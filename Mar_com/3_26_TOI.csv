Now, Komal Sharma , known for her roles in films like Sattapadi Kutram and Nagaraja Cholan MA, MLA, is set to make her Bollywood debut. She’ll be seen in Priyadarshan’s Hungama 2.“We’ve shot some portions of the film already,” she begins, “Priyan sir’s films are thorough entertainers — it’s for everybody in the family to see and enjoy. I play this girl who appears serious throughout the movie, but the situations in which she’s caught are quite funny.”Interestingly, Komal lost out on a big-ticket Kollywood film because her dates were locked for the Bollywood film. “I was in talks to do Maanaadu,” she says and adds, “I also missed Jai’s film with director SA Chandrashekar sir because I was shooting for the Malayalam film Ittymaani: Made in China.”Does she regret missing out on Tamil films? “Well, I would love to do all the films that are offered to me,” she says with a laugh, “For an artiste, there’s nothing called language. It’s all about performance and good scripts. When we first started making movies, there was silent cinema. Indian artistes are doing Hollywood movies. People in Hungama 2 are huge fans of Mohanlal sir. I think artistes are beyond boundaries.”Komal is kicked about her next release, Mohanlal’s Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham , directed by Priyadarshan. “It’s a piece of art,” she states, adding, “I’m lucky to have gotten an opportunity to work with both Priyadarshan sir and Lal sir consecutively. Both are powerhouse of talent. Lal sir, especially is the god of acting. I’m fluent in Tamil, but Malayalam is not my language. When we were shooting for Ittymaani, there’s a sequence in which I have to react to Jimikki Kammal song. I didn’t understand what it was, and Lal sir told me, very humbly, that it was his song and explained the meaning to me so that I could emote properly. He really didn’t have to do it, but this shows he cares for everybody on the set. I also remember once, he stopped shoot and rushed to help an old lady who was struggling to walk with her belongings. He asked everyone on set to help the woman. Not everybody does it.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74813396,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1127493/74813396.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/mohanlal-sir-explained-the-meaning-of-jimikki-kammal-to-me-komal-sharma/articleshow/74813396.cms
1,['26/03/2020'],Will Mangalya Dhosham be the Arundhati of Tamil serials?,"Horror is a genre that’s been explored only minimally on television. Now, a new TV serial, Mangalya Dhosham , promises to explore this genre in a big way. The story is a unique one, where a girl falls prey to the age-old Hindu belief of marrying a tree to save her husband and her unborn child from the clutches of a supernatural force. Arun and Lakshmipriya will be playing the lead roles.Talking about the serial, director Mathan G says, “It is a horror love story. I’d call this the Arundhati of small screen. While the revenge was for a different reason in the film, in our serial, the revenge is for love. The suspense is over who wins in the end — the girl or the aatma.”The director says that a lot of visual effects work has been done in the serial. “We are doing it in an authentic manner. We are putting in a lot of effort to ensure that the serial looks like a film. We have got some of the best VFX companies to work for us and around 50 CG artistes are working on a daily basis to complete it on said deadline. The first couple of episodes have nearly 15 minutes of visual effects. We are trying our best to provide good quality computer graphics,” says the director, adding, “But this also poses as a challenge. Shooting a normal serial is easy, but for this, we are having to shoot multiple times.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74827986,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-787026/74827986.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/tamil/will-mangalya-dosham-be-the-arundhati-of-tamil-serials/articleshow/74813442.cms
2,['26/03/2020'],"Treat your pets like family during lockdown, say experts","Animal lovers bear the brunt

There’s good news, too

Pets don’t spread Coronavirus

No clarity on whether pet shops should be open or not

Ensure to take precautionary measures, say experts

Advisory from Animal Welfare Board of India

Pet parents in Tamil Nadu are in a fix. With misinformation doing the rounds that pet animals can spread COVID-19 , animal lovers are perturbed. Adding fuel to the fire was the report that two dogs had tested positive for Coronavirus in Hong Kong. In India, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in Maharashtra and other civic bodies had put up hoardings asking people to stay away from pets as a precautionary measure. All this led to people abandoning their furry friends. Though health officials have stated that there is no evidence of animal to human transmission of the virus, it seems some people are not in a mood to listen.Humane Animal Society, an animal welfare organisation in Coimbatore, has been flooded with calls asking them to take their pets in the shelter. “We have got a number of calls, but we are trying to educate people that the disease doesn’t spread from animals. This is the time for social distancing from people not animals,” says Mini Vasudevan, founder of the organisation.Michael Abraham of CSK Pet Point, Mylapore, in Chennai, says that he, too, received calls from people asking him to help find a shelter for their pets. “These are people who are going back to their home town from Chennai following the lockdown,” he says.“My owner has asked me to move out of the house,” laments Anusha R (name changed), who recently moved to Delhi from Coimbatore. “The only reason being that I have a dog. I tried to explain to her that dogs cannot spread the virus, but in vain.” R Kannan from Gomathipuram in Madurai, on the other hand, has been missing his morning jog with his dog, Veenu. “It’s tough to keep her inside the house. She looks dull. We both need a break.”However, Reshmi Anil Giri, a resident of Prince Highlands, Iyyappanthangal, says that she is glad her gated community is understanding of pets. “Before moving here, the first thing I checked was whether they allowed pets or not. The residents in the apartment are friendly with pets, but I stopped taking her out, to be on the safer side,” she says.Ask Dr Chinny Krishna, co-founder of Blue Cross of India, about the concerns among pet owners and he says, “Organisations like The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) have sent notifications saying that pets don’t spread Coronavirus.""There is no cross-transmission, says another veterinarian. “Only Section 144 has been imposed. You can take your dog out and go for a walk. Just ensure that you take all the precautionary measures while you do that,” he adds.Dr G Venu Gobal, veterinary surgeon at JSR pet multi-speciality hospital, Coimbatore, says that pet owners need not panic. “All you need to do for the next 10-15 days is to restrict the movement of dogs outside the house. If you step out, you will be at risk of contracting the virus. It’s advisable to avoid food from outside as well and instead, feed them homemade food.”Pet store owner Michael Abraham feels that pet shops should be open during lockdown. “If pet shops are closed, many animals will suffer. My shop is located in Mylapore and I have regular customers, who buy food for stray dogs during their morning walk and feed them. This will completely stop and the dogs would go hungry,” he says.Agreeing with him is another pet store owner in Anna Nagar. “We still have no clarity on whether the shops should be open or not. We have to get clarity from the Pet Shops Association. We have birds and small animals inside the store and we are really worried about them,” he says.When quizzed if there has been an increase in sales after the announcement of lockdown, Michael says, “We received many calls for kitten food. As far as dogs are concerned, you need not worry as you can feed them most of the human food.”Dr Chinny Krishna asks pet lovers to take precautionary measures. “Wash the paws of dogs after you come back home from their walk. Social distancing is applicable to pets as well. Ensure that they do not come in close contact with other animals or people when taken outside.” Mini Vasudevan adds, “This is the time to be there for the animals. All you need to do is practise basic hygiene and not allow them near an unknown person.”A large number of pet shops or animal breeding facility where animals and birds are kept for sale are now shut down due to lockdown/curfew. The animals stranded in such places are likely to suffer and die without food, water and temperature control. All such pet shops are to be evacuated by the State Animal Welfare Boards through SPCAs (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty Against Animals). It is requested to kindly issue necessary directions to all district authorities to check the pet shops in the locality for searching of animals, if any and evacuate them.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/treat-your-pets-like-family-during-lockdown-say-experts/articleshow/74813710.cms

4,['26/03/2020'],"Opinion: No, China can't be sued over coronavirus","This remains the formal position of the Chinese government.

See specifically the much-quoted footnote 20.

At the same time, US courts have been scrupulous about barring plaintiffs from entangling Chinese corporate entities in lawsuits against the government itself. For example, a federal appellate court held in 2011 that a statute allowing lawsuits against foreign officials who engage in torture could not be used to sue a bank allegedly controlled by the Chinese government unless the plaintiff could show that bank officials who arranged his arrest in effect intended his mistreatment by police.

I wish I could join the groundswell of opinion demanding that China be held liable for allowing the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 to get out of control. The drumbeat includes, for example, a class action lawsuit filed in Florida last week and the argument that we should treat the outbreak as we would an act of terrorism, because under US law, a country that sponsors terror can’t claim sovereign immunity.But I cannot. If you want to argue that the government of China has behaved irresponsibly, that the country’s officials deserve the condemnation of the world for letting the novel coronavirus escape when early action could have kept it under reasonable control, you’ll get no argument from me. The Chinese authorities have chosen denial, censorship and bluster rather than the transparency that might have saved lives. The regime’s transmission of patently false information has made matters worse.Legal liability, however, is another matter. The government of China is protected by the doctrine of sovereign immunity, and the regime’s undoubted misconduct does not constitute sufficient grounds for a waiver.Sovereign immunity is not a favor courts do for foreign regimes. It’s an act of reciprocity, a peace treaty resting on a shared understanding that we will not allow our people to sue you if you will not allow your people to sue us. So broad is the traditional doctrine that a British court held in 1894 that even if a foreign ruler moves into one’s country, takes on an assumed name and conceals his true position, and enters into a contract, a lawsuit against him for breach is still barred.Until 1952, the U.S. generally took the position that the immunity of foreign sovereigns was absolute. 1 That year, the State Department took the position that it would more closely scrutinize claims of immunity where the case involved a commercial dispute. That in turn led to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, known as FSIA, passed in 1976, a statute intended (in the words of one federal court) “to protect foreign sovereigns from the burdens of litigation, including the cost and aggravation of discovery.”So broad are the statute’s protections that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that a foreign country need not even file an answer to a complaint — what lawyers call entering an appearance — in order for immunity to apply. 2 For example, when the family of a boy allegedly killed by a malfunctioning hunting rifle sued the manufacturer, a company owned by the Chinese government, the defendant did not bother offering a response in court. Instead, the company just sent the lawsuit documents back to the plaintiff, and the company was held to be immune.Of course, if control of a company turns out to rest in private hands, sovereign immunity offers no defense. U.S. courts have been willing to go as far as tracing the actual ownership of a foreign corporation, to be sure that a government in fact controls the majority of shares. This, too, has been applied to Chinese companies (Chinese businesses get sued a lot). 3 Even before the current outbreak, an increasing number of Chinese companies have been asserting sovereign immunity in U.S. courts. But none of this would have any application to a suit against the Chinese government itself.What about other exceptions in the statute? The Florida class action suit asserts that the exception for commercial activities applies, but it’s not easy to see how. The suit also purports to fall within the exception for death or harm “caused by the tortious act or omission of that foreign state or of any official or employee of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his office or employment.” But that section specifically bars any claim “based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function regardless of whether the discretion be abused.” It’s hard to find a way around this restriction.Yes, China’s behavior has been reckless, but that possibility is baked into the very idea of sovereign immunity. Tort law generally rests on the proposition that people will take reasonable precautions if they know they’ll be liable for the harm they cause. Theorists refer to the process as forcing people to “internalize” the costs of their behavior; that internalization avoids the problem of moral hazard.Under sovereign immunity, however, the costs of misbehavior by a government tend to lie where they fall. That concern led to the adoption a few years ago of the exception for sponsors of international terror. There, at least, a part of the costs of reckless behavior will be internalized. But beyond a handful of small islands of civil liability created by legislation, the punishment for another country’s recklessness is likely to be political.The government of China has essentially bet that it will suffer no punishment, that politics will be its protection. But one wonders whether this will turn out to be true. The world has suffered trillions of dollars in losses from the regime’s recklessness. The economic fallout might well last a long time. Perhaps world leaders will act after all.And even if they don’t, a judge might. Until FSIA went into effect in the late 1970s, the State Department adjudicated sovereign immunity claims on a case-by-case basis. Since then, courts have done so. Recent analysis has suggested that judicial decisions on whether to grant sovereign immunity are often influenced by the politics of the moment than the State Department was.If this analysis is correct, then it’s easy to imagine that no matter what world political leaders may do, a handful of U.S. judges might insist that some special aspect of the pandemic means that the Chinese regime is liable under FSIA after all. I’m skeptical that the judges would be right, but I suspect that a bipartisan coalition of elected officials would cheer them on",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74819120,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-242592,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/opinion-no-china-cant-be-sued-over-coronavirus/articleshow/74819100.cms

7,['26/03/2020'],US asks India to ensure hotels ‘continue to lodge' its citizens during lockdown,"NEW DELHI: After Russia, America has also sought India’s intervention in ensuring that their tourists here do not face problems during the lockdown. They have both sought cooperation from authorities here so those visitors are able to reach airports and take special flights back home. There have been several reports of foreigners being asked to leave hotels.

On Wednesday, the US embassy in India Tweeted: “We are in contact with the Indian government to emphasise the need for hotels to continue to lodge US citizens during the nationwide curfew.” Ken Juster, US Ambassador to India, Tweeted: “The US Mission to India continues to work with State Department and airline companies to arrange flights from India to the US for U.S citizens. Once flights are arranged, we will work with the government of India to arrange to the greatest extent possible safe passage to airports for US citizens.”

A special aircraft flew back Russian tourists home from here on Wednesday. The Goa Airport tweeted: “Despite all odds and skeletal staff on duty at Goa Airport, relief flight to Russia takes off with 121 passengers. Few more in coming days.”

Like Indians stranded abroad, foreign tourists in India are facing a tough time due to flight restrictions that has made returning home for many difficult. The Russian Embassy, for instance, has got distress messages from many its citizens holidaying in India about being evicted from their hotels in places like Kullu and Vrindavan.

“The Embassy of Russia stays in touch with Russian nationals who are presently in India, several thousand in total. We are cooperating with the government of India and local authorities to assist them. Aeroflot has arranged for a special flight from Delhi to Moscow on Wednesday. Many passengers are now on their way and we work closely with our Indian counterparts to ensure their safe return home,” Nikolay Kudashev, Russia’s Ambassador to India, had told TOI on Tuesday.

The Russian embassy estimates several thousand Russian citizens are stranded in India currently. Of them, about 1,000 have informed the embassy of their whereabouts.

“Among Russians who are unable to leave the country, most are in Goa and Rishikesh. There are many in almost every corner of India. The Embassy of Russia updates the advisory on its web-site. Telephone hotlines were launched at the Embassy as well as at every Consulate General of Russian (Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai) to guide people in distress,” Yevgeny Bezeka, press secretary of the Russian embassy, had recently said.

Earlier this month, the Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO), an apex body for Indian tourism industry, had informed the government that many foreign tourists — especially those corona hotspots like Italy, South Korea, Iran and Japan — have been denied check-in by hotels in different parts of the country.

The Mohan sisters, as they are popularly known, along with Neeti’s husband Nihaar Pandya , had gone to Australia on March 6 to support the ICC T20 Women’s Cricket Team. However, they returned home within days after Hollywood star Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, tested positive for coronavirus Down Under.‘WE HAVE RESPONSIBLY QUARANTINED OURSELVES’Mukti says, “Shakti di, Neeti di, my brother-in-law and I had gone to Australia to support the women’s cricket team. We had also planned to visit some other places in Australia after the match, but when we heard that Tom Hanks was in the same city as us and he had tested positive for coronavirus, we returned home immediately. We haven’t met our parents since then. All four of us are in isolation at a farmhouse owned by Nihaar’s family. It has been 13 days since we have responsibly quarantined ourselves,” says Mukti from her isolation den, which is situated in the outskirts of the city.The family had to drive down from Sydney to Brisbane overnight to catch their last-minute flights. Nihaar recalls, “After Tom Hanks and another Indian in Melbourne tested positive, I called up my brother, and he asked us to either stay in Australia till the crisis subsides (which could have taken months) or take the next flight to Mumbai. So, we decided to rush back home and had to travel from Brisbane to Singapore, then Dubai and finally, Mumbai. It was scary to see the airports nearly empty, but the authorities were helpful. When we landed in Mumbai on March 13, we thought that we might be stuck for hours, but it went pretty smooth and after the temperature tests, we were allowed to leave. For the initial three-four days, we stayed in an apartment in Andheri, where Neeti’s parents used to live earlier. Later, we shifted to a remote location on the outskirts of Mumbai and have been living here since.”Neeti adds, “When the BMC authorities got to know our travel history, they started checking on us every two days. Throughout this period, we made sure not to come in touch with anyone, not even our parents! They are anxious, but I guess they are seeking comfort in the fact that we manage to stay in touch through video calls.”‘WE HAD FUN THROUGHOUT’While self-quarantine can be boring, the quartet ensured that they kept themselves entertained. “Since we come from a family of singers, dancers and actors, we were constantly having fun by singing, practising splits and what not,” says Shakti. “The best part is that we kept each other in good spirits.

15,['26/03/2020'],Aanchal Khurana: Sabko pata tha 'Mujhse Shaadi Karoge' mein kisi ki shaadi nahi honi hai,"Ideally, she should have been revelling in her ' Mujhse Shaadi Karoge ' ('MSK') win after Paras Chhabra chose her as his ‘connection’. However, Aanchal Khurana , who joined the reality show on March 9 as a wild-card entrant, was busy doing the rounds of hospitals. After being hospitalised for severe gastritis in Mumbai, the actress, who is currently in her hometown, Delhi, had to make rounds of several hospitals following an attack by stray dogs. In a chat with BT, she talks about her tryst with hospitals, her equation with Paras and her stint on 'MSK'. Excerpts…I didn’t get the time to celebrate because I was doing the rounds of hospitals. I was hospitalised in Mumbai on the very night the shoot wrapped up (March 17) abruptly in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. The next evening, I left for Delhi and on March 19, I went to a hospital for further medication. My pet dog was with me, when suddenly, three stray dogs attacked him. When I tried to save him, they attacked me as well. Thankfully, some people came to my rescue. I immediately went to get an anti-rabies shot, but because of the coronavirus pandemic, it was not available in most hospitals. I had to run from pillar to post to get the shots, but I am better now.I feel that it was a wrong decision to come up with a show like this immediately after 'Bigg Boss', because we saw two strong connections — between Shehnaaz and Sidharth, and Mahira and Paras. The makers just picked one contestant each from the two pairs and made a show on them. I think that didn’t work, because the audience would have liked to see the four of them together and their chemistry. I know Paras ki life mein kya chal raha hai and Shehnaaz is totally into Sidharth. So, it was more of a joke for everyone. Sabko pata tha wahaan kisi ki shaadi nahi honi hai.I also assumed him to be in a relationship with Mahira, but he told me, ‘Mahira is a very good friend’. While he wasn’t too sure of getting married, he was open to an engagement on the show. ‘Kisi se achha connection bann jaata hai toh why not?’ These were his exact words. We needed more time to know each other better. You don’t get married on a lark. After going inside, I told Paras that if not him, I would want to meet someone else, date that person and eventually get married. I don’t want to get into anything frivolous. I went with a clear mind that if I get along with Paras, we will date for six months and get engaged. For me, it was all about making a genuine connection even if it didn’t materialise into anything bigger. I was real, more mature, practical and honest than others. I didn’t suck up to Paras to win the show. Even he acknowledged that I was the only girl who came with the purpose of settling down. The others just faked it with an intention to win the show. However, I don’t see a future with him. I didn’t get enough time with him and also, we friend-zoned each other. We are better off as friends.Even I am shocked, because we spoke on the phone half an hour before he unfollowed me the first time. Maybe, Mahira doesn’t approve of his friendship with me (shrugs). That’s okay. People tend to be possessive of each other when in a relationship. Though he didn’t say it openly, it was quite evident that there was something more than just friendship between him and Mahira. It’s just that they haven’t accepted it yet.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74817200,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-78489/74817200.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/aanchal-khurana-sabko-pata-tha-mujhse-shaadi-karoge-mein-kisi-ki-shaadi-nahi-honi-hai/articleshow/74817200.cms

@iNishaIyer1 Dear Customer, We are not operational due to restrictions imposed by local authorities on the movement… https://t.co/W6T1AehyxK — bigbasket (@bigbasket_com) 1585113611000

NEW DELHI: As India went into a 21-day lockdown from Wednesday, the Centre, states and local administrations scrambled to resolve disruptions in essential services, especially delivery of food, groceries and medicines, with reports streaming in from different parts of the country of police obstructing, and even beating up, distribution executives – prompting e-grocers BigBasket and Grofers and online retail major Flipkart to stop accepting fresh orders.Also, many essential daily products have gone off the shelves primarily because movement of trucks between factories, warehouses and grocery stores have been hit by the lockdown.In a circular to the chief secretaries and DGPs of all states, the home ministry said that while it was imperative to successfully implement the notified lockdown, it was also necessary to ensure unhindered delivery of essential services exempted from various prohibitory orders. All states were asked to set up 24x7 control rooms, state and district-level helplines and appoint nodal officers to ensure seamless supply and availability of essential commodities and services during the lockdown.Across cities, the refrain was that staples were either in short supply or unavailable in shops and not being home delivered by e-retailers. In Gurgaon and Noida, the NCR authorities issued notifications allowing e-comm companies delivering groceries and cooked meals to run operations after being flooded with complaints of cancelled orders and angry residents asking why restrictions had affected the delivery of essential services despite the PM’s assurance of accessibility to them during the lockdown.Noida will now issue passes to riders and vehicles engaged in delivery of essentials. A control room has been set up for complaints, as mandated by the Centre. All grocery, milk and vegetable shops in Noida and Greater Noida will be open from 6am to 11pm. The vegetable wholesale market in Noida will ensure availability of supplies to delivery apps, the DM said. In Gurgaon, the nodal officer on Covid-19 held a meeting with representatives of the grocery and medical shops association, besides representatives of online delivery firms, to ensure uninterrupted supply of essential items.Many essential daily products have gone off the shelves primarily because movement of trucks between factories, warehouses and grocery stores have been hit by curfews declared by some states and UTs. Consumers have complained about being unable to find even common brands of various daily necessities.Industry sources said the disruption in supply chain was mainly due to the overzealousness of a section of the police force, who were allegedly obstructing even stockists of consumer products.Some places are running out of packaged drinking water as well. There are long queues outside supermarkets as consumers scramble to stock up for the next few weeks, resulting in some taking advantage of the situation. A complex in Hyderabad, for instance, has put a Rs 500 upper limit on purchase of vegetables, and Rs 1,000 upper limit for general items. Meat and seafood brand Licious has stopped operations in Delhi.Distributors across the country have stopped operations and are waiting for a few days for things to settle down as there is confusion around labour movements. They, along with retailers, have 15-20 days worth of inventory. Godrej Consumer Products and Nestle India, in separate updates to the stock exchanges, said operations in some locations had been scaled down or suspended.In Mumbai, e-delivery service Supr Daily did not supply milk at several locations on Wednesday. Other delivery options like Big Basket and DMart did not offer any delivery slots to customers. The few shops that opened quickly ran out of staples like bread.Amid uncertainty over how long the shortage would continue, CM Uddhav Thackeray said in a televised speech in the afternoon that the state government had instructed police to facilitate movement of vendors offering doorstep delivery of food items, medicines and all other commodities exempted from the lockdown.The transport department notified that apart from stickers on heavy goods vehicles ferrying essential commodities, transporters would be issued a certificate each that would have to be shown at check posts.The Telengana government was among the first to step in after a flood of complaints about even exempted services like doorstep delivery of essentials being disrupted. ""I am a senior citizen. During the lockdown, home delivery is the need of the hour, especially for people with health ailments. Since Tuesday, I was unable to order essentials for me,"" P Vidyavati, a resident of Kukatpally Housing Board Colony, said in a tweet addressed to municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao.Following an assurance from the authorities that delivery agents and trucks delivering goods would not be stopped by the police, all the major e-commerce companies decided to resume operations on Thursday.In Karnataka , Flipkart resumed delivery of groceries and other essentials in the evening after an assurance from the state government that there would be no impediments. Online grocery BigBasket tweeted, ""We regret the inconvenience caused; we are not operational due to restrictions imposed by local authorities on the movement of goods in spite of clear guidelines provided by central authorities to enable essential services. We are working with the authorities to be back soon."" Punjab police engaged Zomato, Swiggy, Verka and Amul for door-to-door supply of essentials in Amritsar, Ludhiana and Patiala. DGP Dinkar Gupta said that for medicines, the administration would tie up with pharmacy associations so that orders could be taken over phone and delivered at home.Chandigarh's promised ""door-to-door delivery system"" for essentials collapsed on the very first day. There was no milk, vegetable and groceries in most sectors, villages and colonies. Telephone numbers of vendors enlisted by the Chandigarh administration and the municipal corporation were either switched off or went on ringing.Kolkata and other cities and towns of Bengal faced both a shortage of commodities and a spike in prices, although sources said both would stabilise on Thursday. CM Mamata Banerjee asked the police to issue special passes to delivery personnel working for online retailers as well as shops. ""The police will issue these passes to traders, who can then distribute them among their delivery boys,"" she said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74819641,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-336923,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-on-day-of-disruptions-centre-state-govts-seek-to-ensure-stable-supplies/articleshow/74819596.cms

23,['26/03/2020'],Yesteryears star Nimmi no more,"NEW DELHI: Nimmi, who swept to stardom with her debut film, Barsaat, and went to earn acting plaudits in box-office winners such as Aan and Daag, passed away in Mumbai on Wednesday. She was 87.The actor was brought to a suburban Juhu hospital after she complained of breathlessness. She died in the evening, family sources told PTI adding, that the Agra-born heroine of 1950s Hindi films was “unwell” for some time.Among her other recognized films are: Amar, Aandhiyan, Deedar, Sazaa, Mere Mehboob, Akashdeep and Pooja Ke Phool.In an interview for Rajya Sabha tv’s show, Guftagooo, Nimmi said that she was spotted by actor-director Raj Kapoor after she had gone to see the shooting of Mehboob Khan’s Andaz. Kapoor christened her Nimmi; her real name was Nawab Banu . During the shooting of Barsaat, she tied rakhi to Kapoor for a particular scene. He treated her like his sister thereafter.Nimmi’s debut in Barsaat (1949) coincided with that of music director Shankar-Jaikishan, who composed some crackling melodies for the film. The teenager got to lipsync superhits such as Jiya beqarar hai.Her rise was meteoric. A profile published in Stars of the Indian Screen (1952), edited by the legendary Baburao Patel, described her in the following way: “Delicately built and of little height, the most striking features about Nimmi are her beautiful eyes, her fascinating smile and well-shaped arched eyebrows…Nimmi has an indomitable spirit and one has only to see her flashing eyes to recognize the artist in her. Her eyes move fast and quick carrying with them a wealth of expression which is translated into emotion on the screen with lightning rapidity.”Her performance in director Amiya Chakrabarty’s box-office hit, Daag, inspired by Billy Wilder’s The Lost Weekend (1945), earned her high praise. “Dilip Kumar and Nimmi are the stand-outs of the picture. Both act sympathetically with Nimmi displaying the more consummate act,” wrote The Times of India in its 1952 review.Nimmi is also remembered as the spunky girl whose love for Dilip Kumar in Aan goes unrequited. “At one time, I would ask for Rs 3 lakh — equivalent of what any top actor was getting,” she told TOI in an interview in 2006.Many songs lensed on her are Vividh Bharati's timeless favourites: Dil ka diya jala ke gaya (film: Akashdeep) and Tum na jaane kis jahan mein kho gaye (Sazaa), to name just two.“Daughter of a well-known songstress Wahidan Bai, art seems to run in the family, because her mother also used to work in films. So did her aunt Jyoti…her father Janam Abdul Hakim Sahib was a well-to-do military contractor of Rawalpindi and she had a happy childhood,” the write-up in Stars of the Indian Screen (1952) said.Her marriage with film writer S Ali Raza was also a blockbuster success.

25,['26/03/2020'],"World’s conflict zones at greater risk from Covid-19, says think tank","NEW DELHI: The global outbreak of Covid-19 has the potential to wreak havoc in fragile states, trigger widespread unrest and severely test international crisis management systems, says the International Crisis Group (ICG) in a report that points to seven trends that could define a post-Covid-19 world.The report says the economic impact of restricting movement for months on end is likely to be devastating. “Lifting restrictions prematurely could risk new spikes in infections and require a return to isolation measures, further compounding the disease’s economic and political impact and requiring further injections of liquidity and fiscal stimulus by governments around the world,” it says.The think-tank, specialising on international conflict, flagged seven areas of concern, primary among them being that people of conflict-affected countries – whether those in war or suffering its after-effects – are likely to be especially vulnerable to the outbreak of the disease. Libya , Venezuela, Iran and Gaza, could all see spike. Besides difficulties in getting aid workers to the people at the right time, the deep distrust of governments make it impossible to reach services to the affected. “Security obstacles are similarly liable to hamper the Covid-19 response in places where hostilities continue. … The areas of active conflict at highest immediate risk of Covid-19 outbreak may be north-western Syria , around the besieged enclave of Idlib, and Yemen,” says the report.ICG says the disease could “weaken the capacity of international institutions to serve conflict-affected areas. WHO and other international officials fear that restrictions associated with the disease will impede humanitarian supply chains”. For instance, the disease could affect crucial Afghan peace talks, planned as a follow-up to the February agreement between the US and the Taliban.Covid-19 could place great stress on societies and political systems, creating the potential for new outbreaks of violence, ICG observes. The pandemic, for instance, “precipitated a decline in anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong”.“Early signs of social disorder already can be seen. In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian evacuees from Wuhan, China, in response to allegations that some were carrying the disease. Prison-breaks have been reported in Venezuela, Brazil and Italy, with inmates reacting violently to new restrictions …,” The report states adding that governments that have close trading ties with China, especially some in Africa , are feeling the pain of the slowdown emanating from the Wuhan outbreak.The disease could also tempt political elites to exploit the crisis for their own ends — “to solidify power at home or pursue their interests abroad”.Some leaders, ICG observes, may also see Covid-19 as cover to embark on destabilising foreign adventures, whether to deflect domestic discontent or because they sense they will face little pushback amid the global health crisis.“A spate of attacks against US targets by Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq may well be part of a pre-existing effort by Tehran to push the US out of the Middle East.”China, the report says, “after having to cope with the consequences of the initial outbreak, its early and costly decision to hold back information, and its own uneven response, and having sought at times to blame the US by waging an irresponsible misinformation campaign, now sees in the health crisis an opportunity to gain influence over other states through humanitarian gestures”.However, the group sees rays of hope, of rivals coming together during the crisis — UAE sending relief to Iran, for instance.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74819908,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-202565,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/worlds-conflict-zones-at-greater-risk-from-covid-19-says-think-tank/articleshow/74819909.cms

(Contributions by Namrata Singh in Mumbai, Udit Prasanna Mukherji in Kolkata, John Sarkar in New Delhi, Sujit John & Avik Das in Bengaluru)

NEW DELHI: Many essential daily products have gone off the shelves. Truck movements between factories, warehouses and grocery stores had been hit earlier due to the curfews declared by some states and Union territories. Now, consumers say they’re unable to find brands like Dettol , Savlon , Maggi and Aashirvaad atta , to name a few, even as the nation began its 21-day lockdown on Wednesday.Coronavirus outbreak: Live updatesIndustry sources said the uncalled for disruption in supply chain is mainly due to the overzealousness of a section of the police force who were allegedly stopping even the stockists of consumer products and godown staff from carrying out their basic duties.Consumers are running out of packaged drinking water as well. There are long queues outside supermarkets as consumers scramble to stock up for the next few weeks, resulting in some taking advantage of the situation. A complex in Hyderabad, for instance, has put a Rs 500 upper limit for purchase of vegetables, and Rs 1,000 upper limit for general items.Meat and seafood brand Licious has stopped operations in Delhi, even as consumers complained they’ve run out of pet food.Distributors across the country have stopped operations and are waiting for a few days for things to settle down as there is confusion around labour movements. They, along with retailers, have 15-20 days worth of inventory. Companies, even those that have stopped production facilities, will have 20-25 days worth of inventory, senior industry executives said.Godrej Consumer Products and Nestle India, in separate updates to the stock exchanges, said operations in some locations are scaled down or suspended.An FMCG official said, “Supply chains are very complex. Whatever is produced in factories has to reach the markets. To produce essential goods, we need to source different raw materials. If the movement of goods does not happen, how will these products reach consumers?”Sources indicated that ITC’s production of food items like biscuit, packaged atta, noodles and other items like handwash, soaps and sanitisers has been affected nationally. It is learnt that ITC factories in Panchla and Uluberia in West Bengal, mainly for food products, have shut down since Monday evening.An ITC spokesperson said, “We are in constant dialogue with relevant state government authorities to seek permission and clearance for the manufacture of essential products in select factories with bare minimum people. We are also seeking permission from local authorities for the transportation of essential products from the factories, warehouses as well as for distribution of products to the retail outlets.”Emami director Aditya Agarwal told TOI, out of its three edible oil plants in the country, the Rajasthan plant was shut following the curfew.“The West Bengal plant is working, but at 20% capacity. The problem is lack of labour force and transportation. Edible oil is not only needed for cooking but is the raw material for biscuit, cake, breads,” he added.R S Sodhi, MD of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation which makes Amul, said due to higher than usual demand for milk, the firm has been increased supplies to Mumbai by 15-20%, but there is a 20-25% decline in demand for products like ice cream and cheese because restaurants are shut.“There are some disruptions in logistics. For instance, if an empty vehicle is not allowed to reach the godown, how will it go back filled with products? Moreover, to package any product, packaging material is required. This is usually outsourced. But packaging material is not an essential product. Companies usually hold an inventory of 15 days of packaging material,” said Sodhi.For Metro Cash & Carry India, out of 27 stores in the country, 19 are operating with 15-20% staff. Its Mumbai store could not be opened on Wednesday as no one showed up for work. MD & CEO Arvind Mediratta said, “The local district magistrates or police commissioners are not allowing us to open the stores. The police officials are mistreating employees who venture out of their homes to come to the stores. Yesterday, there were quite a few cases of police beating up our employees though they are involved in critical services.” Kirana owners, on the other hand, are unable to visit Metro’s stores, resulting in shortage of dal and edible oils.Bonn Group of Industries has faced many disruptions in transportation of its breads not only across states, but within Punjab itself. “We request the Punjab government to make special points in every city from where consumers or channel partners can pick up breads and other essentials. The state authority should also allow us to have a special vehicle zone in a few areas as well so that the essentials can reach near the consumer’s doorsteps,” said director Amrinder Singh.Companies also blamed hoarding by consumers for goods disappearing faster than usual from retail shelves. “There has been a lot of panic buying in the last two weeks,” said Parle Products category head Mayank Shah “We are trying to supply as much as we can. The problem is talking to local authorities, the district collector or the magistrates to allow us to work, to say biscuit is a food item. One needs permission for the entire supply chain,” said Shah.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74822613,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-11760,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/curfew-pushes-daily-items-off-shelves/articleshow/74818924.cms

Between 2014-15 and 2018-19 financial years, as many as 12.95 lakh building construction and other workers were registered. Of them, 3.39 lakh workers were the beneficiaries of Rs 202 crore from the CCF under various heads.During 2018-19 fiscal, as many as 3.6 lakh building construction and other workers had registered themselves with the welfare board to avail the benefits. A sum of Rs 80.9 crore was disbursed among 2.58 lakh workers after due processing of their applications.“The workers would have to make online registration to seek benefits from the corpus of CCF again,” the official added.Incidentally, the welfare board looks after the health of the building and other construction workers and their safety at the workplaces, besides giving them benefits from the CCF. The welfare schemes include death and maternity benefits, fund distribution for education, cash award, money disbursement for marriage, cycle and instrument purchase plan as well as for medical assistance.Before the announcement of lockdown on Tuesday night, several areas in Patna used to bustle with construction workers waiting to be hired for the day’s work.

32,['26/03/2020'],"Drug, medical device makers slow down output at plants","MUMBAI: Faced with a supply disruption, pharma companies and medical device manufacturers are warning of potential shortages over the next few weeks, with many of their plants either slowing down or shutting due to the nationwide lockdown.Though pharma and medical devices are in the ‘essential list’, there are reports of workers not being allowed to travel to work due to action by local administration at units in Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand and Karnataka. In other regions, like Sikkim, employees are refusing to turn up for work.Chemist and druggist associations across the country have therefore warned of a supply disruption if law enforcement authorities do not stop coercive action against those associated with essential services. This could inconvenience patients with chronic and terminal illnesses, who may not be able to access treatment.Pharma executives that TOI spoke to said on condition of anonymity that supply disruptions are not the only issue. Even the supply of raw materials is patchy, leading to production bottlenecks. Similarly, the distribution of medicines and devices from warehouses to distributors and dealers is also getting hampered. This is despite a communication by the department of pharmaceuticals to chief secretaries on March 23, asking them to ensure disruptions don’t take place.As a result, supply and distribution of essential medicines, and critical devices like masks, sanitisers, gloves, and protective gear are getting hampered, while production is also slowing down due to raw materials and components not reaching factories. “Production has slowed down at units manufacturing devices and, in certain cases, protective gear and masks are not being able to reach diagnostic companies and hospitals,” said Rajiv Nath, forum coordinator of AiMeD, an industry association representing domestic devices companies.The pharma industry has an inventory of two months, but if issues are not ironed out, potential shortages are looming ahead. Factories in Baddi (Himachal Pradesh), Daman and Palghar (Maharashtra) are working at 30-50% capacity, pharma executives said, adding the issuance of passes for those under essential services should be done immediately or digitised.“To facilitate approvals and avoid paperwork, technology should be able to help, and issuance of digital passes is an option which we have recommended,” an official with industry body OPPI told TOI. It is understood that the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) is trying to iron out the issues and has taken the help of the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).To add to their woes, there is also a problem in transporting finished items from factories, with operations of trucking and courier services getting hobbled. Packaging materials required for medicines and ointments like plastics and tubes, which are facing a shutdown, should be allowed to operate, an executive with a Mumbai-based pharma company said.Chennai-based med device company Trivitron Healthcare has flagged issues related to movement of raw materials and components, transportation of finished goods by road and mobility of workers. “Though we are providing transport to our employees, and taking more precautions like checking temperatures, issuing masks and hand sanitisers, there is a huge sense of fear,” said another company executive with units in Gujarat and Maharashtra.

I also watch television and analyse the economic impact of coronavirus at the global and national levels. Besides, I have sufficient time to reconnect with my old friends,” he says.Making the most of the 21-day lockdown, PU English department former head Shaileshwar Sati Prasad is writing his autobiography, which will throw light on the state of higher education in Bihar and the cultural growth of Patna.He says, “I am reading books and interacting with my friends and students on social media.” Patna Science College geology department head Atul Aditya Pandey has started cleaning his book shelves and found several important documents he had been looking for.

MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi has written to chief secretaries of all the states to allow people working with Sebi-registered entities to commute freely during the current nationwide curfew.

Late on Tuesday, Sebi had come out with a notification with a list of entities that would be covered under home ministry’s list of exempted entities during the 21-day lockdown. “Sebi has written to chief secretaries, administrators of all states and union territories, requesting them to facilitate the functioning and movement of personnel of entities notified by Sebi for the smooth operation of the capital markets,” a Sebi spokesperson said.

On Tuesday, after the Prime Minister announced the lockdown for three weeks, the home ministry had issued a notification about the entities and people who would be exempt from the stringent measures by local authorities.

The order said Sebi-registered entities and people would be exempt from the lockdown under the Sebi notification. Subsequently, Sebi issued an order in the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday. The notification included stock exchanges, clearing corporations, depositories, custodians, mutual funds, brokers and other allied service providers and people working for these entities.

However, brokers said their employees from several states faced difficulties to reach their offices or carry out their duties because not all state governments had issued notifications that exempted the entities and people included in the Sebi notification. “Stock market operations are to be in line with the orders of the government of India and state governments and Sebi notifications,” the regulator said.

BENGALURU: MakeMyTrip ’s co-founders — executive chairman Deep Kalra and CEO Rajesh Magow — said that they will be on zero salary from April, while the leadership team will also take a 50% salary cut. The move comes as India’s largest online travel agency braces for a crushing hit to business from lockdowns across the world due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Nasdaq-listed firm said it has started reviewing expenses, even as it continues to “sharply reduce variable costs” like advertising & marketing besides “expenses relating to the functioning of our offices and other establishments” as areas of cost-cuts. MakeMyTrip also indicated that it will have to lay off employees in a bid to reduce fixed costs. “Being an online company, the majority of our costs are variable. However, the situation demands that we take a hard look at all our fixed costs, including people costs,” said Kalra and Magow in a letter to employees. MakeMyTrip had a total of 3,450 employees as of March 2019, according to the company’s filings.

The company said business has come to a “virtual standstill” due to a fall in bookings, increasing cancellations and, finally, the ban on domestic travel as well. The developments follow a record October-December quarter for MakeMyTrip, when its gross bookings jumped 19% to $1.7 billion, while losses also halved to $11 million. But since late February, the company has started seeing a fall in bookings, especially for the busy summer holiday season.

KOCHI: In a dangerous trend observed in the district, several persons continued to violate lockdown on Wednesday as the Rural police arrested 242 persons for the offence. As many as 233 cases were registered and 170 vehicles were seized, police said.

With this, the total number of cases registered in Ernakulam Rural for lockdown violations reached 438. Police said that they are conducting strict monitoring to enforce the lockdown.

Ernakulam Rural SP K Karthick on Wednesday said that strict action is being taken against those who are found to be misusing the relaxations in the lockdown. He said that that even as there were no restrictions on procurement of essential commodities like groceries, people who travel long distances for purchasing such commodities are violating the lockdown and they will have to face the consequences.

“You cannot be 10km away from your home and then say that you were out to buy milk. I travelled to almost all towns in the district on Tuesday and I’m sure that there is no shortage of any essential commodities. So, buy your groceries from the nearest retailer. Don’t go for a round in the city on the pretext of buying groceries,” said Karthick.

He said police are getting all sorts of responses from those who are on the streets. “We urge the residents to understand the reason for the restrictions and to cooperate. Going to a friend’s house or to a relative’s house just like that is not a sufficient reason to be on the road. We will have to resort to FIR registration and seizure of vehicles if such actions are spotted,” said the officer.

Varapuzha police seized around 20 vehicles for violating lockdown. In Chembarakki, there was a scuffle between two youths and policemen on patrol after the latter stopped the youths. The duo was arrested and removed from the spot.

At Wednesday’s close, RIL had a market capitalisation of Rs 6.9 lakh crore, compared to TCS’s Rs 6.6 lakh crore, BSE data showed.

The day’s rally in RIL was on the back of a news report that global social media giant Facebook planned to take a large minority stake in its telecom operation, Jio. However, due to the recent crash in stock prices and the weakness of the rupee due to the coronavirus pandemic, both the companies are now below the psychologically important $100-billion m-cap mark. In intraday trades, RIL had rallied more than 20% and, under Sebi’s new risk-mitigation rule, there was a trading halt in the stock at about 1.53pm.

BETTIAH: Barely had the Prime Minister finished his ‘Lockdown’ address to the nation on Tuesday night, people crossed the ‘Lakshman Rekha’ of their homes. Many here swamped their neighbourhood grocery shops and subzi outlets in a spree of panic buying. Social distancing that the PM had just so emphatically appealed for was sent into quarantine till the midnight hour, the time anointed for the nationwide lockdown to begin.

In a scramble to stock up essential food items, how many got infected by the coronavirus is a question that will keep hanging for some time. “As of now, the district has Zero live cases,” West Champaran DM Kundan Kumar said on Wednesday. “We have established a district control room with a dedicated number, in addition to 104, along with ten hunting lines,” he said. “ Altogether 252 people have come home here from abroad. We are collating the numbers of people who have come from other states,” the DM said.

A large number of migrant workers have returned in jam-packed trains and buses till both rail and road transport was closed following the ban on air traffic. “Ten such people were checked...all were found negative,” he said.

The DM, along with Bettiah SP Natasha Gudiya, held a meeting with representatives of different trading bodies amid anecdotal reports of black-marketeering and hoarding. The traders promised to cooperate but expressed their worries on the breaking of supply lines due to the lockdown.

A day after adjoining Nepal sealed its borders, the district administration had sealed its borders with Gopalganj and East Champaran districts in Bihar and further with Kushinagar district of UP. “The trader bodies have complained that trucks bringing in supply of essentials are stranded on the Kushinagar border. We have just got in touch with the authorities there to reopen the route for such trucks,” Kumar said.

In response to reports of soaring prices, especially of vegetables and groceries, he appealed to the trading bodies to give daily updates on retail prices.

Meanwhile, citizens are reporting a steep escalation in the prices of vegetables and even pulses and vegetable oil. Stray anecdotal reports from villages complain of PDS dealers selling forms at Rs10 to ration card holders after the state government’s announcement promising free ration to the poor families.

“There is no form to fill,” the DM said, directing the marketing officer to ensure that the BPL card holders are not cheated. “The families concerned will receive their rations for April free of cost,” he said.

As the lockdown could only be enforced with heavy police bundobust, four vehicles were seized for breaking the rules. “Their registrations and driving licences are being cancelled,” the DM said.

But, no vehicles are coming for the past five days, thus we are very short of supply,” said Ramesh Khunteta, who owns a retail grocery store at Jhotwara locality. Majority of the shops do not have items like wheat flour, refined oil, desi ghee, pulses and even spices.

Even the Jaipur transport operators’ association complained that police are stopping grocery and other essential goods-laden trucks coming into Rajasthan. “Some of our trucks were coming from Uttar Pradesh and were stopped by the Bharatpur police. I spoke to the superintendent of police, Bharatpur to ensure arrival of these trucks in Jaipur,” said Gopal Singh Rathore, president of Jaipur transport operators’ association.

When contacted, Anand Srivastav, commissioner of police, said, “We had a meeting with the various food chains having online stores of grocery and other wholesalers. We have assured that that their vehicles would be allowed and urged them to ensure proper and timely supply of goods in the city.”

CM Ashok Gehlot, while appealing for lockdown, has categorically asked the officers to ensure uninterrupted supply of groceries. District collectors and district superintendent of police have been asked to ensure the smooth moving of transport vehicles sending grocery items to various districts.

Many grocery stores also apprehended that in this time of crisis, many wholesalers, in order to hike prices of various commodities, are doing it purposely. “In a day or two, they will increase the prices and we will have to take it as we have our regular customers asking for things. I think it is a very crucial period and manufacturers and wholesalers should understand the plight of people and cooperate,” said Vishnu Goyal, a retailer at Bapu Nagar.

MUMBAI: As a result of the current air travel shutdown, Tata Sons may be strategically compelled to operate just one rather than two airlines — AirAsia India and Vistara , and Air India ’s privatisation is unlikely to proceed in FY21.

IndiGo and SpiceJet , the two listed carriers alone could report combined losses of $1.25-1.5 billion across FY20 and Q1 of FY21, according to the indicative numbers released by Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA), a global aviation consultancy firm on Wednesday.

“Given the expected decline in traffic, both Delhi and Mumbai airports are expected to consolidate their operations in a single terminal in the near-term, as and when service resumes,” the CAPA report said, adding that post-Covid-19, a substantially different aviation sector would emerge.

The impact of the shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic will be so severe that even the stronger carriers may not be immune and smaller carriers may exit, said CAPA, adding that IndiGo’s “hitherto enviable free cash reserves may almost be wiped out”. The report said there was a strong likelihood of aircraft orders being deferred or even cancelled.

With regards to Air India, the government must prepare a backup plan, which will require it to make a renewed commitment to operating the national carrier, and to brace the exchequer for long-term capital infusions, it said. “In the short-term alone, Air India could conservatively require financial assistance of over $1.5 billion to survive,” the report said.

“India’s aviation sector could incur losses of $3.3-3.6 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Out of this, approximately $1.8 billion would be airline industry’s losses and $1.5-1.8 billion airports’/concessionaires’ losses. These are preliminary estimates for the potential sectoral losses in Q1FY21, assuming all domestic and international operations remain grounded until June 30, 2020. Even with some partial resumption of services in May and June, the financial outcomes may not change significantly,” said CAPA.

Currently, all domestic flights in the India are grounded till April 14.

“Although the duration of the lockdown is as yet known, if the first quarter is subject to continued and extensive disruption, with a rolling impact on the remainder of the year, it is possible that both domestic and international traffic could decline by 30-50% year-on-year in FY21,’’ said CAPA, but not without clarifying that the said numbers are “very much an indicative figure only, in what is a highly uncertain and fast-moving environment and should not be considered a projection”.

“The already-weak Indian airline sector is not equipped to deal with a shock of the magnitude of Covid-19. Most Indian airlines have not structured their business models to be able to withstand even regular shocks, such as elevated fuel prices or economic downturns, let alone once-in-a-century events,’’ said the report.

“The extension of the domestic lockdown until at least mid April is the right decision by the government. However, it has ensured that aviation will be seriously impacted by Covid-19. The April-June quarter, traditionally one of the stronger quarters of the year for Indian carriers, is increasingly looking like it will be a washout,’’ said the report. “This will have consequent implications for Q2 (usually the weakest quarter) and for the rest of FY21. The severity of the impact could possibly lead to a structural reset of the airline sector in India, with a strategic shift in terms of traffic growth, fleet expansion, pricing, costs and business models. Although it is too early to come to a firm conclusion, what emerges on the other side may be a smaller, consolidated industry,” it added.

After Covid-19, the movement of passengers and cargo by air will be critical for the economy to repair itself. “In recognition of the strategic role that aviation will play in national recovery, it is essential that the government’s response supports the revival and not simply the survival of aviation. However, if the government is able to provide swift and meaningful assistance, it will also be incumbent upon the promoters of private carriers to play their part and collaborate by bringing in additional funds,” the report said.

CAPA recommended cash infusion to support part-payment of salaries up to a certain grade for 3-6 months, so that redundancies can be averted, as is currently being discussed with the government. “Moratorium on outstanding payments for a period of 3-6 months for airport charges at all airports, ATF, GST and other tax payments. Rescheduling interest and principal payments on working capital loans for 3-6 months,” it said. Among the other suggestions were to bring ATF under GST framework, which will provide for full input tax credit. In the interim, until ATF is brought under GST, sales tax should be reduced to 4%, CAPA said. 

“Provide a waiver on airport charges as and when services resume, for a period of 3-6 months. Ensure that appropriate credit lines are available from banks on attractive terms to support the revival of the sector,’’ it said. “Depending upon the severity of the impact, the possibility of a direct cash injection by the government in the form of grants. This would be the first such instance of public funds being infused into private Indian carriers, but may be required in the event of an extended shutdown,” the report said.

54,['26/03/2020'],Back-office realty with MNC tenants to be least hit by virus,"(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Commercial real estate catering to back-office operations for multinationals is expected to be the least affected by the current economic crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. This is because the tenants are financially strong multinationals, spending only a fraction of their expenses on rent even as they gain by the weakening rupee.

TOI had reported how the residential and retail real estate was badly hit with many on the verge of default. According to Kunal Moktan, co-founder of real estate investment platform Property Share Capital, the first impact has been on the hotel industry, which has been reeling under travel restrictions. “This is reflected in hospitality stocks. Retail malls are also hit all across the world. Retail REITs worldwide are down 40-50% and we expect there to be renegotiations on rent. Warehousing business has also been impacted because of the slowdown,” said Moktan.

“Back-office properties would be the least affected. In dollar terms, there has not been an increase in the rent from 2007. If there is a lockdown of offices like in Italy, some tenants might probably ask for relief on rent, which will not have an impact on a long-term agreement,” said Moktan.

Moktan, a former Blackstone executive, partnered his colleague Hashim Khan to set up Property Share, which buys commercial real estate and enables individual investors to pick up fractional shares in each property. The company, which is registered as a portfolio manager with Sebi, targets a rental yield of 8-9% on a property and a capital gain on the same when it is sold. It has purchased around Rs 330 crore of real estate assets. The properties are purchased by creating special purpose vehicles (registered companies) for owning each asset and investors can sell the property.

According to Moktan, now is the best time for alternate investors to buy prime properties as landlords who have borrowed against rent are under stress. “If you look at Blackstone, most of the prime real estate assets were acquired after the froth went out of the markets,” he said. “Out of our Rs 330-crore portfolio, only one property in Capital building in BKC — purchased for Rs 30 crore — is front-office space. This has been leased to SBM Bank for three years,” said Moktan.

But these policies will not be triggered as most of them come into force only if there is property damage ,” said Srivastava. GIC Re provides reinsurance cover to Indian and multinational companies who want to pass on some of their risks to a large organisation.The airline industry, despite major losses, is also not protected by an insurance cover. “For airlines, this is like the Icelandic volcano eruption in 2010 when most flights from Europe and America were grounded, yet no insurance claims were payable,” he said. Most insurance companies may have to refund some of the premium they collected.Globally too, corporates are unlikely to claim under their insurance policies for coronavirus-related losses, except in the case of event insurance. “The biggest event globally is the Tokyo Olympics where fortunately we have zero exposure,” said Srivastava.GIC does have a large exposure to the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) telecasts. “The event has been called off by BCCI. But if it is rescheduled, the exposure will be taken care of,” said Srivastava. “Our maximum exposure to other events is Rs 35-50 crore in film insurance. The claims will happen in the worst-case situation,” he said.While GIC does have exposure to domestic insurers’ books, which includes mediclaim , this is largely on account of obligatory cessions, under which insurers pass on 5% of their risks and premium to the national reinsurer.The crisis has led to an increase in the number of people buying health insurance.

59,['26/03/2020'],"Delhi, Hyderabad airports to face downgrade","(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Rating agency Moody’s has said that it is likely to downgrade Hyderabad and Delhi airports. The ban on commercial flights during the 21-day lockdown and uncertainty over future growth amid the coronavirus pandemic is expected to reduce air traffic, the aviation industry is expected to shrink 20-25% in FY21, according to Care Ratings .

Both Delhi International Airport (DIAL) which operates the Indira Gandhi International Airport, and GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited (HIAL), which operates the Rajiv Gandhi Hyderabad International Airport (RGIA) repay loans from both aeronautical revenue and non-aeronautical income sources, which are linked to the airport’s passenger traffic volumes and aircraft movements.

As such, the expected traffic decline will lead to a sharp reduction in the airport’s revenue and cash flow over the course of FY21, Moody’s said.

According to Spencer Ng, a Moody’s VP and senior analyst, the sudden drop in flights and the uncertainty over the timing and extent of recovery, have coincided with increased debt issuance even as the airports enter their peak stage of the expansion project. While the current environment is unpredictable, Moody’s expects a recovery in airport traffic to commence in the second half of the year. Nevertheless, Moody’s expects that the airport’s traffic levels for the next two to three years will be lower as a result of the coronavirus.

“Domestic scheduled airlines too have started facing severe cash flow pressures, considering airlines will not be functional at all till 14th April 2020 and this is also leading to trimming of employee salaries aside of the other issues being faced by the industry. Even post the nationwide lockdown, fares of airline operators is to be very low considering the lack of air travel demand which will also lead to scaling down of certain routes,” Care Ratings said in a report.

“Passenger growth of airlines is to fall sharply and register a negative 20%-25% growth for FY21. Passenger growth has been 13.7% during FY19 and 3.7% during FY20 (April-February),” the report said.

64,['26/03/2020'],How Indian IT is keeping lights on for global businesses,"Shilpa Phadnis | TNNBengaluru: TCS is said to be shipping nearly 6,000 laptops to employees every day to enable them to work from home (WFH). The numbers are up from 1,000 a day about 10 days ago. The company, which has some 4.5 lakh employees, has now enabled work from home for 85% of staff in India.The scale of transitioning work from office to home is staggering for Indian IT. A lot of it is work that cannot stop. There’s also lots of work that simply cannot be moved to employee homes, either because of security concerns, or because the workloads are too heavy to be dependent on uncertain residential broadband connections. Indian IT supports mission-critical systems that run banks , healthcare, insurance, utilities and stock exchanges.Keshav Murugesh, group CEO of outsourcing solutions provider WNS, says services delivered to regulated entities, such as banks and financial institutions, have extremely sensitive data that clients are wary of being accessed from employees’ homes given the security, privacy and regulatory obligations. “Additionally, the performance of a home-based internet connection is not as good as a corporate-provisioned network in terms of latency, which restricts certain processes that are bandwidth-intensive and/or require a high quality of service to be delivered from homes,” he says.Banks and financial institutions constitute 30-40% of many leading IT service providers’ revenue.A top executive of one of the leading Indian IT companies, which did not want to be named, notes that large Indian and global corporations have entrusted their critical applications, networks, and infrastructure to Indian IT. “As part of our contractual obligations, we are expected to provide these services out of some approved facilities (these typically have access to client networks). If we are moving things outside the approved facility, there are implications for secure connections. Without approval, it’s a breach of contract,” he says. His company is looking at ways they can connect to the client systems and networks remotely without any security compromise. Wi-Fi networks, he says, are good for downloading information, but the services they offer require uploading information. “We are putting together a monitoring mechanism to look at bandwidth, the response time latency, to ensure it’s not a pain to work from home,” he says.Jimit Arora, who leads US-based advisory Everest Group’s IT services research practice, says even if devices (PCs) were available, users need dedicated, high-speed bandwidth, VPN access, multi-factor authentication. These, he says, will not be available to all delivery resources. But the biggest challenge in WFH, he says, is contractual clauses. “This ( coronavirus crisis) represents a typical force majeure event, given that there is now mandated work from home requirements. Clients and suppliers need to prepare for missed service level agreements,” he says.Everest says data centre support, production support (the highest levels of L2 and L3 support for IT systems and applications), network operations centre, and security operations centre are activities where clients are unwilling to permit any WFH. Then there are areas where clients are reluctantly allowing WFH, including areas like business & accounting processes, procurement processes, application development and L1 production support.A CXO of an IT firm, who did not want to be named, says that for every customer, they have mapped 6-7 scenarios for business continuity and are reaching out to them to seek permission for what they found reasonable. “Every action that we are taking now is a compromise on the contractual obligation. But we are beefing up our security processes and monitoring mechanisms,” he says.Everest’s Arora notes Accenture’s position that 60% of its work can be delivered remotely; beyond that, office presence is needed because clients have specific security and data privacy needs. Wipro said in a statement it’s working towards enabling all employees to work from home barring skeletal essential staff who may be required to be present in the offices. “In cases, where employees do not have the necessary infrastructure, we have procured additional laptops/desktops with essential infrastructure and connectivity to enable them to work from home in the current situation,” it said.Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based HfS Research, says keeping enterprise clients’ critical support services functioning is becoming the biggest challenge ever faced by India’s IT industry as it tackles this health crisis. “They have to operate on an immediate short-term footing to keep the lights on for enterprise clients, with a medium-term focus on surviving the next few weeks with the right emergency provisions in place to keep staff healthy and a financial fall-back to keep the wheels on the track as we go through these very painful motions,” he says.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74819117,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-78832,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/how-indian-it-is-keeping-lights-on-for-global-businesses/articleshow/74819119.cms

Even priests avoided mass gatherings and did not step out of their houses.“I did not go to anyone’s house or temple to perform the Navaratra rituals. I have decided to follow the government’s instructions and stay at home,” city-based priest Gyan Prakash told this newspaper.Meanwhile, many devotees had a tough time making arrangements for the ‘puja’. Ranjan Sinha, a resident of Saguna Mor, rued, “Chaitra Navaratra is an auspicious festival and I look forward to celebrating it with religious fervour every year. This time, however, it is going to be a low-key affair because of the lockdown.”Another resident, Shyama Gupta , said, “Last night, I went out to buy ‘puja’ items, but did not get most of them.”Others did last-minute preparations for ‘kalash sthapana’ and fast. “Despite the lockdown, I purchased milk, dry fruits, fruits and other items for my mother, who observes fast during Chaitra Navaratra,” claimed Aditya Rai, a resident of Boring Road.Even temples wore a deserted look on the first day of Chaitra Navaratra. The Mahavir Temple near the Patna Junction, where hundreds of devotees offer prayers, did not witness mass gatherings. “The doors have been locked and devotees are not allowed to enter the temple.

In the video clip, the teachers and the two students of the school could be seen telling people how hand sanitizers can be made at home.The hand sanitizer has been made with camphor (mixed with any form of gel or glycerol ), vitamin E capsule, aloe vera gel and few drops of essential oil.Shashank said the homogenous solution was prepared by mixing all the ingredients and people can add some fragrances like rose petal water to avoid the pungent smell of the mixture. “All these ingredients are easily available at home. Essential oils combat various ailments and infections. They also have anti-bacterial or anti-fungal qualities.

PATNA: There are certain cases of police high-handedness reported from some parts of the state to enforce complete lockdown .

The plea of Dilip Kumar Mishra of Bajidpur in Vaishali district to the police to allow him to go to Tajpur in neighbouring Samastipur district for medicines for his ailing father Prabhakar Mishra fell on deaf ears. Though Mishra (34) showed the doctor’s prescription, a police constable, who had intercepted his motorbike on the deserted Mahua-Tajpur road, turned down his request and said, “Hume kisi bhi halat mein lockdown enforce karne ka aadesh mila hai (I have been assigned the task to enforce the lockdown at any cost).” A shocked Mishra returned home.

Mishra’s is not an isolated case. Cops in Sitamarhi caned a few youths after they were to sit in on the road for moving near Dumra. “I was thrashed by the policemen while returning home with some essential goods from a nearby grocery shop on my motorbike,” said one of the victims, Santosh Kumar.

Santosh’s friend Golden Kumar was penalized for not carrying the documents of his motorbike and had to pay a fine of Rs500. “People are being harassed by the policemen in the name of complete lockdown. It’s true some people are violating the restrictions, but all are not defaulters,” Golden, who worked at a private hospital in Sitamarhi, said.

In fact, senior police officers had given a dressing-down to cops manning police stations after CM Nitish Kumar received complaints of laxity in enforcing the lockdown on Monday. As a result, the SPs and DSPs were spotted moving on the roads and trying to convince people to remain indoors during the lockdown.

In Gopalganj, SP Manoj Kumar Tiwari stepped out of his office to ensure that his subordinates in the district, close to Uttar Pradesh border, were enforcing the lockdown completely.

On Tuesday, a close relative of a coronavirus suspect was penalized by the cops of Dehri Town police station in Rohtas district . “Police are minting money under the garb of invoking lockdown,” the victim’s brother, Shailendra, said.

Additional director general (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said instructions had been issued to the SPs and the officers in field to enforce lockdown, but it didn’t mean that people should be harassed. “Those found to be roaming aimlessly on roads are supposed to face legal action. One should have valid reason for stepping out of home during lockdown,” he said.

According to a report issued by the police headquarters, 41 FIRs were registered and Rs15,87,800 was realized as fine from those violating the provisions of lockdown across the state on Wednesday. Besides, nine people were arrested and 531 vehicles were seized, the report says.

69,['26/03/2020'],Bihar legislative council polls likely to be delayed,"Representational image

PATNA: The 21-day countrywide lockdown is likely to delay the biennial election to fill 17 seats in Bihar legislative council. These seats will fall vacant on May 6.

As the Election Commission has already postponed the ongoing Rajya Sabha elections in many states and the lockdown will continue till April 14, political observers feel there is little chance that the commission will announce the schedule for holding the council polls in near future.

“As 17 seats will fall vacant on May 6, the commission is expected to complete the entire election process latest by April 30. For this, it is expected to announce the schedule by March 31. Since there is lockdown across the nation, there is little chance that the commission will come out with a schedule for that,” said an assembly official associated with the poll process. He said the commission might announce dates after normalcy returns.

Altogether 27 seats in the 75-member Bihar council are going to fall vacant in May. Of total 27, 17 seats will be filled up through election, while the rest 12 are to be nominated by the governor.

Of the 17, members for nine seats will be elected from Vidhan Sabha constituency and four from the graduate constituencies while another four will be elected from teachers’ constituencies.

The four graduates’ constituencies where biennial polls will be due in April are Patna , Tirhut, Darbhanga and Kosi. These seats will fall vacant after the retirement of Neeraj Kumar and Dilip Kumar Choudhary (JD-U), Devesh Chandra Thakur (Independent), and N K Yadav ( BJP ) on May 6.

Similarly, four teachers’ constituencies are Patna, Tirhut, Darbhanga and Saran. These seats will fall vacant after retirement of Nawal Kishor Yadav (BJP), Sanjay Kumar Singh (CPI), Madan Mohan Jha (Congress) and Kedar Nath Pandey (CPI) on May 6.

Besides these, other nine sitting members who were elected from Vidhan Sabha constituency and retiring on May 6 are council’s acting chairperson Haroon Rashid, Ashok Kumar Choudhary, Prashant Kumar Shahi, Satish Kumar, Sonelal Mehta, Hira Prasad Bind (JD-U), Krishna Kumar Singh, Sanjay Prakash and Radha Mohan Sharma (BJP).

70,['26/03/2020'],Blood banks face shortage as shutdown hinders donation in Kolkata,"KOLKATA: Blood banks across the city are facing a big challenge with no blood donation camps being organised in times of social isolation. That, in turn, has created serious crisis for patients who require regular transfusion.With shortage of supply looming large, the state health department on Monday came up with a circular, asking all stakeholders to carry on with voluntary blood donation camps, and issued a safety guideline to be followed in context of the Covd-19 crisis. However, the situation is yet to improve.According to the guideline, a maximum of 30 donors are to be allowed to donate blood at a particular camp. A maximum of five donors are to be allowed at a time. Volunteers are supposed to ensure social distancing is maintained at the camp. There is a temporary deferral of donor who has had travel history in the past 28 days. No blood can be taken from donors with symptoms of influenza.Officials at the Central Blood Bank Maniktala said that the shortage is yet to hit the apex blood bank in the state. “We, however, have started rationalizing the supply of blood units as collection at blood banks is depleting,” said a source.Malay Ghosh, director of the blood bank at RG Kar Medical College & Hospital said, “We have already spent two weeks without any collection. After one week, I do not know what to do. No organisations have got in touch with us for organizing camps even after the circular was issued. They are also helpless. I shall try my best to overcome this crisis but I do not know how much can be done.”Bratish Neogi, managing partner of Peoples Blood Bank, called the situation “grave”. “Our stock of blood has more or less dried up. We are entirely depending on replacement or exchange donation. All hospitals have been requested to postpone planned surgeries. But regular blood transfusion is required for the patients who need dialysis or are suffering from cancer, chronic kidney disease, thalassemia and haemophilia,” he said.It is a critical similar situation at the blood bank of the Kothari Medical Centre. According to its coordinator Sanjoy Mondal, the supply has trickled down to the nadir. “We used to have a stock of 1000-1500 units of blood. There are no camps happening now. If a person requires blood of a certain group, he has to get a donor to donate blood from the same group,” Mondal said.To manage the situation, volunteers of city-based NGO Project Life Force that is associated with blood donation events for eight years have become active. “Not just cancer and dialysis, blood is required even for childbirth surgeries. That’s why our volunteers have agreed to provide pickup and drop facilities to those keen on donation. Alternatively, people can also make a list of donors and invite us to their apartment. We will send our mobile blood donation bus there,” said Ajay Mittal, the director of Project Life Force.Lakshmi Parakh, who donates platelets regularly, is one such volunteer who is mobilizing people to come in aid of the patients at Tata Medical Centre. “Majority of the outstation patients do not know locals who can donate. They need to rely on social organisations like ours. I have got my colleagues to donate blood and platelets there. Besides, our air-conditioned bus, which is a fully-equipped vanity van with four couches for donors, was sent to the Saroj Gupta Cancer Centre & Research Institute (SGCCRI) at Thakurpukur on Friday,” Parakh said.Among the 44 donors at SGCCRI, 20 were doctors. Among them was SGCCRI’s director Dr Arnab Gupta, who said, “The situation is bad. We need to have a full backup for our patients. Healthy staff and patients’ relatives were requested to donate blood on Friday.”According to Swapan Adak, the supervisor of SGCCRI’s blood bank, “Currently, we have 166 patients. Our monthly requirement is approximately 600-700 units. Now, we just have less than 100 units of blood. We are worried about what will happen during the lockdown situation since we have no supply of A+ blood group.”",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74820463,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-250596,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/blood-banks-face-shortage-as-shutdown-hinders-donation/articleshow/74819402.cms

We took the effort considering the safety of the British national as well as that of other patients admitted here. We can’t provide bathrooms with facilities similar to those in top private hospitals. But clinical care we provide is on par with developed countries. We are giving separate room for each patient in isolation. Four teams of doctors, all specialists, take care of those in isolation wards,” said National Health Mission district manager Dr Mathews Numbeli, who is one of the doctors leading the operations of corona care in the district.While the food for all the patients and hospital staff comes from District Jail, Kakkanad, the food for the foreigners admitted here are being made by MBBS students themselves.

The measures include making a containment zone of 3 km in Bhadadri and 1 km in Rangareddy.As part of Centre’s 'Containment Plan for novel coronavirus disease Covid-19', buffer zones have been earmarked for both the locations. “Both cases are contacts and do not have any history of international travel in the past 14 days.

Containment zone for Bhadradri district is 3 km and buffer zone is 7 km. For GHMC, Rangareddy district’s containment zone is 1 km and buffer zone is 3 km,” read a state government bulletin.The plan, drawn in February by the central ministry of health and family welfare, is meant for cluster containment in order to stop transmission, morbidity and mortality due to Covid-19. “The containment and buffer zones will be mapped to identify the health facilities (both government and private) and health workforce available (primary healthcare workers, Anganwadi workers and doctors in PHCs/CHCs/District hospitals). All ILI/SARI (influenza like illnesses/severe acute respiratory infection) cases reported in the last 14 days by the IDSP in the containment zone will be tracked and reviewed to identify any missed case of Covid-19 in the community,” the document says.The strategy is to contain the disease within a defined geographic area by early detection and breaking the chain of transmission.The plan includes geographic quarantine, social distancing measures, enhanced active surveillance, testing suspected cases, isolation of cases and home quarantine of contacts. “Interventions to limit morbidity, mortality and social disruption associated with SARS in 2003 demonstrated that it was possible then to mobilize complex public health operation.

MADURAI: The civic authorities in Madurai have started marking spaces in front of shops to ensure that people maintained a safe distance to ward off the novel coronavirus while waiting to make purchases. Though the government had called for a total lockdown to ensure that the infection does not spread, it was chaotic in public places. Hence the civic authorities resorted to drawing lines, squares and circles with bleaching powder. ``It is to ensure that the people maintain a one metre distance while standing in front of shops,’’ said corporation sources.

The distancing signs were drawn by the corporation personnel in wards 24, 25,26,27 and 49 ward number 88 in SS Colony, 20 and 22 in Pandian Nagar and ward number 19 in Chokkalinga Nagar on Wednesday. Circles were also drawn within the Amma canteen.

Shopkeepers were also seen taking social distancing seriously. A shop in Kamarajar Salai downed its shutters and asked the people to come after 4 pm as the workers drew distancing circles in front of it with paint.

At Balaji Store, a small shop in Gomathypuram, the customers were asked to submit their list of needs and wait at a distance while the shopkeeper gathered the supplies. Grocery stores also refused to supply items if the people did not follow the rules.

In Tirunelveli city , the corporation and district administration drew marking circles with white powder at least one metre apart. The circles were drawn at all the 10 Amma canteens in the corporation limit, from the space where people queue up to the counters for payments and collection of food as well as at the space allotted for having food.

Tirunelveli assistant collector M Sivaguru Prabakaran said a batchmate had shared such an initiative in their social media group. “We did not know the location but the initiative was good and we implemented it,” he said. The temporary circles were also drawn at the Uzhavar Sandhai, fish and meat stalls, shops where people thronged in more numbers and pharmacies as well.

“Considering the need for such measures for a longer period we started permanently painting the spaces with blue the same morning,” the assistant collector said.

Reason: Acute shortage of testing kits.Since January last week, 77,045 people had arrived at the RGI Airport from various foreign destinations. After thermal screening, 17,283 passengers were identified with some symptoms such as cough, cold and fever. When it came to sample collection, only 764 passengers were tested and of them, 699 were negative for Covid-19. Till March 24 night, 39 people tested positive for coronavirus. In the last two weeks, those who came from abroad were told to be in 14-day mandatory home quarantine and stamped accordingly.“The state government is not procuring kits from manufacturers directly. The kits are being supplied by the Centre through Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV). Though the number of positive cases are less, tests have to be conducted on suspect cases,” a senior health department official said.Apart from shortage of kits, cost of the test was also a major concern as each test kit costs anything between Rs 4,000 and Rs 5,000, sources said.

Even if the government wants to conduct more tests, more laboratories have not become operational. Though the Centre gave the nod for Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), the CSIR laboratory has not started conducting actual tests. “In a day or two, coronavirus testing will begin at NIMS and IPM. CCMB is also in the process of starting tests,” director of medical education (DME) Ramesh Reddy told TOI on Wednesday.Officials said tests were being done on people who had direct contact with positive cases (family members, friends and colleagues) and surrounding areas. In Karimnagar and other places, such a strategy was adopted, another health department official said.Meanwhile, private hospital and laboratories have expressed their readiness to treat patients and conduct Covid-19 tests. The Centre has reportedly permitted three hospitals and diagnostic laboratories to conduct tests. However, there has been no official communication regarding it to the state government so far.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74822030,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-357103,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-fight-caught-in-red-tape-and-kit-shortage-in-t/articleshow/74818825.cms

93,['26/03/2020'],"With lockdown, pollution levels dip in Kochi","From the days the lockdown began, the pollution levels fell by as many as 30 points for nitrogen oxide.

KOCHI: With vehicular traffic almost coming to a standstill, the pollution levels in the city, especially nitrogen oxide levels, recorded a drastic fall on Wednesday, as per Kerala state pollution control board (KSPCB) data.

“We have noticed a drastic fall in the vehicular pollution levels and respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) in all our stations, mainly at Vyttila and MG Road which often record the highest levels because of the huge traffic movement,” said KSPCB chief environmental engineer M A Baiju.

According to Vyttila air monitoring station data, the pollution levels crossed 100 microns for nitrogen oxide (NOX) –– a parameter that indicates high emissions from vehicles –– in the first couple of weeks in March. The dust pollution levels indicated by PM 10 (particulate matter) were also very high in this region. The standard for NOX is 80 microns in 24 hours while it is 100 microns for PM 10 in 24 hours.

But from the days the lockdown began, the pollution levels fell by as many as 30 points for nitrogen oxide, indicating that the air was getting cleaner due to vehicular traffic coming down drastically.

“Our air quality index is comparatively good because of our climate. Normally in summer, the RSPM remains high because there is no rain or winds to clear the air. The main pollutants for us are vehicles and the construction sector. Since construction activity has come down due to the Covid situation, we are seeing a drastic fall in particulate matter levels too,” Baiju said.

According to the data recorded by the KSPCB, the PM 10 levels touched 211 microns on March 7, 173 on March 6 and 166 on March 8. The highest recorded in the last 10 days being on March 17, at 161 microns. The fall in levels began from March 20 (96) and it has been falling steadily since then.

Interestingly, at MG Road, the PM 2.5 levels showed a rise from 17 microns on March 22 to 31 microns on March 24, during the lockdown period. There is a growing concern that this could be because of people burning waste at night times. With waste collection affected by the confusion caused due to Corona scare and social distancing, people have been seen burning plastic and other waste at several points in their own neighbourhoods.

The microplans are prepared in such a way as to ensure that not a single suspected Covid-19 person should remain untraced, just like in the polio eradication campaign, which ensured that every child should administer polio drops.The strategy had worked and the entire country had been declared polio-free by the World Health Organisation. The health authorities have adopted the same way in which they conduct acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance for eradicating polio from the country.According to WHO, polio eradication microplans had adopted the innovative strategy of house-to-house vaccination over time. The health services in countries in which polio had been endemic, did not reach everyone, and underserved communities had a greater burden of polio. Services were therefore brought to the community.Following the same microplan, the health department has constituted 300 teams of health workers to reach out to each and every person in the area around the private hospital, where 16 persons tested positive for Covid-19 so far. “The moment we realised that a doctor working at a hospital could be the epicentre for Covid-19 spread in Bhilwara, we immediately constituted 300 teams and drew up a three-layered containment plan to cover the entire district. It is just like what health agencies used to do when a case of polio was reported from a particular area. We conducted intense contact tracing. Then, our teams went house-to-house to cover the entire urban population for screening and surveillance. Now, we have fanned out into rural areas to identify suspected cases. The strategy seems to have worked for containment,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary (health).The health department developed 24-hour screening centre of all the symptomatic and contacts of the hospital which is the epicentre of Covid-19-positive cases in Bhilwara.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74821528,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-613332,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bhilwara-fights-coronavirus-the-way-nation-erased-polio/articleshow/74819472.cms
98,['26/03/2020'],Rocky road for 30 students in London,"The students were staying in a hotel, paid for by HCI, for the past three days.

HYDERABAD: As many as 30 Indian students , including 27 from the Telugu states, found themselves on the road in London on Wednesday after they were asked to vacate the hotel they were put up in, by The High Commission of India ( HCI ), three days ago. The commission informed them that they would have to vacate the hotel and look for their own accommodation.

“Our problem is that we do not have any money,” Mustafa, a student from Hyderabad told TOI from London. Though the HCI suggested another cheaper accommodation where students could get a twin sharing room for 10 pounds a day, students said even that was unaffordable. “No one has any money. We are literally at the crossroads and don’t know where to go,” Mustafa added.

In fact, one girl from the group said she had only five pounds. While another student had 60 pounds on him, he feared that he wouldn’t have money to buy food if he spent it on accommodation. “We knew we had to vacate the hotel but did not know that we would have to pay when we move into another accommodation,” said a student.

When the students reached the Gatwick airport in London on March 18 to take a flight back home to India, they were informed that flights to India had been cancelled because of restrictions on account of the coronavirus outbreak. Helpless, the students went to the HCI for help as they could not go back to their hostels and universities they had already vacated.

The students slept in the HCI premises for a couple of days, after which they were shifted to the hotel. The HCI paid for the hotel accommodation. During the time that they were in the hotel, food arrangements were done by Telugu associations. One social worker, Gampa Venugopal of Telangana NRI Forum told TOI that other associations were always involved in providing help to students. Meanwhile, the HCI has also announced a shutdown of its premises and therefore, the students cannot go back to the commission.

MADURAI: People of the city have demanded that the isolation wards for Covid-19 patients, which have been established in the vicinity of other wards, frequented by other patients, of the Madurai Government Rajaji Hospital , should be moved to a more secluded place to prevent the spread of disease.

The isolation wards have been established in ward number 120 of the old building of the hospital, the old dengue ward near the outpatient facility and in the super specialty hospital opposite to the Anna bus stand. If the need arises, an isolation ward has also been kept ready in the post graduates’ hostel in the Madurai Medical College .

There are almost 10,000 people at GRH at almost all times. Similarly, the super-specialty hospital has about 1,500 people in this building at any given time including outpatients, in-patients, hospital staff and medical professionals. Hence, there is a need for the isolation wards to be established in more secluded places, people said.

Veronica Mary, a resident of Madurai, said that she was scared after taking her seven-year-old daughter for treatment to the hospital as there were many patients moving around. “I couldn’t get a mask outside the hospital, and no sanitizer was provided to us like it done in private hospitals,’’ she said.

Geriatrician Dr N Raja said that maintaining a distance between the Covid-19 suspects and other patients is important. “It is an infectious disease that fortunately does not spread through air, but a safe distance is a must. But, when taken into account the requirements like ventilators, it was only available in the GRH and the private hospitals. Thoppur would have been a better choice for the isolation ward, but ventilator and other equipment were only available in the city,'' he said. Dr Raja said that all hospitals in Madurai including the GRH and private hospitals have only about 500 ventilators.

Meanwhile, the Madurai MP Su Venkatesan has made an allocation of Rs 56.17 lakh from the MP Local Area Development Fund (MPLAD) for equipping the isolation wards at the GRH. The funds are to be used for procurement of three ventilators for Rs 18 lakh, multi-para monitors for Rs 6.06 lakh, 1,000 N95 masks for Rs 3 lakh, 25 oxygen cylinders with stand for Rs 3 lakh and other equipment.

MADURAI: Hundreds of people continued to flout the rules by coming out on the roads and crowding the markets on Wednesday morning, even as Section 144 imposed by the state government at 6pm on Tuesday, and the nationwide lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi came into effect six hours later. Police had to forcibly shut down about 400 shops in the Central market as the crowds turned unruly.

While the curfew rules strictly specified that gathering of more than five people at a time was an offence, women and men crowding the market to buy vegetables was a common sight in the Central market from as early as 7am on Wednesday. The vendors were unperturbed by the fact that they too were at risk, while customers were happy that the prices of vegetables had come down compared to Tuesday.

Commissioner of police, S Davidson Devasirvatham himself came to the spot on receiving information about the crowds and warned them. A police vehicle was also parked at the entrance to regulate the crowds, but as they turned unruly, authorities ordered the closure of all 400 shops in the market.

Meat stalls and fish stalls also saw more than five people at a time and the authorities ordered them to shut by 11am.

Meanwhile, people on two-wheelers were a common sight in many traffic signals as they continued to violate the rules. In some places like Kamarajar Salai and East Masi Street, police personnel warned the violators while some others were fined Rs 100. Some police officials even resorted to deflating the tyres of some of the riders who were found continuously on the road, as a last resort to prevent them from venturing out again.

Thus, he is the second Covid-19 positive case in Bhopal, said the health department.

The journalist is the father of Bhopal’s first Covid-19 patient, who is undergoing treatment at AIIMS, Bhopal.

Health officials said that AIIMS Bhopal has confirmed that the journalist had tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday — five days after he attended the former CM’s press conference. This is the press conference where Kamal Nath resigned. It was attended by top political leaders, journalists and other staffers. The journalist is a resident of Professors Colony and his family is under quarantine.

Health department is tracing the places that the journalist visited, including press conferences after March 18. The contact tracing took the health officials to Vidhan Sabha too, said sources.

The first Covid-19 case in Bhopal was reported on Sunday. The patient had returned from United Kingdom on March 17 and reached Bhopal via train on March 18. Contact tracing of the patient revealed that she came in contact with 157 people. CCTV footage and other areas visited by the family of the infected are being reviewed. “All those who have come in touch with the journalist will be requested to get a medical check-up and asked to self-quarantine,” said a district health official.

Many, who came in contact with the journalist, had gone into self-quarantine after the daughter was tested positive on Sunday. Test report of the mother, brother and maid of the city’s first patient is awaited.

Meanwhile, the state government has asked journalists, government employees and politicians who came in contact with the girl patient’s father to self-quarantine . In a directive, MP Vidhan Sabha principal secretary AP Singh directed all Vidhan Sabha employees and others who came in touch with the Covid-19 patient in the state assembly to self-quarantine. Another officer, who was OSD for former CM, said on social media that he tested negative for Covid-19. It is not clear, if any politicians are under self-quarantine.

PRAYAGRAJ: At a time when the country is facing challenging times in view of complete lockdown, it has come as a blessing in disguise for fight against pollution as the city’s air quality index (AQI) has improved drastically.

The comparison of AQI in Sangam city, as recorded on two different dates of the month put up on the display board at Prayagraj Junction, shows how the situation has improved.

Chief public relations officer (CPRO), North Central Railway (NCR), Ajeet Kumar Singh said on March 18, the city’s AQI was 206 (against the standard value of 100). The AQI on PM10 (particles per million) scale was recorded at 162µg/m3 and 91µg/m3 at PM2.5 scale.

“However, on March 23, the AQI was just 24, perhaps the lowest in several decades. The AQI on PM10 scale was recorded at 22µg/m3 and 14µg/m3 at PM2.5 scale,” he said.

To understand the purity of air, as inhaled by residents, one has to look at last year’s AQI. On November 1, 2019, AQI was recorded as 547.

On November 4, AQI was recorded at 622 (six time higher than permissible limits) and 380 µg/m3 on PM10 scale and 64µg/m3 at PM2.5 scale.

“Due to the lockdown, there is almost negligible pollution by vehicles and industries and as such every citizen can heave a sigh of relief as pollution level is very low,” said Ramjas Prasad, an official at UP Pollution Control Unit of Prayagraj.

Physician Dr Kamal Kumar said, “Although these are testing times and many people, especially younger generation could be irritated for being confined to their homes, everyone should start building the capacity of their lungs by following simple inhaling exercise and what better days it could be than the best AQI one could get”.

“Imposing penalty doesn’t mean that people will come out and get away by paying a fine, they will also be booked under various sections of the relevant laws and further legal action will be initiated. The move is aimed at sending a message to people that irresponsible behavior will not be tolerated and that guidelines need to be strictly followed by all,” the DM added.

UDHAGAMANDALAM: The Nilgiris district administration ordered officials to make vegetable and fruit shopowners to display price list and crack down on shops inflating prices of essential commodities.

Collector J Innocent Divya issued the order on Wednesday after conducting a check at the Ooty municipal market and receiving reports of inflated prices at Coonoor, Kotagiri and Gudalur markets. While at Ooty Uzhalavar sandai vegetables were sold at the prescribed price by the horticulture department, tomato was sold at Rs 40 at the Ooty municipal.In Kotagiri, tomato was sold at Rs 60, said Haldurai , a resident of the town.

The collector instructed shops to follow guidelines issued by the government as markets were overcrowded and shops were without facility for washing hands. The Ooty town DSP was instructed to allow only 25 people to enter the Uzhalavar Sandai at a time and permit the next five after as many come out of it.

Meanwhile, the district police stopped people roaming, including bikers, on streets and let them off after issuing stern warning.

MADURAI: The city will get two more police stations at Kochadai and Anupanadi to be constructed at Rs 6.08 crore each to share the burden of the SS Colony and Avaniyapuram police stations, which have a vast and densely populated areas to cover. An announcement to this effect was made by the state government on Tuesday. Four more traffic police stations too have been announced for Madurai .

Last year, the government announced two police stations at Tirupalai and Mattuthavani to share the burden of vast police stations like Tallakulam and Anna Nagar. The process is under way for the creation of the two stations at present.

Following the expansion of the Madurai Corporation limits from 50sqkm to 147sqkm, the city police expanded its limits coterminous with the corporation limits in 2015.

The city police are having tough time controlling the expanded limits as the strength has not increased much. With the traffic strength too not being revised for long, officials found it difficult to manage the growing traffic. Officials will be relieved, once the four proposed stations come into operation.

City police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham told TOI that smaller the size of the area to be covered by a police station, better the services to the public. Since the city is densely populated, more police stations are required to provide better policing.

“When the number of stations increase we can handle emergency phone calls landing in control room, and patrolling effectively,” he said.

Meanwhile, the four traffic police stations would come up in Anna Nagar, Koodalpudur, Tirunagar and Mattuthavani at a cost of Rs 5.52 crore each. Devasirvatham said this will result in increase in traffic police strength, which will help manage traffic more efficiently.

The state government also announcement that sub-inspector led police stations like Perungudi, Austinpatti, Satur, Keelavalavu, Melavalavu, Kadupatti and Appan Thirupathi will be converted into inspector-led police stations.

The number of inspectors will also increase as there was an announcemnt to increase the strength of law and order and crime inspectors in districts like Trichy , Madurai, Coimbatore, Salem and Tirunelveli at a cost of Rs 11.74 crore.

On Monday, Kothagudem police registered a case against the DSP and his son, who returned from London via Dubai on March 18, for hiding the latter’s travel history and violating the home quarantine rule, after the latter tested positive for coronavirus.Health officials carried out contact tracing and zeroed in on people whom the DSP’s son had come in contact and began the isolation process.

111,['26/03/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Stay home or 1 lakh could be in hospital,"CHENNAI: We will have to pay a heavy price for violating the Covid curfew. A mathematical model has predicted that up to 60,000 people may land up in hospitals across Tamil Nadu when the disease peaks in May and that is the best case scenario, say officials in the state Covid-19 control room. In the worst case, the number may touch one lakh.The numbers are approximate, based on the model prepared by the Centre For Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy (CDDEP) in association with the Johns Hopkins. “They have estimated the scenarios for Kerala, Karnataka , UP, Telangana and Delhi. We are using a rough calculation and taking a number between Telangana and Maharashtra,” said a senior health official.On Wednesday, Telangana, which has a population of 39.64 million, recorded 39 cases, while Maharashtra, with a population of 126 million, had 107. TN, with 81.5 million people, had 18 covid-19 positive cases. The analysis showed that India might end up with 13 crore to 25 crore Covid-19 infections – symptomatic, asymptomatic and hospitalization -- and between 12 lakh and 25 lakh people may require hospitalisation. “We have asked them for an exclusive report for Tamil Nadu,” said health secretary Beela Rajesh. Other recommendations in the report will stay valid, officials said. The report says most infected cases will be mild. Infections will peak between April and May, when the most number of people will be hospitalised.Government and private hospitals have been asked to increase bed strength, and district collectors and civic bodies to identify buildings that can be used for isolation and quarantine. Hospitals have been asked to drastically cut patient service and elective surgeries.The CDDEP guidance report on COVID-19 in India is based on evidence from the India SIM Model – an agent-based model of the Indian population. Scientists fitted the model to available data from China and Italy under three scenarios –high, moderate and low infection.National containment, it says, may no longer be an option for India, as community transmission of the virus most likely started in early March. “However, state or local (temporary) containment and mitigation is the best option,” it said. Tamil Nadu has found contacts of people who have travelled abroad being infected. Health minister C Vijayabaskar says they are doing their best to stop community transmission of the disease. Experts point out that social distancing can reduce this peak load by as much as 75% although this may be hard to enforce in India, the study points out.Encouraging early testing, it says people should follow social distancing more seriously. Director of public health Dr K Kolandasamy said disinfecting surfaces and hand hygiene should be practised along with social distancing. “This will have more impact than lockdowns,” he said.There is also hope that increase in temperature and humidity should help us in reducing case load, although the report warns there could be multiple peaks on the graph.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74820275,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-193492,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/stay-home-or-1-lakh-could-be-in-hospital/articleshow/74818873.cms
112,['26/03/2020'],Coronavirus scare pushes prices of essentials up,"BHOPAL: The corona scare in Madhya Pradesh is driving up the prices of essential commodities — adding to the pressure of household budgets. Prices of fresh vegetables have doubled and that of staples like pulses and flour have gone up by almost 25%, complain residents.On Monday, when Pankaj Sharma had gone to purchase fruits and vegetables from the nearby market, the prices were reasonable. But on Wednesday, the same hawker charged him double. When Sharma asked the hawker to reduce the prices, he told him, “We are not trying to cheat you. We are ourselves getting vegetables at a higher price.”Left with no option Sharma bought potato at Rs40/kg, tomato at Rs50/kg and bottle gourd (lauki) at Rs80/kg.What is strange is that vegetables and fruits are available at half the price at supermarkets — but things go out of stock there within minutes. On Wednesday itself, a supermarket in Trilanga was selling potatoes at Rs22/kg, tomatoes at Rs25/kg and onions at Rs27/kg — but everything was almost sold out by 10:30am.Despite the claims and assurances of government and district administration that there would be a smooth supply of essential commodities, black marketing of items like flour, edible oil, pulses (toor dal), rice, poha and sabudana have begun. These commodities are always “out of stock” and if one persists, you get it in black.“Prices of grocery items are up by at least 25%. Since people have been stocking up over the last few days, many staples are in short supply — because of which they are being sold at inflated prices. Aata which was earlier available for Rs625 per 25kg is now being sold for Rs850 per 25kg ... The prices are expected to rise,” said Vinod Shrivastava, a merchant.Ever since the janata curfew was announced, Bhopalis have been coming out in large numbers to buy grocery items, medicines and other goods. After the PM’s address on Tuesday, residents lined up outside markets to prepare for the 21-day lockdown in India. This buying spree has led to crowding in market areas, raising concerns. As many as 200 persons had reached a supermarket in Kolar on Tuesday, forcing the manager of the store to close the entry, even as the people jostled with the staff members. It was only after police announced that whosoever doesn’t leave will be arrested that the crowd dispersed.Shop owners are taking all precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. Many of stores have made it mandatory for customers to wear masks in their shops. “We have given instructions to all the traders not to allow crowding of people at their shop. They can take phone numbers of the customers and either call them when there are no people in the shop or deliver their order to their homes. Crowding at one place must be avoided, it is the very purpose of a lockdown,” said Bhopal collector, Tarun Pithode.Answering a question on blackmarketing of essential goods, Pithode said, “We have talked to traders and things should normalise in next one or two days.""Pithode's assurance notwithstanding, prices of sanitisers and masks — which were the first to start rising following detection of coronavirus cases in India — continue to soar despite the administration enlisting self-help groups, prisoners and distilleries to provide adequate stock of the two commodities in the market.",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74818870,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-83157,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/corona-scare-pushes-prices-of-essentials-up/articleshow/74818871.cms

KOCHI: To minimise the chances of people stepping out of their houses on the pretext of buying vegetables, the district administration along with Horticorp has joined hands with an online platform to deliver vegetables at their doorsteps.

Thiruvananthapuram-based online platform A M Needs will deliver the vegetables before 7am. As per the plan, the vegetables purchased by the Horticorp from farmers and the agriculture department from wholesale market will be wrapped in a grey paper and transported to the destinations as per the demand of customers.

Vegetables will also be purchased through block-level federated organization under agriculture department and Vegetable Fruits Promotion Council of Kerala (VFPCK).

The order for vegetables can be placed through the mobile application of AM Needs, which currently delivers bread, egg and milk at people’s doorsteps after taking orders online. “We plan to sell around 10 varieties of vegetables, including onion, potato, chilly, beans and bitter gourd online. AM Needs will deliver it before 7am under the brand name of Horticorp itself. The vegetables purchased by the agriculture department and VFPCK will be supplied to the Horticorp, which in turn will wrap in paper as per the demand of each customer. After wrapping the vegetables in paper carrying name of the customer on it, the parcel will be handed over to the delivery boys of the online agency before 5am. The price of vegetables will depend on the procurement rate. The online agency will charge transportation fee from the customer. The payment should be made online,” said a Horticorp official.

The customer should place the order for vegetables a day before delivery as the officials need to purchase the products from market depending on the requirement.

The agency currently plans to distribute the vegetables at Kakkanad, Edapally, Panampilly Nagar, Thevara, Pottakuzhy, Tripunithura, Palluruthy, Palarivattom and Vyttila areas. ‘We have employed 38-40 delivery boys for the job. Online delivery boys are not allowed in many apartment complexes due to the Covid-19 situation. In such cases, we either hand over the parcel to security staff in the building or the customer can directly collect it from the gate. Though we have decided to deliver vegetables at nine places now, we will extend it to other parts gradually,” said Pranav T P, official of AM Needs.

Delivery has already been started on a trial basis at Kakkanad and Edapally on Wednesday.

The customer care department of the agency will be open from 6am to 10pm.

BHUBANESWAR: Several Odias, including students, stranded in different cities of the country appealed to the state government on Wednesday to bring them back home. A group of 79 students pursuing their BEd in K J Somaiya Sanskrit Vidyapeetham, Mumbai, posted a video on social media urging the state government to rescue them. They are staying in rented accommodation.

Ajay Pati, a first year BEd student at the institute, said they are in a tight spot. “Eight people are staying together in a room near the institute. We do not have rations and cooking gas. We are somehow managing with dried foods and biscuits. We may not survive till April 14 if the government do not rescue us,” Pati said.

He said they stayed back because their examination was scheduled on April 7. “But later it was postponed. We had booked tickets for March 22, but it was cancelled due to last Sunday’s ‘janata curfew’. Later, we booked tickets for Tuesday. Now the trains have been cancelled,” he added.

A group of five people from Bargarh and Sambalpur are stuck in a hotel in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. They had gone to attend a wedding in Pratapgarh and are now finding it difficult to return, resulting in an appeal to the Naveen Patnaik government.

“We had come to attend the wedding of our friend’s daughter at Pratapgarh on March 18. The next day, we left for Lucknow. After finishing our work there, we booked tickets for March 21 to return to Odisha. But the train got cancelled. Later, the ‘janata curfew’ and then the lockdown robbed us of a chance to return home,” said Sanjay Kumar Bhoi from Khajurtikra in Bargarh district .

He said they are holed up in a room in the hotel which does not serve food. “With the eateries closed, we are surviving on biscuits and fruits. We are also running out of money. If the government provides us with a car from Sambalpur, we can return home,” Bhoi added.

Meanwhile, a group of 45 students stranded at Markapura in Andhra Pradesh returned home on Wednesday with the help of Andhra Pradesh governor Biswabhusan Harichandan. The students had visited Markapura for their BEd exam. As many as 105 students had returned home on March 19, but these 45 could not due to the lockdown. Following request from their parents, governor Harichandan directed the Andhra Pradesh government to help them out.

BIJNOR: Supply department in Bijnor has provided gas cylinders to 16,000 people at home here on the first day of the nationwide lockdown on Wednesday due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

District supply officer Manish Kumar told TOI, “There are over six lakh consumers in Bijnor district who used to get cooking gas from 90 agencies. Since the complete lockdown, we have shut all gas agencies and started providing 100% home delivery. On Wednesday, we have provided over 16,000 cylinders to consumers who had booked their gas through proper procedure. All cylinders are sanitised before they are being sent to the consumers’ houses.”

“Besides, we will have a mobile number on which consumers can send their demands for essentials. We are planning to prepare a ‘grain kit’ for people. They will be sent home of the ‘callers’ at market price. This will help to curb black marketing,” Kumar added.

“With the help of the passes, policemen on duty would be able to identify and segregate them, and provide uninterrupted passage,” a police officer said.

The documents can be sent on helpline number 8057680112, he said, adding that once the documents are received passes will be issued to them.

The move comes against the backdrop of complaints that policemen were “harassing” drivers of vehicles on road to ferry items of daily needs. On Wednesday, despite the lockdown, people were seen roaming on roads.

Police arrested 16 such people who were caught roaming on roads and couldn’t give a valid reason for their outing. As many as 200 challan were also slapped and 27 vehicles were impounded.

Senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Muzaffarnagar, Abhishek Yadav, said, “We are trying to ensure that no one has to go out. Every essential item will be available. Medical stores and grocery shops will be open.”

“If anyone has to come out in an emergency then avoid taking other person with him. Otherwise action will be taken against him,” the SSP cautioned.

128,['26/03/2020'],Covid-19: The uphill battle to save pandemic-hit Bhilwara,"JAIPUR: Rishi Sharma begins his day with prayers to keep himself safe. He has a town to save. Bhilwara The 24-year-old government nursing staffer is part of a huge team of 1,500 health workers and 2,400 police personnel undertaking the country’s largest screening exercise for the novel coronavirus Covid-19 ) after 13 cases of virus infection surfaced in Bhilwara,The magnitude of the task feels overwhelming. The textile town of 6 lakh people in Rajasthan is under curfew. Bhilwara’s borders have been sealed and the vast majority of the population is struggling for essential services. Officials said they have planned three rounds of screening and expect to complete the first round in the next two days.So far, 5,392 persons in Bhilwara have been told to quarantine themselves at home, probably the most in any city in the country, and 38 have been put in isolation wards so far, after three doctors and nine healthcare workers from the city’s Banger Hospital were declared Covid-19 positive last week. A family member of one of these doctors, too, tested positive, taking the total number of infections to 13 till Tuesday.Rishi Sharma’s (name changed) family watches him head out into this world of invisible danger with a mixture of dread and pride, and plenty of do’s and don’ts, but from a safe distance. They know their son is the only person from their locality going out every day to save a city from doom. ""Emotionally it is very draining for my family who know the danger of my job. My mother keeps messaging me and calls me to know whether everything is all right,"" says Sharma. He and others in the screening team of 1,500, split into smaller units to cover more ground and work 8 to 10 hours every day. He goes from home to home collecting information vital to identifying Covid-19 suspects in pandemic-hit Bhilwara.The health workers include doctors, nursing staff and anganwadi workers working round the clock with assistance from the police and home guards.CMHO Mushtaq Khan said the screening process will be challenging because the potential carriers (those who had visited Banger Hospital) are spread across the district. ""So far, 38,000 houses have been screened. The remaining 25,000 houses will be screened in the next three days. The second and third phases will be in areas which will have positive cases,"" the CMHO said.So far, all 13 cases have been linked to the city’s Banger hospital. The local administration has identified for the second phase areas where positive cases are likely. ""A total of 120 people related to the last two cases have been quarantined and samples of 78 have been sent to the labs. If anyone is found to be virus-positive we will restart the process of screening the entire area based on their location,"" Khan said.The sense of fear widespread, so much so that people are losing confidence and being uncooperative with the health workers.""People are paranoid that health workers will infect them. Secondly, rumours that once the suspect is taken he/she will never come back are preventing them from cooperating. Sometimes one household takes half an hour to give us the required information, further delaying the process,"" said Subhash Goyal, a health worker in Bhilwara.Meanwhile, in many areas families have reported shortages of milk, veggies, food grains and medicines. ""We have decided not to touch anything coming from outside, like milk and veggies, or to entertain any person from outside, even if we have to starve,"" says Akram Khan, a resident of Bhilwara’s Chippa Mohalla.The stillness deep in the city is eerie, says Sharma, who accompanies an aanganwadi worker. ""Sometimes it’s scary moving into the interiors without hearing any human voice. The fear escalates when we knock on doors but get no response,"" says Sharma.Strangely, such is the sense of fulfilment of a job well done that Sharma likens finding a person with virus symptoms to hitting the jackpot. ""Our aim is to identify suspects and inform the doctors. The feeling doubles when the doctor, based on my input, says the patient must self-quarantine or takes him/her to the isolation ward,"" says Sharma.At the end of a working day, any elation changes to anxiety when he heads home, back to the family he loves, even after following all sanitising protocols. ""I have maintained a distance from the family and I keep away from my parents and my nephews. They also do not interact with me too much,"" Sharma says over the phone from Bhilwara.The health workers are received well in some places but households sometimes question their motives. ""Many Muslim households try to confirm whether we are part of an NPR or NRC team,"" said Sharma.Curfew was imposed in nine villages in Mandal tehsil of Bhilwara district late Monday night after three persons with apparent symptoms of Covid-19 were found loitering about the rural area earlier in the day. The villages are Balsaira, Kadukota, Srinagar , Gokulpura, Dhumandas, Powderdas, Rupehela, Chatrapur and Schola. ""The measure will help healthcare workers screen all nine villages,"" Bhilwara SP Harendra Kumar said on Tuesday.Around 2,400 police personnel are at the front of the battle in Bhilwara. They don’t have a manual to help them deal with a pandemic of this scale so they are following a 10-point guideline that tells them, among other things to eat a hearty breakfast and sanitise their batons and vehicles before the day begins.""It is an unprecedented situation for all of us and we are following all guidelines and turning to experience to maintain the confidence of the police force,"" Bhilwara SP Harendra Kumar says. The SP's office has been regularly updating its staff via WhatsApp groups on how to keep themselves, and other, safe.The advisory says that every policeman starts his/her day by wearing a fresh face mask and refilling a water bottle. Before leaving home they have to self-check their health status. Anyone with Covid-19 symptoms is advised to report to the doctor.""The job is very distressing due to prolonged hours and the danger.

They were hungry for the last two days. Seeing their condition, policemen posted at the station offered them eatables and some cash.

“We somehow survived till Wednesday morning. But, when the children could not bear the hunger, I decided to walk with them to the nearest police station, which is 4km away.

QUEPEM: Even as most residents of Quepem were flustered about having no access to groceries on Wednesday, several homeless people were seen going house to house, begging for food. With all shops, restaurants, medical stores and petrol pumps closed on the first day of the 21-day curfew, the destitute, and ragpickers who live on the streets were caught unawares.

Citizens raised concerns about the homeless, some of them with special-needs and mental disabilities, moving around town, scavenging for food and sleeping on the roadside. While they usually manage to wrangle a meal from roadside eateries, most of them had to go hungry due to the lockdown.

However, the well-heeled also had to return empty handed when they went out of their homes looking to stock up on essentials. In Sanguem , a serpentine queue was seen at a grocery shop in the town but the police came by and shut the store down.

Those in the long queue which reached from the market area to the bus stand and beyond, said they maintained a metre’s distance from each other, yet the police didn’t allow the shop to sell essentials. Another vegetable shop was also shut down within an hour of opening.

In Quepem, some locals were frustrated over the unavailability of milk. It was a near-100 percent lock down in Quepem town and surrounding areas.

When asked whether fair price shop owners or grocery shops had approached him for curfew passes to start home delivery for essential goods, as declared by the chief minister, deputy collector of Quepem Rohit Kadam said that he did not receive any notification from the district collector in this regard.

Some shopkeepers told TOI that they are unaware about the chief minister’s announcement regarding home delivery.

More and more Muslim women and girls are choosing to wear the burqa to protect their faces, eyes, nose and mouth against the novel coronavirus.At least 10 tailors of Kendrapada town and its nearby areas are busy stitching burqas in their houses.With workshops closed because of the earlier state-wide and now nation-wide lockdown, they have moved their work equipment home. A burqa can cost anything from Rs 500 to Rs 1500. Now, many tailors are selling them for double their price to eager customers.“Many Muslim men have resorted to wearing masks and gloves to protect themselves. For the women, the burqa acts as a natural defence against germ-carrying droplets. Most burqas even have a net lining for the eyes, so the demand for the garment has spiked,” said SK Akbar, a tailor in Tendakuda.“We stitch different sized burqas for women and girls. Usually, they sell at dismal prices. Sales are ordinarily slack, except during Eid and the marriage season. But Covid-19 has boosted the sale of the burqa like nothing else,” said Mohammad Sahid, a tailor of Kendrapada.

Those that do are making a profit now,” said Sk Amiruddin, also of Kendrapada.The district is experiencing a shortage of three-layered anti-bacterial face masks. “It’s crucial for people to wear proper protective gear.

133,['26/03/2020'],‘Invasive species threaten Chilika Lake’,"Chilika Lake

BHUBANESWAR: The Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar has conducted a genetic analysis of an invasive species ‘ Phragmites Karka’ in Chilika Lake and is working on finding a possible solution to control it’s growth as it poses a threat to the ecosystem of this brackish water lake.

From 76 square km in 2000 to 286 square km, this dominant species has invaded the north and north-western segment of the Chilika Lake. “The dense growth of ‘Phragmites’ is leading to the retention of sediments. The sediments are rapidly replacing the area under the submerged aquatic plant, which is an important source of food as well as a breeding ground for fishes,” ILS director Ajay Parida said.

He added that the falling leaves and branches of the ‘Phragmites’ make the sediments and soil fertile and help it grow. It dominates the area by not allowing other plants to grow. “It is seen that water cannot penetrate into the area densely covered by this species. The aquatic animals face problems in staying on the sediments and soils formed owing to the growth of the species,” he added.

A team of researchers led by ILS director Parida and his colleagues (Soumyshree Nayak and Seema Pradhan) in collaboration with Dinabandhu Sahoo from the Institute of Bioresources and Sustainable Development (IBSD), Imphal, had undertaken the study using advanced next-generation sequencing approach. The study published in the scientific reports of international journal ‘Nature’ will enable the researchers develop stress-tolerant crop varieties for improving agriculture productivity in rain-fed areas. The research findings stated that the genome sequencing done by the ILS study will help the scientists understand which genes help the species grow in saltwater with ease. These genes will help the researchers develop crop varieties, including rice, which can grow in saltwater or in very less water. “We are also working to find out the genes which can be altered to control this species,” Parida said.

The study revealed that as many as 954 and 1,097 unigenes in leaf and root tissues, respectively, were differentially regulated in treated tissues compared to the normal and 74 unigenes, which were found to be differentially expressed in both roots and shoots.

135,['26/03/2020'],Covid-19 cases in Madhya Pradesh climb to 20,"Bhopal: As Madhya Pradesh reported its first death due to COVID-19 and six more positive patients –one each in Bhopal and Ujjain and nine in Indore—the total number of positive patients increased to 20 on Wednesday. All the four major cities Bhopal, Jabalpur, Gwalior and Indore have been put under curfew.

In Gwalior, the curfew was earlier announced till March 25, but it has been extended for one month till April 21, with some riders. “Six reports were received today and all are negative, as a precaution, we are extending the curfew till April 21, in Gwalior, though it is being done with some relaxations related to essential services. Around 100 people have been traced who had come into contact with one positive patient of the city and all have been put in home quarantine. Situation is being closely monitored,” district collector Gwalior, Kaushlendra Vikram Singh told TOI.

After nine patients were found to be positive, curfew was imposed in Indore too. Jabalpur is already under curfew. “A total of 366 people have been put under home quarantine and 21 are under hospital quarantine. One report was received today and it was negative,” district collector Bharat Yadav said.

Besides curfew in the four major towns, the entire state has been put under lockdown till April 14.

However considering that the crops in the state are ready for harvest, state government on Wednesday relaxed the movement of the vehicles used in agriculture during the curfew. In some districts, police had to take several measures like shaming the lockdown violators or taking action against them.

Rumours also led to fear in some areas, including Ram Nagar town of Satna district, where a senior citizen Laxman Prasad Shukla was alarmed after his middle-aged son Bala Prasad Shukla, who had returned home after a long drive went to sleep after bolting the room from inside and wouldn’t wake up. Laxman Prasad spread the news that his son was probably suffering from Coronavirus. Soon teams of the health department reached there only to find that the man was actually asleep, said sources.

In most of the districts, the administration is making arrangements for home delivery of essential commodities so that people remain at their homes, said sources.

In several districts including Jabalpur, civic bodies drew circles in front of the grocery and medicine shops to ensure social distancing during purchase of goods, added sources.

PANAJI: A Goan IT entrepreneur has created a platform for individuals to search for fresh work-from-home employment if people get laid off, not just in Goa but across the country, from the economic slide caused by the novel coronavirus (Covid-19).

Prajyot Mainkar, founder and chief executive officer of Androcid Media has used a simple online tool to build a crowd-sourcing platform to identify work-from-home opportunities for those looking for jobs and gigs. “This crowd-sourcing is an effort to identify work-from-home opportunities so that anyone looking for opportunities can look up options available, not just in Goa but across the country,” said Mainkar.

Mainkar has created a Google Docs form where individuals can sign-up and leave their contact details. As of now a little over 100 people have expressed interest in such opportunities.

“Once we get a sizeable number of people looking for jobs or gigs, we will share the statistics and data on social media. Using tweets and other social media platforms employers can contact them,” said Mainkar.

Private companies are also slowly warming up to having freelancers on contract or allowing workers to work from home for desk jobs.

Many firms also offer gigs or short term contracts for field-work across multiple cities in India.

“Goa has fewer companies and more people looking for jobs. And once we come out of this crisis, work-from-home could catch up in a big way. So a month down the line, these people can connect with employers for jobs or sign up for projects such as advertising, design, web-development, promotional marketing, transport, training, teaching or retail,” Mainkar said.

The crowdsourcing form has garnered a lot of interest from people residing in Dubai, Delhi and Pune, and Mainkar says he has seen people from the e-commerce, insurance, and marketing sector registering for the service.

137,['26/03/2020'],"Uttar Pradesh: Long walk home for migrant workers, hundreds of km, hours on road, inside milk tankers","Ankit Kumar, a contractual labourer, had walked all night — for about 10 hours — when TOI spoke to him on Wednesday morning. “My home in Saharanpur is 135 km from Meerut. With no income for the past few days and no hope of any in the coming month, I had no option but to leave,” said Kumar. He will have to walk some more.

In Uttarakhand , Moorat Lal — who has had one meal in two days — will cycle 800 km from Dehradun to Raebareli. Along with eight others, the 30-year-old has covered 90 km and reached Laksar (Haridwar) on Wednesday. Tonight, this crew of plumbers, electricians and carpenters, would be taking shelter at the railway station. There’s 700 more km to go. Among them, they have less than 2,000 rupees. “It might take five days to reach, unless we are stopped by police. But we can’t go back. There’s nothing there for us,” said Lal.

With Covid-19 lockdown robbing daily wagers and labourers of their income, thousands across India are walking long distances, over 100 kilometres in many cases, and often on empty stomachs to reach their native villages and towns.

In Agra, closure of tourism and footwear industry which employs scores of daily wagers has left many in dire straits. UP CM Yogi Adityanath has announced Rs 1,000 monthly allowance each for around 35 lakh labourers, hawkers and vendors and free ration to 1.65 crore daily wagers, but many that TOI spoke to said they had no information about this.

With no money and no work, those working in bordering states are desperate to make it home. Mohammad Kasim and five others managed to reach Aligarh from Palwal (Haryana) after 28 hours of being on the road, walking and hitchhiking on trucks. “We ate biscuits and bananas as we didn’t have money for proper meals,” he said.

Gaurav Kumar, who worked at a shoe manufacturing company in Haridwar, said about 200 of them left on Tuesday night — hours after the 21-day lockdown was announced — to reach Bijnor in UP. “Even the children walked,” he said. Another person, Yaseen, travelled with his friends in an empty milk tanker to Najibabad.

In Rudrapur, Madan (who only uses his first name) was trying to make the trip with a five-month-old infant to Bareilly but was turned back. He was, however, adamant that he would try to leave again. “I don’t have money to feed my family as I have not got any work for past five days. I have no option,” he said.

Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Singh Rawat released a helpline number where migrant workers can seek assistance to reach their hometowns. Some good samaritans have also extended a helping hand. A local journalist went out of his way to drop a labourer who was planning to walk from Haridwar to Chamba, 90 km away. He then picked up another woman, who works at a hotel in Devprayag, and drove her to Rishikesh.

BHUBANESWAR: More than 200 persons were arrested and 80 vehicles seized across the state in the past three days for allegedly violating the lockdown order of the state government. In Bhubaneswar, the commissionerate police on Wednesday shamed the offenders by making them do sit-ups.

Among those arrested are shopkeepers selling non-essential commodities and three grooms who were getting married amid massive congregations. Police booked the arrested persons under Section 188 (disobedience of government order) of the Indian Penal Code . Almost all of them were subsequently granted bail.

Police did not slap other stringent sections of the IPC as the mass arrests might lead to overcrowding in jails.

Between Tuesday and Wednesday, police registered 137 cases, related to violation of lockdown across the state.

“We have been requesting people to stay indoors at this time of crisis. Only emergency service providers, including doctors, are exempt during the lockdown period. The SPs have been asked to ensure the free movement of healthcare personnel and other emergency service providers. Those who come out on the streets unnecessarily in defiance of the lockdown order are facing action as per law,” senior police officer said.

The senior cop has been holding video-conference with the SPs almost every day to know the status of the enforcement and awareness drives undertaken by the police. Though no arrests for the disobedience of the lockdown order have been made in Bhubaneswar so far, police caught some persons who were moving on the streets for fun. “We warned those irresponsible persons and asked them to do sit-ups by holding their ears. They apologized after being shamed publicly and pledged to support the government’s lockdown order,” Nirmal Satapathy , a senior police officer said.

The Keonjhar district police are also planning to punish lockdown violators through public shaming. “We are planning to have a hall of shame of #COVIDIOTS who wander unnecessarily and argue with law enforcing authorities,” read a tweet by the Keonjhar district police.

Whistle-blowers among students have been allegedly threatened by hospital authorities, though the state health department has denied it.“These surgical masks are effective only for six hours as pores get blocked, but we wear them for two days,” said a house surgeon in Theni GH.

146,['26/03/2020'],Odisha: Constables wield lathi on grocery shoppers as confusion prevails in Bhubaneswar markets,"Representative image.

BHUBANESWAR: Chaos accompanied the enforcement of the lockdown here, with police using lathis to ensure social distancing. People who stepped out for unavoidable tasks such as buying groceries and other essentials faced the wrath of the men in khaki, and were left thoroughly confused about how to buy food in future.

Police were seen using force on people who had ventured out on foot, and on those on bikes. Grocery shops unofficially became no-go zones after noon, with police personnel deployed in large numbers outside these shops. Since the government’s order clearly states that grocery shops will remain open during the lockdown, residents are now wondering how they will be able to access the products if they are not allowed to step out. Most online delivery services were unavailable on Wednesday, and local kirana shops do not have the manpower to start deliveries.

“We welcome the seriousness with which police are implementing the lockdown, but there should be a set of concrete dos and don’ts to make our lives easier. We don’t understand when police decided that people buying essentials should go back by noon. In that case, shouldn’t police ask the stores to also close by then?” said Prabhat Rath, a resident of the city.

Residents seemed to agree on the fact that there was a gap between orders coming from the top brass of police and those being followed by the constabulary and lower-rung personnel on the ground. The former however refused to admit that there is any confusion. “There is no confusion at all. The instructions are clear. Police will use force to ensure the lockdown if people don’t follow the directives,” said twin city police commissioner Sudhanshu Sarangi . He advised people to go to grocery stores on foot.

In other parts of the state, too, police were seen beating cyclists. In Bhubaneswar, the force made some people do sit-ups for flouting norms.

Social activist Biswajit Mohanty said instead of beating people up, police should ensure social distancing by making buyers stand apart in a queue outside grocery shops. “One fails to understand the logic of police that social distancing can be ensured only if a person goes shopping on foot. This is ridiculous,” he said.

BHUBANESWAR: Markets across the city witnessed a mad rush as customers went on a buying spree right after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day lockdown in the country on Tuesday.

Panic-buying returned to the city even though the government has assured that there is no dearth of staples in the state. As hundreds of people thronged the markets to stock up on groceries, police had to intervene and take action against those not adhering to the restrictions imposed to contain the spread of coronavirus.

“I went to buy fish at Unit-4 market around 8.30am. I was surprised to see the rush at a meat shop near the RBI Colony. There were serpentine queues in front of many shops,” Sunakar Bihari, a resident of the Sastri Nagar area, said. “Fearing that the situation may worsen in the coming days, people were seen buying more than required,” he added.

Manoranjan Udgata, another resident of the area, said, “We are thankful to the government for taking such a step to contain any further spread of the virus. We must cooperate by staying home. Since I don’t want to come out of the house every day, I am taking enough vegetables and other necessary items for my family,”

Debashis Acharya, 42, a resident of Madhusudan Nagar, said they have reduced consumption of food. “Coming out from home to buy essential items does not violate the lockdown,” he added.

A famous retail outlet in the city has drawn circles one metre apart outside its shop to help its customers maintain social distance. Some departmental shop owners have alleged hoarding and shortage of supply in the wholesale market. “We don’t get enough items from the wholesale market despite the government’s assurance of the same,” Bibhuti Bhushan Patra, grocery shop owner at Unit-1 market, said.

This issue was raised by a city psychiatrist to Union health minister Dr Harshvardhan in a letter that sought a temporary arrangement to allow WhatsApp prescriptions too.A WhatsApp counselling team of city psychiatrists, in the meantime, has registered rising anxiety levels among citizens, especially those who live alone in Mumbai.“The medication available for the mentally ill is strictly controlled by FDA (Food and Drugs Administration) and without a freshly dated hard copy, they are not given to patients,” said psychiatrist Dr Harish Shetty, who has written to state health minister Rajesh Tope as well. “Many medicines fall under the purview of the NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act and others under Schedule X of Drugs and Cosmetics Act,” he said. Most of these drugs require the chemist to photocopy the prescription and maintain a file that can be checked by FDA.“Under the prevailing circumstances, many patients are not able to contact their doctors due to fear, restrictions, non-availability of doctors and many other reasons. Psychiatrists are also forced to take Skype, online and web-based sessions with patients,” said the doctor. As soft copy prescriptions are not honoured by chemists, he has asked the minister to instruct FDA to allow patients to avail of medicines through soft copy prescriptions temporarily. “This will help patients prevent a relapse,” he said.Meanwhile, a WhatsApp initiative by 12 psychiatrists titled ‘Don’t let the virus invade your mind’ had them fielding hundreds of questions on Wednesday. “Social distancing to stop Covid-19 will leave many of us feeling lonely and anxious, leading to an epidemic of psychologist health issues,” said the tagline.Psychiatrist Dr Kersi Chavda, who set up the initiative at the instance of NGOs, said each doctor answered five to 25 calls.

""They call and WhatsApp details of what they need and we door deliver it,"" says Advaith. ""Now we also have people making home-cooked food on demand and we supply to seniors who need it.""His mother Bhuvana Seshan, a playback singer by profession, says the group ensures contactless delivery, and finds volunteers closest to the senior citizen’s home. ""Volunteers leave the groceries or medicines at the door step. Senior pay the volunteers for essentials received through mobile payment apps. For medications, we require the prescription to be whatsapped to the volunteer,"" she says.For years now, the residents of Zone 13 (Adyar, Kotturpuram, Velachery, MRC) have been working out ways to help the conservancy workers of their area. Sometimes, it’s events to celebrate special occasions, sometimes it is giving them a little financial incentive. Now, in the time of the Covid-19 crisis, the residents have got together virtually to start a crowdfunding campaign to raise Rs 20 lakh for 950 of these ""invisible heroes"" who work in their zone.""They may be invisible but the work they do is very visible.

""All of us are within the comforts of our own homes, keeping safe, but these people with no significant health insurance, are out on the streets working day and night. This is our way of saying thank you.""Archana says the campaign has already crossed Rs 4 lakh. ""The crowdfunding platform has waived off-platform fees and 100% of the contribution will go directly to the individual account of the workers. We have got their bank account details from the contractor so the money reaches them directly,"" she says.Anticipating that the elderly and those with low immunity could be the worst-affected during the nationwide lockdown, Bhoomika Trust opened their helpline early Wednesday morning, with volunteers on call for anyone in need of supplies, transportation to the hospital, or medical help.""And by afternoon, we had received close to 20 calls from seniors who had run out of water, a woman whose husband had suffered a stroke and could not reach his usual attenders, and patients who needed to get their dialysis done,"" says Jayendra Panchapakesan , founder-trustee, Bhoomika Trust, which works on disaster relief.Following the PM’s announcement on Tuesday evening, Bhoomika’s volunteers reached out to night shelters in Chintadripet, Santhome, Mandaiveli and Nungambakkam housing the homeless and migrant labourers, and gave them food supplies.

VADODARA/ ANAND: The National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) has appealed all dairy cooperatives across the country to take essential measures for continued supply of milk and milk products to avoid panic buying by consumers in view of COVID-19 pandemic.

“In case of any difficulty in maintaining the dairy supply chain, the concerned dairy cooperatives are advised to contact the local authorities,” said NDDB’s chairman Dilip Rath.

Dairy cooperatives were also requested to make suitable arrangements for ensuring uninterrupted collection, chilling, transportation and processing of milk and availability of fodder in villages.

The lockdown measures announced by the ministry of home affairs, government of India may dry up majority of income sources for the people in rural areas, he said.

“Hence, milk business may prove to be the only economic lifeline for millions of rural dairy farmers,” he said.

While commercial and private establishments have been closed down, dairy and milk booths are allowed as essential services.

“Arrangements for animal fodder can also be continued. Cold storage and warehousing services are permitted.

Transportation and other logistics services with respect to the above are also exempted,” Rath added.

My job is of drying clothes, ironing them and folding them up neatly. Our kids take care of cleaning the home and garden. Every member of the house has taken up a responsibility and it’s an amazing feeling to be able to do this together,” said Renu.

Aditya Bhaiyya is a well known interior designer, who now is enjoying maintaining the finished product. “I have been mopping, sweeping and doing dishes and frankly it’s very relaxing. First of all, it’s a great exercise because you are stretching your legs, squatting while sweeping in hard to get places etc. This is a fantastic experience for all of us,” said Bhaiyya.

Homiar Godha, who works in the marketing department of a well-known icecream company, says he’s making the most of his chores. “I got into this on my own and am happy that I am lending a hand to my wife. It’s an exhausting work, which is something I realized now,” said Godha.

Nikhil Bajoria, a businessman in the logistics field said sharing household work is like a blessing. “We are all doing our bit to ensure that the workload does not come on any one person. I do the dishes, sometimes sweeping and mopping, my other family members too pitch in with other things. It’s like a family activity which makes our home beautiful,” said Bajoria.

Well-known brand guru Sanjay Arora says he too is doing his part by making sure that their is less ‘mess’ around. “I ensure that clothes are folded up or that just one glass is used for drinking water throughout the day. These little things add up because it means there is less work to do at the end,” said Arora.

Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health and family welfare), told mediapersons on Wednesday that a total of 1.07 crore Gujaratis were covered under the massive survey.“The survey is quick and is often conducted over the telephone, to ascertain whether there are persons with a history of foreign travel and whether there has been a spike in symptoms associated with Covid-19 in clusters,” said Ravi.“Through the system, we identified 15,468 persons with a history of travel overseas. Of these, about 15 persons had shown symptoms and were provided medical help.”When TOI caught up with health workers in various parts of the city, who are part of the exercise, they said that the quick survey would only work when citizens wholeheartedly supported it.“The majority are forthcoming, but the survey depends on information provided voluntarily. We recently came across a case where a group had travelled to Uttarakhand and Delhi. One of the persons had fever and was put under quarantine. We later learned that four others had similar symptoms, but they were taking medication,” said a health worker. “We reached out to them and made them understand how dangerous this was for their families and friends.”The workers also highlighted the issue of social ostracization by neighbours. A health worker in the western part of the city told TOI that even those in posh localities have faced a change in behaviour of their neighbours as if the condition was their fault. The application of quarantine stickers outside their residences has worked both ways, they added.“There is a need for awareness, not for making the details of those under quarantine public,” a health worker said. “– we requested people not to circulate lists as these are the patients whose samples are sent.

Bhopal: With the beginning of Navratri and with the Sharda temple in Maihar town closed for public to check the spread of Covid-19, the district administration has arranged for online ‘darshan’ of the deity.

Due to current lockdown across the country, Sharda temple has been closed and permission for a fair, which is held in during every Navratri was also cancelled by the district administration. A fair is also held on every ‘amavasya’ in nearby Chitrakoot. However, both the Maihar and Chitrakoot fairs were cancelled by the administration as a precautionary measure to fight against COVID-19.

Keeping in mind the religious sentiments of the devotees during this time, the local administration has, however, arranged for an official online ‘darshan’ of the deity at the Sharda temple since they will not be able to visit the temple. “We allowed it as a measure to ensure that devotees get ‘darshan’ and at the same time there is no crowd at the temple. However, there was a lukewarm response as the official site only saw around 1,000-2,000 visitors, but it is an effort to ensure safety,” sub-divisional magistrate, Maihar, Suresh Agarwal told TOI.

Like all other districts, lockdown has been declared in Maihar, though no positive Coronavirus cases have been found so far in the newly-formed district.

169,['26/03/2020'],Delhi’s lone abattoir at Ghazipur closed,"NEW DELHI: In an unexpected move , the only slaughterhouse of the capital city at Ghazipur has been closed down by East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC).

While the shops selling meat and poultry products have been exempted from the 21-day lockdown announced by the central government to contain novel coronavirus, the municipal corporation has reasoned that the closure is in public interest. Meat merchant associations have, meanwhile, claimed that the authorities did not consult them. The decision to shut down the abattoir is unfair, they say.

As per the order issued by the deputy director of veterinary services (in-charge) at EDMC, the closure will remain in effect till further orders. The order issued on Wednesday states that “in-view of the ongoing steps to control, contain and eliminate the Covid-19 pandemic in compliance with the guidelines issued to restrict proximity of human involvement, it has been decided to close the Ghazipur slaughterhouse till further order in public interest.”

The order, however, clarifies that the animal rendering plant of Ghazipur—which processes animal carcasses found in the city—will remain operational because it has to scientifically dispose off the fallen animals. Ghazipur — the only functional slaughterhouse complex in the capital — processes over 5,000 cattle in a single shift under normal circumstances. A senior EDMC official said, “Since there is no movement of people and animals to the premises, the facility at the plant cannot be operated. There is no supply of animals, so there is no point in keeping it open.”

However, Md Arshad Quraishi, Delhi meat merchant association head, said that the claim that no animals were being supplied was not accurate. “There are still some animals left in the animal market near the slaughterhouse.”

NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Wednesday fed over 300 homeless and those living on footpath after bringing them to its five shelter homes across the city. The meals are being provided twice a day free of cost under the Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana due to the ongoing lockdown.

Under the central government scheme, a nominal fee is charged for a thali but because of the prevailing situation the NMC is serving the khichadi, sabzi, dal, rice and chapati for free.

Preventing any possible spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19), the inmates are asked to sit at a distance of 3 feet during the meal. Before entering the shelter homes, the inmates were shown how to wash their hands properly, a practice which is now followed regularly during the day.

They have also been asked to stay indoors at the shelter homes for the next one month as part of the preventive measures undertaken by the city administration.

The shelter homes are at Hansapuri Primary School in Timki-Bhankheda, Buty Girls’ School in Sitabuldi, Guru Gansidas Samaj Bhavan at Dipty Signal, NMC library and samaj bhavan at Nara Road, and near Tekdi Mandir under railway station flyover. All of them were sanitized.

Deputy municipal commissioner Ranjana Lade told TOI that the NMC has tied up with NGOs who are helping creating awareness among the inmates about social distancing which is needed at the moment. “The drive of shifting homeless is underway 24X7. They are arriving in batches. We are ready to feed all homeless at our shelters. We are targeting any number but all will be fed till the lockdown is in force,” she said.

New Delhi: Amid growing threat from the novel coronavirus, India and China on Tuesday discussed cooperation to jointly fight the pandemic which has killed more than 17,000 worldwide.

Foreign minister S Jaishankar said in a tweet that he and his counterpart Wang Yi discussed working together and agreed to build further on bilateral efforts. The two also spoke about the upcoming G20 summit.

India had earlier sent a planeload of relief supplies to coronavirus-hit Hubei province as a mark of solidarity with China. Providing more details of the conversation, Chinese ambassador to India Sun Weidong said on Twitter that the two ministers expressed sympathy and solidarity with India in its fight against Covid-19 and that China was ready to share its experience, provide assistance within its capacity and ""open its channel for procurement to India"".

Significantly, as the US and China spar over the origin of Covid-19, Sun tweeted that Wang said in his conversation with Jaishankar that ""it’s not acceptable and detrimental to international cooperation to label the virus and stigmatise China, hope India opposes such narrow mindset"".

""Jaishankar agreed not to label the virus and the international community should send strong signal of solidarity,"" Sun said.

There was no official response from India to Sun’s comments.

""Wang Yi said we are confident that India can handle and win the battle against Covid-19. China and India should support each other, and jointly safeguard global public health. Jaishankar thanked China for its sympathy message and assistance of medical materials to India,"" Sun said.

Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the virus cases were first detected in December last year, on Monday reported one new confirmed case of Covid-19 after reporting zero cases for five consecutive days. On Tuesday, China announced that it will lift the three-month lockdown on more than 50 million people in the Hubei province, the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus outbreak, on Wednesday as Covid-19 had begun to abate.

Chanawala is associated with a group named ‘Genuine Help’.

HYDERABAD: With many motorists violating the 3-km commute cap set by authorities, the Telangana police on Wednesday decided to use Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) to crack down on those in the wrong from Thursday.

By assessing the movement of motorists through CCTV footage from various junctions in Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda, police will calculate the distance travelled by each motorist using AI. “As of now, there are 250 junctions, where automatic number plate readers (ANPR) are set up. Using ANPR and AI, violators will be identified. The system will automatically record the distance travelled by motorists. ANPR will capture all vehicle details at every given junction,” sources in the office of the director general of police told TOI.

AHMEDABAD: The city police on Tuesday booked a 23-year-old grocer under charges of spreading infectious disease, invoking the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The grocer had not made hand sanitizer available for his customers and thus increased the chances of coronavirus infection.

A team of Vejalpur police was patrolling the Juhapura area to ensure complete lockdown. The cops found a few grocery shops open in the area. Though grocery shops can remain open to supply essential commodities, shopkeepers must make their customers to maintain social distancing, said a cop who was part of the Vejalpur police team.

“When the cops reached Amiraj Traders near Famous Bakery at Juhapura crossroads, they found that owner had not made hand sanitizer available for his customers,” said inspector L D Odedara of Vejalpur police. He said that the trader, Renish Kothia, a resident of Juhapura, did not give a satisfactory explanation.

193,['26/03/2020'],Mumbai police chalk out novel ideas for safe distance between shoppers,"MUMBAI: City police came up with innovative ideas on Wednesday to prevent overcrowding of public spaces by Mumbaikars rushing out to stock up on essential items such as groceries, vegetables and medicines. Two of the ideas were successfully implemented. One, marking of square or round outlines with chalk outside shops and in vegetable markets for shoppers to stand in at a distance from each other and avoid getting infected while moving in queues. Two, in the western suburbs, police have pasted notices outside grocery stores asking customers to jot down lists of essential items with their names, addresses and phone numbers and hand them over to the shopkeepers without crowding shops.Additional commissioner of police (west region) Manoj Sharma said the ideas were the brainchild of Zone-X deputy commissioner of police Ankit Goyal to enforce social distancing after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day lockdown on Tuesday.“The ideas have helped us gain the confidence of people who have now overcome their fear of a shortage of essential commodities. They have also understood the importance of social distancing and maintaining peace. They can buy what they need without risking their lives,” said Goyal.Some of the shops in Jogeshwari (East), MIDC, Andheri and Powai had notices pasted outside that read: “Please leave your list of items in the basket with name, address and contact no. You may collect your items from the store after 2 hours. No crowding the store please. Help us to serve you better.”Premjibhai, owner of Spain Enterprises (Daily Needs) on Military Road in Andheri (East), told TOI: “Customers left their lists in a basket. After packing the orders, we called them and asked them to collect the items. This helped in not just social distancing but also in running our business without any hurdles, all thanks to the police.”Marol’s Pramod Chavan told TOI: “Customers are made to stand inside circle or square markings in queues. Wherever there is a space constraint, people have been asked to place their orders and are called once the order is ready.”Juhu’s Rahul Singh said several grocery stores have begun to give out token numbers and asking people to turn up at a specific time to collect their orders. “Hats off to the police who in coordination with shop owners have worked out plans to curb crowding,” he said.People waited patiently inside shapes drawn outside shops in Vile Parle, Kherwadi, Bandra-Kurla Complex and elsewhere too. Antop Hill police senior inspector Prashant Raje and staff said this idea should be replicated everywhere.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74820093,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-287438,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/police-chalk-out-novel-ideas-for-safe-distance-between-shoppers/articleshow/74819033.cms

He said that the social media cell’s intention behind the move was to achieve through a friendly approach the same goal that their colleagues on the field were trying to achieve through stern measures. Having a huge following of 1.4 million, if they succeeded in keeping at least half of them at homes, it would make a huge difference on the streets.

“However, we tried to reply to maximum queries possible, regardless how silly many of them were”, the officer said. Serious queries were received too. Most of them were from Keralites trapped in other states and were unable to return home owing to restrictions as part of the nationwide lockdown. There were several messages that touched the cops. They were from expatriates who did not have any means to reach their families.

For the purpose, a list of daily wagers has also been sought from the department of labour.“So far, we have transferred Rs 1,000 in accounts of 13,600 daily wage workers. To ensure aid to more such people, we have directed the banks to work for two additional hours,” Dehradun DM Ashish Kumar Srivastava told TOI.The move comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to nation, announced that daily wagers who are Jan Dhan account holders can be assisted with Rs 1,000 so that they don’t suffer much during lockdown DM Srivastava added that those workers who are not registered with the department of labour are being provided with food packets.In Nainital district, hundreds of daily wage workers coming from neighbouring Uttar Pradesh as well as states like Bihar and Jharkhand have become stranded due to the lockdown. “I want to go to my village in Darbhanga (Bihar) but all trains have been cancelled. I don’t have the means to survive for the next three weeks,” said Ram Charan Singh, a daily wage labourer.The district administration has said that though no arrangement has yet been made to send these labourers back home, efforts are being made to provide them with essentials.

Comorbidity is the presence of one or more additional conditions co-occurring with a primary condition. Information is mainly collected regarding aged people, palliative patients and those with various other diseases.Database of health department, local bodies and social welfare pension are being mapped for this purpose. In addition to this, ground-level surveillance teams, which are deployed to monitor persons under home quarantine, are collecting data from households regarding elderly persons in the family or those with various ailments.“We are taking steps to prevent a possible infection to those with co-morbid conditions from persons with travel history to Covid-19-affected countries. Primary and secondary contacts are being included under this data collection process to find out if anyone in their family comes under the vulnerable group,” said an official.Early collection of data will enable both the district administration and health wing to be prepared to deal with further spread of the disease. If necessary, reverse quarantine is being considered for such persons, especially aged persons and those who are under palliative care. Home quarantine will be extended to these sections as well, if found necessary. As of now, health officials estimate that precautionary action may be taken for 92 persons in the district.Every local body in the district maintains database of beneficiaries receiving old-age pension. Data regarding persons with underlying medical conditions are obtained through health department.The risk communication guidance prepared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in a situation report cites that two groups of people are at a higher risk of getting severe Covid-19 disease. These are older people (that is people over 60 years old); and those with underlying medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer). The risk of severe disease gradually increases with age starting from around 40 years.WHO has issued advice for these two groups and for community support to ensure that they are protected from Covid-19 without being isolated, stigmatized, left in a position of increased vulnerability or unable to access basic provisions and social care. This advice covers factors including receiving visitors, planning for supplies of medication and food, going out safely in public and staying connected with others through phone calls or other means. It is essential that these groups are supported by their communities during Covid-19 outbreak, WHO notes in the situation report.",thiruvananthapuram,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/health-team-initiates-steps-to-guard-vulnerable-sections/articleshow/74817533.cms

Vadodara: The cops have begun cracking down on citizens venturing out of their homes during the lockdown and earning wrath of some people. But amid the crisis, police is also extending help to the homeless who have nowhere to go. They have begun distributing food and water to the footpath and slum-dwellers across the city.

After the state government announced lockdown two days ago, the police department began reaching out to the poor. “Those having homes and jobs can survive under the lockdown but these homeless people have nowhere to go. Many of them don’t even earn and with shops closed down and people off the roads, they won’t get any food,” said a police official.

Footpath dwellers in Sayajigunj, Soma Talav area, Karelibaug, Makarpura and other areas were given food and water by the police as well as traffic cops. While the daily wage workers and handicapped persons were given food packets.

The cops, though, didn’t just stop helping fellow humans. Several teams of policemen fed stray dogs with biscuits and offered grass to cows in different areas. Even pigeons were fed with grains near Bird Circle by some cops.

“We are ensuring that even homeless people stay safe and don’t suffer due to the lockdown. Some organizations have come forward to help us in this drive,” the police said. On Wednesday, some good Samaritans were seen offering food and other help to the needy amid the lockdown. The cops are allowing them to move around on humanitarian grounds.

Casual labourers, who were stuck in the city for the want of transport, were helped by the cops to reach their villages in Panchmahals and Dahod.

214,['26/03/2020'],"Amid row, govt steps back on age relaxation for EWS quota","Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a sharp about-face, the government has officially withdrawn its proposal to relax the limit on eligibility age and attempts in public employment for upper caste candidates under the 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections. The proposal was moved in the form of a cabinet note by the social justice ministry and was expected to be cleared swiftly but political rethink seems to have scuppered it for now.

R Subrahmanyam, ecretary for social justice and empowerment, told TOI, “The cabinet note has been withdrawn for now. It requires more detailed examination.”

The proposal stated that the age limit for eligibility in public employment and education should be relaxed by three years for EWS individuals, at par with the benefit available to the OBCs under the 27% Mandal quotas. The proposal was circulated to all the ministries for their comments amid indications from the social justice ministry that it would be cleared at the earliest.

This is the first public announcement on change of stance on the controversial proposal which was first rebuffed by the department of personnel and training last August, only to be moved again with gusto by the social justice ministry this February, amid intense lobbying by the interested upper caste groups.

While there is no indication on the reason behind the withdrawal of note, the rethink appears to be rooted in the controversy generated by the wide belief that EWS category was being given the relaxation just to put them at par with OBCs without the sufficient grounds which originally resulted in this benefit to the backward castes as well as to SCs and STs.

A government insider said the proposal has not been junked for good while pointing to “political reasons” which have put it on hold for now.

As reported by TOI on August 5, 2019, DoPT minister Jitendra Singh had reacted negatively to the proposal by arguing that “in the past, the question of age relaxation has been decided only after observing the impact of reservation policy, ie, whether the required number of persons from that particular category are getting inducted in the services reserved for them”.

It implied that age concession is given only if the beneficiary group of a particular quota regime is unable to compete and succeed within the laid down eligibility norms of age.

Given the argument, relaxation under the EWS was seen as unlikely because economically weaker upper castes are assumed to be competitive. This is unlike Dalits and backwards who, because of historical social handicap, are unable to compete under a lower age bar. The shortfall noticed during earlier years of SC/ST/OBC quotas led to their being given the age rebate.

In his response, Singh had pointed out that age relaxation for OBCs came three years after the Mandal quotas were implemented while it was longer in case of SCs and STs.

For the first time, all temples remained shut in the state during the festival forcing people to perform pujas within the confine of their homes. Shila Mata temple in Amber , Karni Mata temple Bikaner, Jwala Mata temple in Jobner and other famous temples of goddess Durga have been closed down for the safety of people.Priest of Shila Mata temple Banwari Sharma said the puja will be organised in the temple but people are not allowed inside. “It is in the interest of the people to avoid spreading the disease. Priests of the temple will follow all the rituals while maintaining distance in the temple itself but the public will not be allowed. In my knowledge, I have never seen the spread of such a deadly disease,” said Banwari.People are trying to keep the festival low-key this time. Nirmala Sharma, a resident of Raja Park said, this is the first time she is staying indoors during Navratra. “Temples are shut so it will be better for everyone to celebrate at home. We have decorated a small temple at home for the goddess. This is safe and secure,” said Nirmala.Unlike last year, when shops were all decked up with pooja items, people are preferring hand-stitched clothes for the goddess this year. “I had purchased the pooja items in advance. But many are now stitching dresses and chunari (stoll) for the goddess at home. In my colony, people are borrowing some items from the neighbours for pooja.

Coordinators from the weekly farmers’ markets said over 400 farmers’ groups had expressed their willingness to suply produces to the cities every since the weekly markets they used to hold had been stopped because of the restrictions. The markets were held at over 50 places in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad to supply vegetables and fruits.

A coordinator said, “A new concept is being explored to deliver packets of vegetables to housing societies. This could be bulk supply for the entire society. Preliminary discussions were held in the last two days. Soon a plan is expected to be out. To streamline the functioning, the farmers’ groups will be attached to municipal wards so they will have specific areas to cover. There may not be an open market. The groups will only deliver packets.”

Another coordinator said options were being explored where the housing societies could register their demands over call or through an online system. This would also help the administration and farmers’ groups to maintain accounts. While the administrative part will be dealt by authorities the farmers’ group will look into the supply of vegetables. A PMC official said the administration will provide assistance in terms of infrastructure and space for packaging of vegetables.

Possibilities were also being explored to decentralize distribution of vegetables and fruits in the city, where the wholesalers will supply farm produces to local retailers in every ward, another coordinator said.

Anxiety , depression and fear are some of the most common symptoms that require attention, says Dr Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences. “For the generation in existence, this is the first such experience of a global pandemic.

Revenue and police teams have to ensure that essential items are supplied to housing societies or at some select points for the individuals to collect them without crowding. The 21-day lockdown is a long period and we have to ensure that there is a smooth flow of the supplies,” he told TOI.On Wednesday, the Uttar Pradesh government announced using over 10,000 vehicles for delivery of essential products such as vegetables, milk and medicines for he people to prevent them during the 21-day lockdown period.“We have reached out to every district in the state and are working on a plan. We have mobilised the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) markets, farmers, local hawkers and grocery shop owners to streamline the supply system. In Mumbai, a list has been drawn out of grocery stores and chains supplying services at people’s doorstep. The model can be replicated in all areas,” Bhujbal said.The food and civil supplies minister said he has urged his home department counterpart, Anil Deshmukh, to go easy on people stepping out of home to buy essential items with the state being in the lockdown mode in the time of Covid-19.“I have told the home minister that action is essential to prevent people from movement. If two persons are stepping out to buy grocery or other essential items, police can send back one home. If this is not followed, a penalty of Rs20,000 can be slapped on the offender. But one person going to get the essential supply should not be manhandled or beaten up,” Bhujbal said.The revised order issued by the chief secretary stated that plying of private vehicles should be restricted only to the extent of procuring essential commodities, health services and activities permitted under the directive. The order added only two persons, besides the driver, in a car should be allowed in cases of essential services.All ration card holders would get items from the fair price shops and supply of grain would be uninterrupted for two months. “We are urging people and traders to not hoard grains or pulses. If they do so, they will face action under the Essential Commodity Act,” the minister said.He added that ever since the nationwide lockdown was announced on Tuesday, he has been speaking to his officials and departments to streamline supply of essential items. “Everything will be in place within two-three days,” Bhujbal said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74821602,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-276983,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bhujbal-for-doorstep-delivery-of-essential-items-during-21-day-cap/articleshow/74819105.cms

The total number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi now stands at 35.The five new cases on Wednesday include two residents of Sainik Farms — not connected to the woman — with travel history to Brazil and London, respectively.According to a Delhi government official, eight cases in the city are so far linked to the Saudi Arabia-returned woman, excluding her. The latest additions are the wife and the daughter of the mohalla clinic doctor who examined her on March 12 and a relative of the woman’s brother who picked her up from the IGI airport on her return to India.The woman, Delhi’s case number 10, was diagnosed positive on March 17. Three days later, her brother and mother tested positive, and on March 21, her two daughters. The mohalla clinic doctor tested positive the next day.All of them are in stable condition in hospitals, a source said. On Tuesday, the doctor was shifted to the Safdarjung Hospital ICU from Guru Tegh Bahadur (GTB) Hospital after developing respiratory distress but has since been kept in an isolation ward.Since March 12, the doctor had seen several patients at the mohalla clinic. On Wednesday, the subdivisional magistrate of Shahdara directed that all those who had visited the clinic in Maujpur’s Mohanpuri between March 12 and 18 should home-quarantine themselves for 15 days.A district health official also said 74 people living in the neighbourhood of the Saudi Arabia-returned woman are under surveillance. “After the woman tested positive, we immediately asked her family for the names and addresses of the people who had visited them since March 10, the date of her return,” a health official said. “They weren’t cooperative, so we had to seek local police’s help to get information. We also used footage from the CCTV cameras installed near their home to identify some people who needed to be put under surveillance,” he added.The woman’s brother and mother live in Jahangirpuri.

227,['26/03/2020'],Nagpur: Some goods run short as buyers store up and supply falters,"The streets were deserted, but people could still be seen at grocery shops or vegetable stalls that were open ... Read More

NAGPUR: The streets were deserted, but people could still be seen at grocery shops or vegetable stalls that were open for limited period. As the district administration is trying to ensure adequate supplies amid increased buying due to the lockdown, traders had a mixed reaction.

Bulk dealers in grain said there was no shortage as they had received orders to keep their establishments open.

However, dealers in grocery that include a whole gamut of food products other than grains said there was shortage of packaged items and other fast moving consumer goods (FMCG). Transportation has been hit due to the lockdown. Even supply of wheat has been hit because curfew has brought trucks to a standstill, said a trader.

Dairy plants that have managed to meet the demand of milk so far are also facing hassles, said sources in the industry. Vegetable wholesalers at the agriculture produce market committee’s (APMC) at Kalamna will remain shut till Monday. Other shops at Kalamna are also closed till Friday. Traders who have shut down said they had already pumped in enough supply to retail markets to last till they reopen.

Bulk dealers in fruits decided to close the business during the entire lockdown period because supplies from other states have been held up. Closure of resautrants which are major buyers of fruits has also led to a significant drop in the demand, prompting the traders to close.

Officials of the oil companies said they were already geared up to meet any hike in demand for cooking gas and the bottling plants can work overtime too.

Secretary of Itwari Grain and Seeds Merchants Association said after a meeting with the district administration officials it was decided that the grain traders’ shops in Itwari and Kalamna will be open. Even the labour engaged for loading and unloading have been issued passes to move out during the curfew, he said.

Prabhakar Deshmukh, president of Nagpur Chillar Kirana Vyapari Sangh, said even as there was enough supply of rice and pulses the traders had not been able to replenish their stock of wheat which comes from Madhya Pradesh. This has led to a slight shortage of wheat flour also. A whole gamut of branded packaged food and cosmetics are also not available from bulk dealers due to restrictions on transport, he said.

Nandkishore Gaur, who heads the vegetable traders’ association at Kalamna, said the traders want to close down as they were more susepctible to infection because of a large number of persons coming to Kalamna. “Those at market places have to interact with hundreds of persons which increases the risk of infection. I had plans to shut down for more than six days but due to officials’ insistence, the shops will open on Tuesday,” said Gaur.

Shyam Laddhad, who heads Amul’s plant at Nagpur, said procurement of milk had gone up during this period. This may be because other buyers are not there due to the shut down. “The distributors are facing troubles in moving around. They should be given permission by the police,” he said.

Ajay Kumar Upadhyaya of Dinshaw’s Dairy said the company had witnessed a major reduction in demand due to shops closing down. “Workers are finding it difficult to reach the plant. Not only this, some workers are not able to return home after finishing their shift,” he said.

Officials of the three oil companies- Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL), said the demand for cooking gas has been more or less stable. “All the gas agencies have been issued instructions to carry out home deliveries of cylinders which is being followed too,” said a source in BPCL, which is also the state level coordinator among the three oil marketing companies.

“Mass SMSes have been sent to the consumers intimating that they can book a second cylinder too during this period. This means one can have two filled cylinders at a time these days,” said an official in HPCL. There has been a hike of around 2% in the demand due to the situation which will be easily met. The official in IOC said even as there is no increase in demand, any spike will be met easily. The three companies supply 25-30,000 cylinders each throughout Vidarbha region daily.

Rajesh Chabrani, a former director of APMC and fruit dealer, said there was no sense for bulk traders to stock fruits because the trade channels down the line are closed.

‘Drivers should have IDs and essential commodities label’

Director general of police (DGP) has appealed to all the associations engaged in transportation of essential commodities and providing essential services to ask truck drivers to carry their identity cards and display a placard of essential commodity/service on their vehicles.

Police have given instructions time and again to all the personnel on the field to facilitate movement of these vehicles and persons. Despite this if there is any inconvenience then it may be reported to 100 number which is working directly under the commissioner of police or superintendent of police.

In case the issue is not resolved, the person may contact the state police control room any time on +912222026636 or +912222822631. Manoj Patil, SP of state control room, will be available on 9075080344.

228,['26/03/2020'],Delhi Coronavirus News: Crowding at shelters for food a cause for concern,"Free lunch and dinner will continue till the capital is under lockdown

NEW DELHI: City’s night shelters have turned into the biggest centres of community food with a large number of homeless and the poor converging to have food during the lockdown. Officials said at least 16,000 people were offered both lunch and dinner at the city’s 220 night shelters on Wednesday.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had last week announced free lunch and dinner for anyone who was willing to eat at the night shelters. The services started on Sunday and will continue till the time the city is under lockdown.

Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) has roped in shelter management agencies to augment its capacity and provide food to everyone coming to the shelters. “Every day, we cook food for 40 per cent more people than the total count of those who consumed the previous day. Our priority is to ensure that no one is left hungry,” DUSIB member-expert Bipin Rai said.

The number of those coming to the shelters during the daytime has increased to at least three times since the government has started the free food facility. The beneficiaries mostly include migrant labourers, construction workers, helpers and cleaners at shops and small factories. With most of the gurdwaras and temples either closed to public or not offering food, these poor people are left with no place except the night shelters to get food.

“Thousands have collected at shelter homes where Delhi govt has directed cooked food be provided. Overcrowded, overwhelmed- shelters don’t have adequate ration & infrastructure. Govt needs to ensure cooked food distribution at all anganwadis & govt schools also,” Anjali Bharadwaj of Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Manch tweeted.

However, crowding at night shelters threatens to demolish the idea behind the lockdown. TOI learnt that crowds reached shelters near Nigambodh Ghat cremation grounds on Tuesday resulting in a somewhat unwieldy situation and reports of large number of people reaching other shelters in areas like Jama Masjid, Sarai kale Khan to seek food also came in on Wednesday. Things are expected to get worse, say social activists.

By Wednesday evening, it was evident that thousands of people are struggling with hunger amid lockdown.

The plan involving community organisations, including gurdwaras and temples, can probably provide a sustainable solution to prevent large crowds from gathering at one place, said an activist.

Rai said the government’s top priority was to provide food to the hungry. “But we are exploring options on how to maintain social distancing. We are working out a plan and hope to roll it out on Thursday,” the DUSIB member-expert said.

Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Manch on Wednesday wrote to CM Arvind Kejriwal demanding emergency measures to ensure access to food to all and prevent starvation deaths during the Covid-19 crisis.

HYDERABAD: As many as six rabbits and eight birds were rescued from a closed pet shop in Narayanaguda on Wednesday. The incident came to light after a twitter user tagged municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao asking him to help the animals locked up in pet shops without food and water after the government announced ‘janata curfew’ in the state on Sunday.

Posting a video of one such pet shop, Mayura @redearthz tweeted, “@KTRTRS sir, could you kindly look into petshops in Hyderabad that are locked with pets inside with no ventilation and water. This is one such pet shop in Narayanguda . Request you to help. (sic)”

Responding to the twitter post, the enforcement vigilance and disaster management (EVDM) wing of GHMC raided the pet shop on Wednesday and rescued the pets.

Sharing pictures of the pet shop owner with the rescued pets on his twitter account, the director, enforcement vigilance and disaster management (EVDM) @Director_EVDM said, “Six rabbits and eight birds have been rescued from the closed pet shop. The owner has agreed to take care of them by shifting them to his residence.”

Meanwhile, senior BJP leader Maneka Gandhi asked people to keep an eye on pet shops as the owners are leaving the animals and birds inside during the lockdown without food or water. She also appealed to the people to call police or write to her office to inform about the same.

“Pet shops are locking up with their animals and birds inside. These will die in two days. If you see a pet shop and hear animals inside call the police or let me know at gandhim@nic.in,” tweeted Maneka Gandhi @Manekagandhibjp.

The former union minister’s remarks came after the government announced complete lockdown in the country amid the Covid-19 crisis.

The lockdown has left restaurants, groceries and other stores short on manpower. Many shops have limited working hours to slots from 7am to 11am and 4pm to 9pm. About 85% of restaurants across the city have stopped home deliveries altogether.

Citizens TOI spoke to said orders placed via food apps were being cancelled. Food delivery firms such as BigBasket also paused deliveries after citing issues with local authorities. Other websites and apps were displaying a limited number of items — with delivery dates as late as April.

“Reach the stores as early as possible if you want something,” said a shopkeeper in Model Colony’s Deep Bungalow Chowk. “We have not been able to secure supplies because transporters have been impacted by traffic curbs.”

The problem has left citizens worried. “I had to rely on volunteer groups to get my elderly parents food. All the delivery apps cancelled my order,” said a US-based woman.

Delivery portal BigBasket told TOI on March 25 it is currently not operational in cities such as Chandigarh, Chennai, Delhi, Ludhiana, Pune and Vizag. “In each of these cities, our operations have been shut down due to severe restrictions on staff and vehicular movement. We have been trying to work with local authorities, but have not gotten necessary help so far,” a statement said.

Sources from the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (PRAHA) said many restaurants — almost 85% — are not finding home deliveries viable. “We hope online delivery of food resumes properly by next week,” the source said.

A Swiggy spokersperson said it is “working with local restaurants to remain operational”. “As per the Prime Minister’s directive, food delivery has been designated under essential services. There has been a short-term impact on volumes, which can be attributed to supply shortage due to temporary closure of many high-volume restaurants in malls and disruptions on ground across certain states.”

A Zomato spokesperson said, “Coordinating with multiple local authorities is has been challenging. Our delivery partners are facing several hurdles across cities. We are communicating with the relevant authorities and hoping these issues are sorted soon.”

231,['26/03/2020'],Helplines to provide citizens key information,"Pune: The civic body and the Smart City Development Corporation have commissioned helplines to assist citizens in seeking medical help and provide information about availability of essential commodities during the 21-day lockdown starting Tuesday.

A Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official said staffers have been deployed at the helpline centre. “The helplines will prove useful, especially for senior citizens and those well versed with the city, to get necessary information,” the official said.

The helplines were operational as a part of the PMC’s disaster management plan. The official said the citizens’ queries would be routed to the departments concerned for prompt replies. “We will give basic information about the functioning of grocery shops and the locations of nearby medical shops and hospitals,” he said.

Some corporators have on their part set up help desks through dedicated WhatsApp numbers and helplines to assist citizens about availability of essential goods and vegetables in their areas.

Amol Balwadkar, chairman of the PMC’s city improvement committee and corporator from the Baner-Balewadi area, has set up a system to reach out to people. He said, “The primary aim is to arrest spreading of wrong information among people”.

Another corporator said he was preparing a list of grocery shops in the area. “We area getting several calls from residents. We now plan to provide the list to them so they can approach nearest shop, vegetable vendor or medical store,” the corporator said. Hadapsar MLA Chetan Tupe said he has told party (NCP) corporators to be present in their respective wards and minimize the citizens’ fears about the 21-day lockdown.

While some thing the RWAs are making unnecessary rules, others argue that strict steps are a must now.Vasant Kunj’s Sushma is one of those who feel that by restricting entry to service providers, people are being exposed to risks by having to leave home and stand in queues at shops. “This will beat the entire purpose of the curfew and heightens the chances of spreading infection,” she said. “No vegetable vendor has been allowed in for four days. Ideally, they should be issued cards and given fixed timings.”At Dwarka, a resident said, “In my society, we’ve not got a newspaper for two days. Initially I was told to collect it from the entry gates in morning, but the deliveries stopped. For other stuff too, one has to go to the entry gate because delivery people are not allowed inside.”M K Gupta, RWA member of S Block, GK-I, disclosed a few residents had wanted newspapers restricted for fear of infections, but the RWA decided absence of information would only create more panic. “Moreover, on an idle day, reading newspaper is the perfect way to get details about things happening in society. So we placed soaps at the entry gate and requested vendors and delivery people to sanitise their hands and wear masks before coming in,” he said.Gated societies argue they are only restricting entry of delivery executives into their complexes while allowing collection at the gates. “The chances of infection are high if common areas are frequently visited by outsiders,” reasoned K Ramamoorthy, president, Aravali Apartments. “We allow newspapers, but restrict other services. For senior citizens, we plan to engage our own in-complex delivery boys to take goods from the gates to their houses.”Another RWA member, Sulbha Gupta of Alaknanda in south Delhi, said it took a lot of effort to sanitise the society area. “People only need to walk to the gate, it’s not an inconvenience,” she said. “We have called vegetable and fruit vendors to the gate at fixed times.”Dwarka resident Kamaljeet Sherawat accepted that societies were being extra cautious but hoped that things would be streamlined soon.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74820127,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-169727,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rwas-residents-locked-in-a-feud/articleshow/74819137.cms

236,['26/03/2020'],Showers add to anguish of working from home,"Pune: The concept of work from home went for a toss for many on Wednesday afternoon when summer showers lashed several parts of the city, interrupting electricity supply.

In theory, techies say, internet speed of 5MB per second is sufficient to seamlessly go about their work in most cases. However, fluctuations in speed combined with electricity outages posed a challenge for hundreds of techies working from home.

“My office has supported me in every way with connection issues and setting up my machine for remote work. The problem is with internet speed that keeps wavering as well as electricity. Since yesterday, it has started raining heavily in Pune, which leads to power cuts. Somehow, the infrastructure does not support even a little bit of downpour. Until now, I have faced three under-one-hour long power cuts,” said Shripad Tak, a techie.

According to IT firms, productivity levels are still at about 50% of the usual seen on a daily basis. However, since this is new on such a large scale, firms are willing to be patient for now. “We know that our staffers are getting used to this and the challenging environment around. Our managers are in touch with their teams. We are sure the productivity will improve in the weeks ahead,” said a senior executive of a Hinjewadi-based IT company.

Employees are also facing the challenge of reducing the number of devices connected to the internet. However, with the entire family, and their varying interests, being together at home makes it more complicated. Besides, people have had trouble reaching out to service providers with their complaints in the wake of the nationwide lockdown.

As per Sandeep Sawarkar, principal general manager for BSNL Pune circle, while internet services are functioning, complaints are coming in daily. “We are getting complaints from citizens and we are registering them through our call centre. Internal systems are also working to resolve issues. There are certain delays in rectification of issues as most of our staff is outsourced.”

With community transmission being the current concern in India, the professor emphasises that high hover distance (localised movement within a neighbourhood) is the most important parameter of the study.“When the population is high, the infection can spread more easily. While there is nothing much we can do about the population of our neighbourhood, we can easily change how much we move around. Seeing how much this impacts the spread of infection, hopefully, will inspire us to restrict our movement,” said Pudi.In the study, the professor tested variables such as population size, hover-distance, travel probability (to different parts of the world), death probability, transmission probability, transmit distance (distance within which the infection can transmit), and duration of the infection (pegged at 15 days in the experiment). Pudi said that the purpose of the simulation is to see the impact of strategies that governments can implement on containing the virus and added that the highly optimised code that can run on any android device.“There is no server in the back-end. It runs directly on the browser. Because of that it is highly scalable and will not slow down even if several people are viewing it at the same time. It has multi-lingual support and currently displays in Hindi, Telugu or English, based on the settings in one’s browser / mobile,” he added.Calling the simulator a basic version with scope to build on and improve further, the professor said that actual data from various websites such as the WHO Covid-19 dashboard, the Johns Hopkins Covid-19 dashboard, and others could be included in the next version.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74820757,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-59009,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/prof-develops-simulator-to-predict-virus-transmission/articleshow/74819251.cms

NEW DELHI: As the nationwide 21-day lockdown to fight the novel coronavirus kicked in on Wednesday, the residents’ welfare associations ( RWAs ) and some inhabitants at several high-end colonies in the capital barred waste-pickers from entering the colony.

Chitra Mukherjee, the head of advocacy and policy at Chintan, which works with the community, said waste-pickers were doing a tough job at this critical time without any support and people should come forward with water and soap near dhalaos, and masks and hand sanitisers for them. “Instead, we are getting these complaints from many areas. This is the time to help, not boycott, them.”

Md. Tariqul, who has been lifting garbage from Defence Colony for the past 10 years, said a RWA member had called and asked him not to come due to the virus scare. “My friends and other workers have also received similar calls.”

Some residents said they had reported the matter to the municipal commissioner and police. “Defence Colony RWA members are asking waste collectors not to come. This will mean over 6,000 people will step out each day in one colony to dump their mixed waste in dhalaos,” pointed out Bhavreen Kandhari, who has approached the authorities. RWA president Ranjeet Singh, however, claimed, “We only stop those categories of people who, as per police, should not come to the colony, such as casual workers and maids.”

At B1A block in southwest Delhi’s Janakpuri, RWA president Navneet Singh Bhambri said two waste-pickers serving over 100 houses had been asked not to come to safeguard the residents.

With several dhalaos closed in many areas, locals are leaving their waste. by drains, which may eventually lead to clogging, said Amit Sharma, a resident of northeast Delhi’s Nand Nagri.

HYDERABAD: People did not let the lockdown dampen their festive spirit on Wednesday. Though celebrated low-key, most families in Hyderabad ushered in the Telugu New Year with Ugadi pachadi.

Savouring the pachadi, which is a mix of six ingredients signifying life’s six emotions and phases, is a tradition on Ugadi day among Telugu families. “There can be no better reminder of the bitter-sweet journey of life than the Ugadi pachadi,” said Lalitha Kumari, a resident of Miyapur.

Teaching her children how to make the recipe with raw mango, jaggery, tamarind, neem flowers, chilli and salt, she said the novel coronavirus pandemic has brought families together. “Since my children were not out playing, they helped me.” Residents, who were confined to their homes, watched the live telecast of Panchanga Sravanam and other rituals performed in Tirumala.

Endowments minister A Indrakaran Reddy along with his family attended the state government’s Ugadi festivities held at the department’s offuce. Srinivas Bellam, a resident of Bhagyanagar Colony in Kukatpally, decorated his house with mango leaves, neem flowers and rangoli. “Ugadi signifies the beginning of Telugu New Year. This is a very auspicious day for Telugu people. I hope the gloom and fear of the virus is replaced with positivity and hope,” Srinivas, who is into facilities management, said.

PUNE: Mahatma Phule Mandai, one of the biggest vegetable markets in the city, has redesigned each stall in a way that customers and vendors deal with each other from a safe distance.

Each stall has been given a designated area, with markings to indicate where the customer must stand, to ease vendors’ operations.

Of the nearly 1,000 vegetable and fruit stalls at the market, only about 100 were functional on Wednesday. “The market will remain open between 7am and noon every day for the next three weeks,” Rajabhau Kasurde, president of Shet Maal Trader Association told TOI.

Kasurde said the city police had redesigned stalls in such a way that there would be at least 3 to 4 feet distance between two persons and the vendor. “We have also decided to appoint our personnel at five gates of the market. They would only allow 10 people to enter the market from one gate. It means, only 50 people can visit the market at a time,” he added.

On Wednesday, the police allowed people to visit the market. However, no vehicles are allowed in the market as of now. “We will to keep a tab on vendor activity as there is a chance that they would sell vegetables and fruits at high rate,” he said.

The system being followed at Mandai was first introduced by the Talegaon Dabhade Municipal Council (TBMC) two days ago. “We had to close the market for four days to avoid mass gathering here but that was not a prudent solution as people were facing trouble. Then we not only redesigned the stalls but also shifted or relocated vendors to 13 different location across the towns so that people would not come to one place for their purchases,” said TBMC chief officer Dipak Zinjad.

246,['26/03/2020'],"Hyderabad: Shelters at maximum capacity, homeless still at high risk","In Andhra too, homeless are left in the lurch due to a lack of shleters

HYDERABAD: The homeless across the city are at a higher risk of contracting coronavirus with only 12 functioning shelter homes here. According to GHMC, there is a dire need for an action plan to be charted out for the homeless amid the lockdown.

“Local corporators and MLAs have to step up and coordinate with GHMC, health, police and revenue departments to identify the homeless first. Currently, there is no action plan for the homeless, but they are the most vulnerable and exposed to the virus,” said an official.

While there are 12 working shelter homes with nearly 600 beds, they have reached their capacity. “Although each shelter home has been given 100 sanitizers, 1,000 masks and ration for over a month, there are still thousands of people, including migrant labourers, who are trying to travel to their homes. Some are even living with acquaintances in slums,” added the official.

The official said that community centres and educational institutions which are currently closed can be utilised to accommodate the homeless after sanitizing the space. “They will also have to be provided with ration but until now, no plan has been made,” said the official.

The private shelters also seem to be helpless as the homeless will need to be screened before being taken in. “The authorities can collaborate with NGOs. People can be sent to the care of shelter homes, but only after being screened. We cannot put the existing inmates at risk,” said George Rakesh Babu, from Good Samaritan’s India and the international human rights organisation director for elderly welfare and homeless.

The 21-day nationwide lockdown is especially scary for those on the streets. “We live on the streets, what precautions can we take? Neither we can go back home, nor sleep outside. I am scared but there is nothing much we can do,” said Mohammed, who came to the city from Odisha.

According to GHMC commissioner, Lokesh Kumar, the department plans to collaborate with 93 NGOs to give shelter to the homeless during the lockdown. “There are around 2,600 homeless who were previously identified, but the number is expected to have increased given the current situation. The 93 NGOs working with GHMC will be asked to accommodate the homeless,” said Lokesh Kumar.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74820119,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-543288,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shelters-at-max-capacity-homeless-still-at-high-risk/articleshow/74819278.cms

The rush has led to the shortage of the drug.HCQ is an anti-malarial drug and is supposed to be sold only on prescription. Yet many managed to get it over-the-counter. “This panic buying has resulted in a shortage of the drug for medical professionals and now the health authorities have issued clear orders for supply of the drug only to health facilities,” said Dr Ravi Shankar, a senior cardiologist.“This drug should not be taken without a doctor’s advice. It can be especially fatal if taken by people with heart diseases. Side effects include QT prolongation in EGC, leading to a sudden death. We have come to know that people are randomly purchasing it and having it thinking that it will work like a vaccine against Covid-19. I strongly advise people not to use it.”Other cities apart from Hyderabad are also witnessing a similar situation, health officials claimed. In fact, the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Drugs Control Department), issued a letter to the All Chemists Association of Delhi, on Wednesday, asking them not to sell the drug to anyone without the prescription of a registered medical practitioner. “Any deviation in this regard by any of the chemists/druggists will be viewed seriously and stringent action as per Drugs & Cosmetics Rules will be initiated against them,” the advisory stated.But while supply of HCQ has been hit, drug supplies say that there is no shortage of regular drugs at the moment. “Right now there is stock, but the problem is distribution, especially to far-off locations...We have requested the police commissioner to allow the staff, distributors and dealers’ movement by showing their ID cards and letters on our letter head,” said Ramesh Chandragupta, president Chemist and Druggist Association, Telangana.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74820126,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-528918,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/only-professionals-can-give-hcq-docs/articleshow/74819242.cms

From adopting a token (or slot) system to inviting a limited number of local vendors inside their apartment complexes, residents have stepped in to avoid overcrowding at in-house supermarkets and grocery stores.These systems have restricted the number of people making purchases at a given time. “All residents have to register on the gated community mobile application for tokens. Only 20 token holders are being allowed to make purchases at a time in an hour,” said Shikha Gupta, a resident of community in Nallagandla . In some areas, residents also helped their neighbours with grocery shopping, to reduce the number of people stepping out.Similarly, all residents stepping out to purchase essentials at a gated community in Manikonda divided slots on first-come-first-serve basis. “There are two shops within the society – a vegetable shop and a grocery store. For both the shops, separate slots are being issued to the residents. Fifteen minutes before our slot, they remind us and ask us to come for shopping,” said Robin Chatterjee, resident of the community. Some communities also collaborated with local vendors to deliver on particular days.The GHMC , on its part, too rolled out unique measures to propagate social distancing. The assistant medical officers of health outlined circles in front of several stores in Serilingampally and Kukatpally circles to earmark spaces for people to stand, at a distance from each other, while waiting for their turn.Apart from helping each other with preventive measures, residents of many colonies in the city also made a concentrated effort to curb rumour-mongering. “There are a lot of conjectures doing the rounds on our apartment WhatsApp group.

HYDERABAD: Seafood exporters from Telugu states have sought financial assistance from the Centre, as demand from Europe, USA and China has taken a serious hit.

“Several small exporters and a few large players have been affected as sales have dropped from more than 100 shipments to 20 shipments now,” a senior official from Seafood Exporters Association of India told TOI.

Exporters from the two Telugu states are afraid they might be penalized if they don’t ship the goods in the given time period. “The government should relax the deadline for shipping. Companies with good presence in Chinese and European markets were impacted as demand has fallen significantly since February,” he added.

The worsening situation due to Covid-19 could hamper the movement of marine consignments to foreign destinations. “The lockdowns have also led to wholesalers and processors declining our products,” said Vishwanath, a seafood exporter from Zaheerabad. The European market has totally cut itself off and there is negligible procurement from the Chinese market. However, representatives of seafood associations said restaurants in China had reopened and that should result in increase in exporters business

255,['26/03/2020'],Summer rain with thunder and hail in some pockets,"Pune: In a 14-hour time block, starting from early Wednesday till 5.30pm, Pune received its first spell of summer rain with thundershowers and hail.

Light rains and thunderstorm began in Pune around 3.30am on Wednesday, followed by sunny skies during the day. The city witnessed its next spell of thundershowers around 2pm on Wednesday, which gave Shivajinagar 1.8mm rain in a few hours. As is with localised thundershower activity, Lohegaon recorded no rainfall on Wednesday.

Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD, Pune, said the thundershowers on Wednesday were localised as some areas received rain while others did not. “A few areas like Kondhwa, NIBM Road witnessed hail activity too. We expect thunder showers to continue on Thursday as well in Pune city with more or less the same intensity as Wednesday,” he said.

“We are working from home and the heavy rain caused a power outage for around an hour and a half. My laptop was charging while I was working and after the power went off, the battery died soon while I was in the middle of something important,” Suresh Kumar, who works in an IT firm and lives in a housing society in the area, told TOI.

It also rained in Bhusari Colony and Bavdhan areas for about 30 minutes in the afternoon. “As soon as it started raining, the power supply went off for some time. Bhosari area also received heavy rain between 3am and 4am on Wednesday, a resident said.

Tuesday’s systems have become less marked but there is a trough at the lower atmospheric level persisting from East Central Arabian Sea to South Madhya Pradesh via South Konkan and South Central Madhya Maharashtra. These systems are dragging moisture from the Arabian Sea.

The trough in the easterlies from north interior Karnataka to East Rajasthan via Madhya Maharashtra is also influencing the weather over Maharashtra, Kashyapi added.

“We expect generally cloudy skies and very light to light rain in Pune on Thursday as well while the rainfall activity is likely to reduce from March 28. But once again, from March 29 for a couple of days there would be generally cloudy skies with a possibility of light rain. These rain spells are expected to recur during the next few days because there is enough moisture over the state,” he said.

Since the temperatures have been increasing, the moisture availability and high temperature are triggering local convective activity in the afternoon.

IMD rainfall data on Wednesday showed that locations like Jalgaon, Solapur and Nashik received trace rainfall while Mahabaleshwar received moderate rainfall at 33mm.

Among IMD’s regular stations in Vidarbha, only Buldhana recorded rain on Wednesday at 9mm.

PUNE: Markets across the city remained closed on the auspicious occasion of Gudi Pawda for the first time in decades.

The festival, which fell on the first day of the national lockdown, was celebrated by families in Pune by hoisting the Gudi and with traditional food.

Kothrud resident Siddharth Date said, “Though Gudi Padwa celebrations were low-key, many families in my area celebrated it with zeal. My mother is not in the city and so my wife and I did all the preparations. When I stepped out to buy fruits and other essentials, I saw the roads were deserted but Gudis had been installed outside several households.”

He added that at their home, they installed a Gudi, and made a sumptuous meal. “I helped my wife with the cooking. She rolled the palak puris and I fried them. As part of Gudi Padwa celebrations, social visits to seek blessings of elders is common, but we refrained from doing so. I believe nobody stepped out for social visits this Gudi Padwa,” Date said.

An obstetrician and gynaecologist from the city, Manasi Naralkar, said, “We had a lovely family meal at home on the occasion of Gudi Padwa, cooked by my mother-in-law, Vidya. My husband helped clean the house for the festivities while I helped in the meal preps and washed the utensils. We also wished our family and friends virtually this year.”

Roads across the city were empty and the shutters of shops were down. An auspicious occasion to purchase gold, valuables, vehicles and white goods, this Gudi Padwa recorded no sales as traders refused to open stores even for the festival. A Dhayari resident Sachin Jadhav said, “It was a strange feeling this year. Empty roads and everything shut. Our prayers this year are for the entire world. We performed a small puja with immediate family on Gudi Padwa and prayed for this outbreak to stop. It was a very different Gudi padwa this year.”

Prominent jeweller Fatehchand Ranka said, “I got several calls and enquiries from Punekars wanting to buy gold today. Many even told me to open the back door of the store so that they could make purchases. However, lives are more precious and I had to turn them down. I requested everyone to make a double purchase during the next festival if it was so important but told them that the shop will not open on Wednesday.”

257,['26/03/2020'],Delhi lockdown: Food delivery chains have too much on plate,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Despite food delivery being one of the services exempted from the lockdown, reports are coming in from across India of kitchens being forced shut, delivery executives being roughed up and colonies denying them entry into residential complexes. Finally on Wednesday, state governments and local police took note. Food delivery outlets and online players spent the day applying for movement passes for their staff and delivery personnel.

Many people in Delhi heaved a sigh of relief because they rely on food delivery for their meals. Arushi Menon, 24, a communications professional living in south Delhi’s Alaknanda, had no stash of groceries at home and was worried when her food provider messaged her that police were not allowing deliveries. “Delivery services are hampered by staff problems or claim they are being stopped by police. Directions on how people like us can cope with the lockdown will be helpful,” Menon said.

Ankit Thukral, an IT professional who moved recently to the city, with his long work hours, does not have the luxury of organising a kitchen at home or hiring a cook. Not fully clear about how long he would be in the capital, he only kept the minimum of provisions at home, managing mostly on food ordered in. “Many of us do not even have gas connections or water filters. We depend on online food and water services,” he said.

Karan Nambiar of Big City Pizzas and Captain Grub said the ban on interstate travelling was deterring his cooks from reporting to work, while Vishal Jindal of Biryani by Kilo said many of his kitchens were not being allowed to run.

A Swiggy spokesperson acknowledged the supply problems caused by the temporary closure of restaurants located in the closed malls. However, the company assured it was working with the authorities to remain operational. Similarly, the spokesperson for Zomato said, “Our delivery partners are facing hurdles in many cities while trying to deliver food, which has been classified as an essential service. We are communicating with the relevant authorities and hoping these issues are sorted soon.”

Samir Modi, founder 24Seven convenience stores, explained his commissaries were closed due to employees fearing for their personal security if they reported for work. “We are working only from 9am to 7pm because of reduced staff and supplies,” Modi said, adding that the chain has applied for permissions to get all the outlets fully operational.

Clarifications from both central and state governments eased many concerns by Wednesday evening. “There are three authorities in Delhi-NCR. One is the central government, the other, Delhi government and third, the RWAs,” sigh a food delivery operator. “While the guidelines of the two governments are now clear, the RWAs have their own laws and this is cause for confusion and panic at times like this.”

PUNE: Truckers from across the country stranded in the state breathed a sigh of relief with the Maharashtra government permitting plying of empty trucks on highways.

The state government has also made arrangements for food and essentials for truckers along the highways. MP Shashi Tharoor recently tweeted to the Maharashtra chief minister’s office about truck drivers from Kerala being held up at Bhiwandi without food, water or toilet facilities.

His tweet mentioned that the drivers were returning home in empty vehicles after delivering fruit and vegetables in Gujarat. He sought instructions from the government to the police to allow the drivers to go to Kerala. “The conditions are poor and police are behaving inhumanly. Please help. The four hours from PM’s speech to #lockdownindia were not enough for truck drivers to drive back from Gujarat to Kerala! Please help,” his tweet read.

Speaking to TOI over the phone from New Delhi, Tharoor said, “I received several forwards containing recorded Whatsapp messages by drivers who were stuck. First, they got held up at the Maharashtra-Gujarat border while returning to Kerala. Later, they were not permitted to move beyond Bhiwandi. They had to park in abandoned quarries without food or water. Since I did not have a direct contact with Maharashtra government, I tweeted about it.”

He said that the Maharashtra government responded immediately. “The CMO called me, but could not reach me. On Wednesday, Aditya (Thackeray) called me to inform that the truckers have moved on,” Tharoor said.

State transport commissioner Shekhar Channe confirmed that the problem had persisted till Tuesday, but it was taken care of by Wednesday. “We have instructed the authorities on the highways to allow movement of trucks. If a trucker has dropped some goods in the state and is going back to his base, he will be allowed. The same holds for trucks which are on move with goods.

260,['26/03/2020'],RTO likely to register major drop in vehicle registration in Pune,"Representative Image

PUNE: The Pune regional transport office (RTO) is likely to record a major drop in registration of new vehicles during the Gudi Padwa period, officials told TOI.

The automobile dealers are also concerned over their stock of BS-IV vehicles which have remained largely unsold due to the Covid-19 scare and lockdown , said officials.

“While we cannot provide the figures as the staff strength at the RTO is minimal and the 21-day lockdown means that exact figures can only be arrived at later. However, the registration of new vehicles has been minimal. The registrations take place through the dealers who have demanded an extension for registration of BS-IV vehicles as their stocks have remained unsold,” an RTO official said.

Virmeet Singh Maini, president, Pune Auto Dealers’ Association, said that the automobile industry, which is already facing a slowdown, is among the worst hit.

“The number of new registration of vehicles has been negligible. The showrooms have been shut down for days altogether. And now with the 21-day lockdown, it will remain the same. Though the BS-VI version of different brands is already out, there have been fewer registrations. The BS-IV stock is still with us. The RTO had said that they will not register the BS-IV vehicles after March 31. But the stocks have not been cleared due to the virus scare and lockdown. The Union government should help us by extending the deadline to at least June or July,” he said.

In 2018, a total of 7,279 vehicles were registered with the Pune RTO during the week leading to Gudi Padwa. In 2019, the figures had dropped to 7,198. In 2017, as many as 5,500 vehicles were registered. In 2019, the RTO had collected a revenue of around Rs33 crore from registrations. The revenue earned in 2018 was Rs31 crore.

The RTO officials said that with fewer registrations taking place during Gudi Padwa, there would be a major drop in revenue.

Abhay Jagtap, a Kondhwa resident, had planned to buy a four- wheeler this year during the festival. “We had decided to go to the showroom last week to book a vehicle and take delivery on Wednesday. However, our plans have now gone for a toss due to the lockdown. So, we have dropped the idea,” he said.

261,['26/03/2020'],"Cops lose cool, Nagpur citizens feel the heat","NAGPUR: Many citizens were at the receiving end of the flying temper of cops enforcing the lockdown on Wednesday, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended the restrictions till April 15 to break the coronavirus chain. Some questioned the harsh attitude at places, which has marred the general appreciation for the police force and their humanitarian effort displayed elsewhere.Guardian minister Nitin Raut, along with divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, city police chief BK Upadhyay and other officials toured various markets in the city on Wednesday, including Kalamna, Jaripatka, Khamla, Gokulpeth and others, following complaints of short supply of essential commodities and disruption of emergency services.“We checked the availability of essential commodities and also emergency services, and are satisfied to find them in place. I have instructed police, civic and district administration to keep tabs on essential commodities and report any short supply immediately,” Raut said. He promised to ensure that no one is deprived of basic needs during the lockdown. “Public is in self-defence mode and situation is under control,” he said.“I have told police to keep a vigil on the colonies and report short supplies immediately. Similarly, the civic administration has been asked to collect information on availability of essential commodities and emergency services through their zonal office. District collector too has been asked to rope in NGOs to supply essential commodities,” he said. Raut said there should be no power cuts or inadequate water supply.The rising heat, with outside temperature touching 35 degree Celsius at noon, apart from Maharashtrian festival of Gudi Padwa , onset of Chaitra Navaratri and Sindhi community’s Cheti Chand has already done half the work of the cops by keeping people in their homes. However, their rising temper at a few places left citizens with a bitter taste. Around 324 violators were detained while six offences were registered related to breach of norms in the backdrop of Covid-19 virus scare.Though cops had begun on a strict note earlier this week, the enforcement had a more moderate approach, allowing unhindered movement of citizens with passes from the police stations a day ago. City police had started issuing passes to citizens for movement in vehicles for genuine reasons, like procuring essential commodities and availing emergency services. On Tuesday, 4,156 passes were distributed from different police stations.Some stray cases of police manhandling citizens were reported on social media too. A man was struck with canes by the cops at Mate Chowk when he was heading to a grocery shop with his father. In another incident, also at Mate Chowk, a man was beaten by cops when he was going to purchase medicines with his father-in-law. In Pachpaoli, citizens also claimed that a police volunteer was found beating citizens with a cane.Another citizen shared an ugly experience of having to cough up Rs300 at Durga Mata Mandir Chowk near Chhaoni to cops to ensure his two-wheeler was not seized. “I was wrong in venturing out without a police pass but that does not mean the police should extort Rs300 from me,” he said.City police chief BJ Upadhyay has asked officers to ensure personnel working on the roads refrain from using more than moderate force on citizens. “I have sought a report from senior PIs against the constables who manhandled citizens on the road. There is an instruction to avoid tough means without reason,” he said.On the other hand, traffic API at Sitabuldi Chowk helped a woman reach Kamptee when she was stranded without vehicles. He ensured that the woman was helped by two other commuters who were heading towards Kamptee. “They ended up travelling triple seat, but I ensured they were not penalized anywhere as it was important for the woman to reach Kamptee without public transport,” he said.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74822796,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-196013,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-lose-cool-citizens-feel-the-heat/articleshow/74819197.cms
262,['26/03/2020'],Vegetable prices soar giving a hard time to consumers,"Thiruvananthapuram: Prices of some of the vegetables in the city nearly doubled in the past two days giving a hard time to consumers.

The price of tomato, which was Rs 30 per kg rose to Rs 60 per kg on Wednesday. Shallots were sold at Rs 80 per kg.

The price of beans also doubled within a week as it hiked from Rs 60 to Rs 120 per kg.

The merchants said that there has been a delay in procurement of vegetables which has resulted in the price rise.

“Usually trucks deliver the items from neighbouring states on a daily basis. The delivery has been halted for two days which now reflects in vegetable prices. Without goods arriving on a regular basis there are chances of further increase in price,” said Chandran, a vegetable vendor at Palayam.

Babu a wholesale dealer said that panic buying by some of the residents also resulted in shortage, which forced merchants to increase the price.

“We tell our customers to purchase only what is required,” said Rajan, another vegetable vendor at Palayam market.

The merchants in Chalai said that prices of only some of the vegetables have risen and once goods movement from the border gets smoothened, the prices would come down.

Owing to lockdown, the shops in Chalai and Palayam market wore a deserted look. However, some of the customers turned up to purchase essential commodities, regardless of the price. “We have to purchase things because there is no other way. I came today to purchase commodities for one week,” said Smitha, a resident of Kumarapuram.

Meanwhile, in a meeting of Thiruvananthapuram and Kanyakumari collectors held at Kovalam here on Wednesday, it was decided that goods transport would not be blocked on Thiruvananthapuram-Kanyakumari border.

Only two persons including driver shall be allowed to travel in goods vehicles.

TRICHY: To stock groceries and essential commodities, people continued to crowd retail outlets and grocery shops in and around the city on Wednesday morning as well. The shops witnessed panic buying on Tuesday as well following Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s call for the 21-day lockdown . In some places police had to ask shop owners to down shutters for a while to disperse the crowd. Panic shopping could not be avoided despite the promises made by the PM and chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami that the supply of essential commodities will not be affected.

A grocery shop owner in Kallukuzhi of Trichy said that people were shopping more than the usual. Since the lockdown is in effect for the next 21 days, they fear shortage of supply and want to stock more food stuff.

“Some of the retailers had to return without buying vegetables from the Gandhi market as the stock was finished in the morning. If the situation continues in the coming days, the prices of vegetables may go up in the coming days,” said the shop owner.

Crowd started thinning by the afternoon following measures taken by the administration by restricting people outdoors. There was a large gathering at Gandhi market on Wednesday. Apart from the whole sale sellers, public too gathered in the market to purchase vegetables.

Asking people to avoid gathering at one place during the lockdown period, Trichy district collector S Sivarasu said that only whole sale sellers with identity cards will be allowed in the Gandhi market. Saying that stringent action will be initiated against people who try to visit Gandhi market for vegetables, he asked people to visit nearby vegetable outlets.

NAGAPATTINAM: The curfew in place from Tuesday evening has halted the movement of tonnes of salt from the salterns in Vedaranyam to various states in the country, as truckers are asked not to operate their vehicles. Saltpan owners say that this would lead to revenue loss worth lakhs of rupees.

To curtail the spread of Covid-19, the state government has imposed a curfew from 6 pm on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on the same say Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced a lockdown until April 14. This has brought the production as well as the movement of tonnes of salt worth several lakhs of rupees to a grinding halt in Vedaranyam in the district. Around 75,000 tonnes of salt, meant to transport across the state and the neighbouring states such as Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh , are lying in the salterns owing to the curfew, saltpan owners said.

Salt is being produced in about 9,000 acres in Vedaranyam, Agasthiyampalli and Kodiyakkarai coast of which nearly 6,000 acres were run by two corporates companies. The remaining 3,000 acres are owned by about 900 individual licensees affiliated to Vedaranyam Small and Medium Scale Salt Producers’ Federation.

Around 2,250 tonnes salt is being produced in 9,000 acres on a daily basis, where around 10,000 people are working. Nearly 5,000 people are benefitted indirectly from the salterns, V Senthil, secretary of the federation, said. “Every day we produce salt worth Rs 17 lakh. However, the entire work has been stalled. Though this is not a peak season for production, but we will face revenue loss to the tune of Rs 17 lakh per day. Moreover, around 75,000 tonnes of salt are kept on the salterns itself, as we are not able to transport it,” Senthil added.

MARGAO: Day one of the sudden 21-day lockdown of the state on Wednesday led to many people being deprived of their daily essentials leading to government facing flak from the citizens for what they called its “poor management skills” in dealing with stemming the spread of the novel coronavirus.Several people that TOI spoke to complained of not getting milk at their regular milk booths, while non-availability of newspapers left many of those relying on the print media for information, clueless about the government’s moves to tackle the crisis.The sudden lockdown has affected not only the marginalised but the affluent as well.“This is absurd. I don’t even have stocks that can last for two days. Though I have been following the updates on television and newspapers, I didn’t imagine this could lead to a lockdown,” Rajesh Sawant (name changed), a property dealer said, indicating that the severe shutdown measures have hit all sections of the society.President of International Human Rights Association (IHRA) – Goa, Navnath Khandeparker, said that the ill-thought-out measures of the state government added to the panic and chaos among the citizens.“The government has no doubt taken several steps to tackle the crisis of this magnitude, but given that government’s resources are limited, the government should have roped in voluntary and non-government organisations to reach out to the needy and vulnerable. How will people be able to survive without essentials? Even the elected representatives don’t seem to have been engaged in the task. The panicky situation that followed the Prime Minister’s address saw people rushing to grocery shops, defeating the very purpose of the intended measures. The government is talking of tomorrow, but people are suffering today, what about them?” Khandeparkar said.Echoing his views, wellknow physician Dr Oscar Rebello warned that the situation could lead to riots if people are unable to procure essential commodities.“Enforcing a lockdown without a system in place to allow people to procure essentials is beyond my imagination. There is no clarity on how people should buy their basic stuff. Making arrangement to facilitate people to purchase essentials should have been priority when such extreme measures are enforced. Grocery stores should have been kept open allowing in five persons at a time, and police should monitor and if people crowd, they have to act,” Rebello said.Principal of CES College, Cuncolim, Sanjay Dessai, said that multiple points of communication added to the confusion. “The task of conveying government’s directions should have been left to the district collectors and the entire district administration — BDOs, mamlatdars, talathis — should have been on the ground along with police, reaching out to people guiding them and reassuring them of all required support,” Dessai said.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74819958,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-138564,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/deprived-of-essentials-goans-slam-governments-management/articleshow/74819962.cms

About three million people from across the globe gather at Mecca.

There is no official communication to the Central Haj Committee from the government of Saudi Arabia. The Central Haj Committee in its latest communication on March 24 extended the last date for payment of second instalment for Haj- 2020. The last date is March 31. The second instalment can be paid along with the third instalment,” Khan added.Maqsood Ahmad Khan, chief executive officer, Haj Committee of India, in a communication to all state Haj committees, said: “Considering the uncertainty and the situation all over the world the declaration of the third instalment will be done after getting confirmation of the Haj and participation of Indians in Haj by Saudi Arabia.”He said Saudi Arabia has not yet decided on Haj-2020. “The latest communication from Saudi authorities has asked Haj operators to not make any new commitments for Haj this year,” he said.The Haj Committee of India has also clarified that the money paid so far by prospective pilgrims is safe and it would refund the amount in case of “any unexpected decision in the future”.About two lakh pilgrims from India, including 5,000 from Telangana, are scheduled to perform Haj this year.

Vadodara: Hundreds of policemen are out on the streets to ensure that people d not expose themselves to the hazards of Coronavirus. However, when it comes to their personal sanitization, very little efforts have been done to keep the police personnel safe. Looking at this, police officials are demanding that police stations too need to be strictly sanitized by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC).

Police are given facemasks and hand sanitizers to protect themselves from contracting the virus. Hand sanitizers have also been provided at every police station, but officials believe that these measures aren’t enough to protect them as they have to spend around 12 hours in the field, meeting different people.

Of the 2,700-strong police force, 90% staff is involved in field duties currently and the remaining 10% staff is handling work at 24 police stations and different branch offices.

“Right now the staff is involved in ensuring that lockdown is made totally effective and nobody comes out of their homes. Some of our colleagues are also involved in social work like feeding the poor people and stray animals — such acts that are doing under extraordinary circumstances,” said a police official.

“At the end of the day, the field staff is expected to come to the police station once before going home. So, the risk of them bringing in infection from outside to the police station, where even citizens come with their complaints, are much more. But the condition of the police stations remain the same,” the aggrieved official added.

Several inspectors, who head their respective police stations, too have voiced their concerns and want the civic body to properly sanitize their police stations too. The police officials have made an informal request regarding this to their higher-ups, but are yet to get a response. “We have already sanitized police lines and will also be taking up sanitization of police stations because that is a very important place. We have already provided hand sanitizers and sprays to all the police stations which the officials are using,” said police commissioner Anupam Singh Gahlaut.

Because of the lockdown, the retailers are finding it difficult to reach the wholesale market.APMC chairman Adil Ahmad Khan said about 2,500 passes were issued on Wednesday to wholesalers, trucks, tempos and local transport vehicles. About 400 identity cards were issued to sanitation and security staff working at Asia’s largest wholesale vegetable and fruit market at Azadpur.“We got complaints of truckers finding it difficult to bring the supplies to Azadpur and to the retail markets. We held a meeting today and decided to issue passes to them.

It is okay if they let the mandis function for just 2-3 days in a week, but they should devise a mechanism so that vegetables and fruits reach the local markets,” Malhotra said.Meanwhile, prices of all commodities started soaring forcing buyers to stock up large quantities.

280,['26/03/2020'],Meat supply stops as NMC closes Nagpur's only abattoir,"A pair of Guineafowl roaming on Kamptee road took residents by surprise on Wednesday

NAGPUR: Though meat, chicken and other non-vegetarian items are considered food and hence permitted to be sold during lockdown, butchers here are unable to cater to the demand as slaughter itself is banned. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has shut down city’s only abattoir in Mominpura.

Traders say even if slaughter is allowed, there is a little chance they may still be able to supply meat. This is because transport of animals for slaughter too has been hampered. As business has come to a standstill, it has led to another problem at Kasabpura pocket in Mominpura where butchers live. The storages are full with dead animals’ hides that were kept for being sold to leather traders who take it to tanneries in Chennai and Kolkata.

Now as everything has come to a standstill, the hides are not being lifted leading to complaint of stench. The butchers, on the other hand, are making desperate calls to the NMC for lifting the hides but in vain, they said. As labourers are not available, the butchers are not in a position to dispose of the hides on their own, said traders here.

Ashok Patil, the in-charge of NMC’s Gandhibagh zone that covers Mominpura, confirmed he had closed the abattoir because meat vending itself has been banned. Resident deputy collector Ravindra Khajanchi said he will look into the matter.

Ateeq Qureshi, a political worker and a resident of Mominpura, said the NMC had stopped the slaughter house itself despite the district administration including meat in exempted list. Butchers are not being allowed to carry out slaughter on their own too. “Now even fodder is in storage for the animals kept for slaughter,” he said. Qureshi pointed out abattoirs are working in neighbouring Chhattisgarh.

Taufiq Qureshi said the entire movement of goats is stopped. Bakra Mandi at Nagpur gets supplies from villages in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh . Chhindwara is one of the major sources, he said. Even local supply has been stopped due to curfew.

Syed Qureshi, a hide trader, said, “the lockdown has left the daily wagers employed at the market facing tough times. As funds have been blocked, even we are not in a position help them.”

Meanwhile, a member poultry farmers’ association here said there are chances sale of chicken may begin as the matter has been taken up with the district administration.

NAGPUR: Gudi Padwa , the Maharashtrian New Year, is believed to bring peace and positivity, and one couldn’t agree more as citizens, currently grounded at home because of the lockdown, celebrated the occasion with utmost zeal and enthusiasm. The festival was celebrated not only with families, but, at some places, also with cops deployed on duty, and sanitation workers working day and night to keep us in safe and clean environment.

Shailesh Jadhav, a cop deployed at Subhash Nagar , missed his Gudi Padwa celebration for the first time as he was on duty. His son performed the puja this year, and Jadhva served the city. “For the first time, I missed being at home for the celebration. But my duty is my priority,” he said.

Residents of Subhash Nagar brought them fasting snacks such as sabudana khichdi since many cops on duty were fasting on the occasion, “We are overwhelmed to see such a nice response from the public. It shows that they trust the cops and have faith in us,” he added.

Sheela Kulkurni also felt extremely cheerful as she made a sweet dish, sheera, for the lady who comes everyday to sweep the road in their residential area. “I celebrated the occasion with my family. Corona has made everything depressing, but we woke up in the morning, wore new clothes and offered prayers to the gudi. I served sweets to the sanitation worker as they are working selflessly for us,” she said.

Ruchika Asatkar, who stays in Mahal area, is also making sure that the cops don’t do duty on an empty stomach, especially on the occasion of new year. She and her mother served them home cooked meal and refreshments as a gesture of gratitude and appreciation. “My mom makes snacks everyday for them around 4pm and we serve them yogurt and butter milk or lemon water. They are taking care of us; hence we are taking care of them,” she said.

Sharing her celebrations at home, Shefali Dudhbade said, “We are following self quarantine and are supporting policemen by showing our full support by staying at home. Instead of moving out to bring the stuff required to perform puja, we gathered everything at home. We celebrated by drawing rangolis, putting up torans, and hoisted Gudi,” she said.

Dr Shwadha Kotpalliwar said, “My family and I pushed away all the negativity of the coronavirus and prayed to the god to bring peace and positivity to the world. We had a small puja in our house and we stand by all the policemen and workers who are day and night tirelessly doing duty for us,” she said.

NAGPUR: A murder accused who drank phenyl at Umred police station is currently admitted at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). He was caught on Monday for the murder of his lover, who had gone missing in August 2018.

The accused identified as Jitesh Kumbhre, 24, is yet to be officially arrested as he drank phenyl in the bathroom of police station after going there on the pretext of using the washroom before his arrest was recorded.

According to police, Aishwarya Chavhan , 19, had an affair with Jitesh, who is married and has a daughter. Aishwarya was pressing him to marry her but he was not willing to leave his wife, who was also upset about her husband’s extramarital affair. On August 6, 2018, Chavhan went missing. Her parents approached Umred police station and filed a complaint.

Cops initially failed to trace Chavhan, so the case turned cold. However, recently API Shital Khobragade took over the case and began scrutinizing call records of Chavhan only to find her in frequent contact with Jitesh.

She probed further and came across a teenager who told them that Kumbhre was with Chavhan on the day she went missing.

Cops later brought Jitesh and his wife for questioning. After questioning the couple separately for hours, the accused spilled the beans. He allegedly confessed before the cops that he strangled Chavhan at his farm and buried her as she was pressing him to marry her.

Cops suspects Jitesh’s wife is also involved in the murder along with some others.

Cops were recording statement of the accused when he asked to go to the toilet. Jitesh went alone inside but did not come out for long, leading policemen to break the door. They found him lying on the floor with the phenyl bottle nearby. He was rushed to GMCH where he is currently under treatment and said to be out of danger.

Cops are trying to trace the location where the accused had buried Chavhan’s body.

Now, state needs to issue similar notification to clear the confusion,” said senior forest officials.Amid the 21-day lockdown, CZA has learnt that many zoos are facing tough time in getting supply of food owing to restrictions under Section 144 and the curfew imposed to contain coronavirus . As slaughter is also banned, getting meat for carnivores in zoos may be hampered.CZA member-secretary SP Yadav said, “In the wake of the crisis, we have asked state governments to include upkeep of animals in zoos and rescue centres under ‘essential services’. We have also asked the chief wildlife wardens to ensure animal health care is not sidetracked.”Even the latest Maharashtra government notification issued on March 25, though has included veterinary hospitals and animal care centres and pet shops under emergency services, it makes no mention of forest and wildlife and zoos.Following the CZA advisory, TOI took stock of the situation at Gorewada Rescue Centre and Maharajbagh Zoo and found that both the captive animal centres are coping with the situation by stocking material.Dr Sunil Bawaskar, Maharajbagh Zoo officer-in-charge, said, “Till March 31, we were prepared. With the extended lockdown till April 14, to fulfil the needs of animals, we are even contemplating to rear over 100 hens in a cage in case the situation worsens following transportation restrictions. Yesterday, one vehicle carrying fodder was detained for an hour. Now, we have issued an emergency certificate to the transporter, which he has pasted on the windscreen so the vehicle is not stopped by the cops.”“We don’t know whether we will get buffalo meat or not. We need 35kg of it to feed tiger and leopards daily. Besides, 350kg green grass & vegetables and 30kg fruits to feed herbivores. The zoo houses over 150 animals. In worse scenario, we may have to cut tree branches and feed the herbivores,” said Dr Bawaskar.The zoo in-charge said at present herbivore feed that will last for four days has been stocked and daily supply is also being receiving. Policemen are cooperating to allow food vehicles and staff too. Zookeepers have been asked to stay put and we have made arrangements so that they do not mix up with people outside,” said Bawaskar.Similarly, Gorewada Rescue Centre, which houses eight tigers, 24 leopards, 10 sloth bears and 40 chitals and nilgais, has also geared up to handle the situation. FDCM divisional manager Nandkishore Kale said, “We have reduced the strength of labourers and those present have been accommodated in the quarters.”“As we have not been included in the essential services, we are stocking non-perishable vegetables like cabbage, lauki (bottle gourd) and fruits like payaya and water melon in an air-conditioned room. We have stock for four days. The contractors, though, have assured supply of buffalo meat, we have flexibility to supply goat meat and chicken,” said Kale.“Stocking of vegetables and fruits is being done as Kalamna Market, major supplier of fruits and vegetables, has also ordered closure for three days.

On Monday, fire department had sanitized homes of those who were tested positive for coronavirus and also other places in their neighbourhood which they might have visited. tnn",vadodara,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sanitization-work-begins-in-all-wards-of-the-city/articleshow/74817646.cms

NAGPUR: Kanchan Sahu is among over 7,000 sanitary workers of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) out to keep the city’s 200sqkm roads clean amid the outbreak of coronavirus Kanchan and her colleagues start work every day at 7am and continue till 2pm. This is their routine throughout the year.But due to the lockdown now, the streets are by and large clean. Even the otherwise garbage-littered streets in commercial areas like Itwari, Sitabuldi etc are relatively clean. “But we have been asked not to avail any leave,” she told TOI. In other words, it means that they are contributing in their own way in fight against coronavirus by giving priority to city’s cleanliness, especially at a time when the entire population is under lockdown and asked to stay indoors.However, the lockdown has increased problems for them. Sanitary workers, especially women, face transportation troubles. Sapna Rai, a sanitary worker, said she cannot drive and with the lockdown in force, reaching her designated place of work has become difficult. “Even my son cannot drop me as police are not allowing any citizen to drive on Nagpur roads. At least during this crisis period, the NMC should provide pick-and-drop facility,” she said.Now, these sanitation workers in Nagpur are living under fear of contracting coronavirus infection in the absence of any protective gear. TOI spotted many workers sweeping the roads without proper masks and hand gloves. Sahu too was cleaning the streets in Jaripatka without any hand gloves or mask.Though sanitary workers are not openly seeking any healthy safety equipment, their leader Kishore Samudre of Maharashtra Pradesh Safai Karmachari Mahasangh demanded face mask, sanitizers and hand gloves for sanitary workers.“There are over 7,000 sanitation workers in Nagpur and they are at the highest risk of infection. They pick up garbage from door to door but the municipal corporation has not provided any safety gear,” Samudre said.Most of the workers, requesting anonymity, said they have neither been given face masks, nor hand gloves and the staff has to lift garbage with bare hands. “If any sanitary worker contracts coronavirus, then the mayor and civic chief will be directly responsible for it,” a miffed Samudre said.Echoing Samudre, independent corporator Abha Pandey expressed anguish over sanitary workers cleaning city’s streets without any safety gear. Pandey said sanitary workers are not aware of the health hazards while handling garbage and clearing the waste.Pandey said she will provide 500 masks to workers cleaning streets in her prabhag in east Nagpur.Leena Budhe, director of Centre for Sustainable Development , said, “I have been telling them (sanitary workers) to adopt simple preventive measures such as use of masks and hand and foot gloves. Usage of these will go a long way in checking various diseases.”The working situation of 1,000-odd employees of both door-to-door garbage lifting firms AG Enviro and BVG India is more grim. Without any hand gloves and masks, they visit almost 6 lakh households across the city and collect garbage. “They too pose a threat to lakhs of residents,” said Budhe. Health committee chairman Virendra Kukreja has assured to look into both the issues at the earliest.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74822424,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-277203,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sans-any-protective-gear-sanitary-staff-keeping-city-clean/articleshow/74819246.cms

He was made to hold a placard saying he is an enemy of the society and his picture was clicked and circulated on social media. Although no legal action was taken against the wedding party, the police claimed that awareness was still lacking among the locals, due to which they had to take such measures.Kashyap Singh Raghave, SHO, Lalgarh said, “We stopped the wedding party, which had five people in a car and questioned them as to why they were organising this event amidst a lockdown. The biggest problem that we are facing is that people themselves are reluctant to follow orders and expect police to take the necessary actions.”The groom was in a car along with five other people and the cops did not arrest him since it was his wedding day, though made to pose him with a photograph which said — ‘I am an enemy of the society and will not sit at home despite being told. I will infect everyone and die myself as well.’While the groom was allowed to attend his wedding, the official added, “The problem is controlling the people who are stepping outside despite the lockdown. We are trying our best by taking measures but the public is not concerned. Though we did not arrest the groom, it was a public message sent out to everyone to follow the law,” added the official.

AHMEDABAD: The city administration and has decided to issue passes to trucks and other vehicles used to supply essential items like vegetables, milk, fruits and other food items, to keep supply chains intact. Top police officials said passes will be issued to such vehicles so the supply of essential items continues on.

City police chief Ashish Bhatia said passes will also be issued to trucks and other vehicles bringing vegetables and other food items to the city. “These passes will be issued by the collector’s office,” Bhatia added.

Top police officials said association members of major fruit and vegetable markets met city police officials and asked for permission to open their markets. “Major markets such as the APMC, Madhavpura Market and Naroda Fruit Market will open from Thursday,” said Bhatia.

More importantly, Bhatia said that major online retailers will also be given permission to home deliver essential items. “We are announcing this through public address systems so the rush seen at provision stores on Tuesday can be curtailed to prevent transmission of the coronavirus,” he added.

To maintain law and order during the lockdown period, one company of SRP and one of RAF have been deployed in the city. “We are ensuring nobody moves on the roads without valid reason. We are not closing shops selling essential items. We have instructed police stations across the city to book those who violate lockdown rules,” said a senior police official.

After Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the lockdown across the country on Tuesday, labourers from Rajasthan who were working in the city tried to go back. As no public transport was available, they started walking back to Rajasthan. City police stopped them, gave them food and water and arranged for private vehicles. “We even informed out counterparts in Rajasthan of their arrival,” said Bhatia.

296,['26/03/2020'],Kolkata: Consumers’ ordeal worsens as e-grocers blame local crackdown,"KOLKATA: Five days after placing an order for atta, edible oil and sugar on an e-grocery app, Sweta Palit, a senior citizen from Maniktala, received a message on Wednesday that her order had been cancelled due to “unforeseen circumstances”. With deliveries getting delayed or cancelled, many online grocery buyers like Palit are facing a tough time. Overburdened e-grocers have blamed it on restrictions imposed by local authorities on the movement of delivery staff and goods and sudden rush in demand.

Although e-grocery biggies — BigBasket, Grofers and Amazon Pantry — contended that they would be offering priority items among the existing orders owing to unprecedented surge in demand, many customers in the state are still counting days to get the deliveries. Like every month, Meera Banerjee, a homemaker in Naktala, was trying to place an order for some essential items like rice and pulses on BigBasket. But, she was told there were no slots available for delivery. “Now, as they have stopped taking orders, I am worried about replenishing my stock,” Banerjee said.

Most e-grocers are in talks with the authorities concerned to find ways for keeping the supply chain going. BigBasket told TOI that better coordination with the state and local police would help smoothen services. “It has to be ensured that our delivery vans and bikes don’t get stopped by police. Some of our delivery partners are getting beaten up by the cops,” said a spokesperson.

Kolkata Police commissioner Anuj Sharma on Wednesday said: “We had a meeting with the e-grocers. We have asked them to continue with their operations. The state government has already issued specific guidelines. There should be no problem in delivery.” Later in the evening, state chief secretary Rajiva Sinha issued a guideline that said e-commerce personnel and delivery boys can move in the state with a letter of authorisation from their employers. It should be endorsed by the local police or SDOs.

Grofers co-founder & CEO Albinder Dhindsa assured that despite a few hiccups, the company was taking every measure to ensure delivery of essential supplies. With a 100% growth in daily gross merchandise value over the last few days, Grofers’ order backlog has touched four lakh.

Paucity of manpower is another aspect troubling the online grocery suppliers. “We need to add bikes, vans, and delivery men to our fleet, and that is a difficult thing to do in a short period of time,” BigBasket clarified.

Amazon Pantry, the e-commerce giant’s grocery section, too, said local restrictions are making it tough for them to keep operations intact. It is currently serving only household staples, healthcare and hygiene products. Spencer’s on Wednesday told its customers that its stores were open for groceries and essential needs, but services may get temporarily disrupted.

297,['26/03/2020'],Kolkata: Fluctuating price graph reflects buying frenzy,"(With inputs from Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey and Monotosh Chakraborty)

KOLKATA: Prices of vegetables, fish and poultry have mirrored the surge in panic among customers, similar to how the Sensex has reacted to PM Narendra Modi’s ‘Janata Curfew’ and then three-week-long lockdown.The city witnessed the first bout of frenzied buying on Friday and Saturday following Modi’s address to the nation on Thursday, in which he urged citizens to observe a curfew on Sunday. Prices of vegetables, fish and egg spiked as demand soared. Some who were aware of the Covid-19 threat looming over India and long-term restrictions in China, South Korea and elsewhere sensed Sunday’s “janata curfew” was just a rehearsal of the inevitable lockdown ahead and stocked up. The rise in demand pushed up prices considerably.The prices had begun to ease on Saturday evening when two announcements on Sunday, one by the Centre on restrictions in 82 districts in the country, including Kolkata, till March 31, and CM Mamata Banerjee’s announcement that the state would enforce the curbs till March 27 and review it before a subsequent decision, saw anxiety among large sections of people, leading to a spectacular rise in prices on Monday morning. Vegetable prices soared by 100%-150%. Fish and egg prices increased by 50% while the hike in chicken price was slightly lower.The following morning though, the markets opened as usual and though grocery stocks had depleted, vegetable, fish and chicken vendors were present with the usual stock and there was no indication that a crisis lay ahead. With prices declining by 35%-40%, some even regretted making bulk purchase at high prices the previous day.But the uneasy calm lasted only a few hours. When Modi announced a more strict lockdown for three weeks, all hell broke lose as people rushed to the nearest market to stock up. In the few hours left to the lockdown, grocery shops were nearly emptied out. But since the announcement came past the hour when perishables like veggies and fish are sold, it was on Wednesday morning that the markets went on fire.Some vegetables like lemon and bottle gourd could not even reach most markets due to restrictions. Whatever else was on offer, was sold at a premium. “There was a mad rush as early as 5am and people started buying everything in huge quantities. No one purchased less than 5kg of potato. Some even wanted to buy a sack (50kg). But we decided to ration it and fixed the upper limit at 5kg,” said Sujit Ghosh, a potato retailer at Behala market.Similar rationing was done by retailers of onion and eggs at Gariahat, Kasba, Lake, Bhowanipore and Maniktala. In several places, the rationing happened after a bit of police advice. In Howrah, the city police notified markets would operate from 5am to 9am to maintain maximum possible social distancing.Despite the steep rates, stocks of most vendors were exhausted by 9am. Many shops marked out how customers should stand with gaps between them to adhere to social distancing norms. Big retail chains regulated the entry of buyers.West Bengal Vendors’ Association president Kamal Dey said retailers had sensed the panic among buyers before they had even started business with many receiving frantic calls from regular customers inquiring when they would reach the market. “The 21-day nationwide lockdown announcement had clearly spooked them though the PM had clearly mentioned that essential commodities were exempt,” said Dey.“The mad rush defies logic. I heard people jostled to buy things. I am once again assuring everyone that there is no reason to panic. There is enough stock of foodgrain and pulses to feed the entire population of the state for the next few months,” said food and civil supplies minister Jyotipriya Mallick. He expects the market to cool down after the CM addressed the issue and assured people of smooth supply. “Those who bought vegetables more than their requirement at a premium will regret when the price starts going down from Thursday,” said Jyoti Guha, secretary, south suburban vendors association.And though price of fish did not jump as much as vegetables, they got emptied out real fast. Ironically, chicken and egg whose prices had crashed following fake messages that claimed one could acquire the dreaded virus by consuming poultry products witnessed the sharpest rise when the lockdown was announced to break the coronavirus chain.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74820490,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-242176,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fluctuating-price-graph-reflects-buying-frenzy/articleshow/74819274.cms

PANAJI: Several people began their day without milk and bread on Wednesday, sending them into panic.

Only pharmacies, medical facilities and petrol pumps were open despite assurances that other daily essentials would be supplied. Some citizens were too afraid to venture out after videos of police lathi charging people went viral.

A mother with a year-old infant living in Aquem ran helter-skelter for cow milk after the tetra pack she used gave her child diarrhoea.

“She couldn’t find milk anywhere. I shared a packet with her. She became emotional with gratitude and cried,” her neighbour told TOI.

“The lockdown is a good initiative, but little more structured planning was needed,” said a woman in Taleigao who tried with little success to help her elderly neighbour access the basics.

At Gandhi market in Margao, people gathered early morning to panic-buy.

“We are hurt because we heeded the government to not go out and buy, and it abruptly notified a lockdown,” a Porvorim resident said.

Many began rushing out of their homes after the PM’s speech on Tuesday night itself. “I rushed to Ponda sabji mandi for vegetables where only one shop was open. From nowhere, two masked men with sticks started hitting around. The scared shop owner begged to leave immediately. I couldn’t pay him. I just rushed back. Does the government want us to starve?” asked NIT Goa professor Sarani Ghoshal, who lives on campus at Farmagudi.

Similarly in Merces, a senior citizen stepped out in search of milk, eggs, rice and vegetables but returned home after he was witness to the police lathi-charging a young man outside his residence.

“People will lose patience in a day or two and rebel on the streets. They said don’t hoard but now those who did not hoard are the ones who are suffering. The CM should intervene immediately. Government representatives aren’t even responding to messages,” a St Andre resident told TOI.

“The government should have given people the opportunity to buy and store. It’s the responsibility of the government to provide required food grains,” he added.

Meanwhile after a meeting of committee members of a society in Ribandar, the residents were instructed not to visit general stores and place orders for essential items through WhatsApp to the store owner beginning Thursday.

The residents have been told to keep the money outside their door and open it only after the delivery person leaves. It was also decided that a book and pen would be kept in every building where all have been requested to write down their building number and requirements with quantity of essentials required.

PATNA: The Bihar Government on Wednesday decided to provide financial assistance of Rs1,000 to all ration card holder families across the state in the wake of countrywide lockdown due to Covid-19 scare. This amount would be transferred directly in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through direct benefit transfer (DBT).

Earlier on March 23, the government had announced Rs1,000 to only those ration card holder families who were living in urban and semi-urban areas, including in the block headquarters towns where lockdown was imposed by the state government.

“Now, since 21-day lockdown has been imposed in the country, the state government has decided to provide the financial assistance to all ration card holders across the state, even in rural areas,” a state government official told TOI on Wednesday.

PUNE: Sweepers, appointed by private contractors to clean public roads, will be able to do their duty without hassles. The Pune Municipal Corporation ( PMC ) will give them identity cards so that they can work even during the lockdown.

Over 4,000 such workers were finding it tough to venture out as they have no documents to prove their role in emergency services. Their workers’ union had demanded ID cards after a sweeper was beaten up by the police when he failed to prove his identity. The civic administration in association with the contractors will provide these ID cards which will have details like the name of the person, photo, name and logo of the PMC and other details.

“We have made a temporary arrangement for giving the ID cards. They will be usable only during lockdown period. These cards will stand suspected after the lockdown ends,” said Dnyaneshwar Molak, head of PMC’s solid waste management department, told TOI on Wednesday.

He said the ID cards were prepared up to March 31 but as the lockdown period has been extended till April 15 they will be valid for the extended period.

According to PMC’s data, nearly 3,600 people are working on contract as conservancy workers, while around 6,600 are part of the PMC staff for solid waste management. “Such identity cards are a must for the workers. These people are working for an emergency service,” Mukta Manohar, trade union leader representing the workers, said.

304,['26/03/2020'],Vegetable shortage may hit Vizag soon,"Visakhapatnam: Sources in the horticulture department and the rythu bazaars are warning of an impending crisis of vegetable shortage in Visakhapatnam. With both the wholesale market and rythu bazaars running short of vendors and suppliers, sources believe that the crisis could happen in the next 48 hours.

The main reason for the non-availability of vegetables is the shut down of inter-state borders restricting farmers from selling their produce in the wholesale bazaars in Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram. Another issue is the taboo that many of these vendors and suppliers face from their villages, where they are not being allowed into their homes.

Elaborating on the situation in rural areas, K Nookaraju, a farmer and vegetable supplier to the Visakhapatnam wholesale bazaar said: “The last trip I made to Vizag was two days ago. Nw my own people, natives of Uratla, are refusing to let me back into my village if I venture out again. I do not know what to do with my stock of vegetables.”

T Jagadish Kumar, estate officer of the Pedda Waltair rythu bazaar said: “Ninety percent of the farmers are not selling their produce in the rythu bazaars. The stock availability is woefully short of the demand. If this continues, we will surely face a shortage of vegetables.”

Sources in the rythu bazaars have even urged people to stock up on dry foods such as lentils, soya peas and channa, just to ensure that they do not depend on vegetable supply.

Consumers too are worried, with many defying curfew norms to rush to the nearest kirana stores to stock up on vegetables and other essentials. The district administration, however, has made it clear that they will ensure that the supply lines are kept open.

L Shiva Shankar, joint collector, Visakhapatnam said: “We have issued orders and permits to wholesalers, vegetable suppliers and vendors to keep the supply going. Moreover, we are coordinating with all the law enforcement authorities to help in the process.”

The work to identify all such people began on Wednesday as the country started its 21-day lockdown to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak. Several social organisations have also come forward to help the district administration for the cause.District magistrate (DM) has assigned responsibilities for doorstep delivery of essential items such as fruits, vegetables, grocery, dairy products and medicine, while for any medical emergency, people have been advised to call helpline number ‘108’ and ‘102’.Talking to TOI, DM Prabhu N Singh said, “We are working on a plan to distribute cooked food with help of certain industrialists and social organisations. We have identified 15 places where street dwellers and poor families will be given food packets. The process to identify the needy has been initiated. The distribution of food packets will be done by the police.”Taking cognizance of profiteering by some, the district administration on Wednesday ensured fixed rates of 21 fruits, vegetables and other food items. The DM stated that FIR will be registered against profiteers under Essential Commodities Act, 1955.After PM Narendra Modi’s announcement of the complete lockdown on Tuesday evening, locals rushed to the vegetable markets, grocery and flour shops the next morning. At a few places, Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) officials along with local councillors ensured supply of essential items at doorstep. Police maintained strict vigil after 9am. They patrolled the interior parts of the city appealing to residents not to step out of their houses.In another act of kindness, a Bareilly-based group has arranged food for poor who dwell in the city’s slum areas, at bus stands and railway platforms. They are also feeding stray cattle and dogs. The group’s president Nadeem Shamsi said a campaign has been initiated to feed the needy and stray animals at the time of this crisis.Shamsi, who runs an NGO called ‘Samaaj Sewa Manch’, further said, “On Wednesday, we visited a few areas in the city to look for stray cattle, dogs and even birds, and fed them with bread and biscuits. They were mainly spotted in Civil Lines, Quila, Choupla, Qutubkhana and near dumping sites. We have decided to carry on with this drive to ensure these animals don’t starve or not die. The local administration has allowed us. We will continue with the drive. We are also following the necessary precautions like wearing masks and sanitisers.”“We had bought food - milk packets, wheat and pulses - in large quantities to distribute among the poor. We have chalked out a plan to identify and give food to slum-dwellers near Bakerganj and Chawni, along with beggars at public places like railway stations,” Shamsi added.Meanwhile, Agra DM also chaired a meeting with representatives of medicine retailers and wholesalers. Decision was taken that retail medical shops will operate from 10am to 5pm on even days and wholesalers will operate on odd days from 12pm to 3pm. The DM asked the chemists to publish their contact numbers. Chemists will be taking orders over phone. Their representatives will be issued passes to deliver medicine on two-wheelers.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Several housing societies in Wakad are taking a slew of measures — from closing amenities such as swimming pools and gymnasiums to restricting people’s movements through the main gates — for effective social distancing in the time of Covid-19.

Bhavana Bhakre, chairperson of Westone housing society with 96 flats off Wakad-Hinjawadi road, said, “We have closed the swimming pool, garden, club house, gymnasium and playground in the society. Though there were some resistance to a few measures, we sorted it out with the help from police.”

The Elementra housing society, with 900 flats off Pune-Bengaluru highway, and Nandan Inspira, with 390 flats along Dutt mandir road, have closed their swimming pools, gymnasiums, club houses, gardens and children’s play zones a week ago.

Pravin Farad, secretary of Elementra society, said, “We are allowing delivery of essentials such as milk, medicines and LPG cylinders to the flats. We have told the housekeeping agency to reduce its staff strength from 100 to 50 by adopting the system of alternate-day duty.”

Silver Orchard housing society, with 48 row houses and bungalows, has restricted the entry or exit, with the exception of emergency purposes, between 5pm and 5am.

Society chairperson Avinash Takate Patil said, “ The aim is to reduce crowding in markets and other public places. We closed the swimming pool and club house a week ago. We have also removed the benches provided by the civic body.”

VIJAYAWADA: Bachelors, daily wagers, the destitute and others who either can’t cook or don’t have a kitchen are struggling to find food .

While the state government has permitted restaurants and hotels to run take away services, a majority of them are still unwilling to open for business. For one, they fear that they may not even break even with the amount invested in food ingredients for the menu.

Secondly, there is a lack of awareness as to whether the take away service would be considered on par with essential commodities.

K Ramana, a private insurance agent from Nidamanur village near Vijayawada , said the situation was bad in the city outskirts. “The cops have barricaded the highway and there aren’t any hotels within the 3-km radius and I don’t have a kitchen. Thanks to my neighbours, I have managed to survive,” he said.

Several bachelors were caught by cops as they were looking for hotels and food stalls around the highway.

Daily wagers, the destitute and beggars who rely on small streetside eateries are struggling to make their ends meet. Beggars residing on pavements of Durga Ghat, BRTS Road and Bandar Road footpaths are now refusing currency and seeking food from people.

Some eateries in a remote location were opening and closing their shutters while letting the customers in and out.

Meanwhile, police and civic officials have been providing food packets to the poor in the city. The same cannot be said for those who stay in remote locations in Krishna district.

“We have kept our menu simple to avoid wastage. We stopped making biryani and are providing idlis and Chinese food,” Karisetty Ramudu, a food stall owner in Gudavalli said.

The police, with the support of few other departments, strictly enforced the lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. The police used batons on some motorists at few places in the city to discourage them from taking to the roads uneccesarily. “We will not allow motorists on the roads for unnecessary travel and will act tough against the violators of the lockdown under various sections of IPC,” the police chief added.

Tirumala Rao said that Rythu Bazaars have been relocated from congested locations to the ground in the city for strict implementation of social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. “Despite our instructions, some people are coming on the roads unnecessarily and arguing with the police, who have been performing their duties for the safety of the people. We are appealing the people to stay in homes and follow the precautions to fight against the virus,” Tirumala Rao said.

“We have observed that some youngsters are defying the lockdown and riding the bikes at high speeds. We are also examining CCTV footage to register cases against all the violators,” a traffic police officer said.

“Thanks to some videos going viral, where the police were seen beating up motorists for violating the rules of the lockdown, youngsters remained at home on Wednesday,” said K Narayana, a resident.

The Centre and state governments are trying hard to help. Still, I do agree that it is important to question the arrangements. But we should also pause for a moment to ask ourselves whether despite the problems, faced with a danger like coronavirus, do we have to win or not. The difficulties are going to be there for only 21 days but the damage that coronavirus will cause if it does not go away cannot be calculated "" the PM said.Modi seemed to be trying to prepare people to put up with various inconveniences like irregular supplies of everyday items while arguing that the threat of wider or uncontrolled transmission of coronavirus was a danger that needed to be averted at all costs.Seeking to drive home the point, Modi said the battle of Mahabharata was won in 18 days, and the one against coronavirus was going to take 21 days. ""Our endeavour is to win it in 21 days. Whereas Lord Krishna was the general and the guide in Mahabharata, the battle against coronavirus will be led by 130 crore Indians,” he said, adding that the common man believed in taking the right step at the right time.“On March 22, it was clearly seen how all citizens supported janata curfew and then at 5 pm, expressed gratitude to professionals fulfilling their duties in essential services,” he said.However, the PM also cautioned that focusing exclusively on shortcomings and instances of dereliction on the part of a few would not be beneficial. ""There can be thousands of reasons for spreading despair and some of those could be valid ones too. But we should remember that this nation is sustained by hope and trust,"" he said as he lavished praise on doctors, nurses, paramedical personnel, police, government employees and the Air India crew.Modi made a pointed reference to incidents of harassment faced by medical professionals and others such as airline crews, who were being asked to vacate residences or ostracised, and said such reports were deeply painful. He said states and police chiefs had been asked to take tough action to curb such instances of discrimination against people providing essential services.“I appeal to all citizens, if you notice any incident where professionals, such as doctors and nurses are ill-treated, then you should take an initiative to make such people understand that they are wrong,” Modi said in response to a doctor, who cited incidents where medical staff was asked to vacate premises by their landlords.The PM said he had told the home ministry and state DGPs to take strict action against those who were not supporting or not cooperating with doctors, nurses and other professionals.“These days, people in hospitals are working for around 18 hours per day. Professionals in the healthcare sector are not getting more than 2-3 hours to sleep. Civil society people are working day in, day out to help poor. We should salute such people who are serving society in this critical hour,” Modi said, adding that those not cooperating with such professionals would have to face the consequences.He said healthcare professionals ""working in white uniforms in hospitals were like god for us today as they were saving people"" from the disease. “They are saving us by risking their own lives,” he added.Responding to the question of a textile merchant, Akhilesh Khemka, about the sufferings of the poor and the roofless, the PM urged better off sections to offer food to at least nine families for the next 21 days, which, he said, would be the best way to offer prayers to Ma Durga during the auspicious period of Navratra. Modi stressed that social distancing, which has resulted in hardships, was unavoidable as part of the ""military strategy"" deployed to fight the pandemic.“However, we consider humans to be embodiments of divinity and compassion should be part of the larger strategy to defeat corona. Whoever has the capability, take the pledge to take care of nine families for 21 days, it will be a true 'Navratri'. Due to the lockdown, animals are also facing trouble. I appeal to people to take care of animals around them too,” Modi said.The PM started the interaction expressing grief over terror attack in a Gurdwara in Kabul where several people are said to be killed.He said that as MP of Varanasi, he should have been among the people of the city in times like these but was not able to do so due to engagements in Delhi. “Despite being busy here, I've been taking regular updates about Varanasi from my colleagues,” Modi said, adding that Kashi could be the torchbearer in the fight against Covid-19.The PM once again highlighted how some people were still not sensitive towards the coronavirus scare. “At times, people don't pay attention to things which are important. The same is happening in India. I request people to understand facts and not believe in rumours. Covid-19 doesn't discriminate between rich and poor. It will not spare anyone just because they perform yoga or exercise daily,” he added.Modi said one should not attempt to treat coronavirus infection on their own.He also announced that the government had formed a help desk, in collaboration with WhatsApp , to seek correct information about coronavirus.“If you have access to WhatsApp, you can use the number 9013151515 for the purpose,” Modi said, adding, “If you write 'Namaste' on this WhatsApp number, either in English or in Hindi, then you will get an immediate response.”",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74819997,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-122839,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-despite-disruptions-lockdown-is-best-option/articleshow/74819998.cms

326,['26/03/2020'],"Lockdown hits real estate market, cycle of buying and selling stalls","bird’s eye view: An aerial view of residential houses beyond the Yerawada bridge

Pune: Property consultant Ibrahim Shaikh has seen a staggering fall in client interest over the last week. “Even a week ago the client footfall was more or less normal, but now the count has gone down to zero giving way to inquiries being made over calls,” he pointed out, adding hopefully, “The market should pick up once things go back to normal. Till then, safety is of the utmost importance.”

One man’s spending is another man’s earning, but the entire cycle falters in the midst of a highly necessary lockdown and successive curfews in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Builders, sellers, suppliers, furniture shops and other personnel attached to the industry have also been hit. “If there are no people seeking our services, supply of material ceases to matter. It is a global pandemic. I cannot say what the repercussions may be in the long run, but, for the time being, it is a positive move on the people’s part to follow the quarantine effectively,” said interior designer Bharat Solanki.

Khushnam Chauhan, a real estate consultant, spoke of the short and long term effect on the finances of everyone involved in the business. “Right now, we are in the process of closing almost done deals. The pandemic has had a cascading effect. People seeking houses have declined drastically. The number of people selling houses have also reduced. A seller refused to meet because she had a child at home and she did not want to take the risk of physical interaction and that’s how it should be. There is no new business coming our way, inquiries too are dwindling,” Chauhan added.

Suparna Pillai, a banker, said, “Wherever a property investment is involved, short term and long term gains come into play. Property holders need to file for capital gains in the form of reinvestment, pay a 24% tax or sign up for government bonds for five years at least by July end usually. But they need to complete necessary transactions, such as buying of property or investing in it by July end. As per finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement of March 24, the fiscal has been extended to June 30 offering some relief to property holders with capital gain accounts.”

“With this 21-day lockdown business will come to a grinding halt triggering an economic slump which will require months to recover. Some people with no option to work from home will face a money crunch,” she added

Vasant Pillai, a Retail specialist and Suparna’s husband, had been seeking to rent out a property in Mumbai to a new tenant in April. “Our present tenant was supposed to leave the house by March-end. Now, I cannot go to Mumbai to close the deal, neither can he find some other accommodation in such trying times. We have decided to allow him an extended stay,” he said.

“This time around the demand for accommodation increases. I have properties in Pune and Powai as well. The situation has definitely hit choppy waters,” he added.

Financial advisors and bankers say it’s too early to opine on the impact on the economy but did express that the situation was dire with the Sensex declining at a rapid pace.

Realtor S Pirani said, “Societies are not allowing entry to outsiders. They are exercising caution and following the mandate of social-distancing and rightly so. It is just a business, our lives and safety of loved ones comes first.”

Most employers in the real estate business have granted their employees paid holiday so that they can stay safe and in quarantine along with their families.

“Clients have postponed meets and business is being conducted virtually. I closed shop on March 17. Financially, we have definitely been impacted,” said realtor Charu Bhatnagar.

Real estate advisor Khalid Memon said nothing concrete could be said about the impact felt by the realty sector until the first week of April, after the retraction of the lockdown. However, most businesses are positive that things would look up post the lockdown.

“It is important to decongest the prisons as early as possible,” said Ramanand.

CHANDIGARH: The Union ministry of health and family welfare, which is facing an acute shortage of ventilators vital for critical care of Covid-19 patients, is interested in a low-cost portable ventilator, weighing just 1.5 kg, designed by a team of experts from Chandigarh’s PGIMER and Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru.

India has only 30,000 ventilators in all the hospitals for its population of over 1.3 billion and it is estimated that at least 5% of Covid-19 patients would need them because of respiratory distress.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday had announced a Rs 15,000-crore package to improve and augment health infrastructure, including ventilators, to manage Covid-19 cases.

“We have recently been approached by the Mahindra Group, which is looking for mass manufacturing of ventilators. We have been working on this for a year and now we feel this will be beneficial for the society during this pandemic,” Dr Rajeev Chauhan, neuro-anaesthesiologist, PGIMER. A patent has already been published for the device, named “Respiration Control (RC),” and it abides by the international guidelines.

The team of experts had started making this ventilator when they felt that manually pumping ambulatory bags was not only tiresome, but also required a patient’s attendant to be immobile for a long period. “Our price will be between Rs 10,000 and Rs 12,000 only. The cost of highend ventilators is around Rs 10 lakhs,” said Eshaan Dhar, an IISC Bengaluru passout and former scientific officer, department of atomic energy.

The device works on battery for 7-8 hours and can then be connected with direct current. The complete unit is noiseless and requires no manual assistance. The apparatus is made of high quality plastic with no sharp edges. The safety of this device is ensured by incorporating volume and pressure microsensors at patient end. Moreover device is incorporated with disconnection alarm. “It is a shortterm alternative to critical care ventilators, which are expensive complex microprocessor driven devices,” said Dr Chauhan, who has spent his own funds to design this device. He said, “We have ethical approval for testing on patients and the same will start soon.”

The designers claim that the device has advantages like sparing human being of tiresome effort, low cost, delivering required volume per breath, easily transportable and easy to assemble. “Although this model is not intended to replace the expensive/ efficient mechanical ventilators, it may be considered for short-term ventilation as required in Covid-19 for which we have a dearth of ventilators,” said Eshaan.

Experts feel that mass production of the device will not take more than 15 days. “We have done field tests and now it has to be seen how it works on patients at the PGI,” said Eshaan.

Initially, the decision was to build a six-storey hospital to provide super-specialty treatment in areas such as minimally invasive cardiac surgeries and neurosurgeries.“The government subsequently decided to build an 11-storey building for super-specialty treatment to needy patients. The same building will now be used as a dedicated Covid-19 hospital in Pune district,” Chandanwale said.A district administration official said, “To make this hospital functional, we require trained manpower, mainly intensivists, pulmonologists, doctors and nurses, for critical and non-critical care areas, Class IV staffers and equipment.

“A number of cases have come to light where patients have flouted the rules set for home quarantine and have ventured out. In such cases the only option is to put them into institutional quarantine,” said Sanjeev Wavre, a senior health official of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).

PMC officials said the step had been taken in consultation with the district administration. Hostels run by government departments as well as those owned by private institutes would be acquired.

According to the civic administration nearly 5,000 beds can be acquired for isolation by converting the hostels. Nearly 2,000 would be available in the first phase while the remaining would be added in the days to come. The authorities want to be prepared with 15,000 to 20,000 beds for isolating suspected and positive cases across the city. Around 45 hostels would be acquired for the makeshift arrangement.

“These hostels are to be acquired on a temporary basis. Converting them into quarantine facilities will be easier and we hope to start the first phase of acquisition in a week,” said Rajendra Muthe, head of PMC’s land and estate department.

He said, “Basic facilities like beds, separate rooms and sanitation facilities are already present in these hostels. The PMC would have to provide protective equipment like masks, hand gloves and sanitizers in these hostels to convert them into isolation wards. The civic body would also take care of maintaining cleanliness and hygiene. Talks are underway with both government authorities and private institutions. Five institutions have already consented.”

PMC officials said most of the hostels have mess facility, but most of them were empty right now because the workers and staff members had left the city due to the coronavirus scare. Thus, catering services needed to be outsourced they said.

COIMBATORE: In the wake of 21-day national lockdown, NGOs in the city have floated a forum ‘Coimbatore Food Emergency Team’ to provide food to people in shelters, sanitary workers, homeless people and unorganized sector workers such as security personnel.

With some civic bodies, as in Chennai, laying curbs on volunteers of service organizations providing food, representatives of the forum said they have strict rules in place for volunteers, who come forward to serve people, and would maintain hygiene of kitchen workers.

It is to be noted that some of these NGOs have been working with the city corporation to provide food for people in shelters.

While some NGOs have kitchens at Town Hall and Balasundaram Road, others have come forward to provide food to the needy in their own areas.

On Wednesday, NGOs such as No Food Waste and Nizhal Maiyam provided food to sanitary workers, homeless people and others in need.

Padmanabhan Gopalan, of No Food Waste, said not more than two volunteers would be involved in distribution work and that they would always maintain distance. “Kitchen workers won’t be changed, and their health would be screened regularly. All personnel would wear gloves and mask,” he said referring to the regulations that they had formulated.

Usually, he said, No Food Waste would get calls only from those who have excess food to be donated. “But now we are getting calls from people saying they can’t get food and asking for help. Security personnel, cleaners and other unorganized workers need help at this time.”

Vaishnavi Balaji, of Food bank Coimbatore, said they were allowing only those volunteers with proper credentials to offer services. “We would provide food for pavement dwellers, daily wagers and anyone those who can’t access food because of the lockdown,” she said.

B Murugan, of Nizhal Maiyam, said they had provided food to around 1,150 people, including sanitary workers, homeless people and others who couldn’t get anything to eat as shops were closed, on Wednesday.

JAIPUR: Four days ago, people clapped and clanged their utensils from their balconies to appreciate the role of doctors and nurses for their untiring efforts to treat Covid-19 patients and suspects.

But these bravehearts are now receiving threats from their landlords for the same reason for which they were appreciated. The state government was however quick to react to the problem and sternly warned houseowners from victimising such people.

The health department has been flooded with such complaints from doctors and nurses who informed higher authorities about the threats they have been receiving from their landlords.

“I have been deployed for the treatment of suspected Covid-19 patients at SMS Hospital. My landlord is aware about it. Since it is a highly contagious disease, my landlord is apprehensive that they might get infected with it because of me, which is not true at all. They have asked me to vacate the house,” said a nursing staff on condition of anonymity.

Not only her, but there are others such healthcare staff facing the same problem. Such cases have been reported in Bhilwara, Jhunjhunu and Jaipur where large number of health department's teams have been deployed in survey, treatment and care of the Covid-19 suspected patients and positive cases.

In Bhilwara and Jhunjhunu, they are working hard in areas where curfew has already been imposed as these areas reported Covid-19 cases in clusters.

Taking it as a serious issue, health department has decided to take action against such landlords. “Some complaints have been received about landlords threatening nurses and doctors, who are tirelessly working for Covid-19 related cases. The state government has taken serious note of it and issued a notification in this connection,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary, health department.

The notification says, “Landlords and house owners are forcing them to vacate their rented residences. The behaviuor amounts to obstructing public servants in discharging their duties. The state government has issued Rajasthan Epidemic Diseases Covid-19 Regulations 202 under Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 and Rajasthan Epidemic Diseases Act 1957 for prevention and containment of Covid-19.”

It further directed district collectors, SPs and zonal deputy commissioners of municipal corporations to take strict penal action against such landlords and house owners under relevant provisions of law and submit action taken report on a daily basis to the health department.

I wanted to eat something different without going out on Tuesday and ended up making vada pav at home, including the pav. The pav didn’t turn out to be exactly like what you get in bakeries but with the vada and chutney, it tasted good. For the last few days, I have been experimenting with different recipes and chutneys. The plan is to experiment a lot more over the coming 21 days,” she explained.

351,['26/03/2020'],"Nagpur: Coal capacity pipeline declines in India, new coal projects continue to be added","Representative image

NAGPUR: On the brighter side, a staggering 47.4 gigawatt (GW) coal-fired power projects at different stages were cancelled in the country last year. On the darker side, 8.8GW of new coal-fired capacity has entered the under-construction phase, all of which is reliant on significant public funding.

This was revealed in the latest report ‘Boom and Bust 2020: Tracking The Global Coal Plant Pipeline’ which is the fifth annual survey of the coal plant pipeline. Jointly released by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), Greenpeace International , the Sierra Club and Global Energy Monitor , the report highlights that the capacity of coal power plants in the pre-construction phase fell by half from 2018 to 2019 in the country.

From 60.2GW in 2018, it saw a sharp fall to 29.3GW last year. “In India, capacity under construction and in pre-construction phase declined 80% from 311.1GW in 2015 to 66GW in 2019, with only 2.8GW newly proposed in 2019,” the report adds.

The findings state that the biggest growth in construction took place in South Asia in 2019, with India starting construction of 8.8GW of new coal power capacity. Along with this, 8.1GW coal- based capacity was commissioned in the country last year. “This, despite the country already having 19.3GW of coal plants frozen in construction mainly due to financing problems,” the analysis states.

The new construction includes four coal plants —- Adani Godda, Patratu and Udangudi having 1.6GW each and Yadadri with 4GW.

All the 8.8GW of new construction received substantial financing from the Power Finance Corporation or the Rural Electrification Corporation , both of which fall under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Power and are set to merge this year.

The report further indicated that with the private sector exiting coal plant development in the country, the public sector is stepping in and footing the bill. “In a submission made by the ministry of power in Parliament on March 17, it removed more than 23GW capacity of coal fired power stations belonging to the private sector from under-construction category. Most of these plants started development before 2011,” states a press release issued by the organizations.

The report also highlights that even as the coal power development shrank in India, the amount of new coal-fired capacity added to the grid last year outpaced the retirement existing old power plants, resulting in net growth in the coal-fired capacity in the country. This further negatively impacted power load factor of coal plants, thus indicating worsening overcapacity.

“The shrinking coal pipeline in India, forced by huge over-capacity,subdued demand for electricity, falling utilization factor, falling prices of renewable energy, drying investments, and increasing public resistance due to pollution gives hope for a future with reduced fossil footprint for the country. But, at the same time new capacity is being added to the grid, new projects are given clearances and infusion of public money into new projects by the government raises concerns,” said Sunil Dahiya, analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

Stressing on the environmental and economic crisis faced by the country, Dahiya added that a strict policy against building or clearing new coal-based plants with rapid retirement of older units is urgently required.

Despite the decline in development, the coal fleet grew by 34.1 gigawatts (GW) globally last year. Nearly 64% of the newly commissioned capacity was in China and 12% in India. “Global power generation from coal fell by a record amount in 2019, as renewable energy grew and power demand slowed down,” said Christine Shearer, lead author and Director of Global Energy Monitor’s Coal Program.

Adding that the number of new plants added to the grid accelerated, Shearer said, “The world’s coal plants operated a lot less. For banks and investors that continue to underwrite new coal plants, this means weakened profitability and increased risk.”

They are required to be out on the city streets to deal with people, who are not taking the lockdown seriously and at the same time thinking about the safety of their near and dear ones.Some women police officers have sent their children to their native places while others reach home so late in the night that it has been days since they saw their children before they were tucked into bed.Considering the speed at which the coronavirus can transmit among people, the police force is at a high risk. Taking a serious note of the situation, sub-inspector Kavita Rupnar of the Hinjewadi police has already sent her two daughters to her native place in Sangola, Solapur district , about 250km from here. “Now, I can perform my duties without tension,” Rupnar told TOI.Her elder daughter is four years old while the younger one is only 18 months old. “My younger daughter can’t even talk. It was very difficult for me to send them so far but I do not have any choice,” Rupnar said.She said her husband too had gone with them and her in-laws are taking good care of her daughters. “Every day I contact them through a video call. That is the only relief after a busy day,” she added.Deputy commissioner of police (Pimpri Chinchwad) Smita Patil too has a similar story to share.

Subsequently, officers from the Bidhannagar North police station arrested Sarmistha Debnath, her friend Nirmal Balmiki and the driver, Md Javed, all residents of Picnic Garden.These three arrested were among the 871 people who were rounded up on Wednesday for violating the nationwide lockdown, imposed to minimize chances of novel coronavirus infection. Since Monday evening, the count added up to 1,874. Police also spent a considerable time, marking out zones for buyers to stand in queues outside grocery shops, medicine shops, ATMs and even inside malls and departmental stores in Ultadanga, Phoolbagan, Narkeldanga, Patuli, Jadavpur and Rashbehari. “No need to crowd around the shops in the market. Maintain social distancing! @KolkataPolice has started marking the area in front of the shops so that safe distance is maintained by customers,” commissioner of police Anuj Sharma tweeted. At neighbourhoods in and around Beliaghata and Phoolbagan, the local cops also introduced a token system to reduce crowding near shops.The Salt Lake’s violation took place around 12.30pm, when sub-inspector Suman Bhattacharya and his team were at a check-naka near PNB. They stopped the app cab that came from the CA-Island direction. The officer asked to see the passengers’ identity cards and the purpose of them travelling during the nationwide lockdown, imposed to minimise novel coronavirus infection.“The passengers initially refused to respond and then said they were going to buy medicines. When our officers asked them to show the prescription, they couldn’t. Then they claimed they were returning after buying provision. When we asked them what they had bought, they showed us a few packets of noodles. The claims seemed unjustified and we told them they would be prosecuted for violating the lockdown protocol. At that point, the woman alighted out of the car, got into a confrontation and bit an officer. She had an old cut on her forehead, which she scratched and wiped the blood on the officer’s shirt, saying she would frame him that ‘he injured her’.

Buses remained in their depots, cars and bikes in the parking spaces and people stay put in their houses. But for those who stepped out for buying groceries or medicines, the entire population of Coimbatore remained indoors.

The arterial Avinashi Road, the commercial hub of Town Hall, walkers’ paradise Race Course and every other place in the city was deserted. The only men out there in all these places were police personnel keeping a tight vigil to enforce the curfew.

“I have been living in Coimbatore for the past 35 years. Never have I seen the city so deserted. The sight of empty roads everywhere itself is disturbing,” said S Mahadevan, a senior executive in a construction company.

Police stopped each and every one who ventured on to the roads and let them off only after convinced they were out for essential purpose. While some were warned and sent back, a few youths who were found roaming out just to have a view of the city during curfew had to face punishment.

In some places like Thondamuthur they were made to remain in squatting position for a few minutes, while in other places they were made to do sit ups.

At Singanallur, a motorcycle-bound duo had to face the wrath of a policeman who beat them with a lathi after finding that they were roaming out for no reason at all. As the video of the incident started going viral, senior police officers instructed police personnel not to beat motorists but warn them. “Compared to other places in the state, the number of people who ventured out randomly without any purpose is less in Coimbatore. But we gave punishments like sit ups so that even those less number of people don’t come out,’’ said a police officer.

By evening, the number of such wanderers also came down. By the time, police had booked about 38 cases on people for violating Section 144 of CrPc. All these cases were in rural areas, particularly, Sulur, Thudiyalur , Kinathukadavu , Madukkarai and Chettipalayam.

“Only if there is an emergency or something very essential you can come out of house,'' said animal husbandry minister Udumalai Radhakrishnan after holding a review meeting at the Tirupur collectorate to take stock of the situation. He said 172 people are being monitored in the district and all are stable. Five teams have been formed to keep tab on them.

“A number of people could be seen coming out in motorcycles, please don’t do it,’’ he appealed.

It was in stark contrast of the scenes from Tuesday.“As against huge rush to the market places on Sunday night and Monday morning, Wednesday was quite peaceful and the streets were deserted. The only ones to move around were those ferrying essential services with valid proofs,” a senior police officer said.Since Tuesday morning the streets and chowks in the city have been barricaded, disallowing movement of vehicles. Moreover police officials manning a few chowks are discouraging movement of people.“The borders of the district have been sealed. All junctions have been barricaded. The message to the citizens is very clear. The media reports about people being punished for loitering have also worked to reduce the people on the road. The intention is to keep everyone safe,” the officer said.Nashikites told TOI that they were relieved after the government assured supply of essentials would not be hampered.“There was some confusion as to whether we would get our essentials. Now that government has made it clear that there is enough stock and that shops will remain open, we will step out as per requirement,” Keshav Shinde, a Nashik Road resident, said.District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal also took to Twitter, urging people to remain indoors. “Let’s make things better for people, who are working day and night for the safety of citizens.

368,['26/03/2020'],"No curbs on grocery stores, says joint CP","Struck: A policeman charges at a man while another looks on and a man in khaki hits a scooterist with a lathi

Pune: Joint commissioner of the city police, Ravindra Shisve, on Wednesday said no restriction was imposed on the functioning of grocery shops, but a blanket permission cannot be given to all employees of such facilities to move around on roads.

On Tuesday, there were complaints from several citizens about the police forcing closure of grocery shops. Even the shopkeepers complained about the police blocking their employees from moving around, forcing them to prematurely close their shops.

Grocery shops are among the essential establishments exempted from the prevailing lockdown orders.

On the ground, some people faced issues related to access to these shops and high-handed approach of policemen despite instructions from the higher-ups against the use of force. “Clearly, the instructions are not percolating to the policemen implementing the orders on the ground,” said a Kondhwa resident.

Shisve told TOI, “The 21-day lockdown announcement on Tuesday evening was followed by a rush of people at various grocery shops for panic-buying, and this compelled us to forcibly shut shops at many places. We have not imposed restrictions on how long the shops should operate in a day, but the crowding was defeating the social distancing purpose. The local police stations are taking care of this issue. We have requested the shopowners to allow their employees to stay with them for two to three days till things get settled.”

He said, “It has been observed that policemen are behaving politely, but large number of people are misbehaving. Strict instructions have been issued to policemen against the use of force.”

He said a majority of Puneites were supporting the police by staying indoors but conceded that people in the fringe areas and slums were venturing out on the roads. Most of the city thoroughfares, otherwise, wore a deserted look on Wednesday.

“We shall be focusing on the fringe and slum areas to secure a total lockdown and have started making frequent announcements through the public-address system in these areas. Still, if they don’t listen, we shall start booking them for offences under Section 188 (disobedience of order promulgated by a public authority) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).”

He said, “We have set up check-posts at more than 180 spots across the city to ensure only the vehicles engaged in transporting essential goods and services move on roads. Apart from physical presence of police personnel at these posts, they are being monitored by CCTV cameras.”

At places where there is no CCTV backup, the police have started taking photographs of errant motorists and issuing them written orders to report to the police station concerned after the lockdown period is over for facing legal action under Section 188 of the IPC. “The whole purpose is to avoid any confrontation between the police and the people,” the joint police chief said.

On Wednesday, the police received 7,315 messages on the WhatsApp helpline numbers, 5,000 requests on Twitter handle and 233 requests, mainly from private firms, on emails. The police responded to 5,683 of the WhatsApp messages, he said. Almost half of the calls were for travel requests citing medical reasons, especially from cancer and diabetic patients.

Fortis group is also likely to announce the creation of isolation facility on Friday, sources said.While Apollo hospital has reserved 50 beds for Covid-19 patients, Max group has reserved 20 beds each at its Saket and Patparganj centres and BLK 10 beds for isolation and treatment. All three hospital groups said they were prepared to scale up the infrastructure significantly, depending on the need, on a short notice.Apollo has also received licence for Covid-19 testing. Sangita Reddy, joint managing director of the group, said most centres have been cleared for testing.“Full-scale testing is likely to start by the end of March. We will have the provision for home collection of samples as well as drive-through testing. In-hospital testing will be discouraged, except for in-patients. Dedicated fever clinics are being set up to screen people. People who qualify under the criteria for tests will enter via the drive-through, make payment as per government recommendations and then be tested,” Reddy said.Reddy added more than 50% Covid-19 positive cases need only isolation and symptomatic management. “Isolation is not possible in many Indian homes where 6-7 people share common accommodation and toilet. Soon, we will be launching “Project Stay I” to create medical rooms in hotels/hostels with light medical supervision for quarantine and creating a barrier before people come into the hospitals,” she said.The medical rooms will be rolled out in Chennai, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Delhi, starting with approximately 50 in each city. They will go up by 50 rooms every three days, to reach an eventual target of 5,000 across the country, said Reddy.Preetha Reddy, vice-chairperson of Apollo, said preparations are on for the next stage of community transmission of the virus. “There will be over 250 beds, which can be enhanced to 500 beds, to treat the critically ill. We expect to give advanced care to over 2,000 patients a month.”Max Healthcare will begin admission of Covid-19 patients from Friday.

In a letter to chief minister Ashok Gehlot, the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (CREDAI) chairman, Gopal Dasgupta, said labour cess should be distributed among the workers of projects as there survival has become difficult .

After the developers in the state also showed their helpnessess to support their labourers for long as the industry has been facing a slump for many years, the appeal was made to the state government.

Dasgupta said, “The developers deposite 1 per cent of the project cost in the development authority, housing board or municipal corporation, wherever the project is constructed. We have requested the state government to utilise the funds for labourers who have lost their employment due to the lockdown.”

Acting on the request, the state has also sanctioned funds for labourers associated with the industry.

According to sources, Rs 400 crore has been sanctioned and Rs 1,000 will be transferred in the accounts of labourers who are registered with the labour and employment department.

A developer however said this would not solve the purpose as registration of all labourers is not done at the department. As per estimation, there are nearly 2 lakh labourers in the state associated with the construction industry.

“The builders only register their permanent labourers. Temporary ones are paid on a daily basis. The state should involve developers too in the process so all the workers of the industry can be benefited,” said the developer.

On Tuesday, the muezzins announced no azaan (call for prayers), namaz and even juma (Friday prayers) will be held at masjids in the wake of restrictions imposed by the government to contain coronavirus.

Complete lockdown of city had resulted in big turnouts in masjids. Muslims have now been asked to offer all prayers at home.

The Shaheen Bagh-style protest, which had started in February at Farooq Nagar’s Teka ground, was also suspended by the organizers. They put up a board announcing they were extending support to Maharashtra government’s decision of complete lockdown to fight coronavirus.

Last Friday, the ‘Juma’ and Khudba (sermon) durations were curtailed from 45 minutes to just 10-15 beside shutting wazuhkhana (abulation taps), removing carpets and towels in their bid to prevent the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19).

Though Muslims turn up in large numbers for the Juma, many reached the masjids only at the start of prayers and left soon after.

At some places, volunteers requested the namaazis to maintain social distancing guidelines and not crowd the premises.

Following the curfew, it wouldn’t have been possible to hold prayers as more Muslims had been visiting masjids.

A scribe, who was quarantined in Nagpur, was at his wit’s end when his parents Tapan Bose (88) and Kalyani (73) informed him that they had run out of necessary ration and medicines. The couple resides in Thakurpukur and live on the third floor of a building that has no elevator. They used to shop online but with home deliveries uncertain, they were stranded.

The scribe, who works in Nagpur, decided to tweet their distress. “I tweeted around 9pm, tagging Kolkata Police commissioner Anuj Sharma and joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. The joint CP reverted within an hour and sought details. I told them I needed to shift my parents from the apartment in James Long Sarani to my sister’s residence on Jatin Das Road. On Wednesday morning, they took my parents in a police vehicle,” he said. He later thanked the cops in another tweet.

In Chitpore, Sonali Bose (77) and her sister Somali (72) were in dire straits after they ran out of ration. They turned to their nephew Swapan Sen for help, who sent an alert to cops via social media. Soon, the local police dropped them off at a relative’s place in Girish Park.

Biswajit Banerjee shared on Kolkata Police’s Facebook page his experience when his uncle residing at Bansdroni felt that he did not have enough to sustain him during lockdown. His uncle spoke of his helplessness to Banerjee. He then sought help from the local police who arranged for an auto and dropped Banerjee’s uncle to a relative’s residence at Hazra.

Cops also lent a helping hand to people from other states stuck in Kolkata. One of them, Omkar Nath, initially tweeted about his troubles, tagging the PMO. His friend Naresh Kumar Boblani, tagged Kolkata police in the thread and the joint CP took note. Soon, cops spoke to Nath and assured him of all help.

This, despite doctors warning that the medicine is not meant for the general public but for specific individuals. On one hand, chemist shops are faced with a glut of demand for hydroxy-chloroquine, and on the other, they are struggling with the depleting stock of medicines as residents have been buying them in huge quantities.The ICMR’s national task force for Covid-19 recommends hydroxy-chloroquine only for asymptomatic healthcare workers handling confirmed or suspected cases and for asymptomatic household contacts of a confirmed case. “Traditionally used in the treatment of malaria and rheumatoid arthritis, there is limited but positive clinical data on this drug as a prophylactic (protective) agent against the current virus. I am getting numerous calls from patients, asking if they should take the medicine. This is not for everyone but for specific individuals, specified by ICMR,” said Subhroyoti Bhowmick, a trained clinical pharmacologist and head of clinical research at Peerless Hospital.Due to discriminate purchase of the drug by others, a young woman from south Kolkata said she was having a tough time replenishing the stock for her mother, who has to have it for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. “My mother has been taking hydroxy-chloroquine for the past five years and it is a life-saver for her. After the ICMR recommendations, the medicine is unavailable in at least a dozen medicine shops in my locality. Even online stores are saying they have run out of stock. How can people make a rush for a medicine, which is not meant for them,” said the woman.Medicine shops agreed many bought bunches of strips at one go. “Ideally, we should not sell it without a prescription. But as it happens with other drugs, many stores are handing it out without the mandatory prescription,” said wholesaler, who has been getting frantic calls from local distributors for more supply of the medicine.Avijit Hazra, professor of pharmacology at SSKM Hospital, warned people against this panic buying and discriminate consumption of the medicine. “This a safe drug for most, except those with contraindications. Toxicity might not be a grave issue, but the season for vivax malaria, for which the drug is prescribed, will arrive soon. This unnecessary demand will create a supply crisis when required the most,” he said. “Owing to limited evidence of hydroxy-chloroquine being a protective drug for Covid-19, even specific people, for whom ICMR has made the recommendation, have to follow precautionary and safety measures, even after the dose is prescribed. If people think they are guarded against the virus by taking this medicine, they are treading a dangerous path.”Medicine stores in the city said they were running out of other medicines too—even very common ones—due to panic buying. “The current stock across the city will last about a week. It is depleting fast as people are buying in huge quantities. If transport remains shut, it will be a problem. We are trying to sort out what can be done to maintain the chain,” said a senior office bearer at Bengal Chemist and Druggist Association (BCDA). “The queues in front of the shop are due to panic buying,” said Subodh Ghosh, vice-president of BCDA.A wholesaler pointed out that another reason for depleting stock was that many wholesale shops were shut. “Around 90% wholesale shops in Burrabazar are closed as employees don’t have any mode of transport.

Authorities have expressed their anguish over people not paying heed to the pleas and fear that this unwanted buying spree may lead to artificial shortage of essential commodities in the markets , giving further scope to black-marketing,

However, authorities are coming out with ways to address the issue at hand. In Aurangabad, the grocery shops are being made to mandatorily put signboards seeking visitors to keep safe distance from one another while visiting the shops.

At some places, where customers did not pay any heed to the safety guidelines as well as the restrictions imposed by the police , shops were made to down their shutters.

The administration’s repeated appeals to the people to not rush to the vegetable markets in large numbers continued to fall on deaf ears following which on Wednesday vegetable vendors were made to set up their stalls at a distance of several feet from each other.

At markets in Shahgunj, Aurangpura, Osmanpura, Mukundwadi and Jadhavwadi, police had to intervene to ensure maintaining of safe distance between vegetable vendors.

In Beed district, vegetable vendors from the traditional vegetable market have been divided into smalls groups and being made to do business from makeshift markets that have been allowed to come up in different parts of the town.

Even in Jalna, Osmanabad, Latur, Nanded, Hingoli and Parbhani, the district administrations and police were found taking steps to ensure that those dealing in essential commodities ensure that customers maintain safe distance while visiting them.

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has failed to provide hygiene items such as masks and hand sanitisers to members of teams carrying out door-to-door surveys to identify people with symptoms of Covid-19 or travel history.

The health teams comprise nurses and healthcare workers.

The teams have been tasked with identifying suspect cases and carrying out primary screening of persons with symptoms such as cough, cold or fever. They are to refer these individuals to health authorities.

Lack of hand sanitisers has the potential to make these teams vulnerable to infection. It was revealed that the healthcare workers use scarves or handkerchiefs to cover their mouth or nose.

Activist Rahul Ingle of the Shahar Parivartan Aghadi said the teams’ members have to be equipped with such items to protect them from the viral infection.

Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele said the AMC has not been able to buy enough hand sanitiser because of a shortage in the market.

State food and drug administration minister Rajendra Shingne has asked manufacturers of hand sanitisers to increase production. The manufacturing of such items is permitted even during the lockdown.

Meanwhile, Eurolife Healthcare Pvt Ltd., a pharmaceutical company has donated sanitisers worth Rs 1.5 crore to deputy district collector of Aurangabad. The collectorate issued a statement that the sanitisers would be distributed to government establishments.

SURAT: Authorities of the Surat District Co-operative Milk Producers’ Union Ltd (Sumul) have urged the residents in Surat and Tapi districts to stay away from panic buying of milk and milk powder as the supply will continue unabatedly during the 21-days lockdown period.

After PM Narendra Modi announced the three week lockdown across the country to contain the spread of COVID-19 on Tuesday night, rumours spread in the city that there will be severe shortage of milk in the coming days. Residents in the Diamond City thronged the milk outlets, dairies and provision stores to purchase milk and milk powder.

Chairman of Sumul dairy, Raju Pathak took to social media on Wednesday urging consumers to stay away from panic buying and assured that Sumul is committed to the regular supply of milk to its consumers in Surat and Tapi districts.

Pathak added, “There are some vested interests in the industry who are trying to gain benefit in the prevailing situation. Our agents and dealers are working hard for the timely delivery of milk to the consumers.”

Sumul supplies about 11 lakh litres of milk in Surat and Tapi districts. “We are receiving milk from all our collection centres across the district on regular basis,” Pathak said.

Talking with TOI, marketing manager of Sumul, Manish Bhatt said, “A detailed list of our agents and dealers is posted on our website. People are free to call them in case they need any kind of assistance.”

397,['26/03/2020'],Jaipur: Milk by Saras dairies to be available once a day,"Representative image

JAIPUR: Wake up early in the morning to get milk for your family, as Rajasthan Cooperative Dairy Federation (RCDF), through its Jaipur Dairy, has announced to supply milk once in a day during mornings only. Because of this, the supply of milk from Jaipur Dairy was adversely affected on Wednesday, leaving many worried across the city.

The RCDF had on Tuesday decided to supply various varieties of its milk brand Saras only once in a day, that created a problem in the city. Likewise, the private milk booth dairies selling milk in various colonies were also closed down, aggravating the problem.

In the localities such as Jhotwara, Khatipura, Murlipura, Vaishali Nagar, Queens Road, Malviya Nagar, Sodala, Mansarovar and others, Saras dairy milk was supplied only during the early morning hours.

“The problem with us is that our men involved in supply too have shown their reluctance in giving the supply to ensure that they too have lesser exposure. Thus, we have decided to supply milk once in a day. Also, while supplying milk once in a day, we will provide as much milk to a booth as it gets twice in a day,” said a senior officer of Jaipur dairy on Wednesday.

People who don’t usually wake up early to get milk and were dependent on the evening supply, were clueless and were seen roaming around to get milk. “The government should at least allow the private milk booths in the locality. Also, Saras Dairy supply should be monitored by the government agency. At many booths by 9.00am there was no milk and at some booths, the tetra pack which costs Rs 60 was sold in Rs 70 to Rs 80,” said Mudassar Ali, a native of Udyog Nagar in Jhotwara.

When contacted, Anil Gaur, an officer with RCDF said, “While supplying twice in a day we are giving nearly 8.50 lakh litres of milk in a day but on Wednesday, we could supply nearly 7 lakh litres. Those involved in the supply vehicles have shown their reluctance to be on duty twice a day, thus we are supplying only during early morning hours.”

However, consumers suggested that with the changed scenario after lockdown, the state government should bring measures to allow the private milkmen to operate. “Those who come from villages with milk should be allowed as presently, people are dependent only on the Saras dairy which is inadequate,” said Radheyshyam Agarwal, a native of Shyam Puri, Jhotwara.

JAIPUR: A robot was brought to Sawai Man Singh Hospital for providing medicine and food to the Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment here on Wednesday.

A private firm has provided the robot to the SMS Hospital on voluntary basis to help the nursing staff and doctors to maintain distance from the Covid-19 patients.

“The work of providing medicines and food, which is done by nursing staff and doctors at the hospital, will be done by a robot for Covid-19 patients. However, to check its efficiency first, we are going to have a demo. If the robot is found useful and does the work efficiently, we will use it to provide medicines and food to Covid-19 patients,” said Dr D S Meena, superintendent, SMS Hospital. Dr Meena said there are higher chances of doctors getting infected from the virus, so it is always a wise idea not to get in touch with the Covid-19 patients frequently; in that case, this robot is useful.

The robot is designed in such a way that it has a tray which is useful for carrying food and medicine from one place to another. Nursing staff were happy to see the robot moving on its own and carrying objects along with it.

However, at the corona out-patient department, patients kept pouring in on Wednesday. The hospital OPD registered 403 influenza-like illness patients, among those 40 are suspected Covid-19 patients.

SALEM: In a complete disregard for the state government’s efforts to contain Covid-19 outbreak by imposing Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, people in Salem region on Wednesday took to streets in large numbers as usual.

While Salem city police booked 10 motorists for violating Section 144 and registered another 1500 cases of traffic violation, a total of 54 people were arrested across Namakkal district for violating Section 144.

Talking to TOI, Salem city police commissioner T Senthil Kumar said strict action would be taken against the people who violate CrPC section in the coming days. “Since it was the first day of curfew, we warned the public, especially motorists, when they came out on roads. Ten of them were booked under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code.”

He said many motorists had taken to the streets for jolly rides while the entire nation was fighting Covid-19 outbreak. “I have directed police personnel to check medical prescriptions and identity cards of road users. Those who fail to produce relevant documents will have to face the law.”

Meanwhile, district collector S A Raman ordered closure of all kinds of tea shops and bakeries from 6pm on Wednesday. He also warned them of strict criminal action, if they were to remain open.

In a few places, including Sathyamangalam in Erode district and Salem city, police personnel resorted to lathi-charge to send out a strong message to the motorists

A senior district administration official in Erode said bikers, especially college students, were coming out of their houses without any valid reasons.

KOLKATA: The photograph of a man’s hand, which was claimed to have been stamped by cops at a police station in southeast Kolkata, went viral on social media on Wednesday, triggering a huge sensation among netizens.

The stamped hand photograph raised curiosity among people, some of whom seemed convinced that the police had put the stamp on people as a sign of warning against not staying indoors and venturing out. However, senior police officers at Lalbazar denied any such action on their part and called it fake news.

Adding more to people’s speculation, some sources in the south east division said that cops would not arrest twice the person with stamp on his hand for defying the lockdown . It was also claimed that the stamp would help the police ascertain the person’s movement back home after being released on bail. The police officers rubbished the claim.

“No such instruction was passed on to the police stations from Lalbazar. There are several other practical methods of policing for the present time of crisis,” said joint CP (headquarters), Subhankar Sinha Sarkar. According to sources, cops are taking several measures to ensure that none is harassed unduly for flouting the lockdown norms.

“Some small steps have been taken to ensure that two police stations will not take action against the same person. These measures will also act as warning and we can spot the repeat offenders,” said an officer from south east division.

With non-availability of food along the way, these people are also having to carry their food and water too.

Some of these home-bound people are also seen travelling on motorcycles and autorickshaws as well.

Majority of those going to Madhya Pradesh and other tribal districts of state are involved in construction industry. With fear of getting no work during the lockdown, they have started to leave for home as in the city they lived in makeshift shanties or even in the under-construction building sites.

After the district administration came to know that such a group of migrant labourers from MP have come on foot from Killa Pardi in Valsad on Tuesday night, they provided them shelter in a public school at night. Another group of MP labourers from Navsari who were seen at national highway 48 had been shifted to a public school.

NAGPUR: Nagpurians might be missing out on their favourite roadside tarri poha and samosas, but they are making the most of their at home by cooking delicious and healthy food in their kitchens.

Meal prep and planning have become the newest trend as it promotes zero wastage and requires less ingredients. TOI tried to find out what are th citizens doing to fulfil their appetite and cravings.

Parveena Lambhajiya , a chef, has come up with an innovative idea to prepare for breakfast which can be used for two days so that it leads to zero wastage and is a healthy alternative to snacks. “I make the batter for dhokla, idli and dosa in bulk which can last easily for at least three days. One can make variety of meals with their own twist into it, such as adding green chili, ginger garlic paste etc. One must avoid using a lot of ingredients, but still make healthy recipes at homes,” she said.

Snehajeet Meshram, a company secretary by profession, has a passion for cooking. He is managing by using less oil making tasty items with leftover food. “ I make sure to use spices minimally and create a balanced meal by including all the nutrients. I use the leftover chana, rajma etc to make dips and sauces,” he said.

Citizens are also stressing on making one-pot recipes as these save gas, serve good and are easily made in less time with minimal ingredients. Ganesh Thorat , accounts officer at South Central Zone Cultural Centre, said, “I am enjoying cooking food for my family. I am helping my wife in the kitchen and strictly cutting down excess use of oil, butter and other primary ingredients to avoid wastage. I made dal fry for my children and they appreciated it. I believe making one-pot khichdi, dal, lentils, and oily food is a great step towards zero wastage,” he said.

Homemaker Savita Tharate said, “I have made a variety of rice flake recipes such as namkeen poha, chiwda and also laddoos with besan. I am making sure to soak the lentils overnight so that it can be used to make various dishes,” she said.

Things are easy for entrepreneur Vjay Dhole as he has a terrace garden which has all the fresh vegetables. “We are avoiding stocking up our pantry. We pluck fresh vegetables from our terrace garden and make delicious meal at home. Proper meal planning is the need of the hour. Wastage must be avoided, as there are people who sleep hungry every day,” he said.

Poonam Khatri, a homemaker, said, “We are lucky that we have a small grocery store right next to our apartment. Hence, we are not stocking things up. But I make sure to prepare masala khichdi, which can be used the next morning as breakfast.”

A group of vendors gathered and abused NDS squad despite Section 144 prevailing in the city,” the officials said.

Video shows the group of vendors abusing NDS squad, physically pushing them and forcing them to return.

This is the first time I am away from my family, which was disappointing. My daughter studying in Std VIII standard, however, compensated by trying her hand at sweets with my mother-in-law,” said the wife of the first Covid-19 patient in Nagpur.She added that she would be getting new year gift as her husband told her that he would be getting discharged on Thursday.Echoing similar sentiments, the second positive patient said that being away from home during such occasions is certainly painful, but being in a joint family has an advantage. “I am happy at the maturity shown by my family members, who are all in quarantine because of me, and also by my friends, relatives and neighbours. They’re maintaining restraint and not venturing outside. I had apprehended that we may face social stigma, but fortunately it didn’t happen with my family members,” he said.Expressing concern over his two daughters, who’re confused on their condition, the second patient says all these happenings may have a psychological impact on their tender minds in the long term. “However, being in a joint family has its advantages, and my family members are taking their good care,” he says.Like the other two, the third patient is also upset over being in the isolation ward and not being able to celebrate the occasion. “I am staying with my parents and obviously they are missing me. But I am content after watching the entire hospital staff working for us day and night that included doctors, nurses and others. They take very good care of us without caring for festivals or their families. They clean our rooms thrice a day despite facing threat of getting infected,” he says.After testing negative in the subsequent tests, all four are hoping to be discharged after 14 days of isolation, which they term as ‘vanvas’ or exile. While the first patient is likely to be discharged on Friday, the second and third would be released on Saturday.The wife of the first patient, however, would take a couple of days more to be released, as her fourth test was inconclusive.

Agencies said a suicide bomber struck the gurdwara and the so-called Islamic State, which has targeted Sikhs earlier in Afghanistan, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement.However, the Sikh residents of Kabul, including one devotee who was in the gurdwara at the time of the attack, told TOI over the phone that multiple terrorists were seen at the time of the attack.A Sikh resident, who did not wish to be named, said pilgrims had assembled at the gurdwara to pray for the well-being of humanity and the elimination of coronavirus when they were attacked. India reacted by saying that such ""cowardly attacks"" on places of religious worship of the minority community, especially at this time of the Covid-19 pandemic, reflected the ""diabolical mindset"" of the perpetrators and their backers. ""I am saddened by the terror attack at the gurdwara in Kabul. I express my condolences to the families of all the deceased,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.The attack comes against the backdrop of the US-Taliban peace deal. The agreement doesn't cover IS operatives though. The Taliban issued a statement denying it had anything to do with the attack.

Rajkot: The 21-day nationwide lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday was almost complete in Saurashtra’s commercial capital as well as other cities of Saurashtra.

All the major roads were deserted with people adhering to Modi’s ‘stay at home’ call.

However, six FIRs were lodged in the city and 22 in the rural areas for the violation of the public notification regarding prohibitory orders.

According to police, most of the FIRs lodged were related to shops of non-essential commodities that remained open despite the lockdown . Police had operated several auto rickshaws in the residential area announcing that people were prohibited from venturing outside of the house.

All the major markets too observed a complete shutdown in the city. The shops selling essential commodities remained open for few hours of morning and evening which resulted in crowds at many places. The shop owners are not allowing more people to enter and people have to wait in queue outside. Police also made circles on the road outside some of the shops asking customers to maintaining adequate distance.

NAGPUR: Sandip Dashesar was having heated arguments with an ambulance driver in front of CIIMS hospital in the city on Tuesday. The driver was demanding Rs5,500 to drive back his father to his native place near Bhilai in Chhattisgarh .

“Ambulance from the same service charged Rs2,500 when we came to Nagpur some ten days ago. Just because we can’t go back in any other vehicle now, they are demanding more than double money,” he said. The driver was firm on the new rates and finally, Dashesar had to settle on Rs4,500.

Many patients and their relatives coming from parts of Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh, and Telangana to Nagpur for medical treatment are facing such problems, although, travelling for medical purpose is not banned during the lockdown. After district borders were sealed, patients and their relatives from neighbouring districts are also facing such difficulties.

Nagpur is Central India’s medical hub and receives hundreds of patients from all parts of Vidarbha, Marathwada and neighboring states daily.

The super specialty hospital and trauma care centre attached to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) are preferred by poor patients as they get benefits of many government schemes here.

Private super specialty hospitals like CIIMS, Meditrina, New Era and Alexis also provide benefits of government health schemes and receive such patients. But during lockdown, these patients and their relatives are facing problems right from accommodation, travelling, and now food too.

“We have 16 patients in the ICU at present. Hotels and lodges are closed. So, their relatives are left with no option but to stay in hospitals. We are arranging accommodation for them in our basements, and in vacant wards,” said Dr Sameer Paltewar of Meditrina Hospital.

As the number of patients reporting to these hospitals has gone down due to the lockdown, most relatives can get accommodation within hospital premises.

“Those having their personal vehicles can also drive back to their places. Discharge card and a letter from the hospital is must. Police may stop them for enquiry, but will let them proceed after showing these documents,” said Dr Anand Sancheti of New Era Hospital.

While private hospitals are arranging accommodation and managing travel facilities for their patients, GMCH and Mayo Hospital are facing a different type of problem. As both hospitals are treating positive patients of the Covid-19, other patients are reluctant to visit here.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, only 170 patients got themselves admitted to the GMCH which is not even half of usual daily count. Similarly, only 1,386 patients reported to the Out Patient department (OPD) of the GMCH in the last two days as against the daily count of 2,500. The condition is Mayo hospital is also similar. Authorities, however, said that the count is not going down due to Covid-19 stigma.

“Non availability of public transport could be the reason behind this. We have also postponed many planed surgeries. Due to this, many patients are not getting admitted,” said a senior doctor in Trauma Care Centre.

Social activist Trisharan Sahare said that patients who want to go back to their native places after treatment should get government ambulances. “We have many 108 ambulances these days. The government should arrange them for these poor patients coming from different states,” he said.

Without the chaos and cacophony of traffic, all that was left now was the idly parked police vehicles.Sitabuldi, between Samvidhan square and Jhansi Rani square, has quietened beyond imagination with only police barricades partially blocking the roads. Apart from checking an occasional biker or motorist straying into Variety Square, the cops are not left with much to do apart from chatting among themselves or happily tik-toking on mobile phones.Though the display board revealing the noise and sound pollution levels was not functioning, the earlier skewed parameters of the city’s environmental benchmarks must have improved beyond doubt. It was so silent the sound of giggling women cops from the other side of the road and their banter could easily be heard. The other sounds that could be heard here is the announcements regarding coronavirus and how to avoid contracting it.With no vehicles, the stray canines and occasional bovines too were found ambling around looking for some eatables.Amid the calm, vehicles of Good Samaritan citizens and their groups visited the place offering cops tea, biscuits, chhaas, snacks, food and also doses of sanitizers on their hands.

NEW DELHI: The Covid-19 contagion spread to Goa (three cases reported) and northeast India, where Manipur and Mizoram confirmed one case each, even as 20 states and UTs on Wednesday reported 94 fresh infections — the second highest for a single day after 99 cases on Monday.Two more deaths, one of an 85-year-old woman in Ahmedabad and another in Tamil Nadu, took the national toll from the virus to 13. The health ministry clarified that the death it had reported in Delhi on Tuesday was not a Covid-19 case.The total coronavirus cases in India stood at 656, as reported by states. At least 60 daily cases have been reported in the past five days. A total of 56 patients have recovered so far, eight on Wednesday. The health ministry has confir med 606 cases and 10 deaths so far. The three positive cases in Goa are all male, aged 25, 29 and 55, respectively.

421,['26/03/2020'],PWD workers risking their safety at MLA Hostel in Nagpur,"Representative image

NAGPUR: For the last 10 days, the Public Works Department ( PWD ) is unable to find safety kits for its workers who are serving food, cleaning rooms and attending to inmates at the MLA Hostel, where around 159 flyers have been quarantined.

Officials said workers are scared of entering rooms without safety kits but they are left with no choice due to the intense pressure from the district administration to ensure that there are no lapses in providing facilities to those quarantined.

PWD executive engineer Janardhan Bhanuse said the district collector has been informed about the need for kits. The agency is even ready to make the purchase on its own, but the problem is that the kits are not available.

“We have sent requests everywhere, right from the government departments to medical institutions. There is a shortage on e-commerce websites too,” Bhanuse said.

Work can’t be stopped as only selected workers are authorized to enter the hostel. “As of now, we do have some kits, but they are not enough. We will soon run out of kits,” he said.

A kit includes a mask, a skull cap, a pair of gloves, a synthetic apron, gum boots and sanitisers for personal as well as general use like cleaning the premises.

Officials said the PWD was suddenly roped in after the administration failed to find an alternative. “The agency was not given enough time to make preparations. The affairs are being run on whatever last moment arrangements could be done as far as safety is concerned. We had to convince our staffers that patients wouldn’t be kept but only passengers would be brought to quarantine them,” a worker said.

An official said 25 to 30 kits are urgently needed. “There are several disposal items which can’t be used by others. Medical stores and pharmaceuticals companies, too, have declined our requests,” the official said.

The official also blamed the deputy director of health services for ignoring the safety of workers at MLA hostel. “When we asked for sanitizers and gloves, they said the items were not available,” the official said.

In the morning, four men and four women enter the building to render housekeeping services. Four men serve food and dispose the leftover in three shifts. Two more frequently enter the premises to attend to day long calls, the PWD contractor said.

“After the shift, they are asked to take a shower with a special liquid and wash their clothes. We know that these are only passengers but what if they turn out to be carriers,” he said.

PUNE: As many as 2,531 samples, which constitute 84% of the total samples taken from presumptive or suspected persons for Covid-19, have tested negative, state health minister Rajesh Tope said on Wednesday.Tope said this was a “good sign” but cautioned that the fight was far from over. It is an indication that the state has not hit the third phase or community transmission stage, he pointed out.On Wednesday, the state registered 122 positive cases with five new ones reported in Mumbai and one in Thane.The samples that turned negative were from among the 2,988 persons tested in the state since January 18. The reports of 335 samples are still awaited.“We are reaching out to the entire state through our tagline, “Main hi mera rakshak” (I am my own saviour).

Of these, 692 tested negative and 37 were positive. It means about 93% of the cases are not coronavirus infected.Tope said, “This is a good sign as we are able to curtail the spread. Those who tested positive have travelled to high-risk countries and were the first contacts. The samples that tested negative were of suspected persons or those in close interaction with these first contacts which means social distancing has helped. The lockdown announced by the Prime Minister till April 14, section 144 and overall awareness will help prevent cases from rising.”So far, 11 patients have been discharged after they tested negative in the second test as per the WHO guidelines. Eight of them were from Mumbai, two from Pune and one from Aurangabad.The discharged persons have gone through proper intervention and monitoring during their hospital stay.

MUMBAI: A 36-year-old moneylender from Kurla, who allegedly raped a 29-year-old woman in his car in Wadala, was arrested by Wadala police on Tuesday.

Sunil Gangaram Anna alias Reddy, a resident of New Mill Road in Kurla, was arrested under Indian Penal Code sections for rape, outraging modesty of a woman, assault and threats, and was remanded to police custody.

The victim, who is unmarried, does odd jobs, and police said she had in 2017 taken a loan of Rs50,000 on 5% interest from Reddy. Mid-2018, she took another loan of more than Rs 1 lakh and gave two cheques, her property documents, ration and Aadhaar cards as security.

“As per the agreement, she was to repay him Rs20,000 per month and was to return the entire amount by February 2020 but failed,’’ said an official. She was to pay him Rs 5.7 lakh with interest, and when she defaulted, Reddy started calling and threatening her. In January, Reddy called her to a hotel in Kurla, and said he would help her get the entire loan amount from a credit society in Wadala, only if she returned all his money.

When the victim agreed, he took her in his car to a credit co-operative society near Mumbai Port Trust, and the society agreed to giver her a loan of Rs 2 lakh, police said. While returning, he allegedly offered to drop her at Sion railway station and, on the way, allegedly touched her inappropriately.

He then allegedly raped her in the car. He threatened her, dropped her off at Sion station, and fled, police said. She complained to police few weeks later.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

424,['26/03/2020'],Salt-making comes to a halt in Kutch,"Rajkot: Salt manufacturing has come to halt as a result of the lockdown, which adds to the fear that this may impact the demand of edible salt in the near future.

According to the manufacturers, the present stock is enough to last one week, but after that they will have to start production to meet the demand in the country. Kutch accounts for 80 percent production of India’s total salt needs.

Kutch sends 7,000 tonnes edible salt every day across the country by rail network. Kutch, Santalpur and Kharaghoda are the main producers of salt in Gujarat. Salt is also used in production of caustic soda which is a raw material used in making sanitizers.

Vice president of Indian Salt Manufacturing Association (ISMA), Shyamji Kangad said, “We believe that if we can halt production for one week, but after will face shortage of salty if production does not start soon afterwards. We will represent the government after a week to allow us to start production and by that period the purpose of isolation will also be served.”

There are nearly 15,000 people working in the salt manufacturing industry in Kutch. Even export of salt has been affected as for the last three months there has been no export due to Coronavirus. According to the exporters, export has reduced by 2 lakh tonne per month and if the situation continues in the same manner, salt will pile up by May.

434,['26/03/2020'],Supply of essentials takes a hit as goods vehicles stay off roads in Kolkata,"Many shops in Gariahat remained closed on Wednesday after running out of stock

KOLKATA: Many wholesale outlets in Posta and Burrabazar — the main source of rice, atta, maida, sugar, potatoes and oil — remained shut on Wednesday as small goods vehicles, an important link in the delivery chain, were off the road allegedly following instructions from police.

This impacted the availability of essential edibles in retail markets where flour and sugar went out of stock on Wednesday. While shop owners said more staples could go off the shelf if the supply chain is not revived, wholesalers claimed they had enough stock but nobody to ferry the goods.

After a meeting on Wednesday afternoon, when chief minister Mamata Banerjee stressed that action will be taken against cops who stop vehicles carrying essential items, Lalbazar hinted they might introduce a pass system.

“The administration has been assuring people that these supplies won’t be affected, but the situation on the ground is different. If corrective measures are not taken, it will trigger more panic buying,” said Siddharta Roy, a resident of Kavi Raj Row off Central Avenue.

Abhinay Tiwary, general secretary of the Burrabazar Posta Goods Vehicles Owners’ association, said the drivers could not even bring vehicles out of the stands. “The cops forced them to park their vehicles and chased the drivers away at many places in Burrabazar. The drivers have refused to ferry goods from Posta and Burrabazar. If drivers are given passes, it will resolve the issues to a large extent,” said Tiwary.

The unavailability of manpower posed yet another challenge. “Most of the staff are from suburban areas but they cannot come because of the lockdown. It is not possible for us to lift so many sacks of rice, flour and sugar and load them on vehicles,” said a shopowner.

In orders sent to all divisional commissioners, ACPs and OCs, Lalbazar iterated on Wednesday evening that trucks carrying essential commodities should not be stopped.

Talking to TOI, special CP Jawed Shamim and joint CP (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar said they expected the teething problems to be solved in a day or two. “Movement of essential commodities is as much a priority as keeping people indoors. We are doing everything to smoothen the process,” said Sarkar.

At Howrah’s main vegetable and fish markets, police made a four-hour window (5am-9am) for business. After 9am, cops forced vegetable sellers to wind up and warned them that force would be used if they did not listen. Cops stood guard at the markets to ensure that people did not come back. Vegetable markets at Ichhapur and Dumurjala did not function on Wednesday.

MUMBAI: Your city may have the notoreity of being heartless, but the lockdown is bringing the city’s humane side to the fore as locals and social organisations continue to do their bit to help people in need as well as those on the frontlines combating the pandemic.

In Dadar (east), the Naigaon Sarvajanik Navratrostav Mandal, at Dadar (E), started providing tea and breakfast to 70 policemen at Bhoiwada police station from Wednesday and will continue to do still till March 31. The mandal’s former president, Datta Divekar, said they have requested officials of various stores to provide ingredients to prepare tea.

The cost of the ingredients will be borne by the mandal, but he refused to reveal the amount they would have to shell out. “The cost does not matter at this point. What we will have to shell out is insignificant if you compare the altruistic service that police personnel at the forefront are rendering,” said Divekar.

“Until Wednesday, for at least two days, the police personnel had been deprived of even as much as a cup of tea in the evening...,” he said.

It’s a similar story of compassion and brotherhood being repeated elsewhere in the city. A group of friends comprising lawyers andsocial workers from Mira-Bhayander have come together under the banner ‘We Group’ to provide essential commodities to families of daily-wage labourers in the twin city.

They distributed rice, dal, flour, oil, salt, sugar and biscuits to 54 families. The stock is expected to last for about two weeks, said Sailesh Mishra, a social worker. The cost for each family has worked out to around Rs 600 and the group has sought donations from people.

They have taken permission from Mira-Bhayander Municipal Corporation. The volunteers said they are following all precautions in the wake of Covid-19.

MUMBAI: Government officials instructed petrol pump owners on Wednesday to serve vehicles dealing with essential and emergency services on priority, sources said. Thus, private vehicles may now find themselves spending more time at pumps. Private car owners and bikers were even turned away at some locations on Wednesday.

A pump owner said though a directive was issued to sell petrol and diesel only to essential service vehicles, it would be difficult to identify them. “Police must be deployed at pumps to identify which vehicles are of essential services. Our attendants will not be able to do that,” said Ravi Shine, a petrol pump owner from Ghatkopar (E).

M Venkat Rao of Petrol Dealers’ Association, the umbrella organisation of most pumps in the region, told TOI business at almost all pumps was down by 90%. “We are also facing a staff shortage, and there is no point having all pumps open from 7am to 7pm. The government should identify prominent ones, mainly owned by oil marketing companies, at strategic locations to serve essential service vehicles. Others should be allowed to shut down,” he said in a fresh letter to the city collector.

He said there was a potential “health hazard” for those working at pumps in view of the coronavirus threat. He added that while pumps will serve needs of essential services, they will also protect employees.

“Petrol pump dealers have reported staff attendance of not even 10%. We have requested government to advise police personnel to allow our staff who have valid IDs to reach their work places. BEST buses should be advised to carry our staff too,” he said.

Oil marketing companies have begun to regulate supply of petrol and diesel on alternate days as there is less demand at pumps. “This will not result in any dryouts but will help with social distancing in view of the coronavirus threat,” said Rao.

There are more than 200 pumps in the Mumbai region.

Police said the accused, identified as Usman Kachcha (25) and Kanuji Soni (24), had murdered Musar Gurung (55), with the intention of robbery. “The accused duo looted two gold rings, two imitation jewellery and a bag from the deceased, thinking it contains valuables. However, the bag contained property papers only,” said R N Khant, inspector with Bhuj B division police station.

Kachcha was identified by his girlfriend Niruta Gurung, who is also the niece of the deceased. She saw him in a CCTV footage along with Soni. Kachcha had once visited Gurung’s house along with Niruta.

“Kachcha surveyed Gurung’s house and observed that he was living all alone. Thinking that he might have got a good amount of valuables, he plotted the loot plan along with Soni. Then both the accused executed the loot and murder on the night of March 20,” said Khant.

Gurung’s body was found lying in a pool of blood by his nephew Suraj Gurung (19), Niruta’s brother, who had come to visit Gurung from Gandhidham on March 21 evening.

LUCKNOW: UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath carried the idol of Ram Lalla from the makeshift temple under a tent to a resplendent temporary abode of wood and bulletproof glass in 'brahma muhurt' before the break of dawn on Wednesday.

The shifting of Ram Lalla's idol - for the first time in 28 years - from the makeshift temple took place on the first day of Chaitra Navaratra and marked the completion of the first phase of temple construction at Ram Janmabhoomi .

CM Yogi offered prayers and also donated a cheque of Rs 11 lakh from his personal account in favour of the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust for the construction of the temple, more than four months after the Supreme Court delivered verdict in its favour.

""The idol was placed on a silver ' singhaasan ' (throne) amid chanting of mantras and other rituals,"" said trust general secretary and Vishwa Hindu Parishad vice-president, Champat Rai, who was also present on the occasion.

""Ram Lalla idol was draped in new clothes and then puja and aarti were performed in the presence of UP CM. Later, darshan of Lord Ram ensued,"" Rai added.

Ankit Kumar, a contractual labourer, had walked all night — for about 10 hours — when TOI spoke to him on Wednesday morning. “My home in Saharanpur is 135 km from Meerut. With no income for the past few days and no hope of any in the coming month, I had no option but to leave,” said Kumar. He will have to walk some more.

In Uttarakhand, Moorat Lal — who has had one meal in two days — will cycle 800 km from Dehradun to Raebareli . Along with eight others, the 30-year-old has covered 90 km and reached Laksar (Haridwar) on Wednesday. Tonight, this crew of plumbers, electricians and carpenters, would be taking shelter at the railway station. There’s 700 more km to go. Among them, they have less than 2,000 rupees. “It might take five days to reach, unless we are stopped by police. But we can’t go back. There’s nothing there for us,” said Lal.

With Covid-19 lockdown robbing daily wagers and labourers of their income, thousands across India are walking long distances, over 100 kilometres in many cases, and often on empty stomachs to reach their native villages and towns.

In Agra, closure of tourism and footwear industry which employs scores of daily wagers has left many in dire straits. UP CM Yogi Adityanath has announced Rs 1,000 monthly allowance each for around 35 lakh labourers, hawkers and vendors and free ration to 1.65 crore daily wagers, but many that TOI spoke to said they had no information about this.

With no money and no work, those working in bordering states are desperate to make it home. Mohammad Kasim and five others managed to reach Aligarh from Palwal (Haryana) after 28 hours of being on the road, walking and hitchhiking on trucks. “We ate biscuits and bananas as we didn’t have money for proper meals,” he said.

Gaurav Kumar, who worked at a shoe manufacturing company in Haridwar, said about 200 of them left on Tuesday night — hours after the 21-day lockdown was announced — to reach Bijnor in UP. “Even the children walked,” he said. Another person, Yaseen, travelled with his friends in an empty milk tanker to Najibabad.

In Rudrapur, Madan (who only uses his first name) was trying to make the trip with a five-monthold infant to Bareilly but was turned back. He was, however, adamant that he would try to leave again. “I don’t have money to feed my family as I have not got any work for past five days. I have no option,” he said.

Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Singh Rawat released a helpline number where migrant workers can seek assistance to reach their hometowns. Some good samaritans have also extended a helping hand. A local journalist went out of his way to drop a labourer who was planning to walk from Haridwar to Chamba, 90 km away. He then picked up another woman, who works at a hotel in Devprayag, and drove her to Rishikesh.

444,['26/03/2020'],Kolkata: Fear grips health workers in absence of protective gear,"KOLKATA: Foot soldiers in the fight against coronavirus — doctors, nurses and health workers — are extremely worried about falling prey to easy transmission from Covid-19 patients in the absence of adequate protective gear (personal pretection equipment or PPE) at city hospitals. The concern has been triggered by a shortage of PPE — masks, gloves and go-wns, which are now mandatory for medics — at several private and state hospitals in the city.Murmurs of discontent have been getting louder across hospital corridors in Kolkata ever since PPE supplies started drying up last week following a sudden spurt in demand. The first public vent came on Wednesday when a section of nurses at the Beliaghata ID Hospital — epicentre of the state’s fight against the outbreak — demanded more PPE cover and threatened ceasework. They alleged they were being forced to work without PPE and made to travel in ambulances carrying Covid-19 suspects. They were pacified and made to ret-urn to work with the assurance that their grievances would be addressed.Wary of treating suspects without proper gear, many doctors across city hospitals have reportedly asked patients to visit later. A couple of surgeons even refused to conduct operations on suspected Covid-19 patients without proper measures fearing infection. This could be dangerous and help to prolong the outbreak, felt several senior medics in Kolkata.At least five private hospitals in the city are short of PPE. Another said it has got stock to last just a week. “Many of my colleagues are scared to attend to patients without the gear. We are using the PPEs sparingly and many are even operating without them, though it’s extremely risky. As per protocol, every Covid 19 suspect has to be treated like a positive patient till a test rules out infection. We had to convince some of our colleagues to treat these patients. Their fear is understandable since each one of us has a family at home and we could now be at the starting point of a spurt in the number of infected. The fear could be mitigated if we have enough PPEs at our disposal,” said a private hospital consultant.“Even with the gear on, doctors are wary since they are mingling with other hospital staff who are not always using protective gear. As the number of infected rises, the fear will grow and many will be turned away without treatment,” said another private hospital doctor.At a south Kolkata private hospital, some 50-odd medics have stopped visiting the outpatient department since last week citing lack of patients. The hospital authorities tried to get them to return but failed. “Since there has been an explosion in demand for masks, PPEs have turned scarce. We are rationing their use and unfortunately several doctors at our emergency are working without any protection. If they now refuse to attend to patients with Covid symptoms, we can’t blame them,” said a hospital spokesperson. The hospital is now worried about having enough doctors on duty at its fever clinic started on Wednesday.According to Fortis Hospital pulmonologist Raja Dhar, doctors in Kolkata are fighting a risky battle without enough protection and are extremely worried about themselves. “We have just treated six Covid 19 suspects who have all tested negative. Test reports of two more are pending. Over the next fortnight, there could be a big surge in the number of patients. Even with PPEs, transmission can’t be ruled out. We are having to tread very cautiously and all are obviously worried about preventing infection,” Dhar said.A private hospital with multiple units said its PPE stock is ‘nowhere near enough’. “Any hospital taking in suspect cases will need at least 20-30 PPEs everyday. We have got just 100 for one unit from the government,” said a representative of the hospital. He, however, added that since there is an acute shortage, the hospital is exploring other sources to procure PPEs.RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) is trying to procure PPEs from all possible sources. “Hopefully, we will be able to get some in the next 2-3 days. At this stage, we are able to provide these to doctors whenever necessary,” said RTIICS zonal director R Venkatesh.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74820446,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-168748,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fear-grips-health-workers-in-absence-of-protective-gear/articleshow/74819723.cms

Essential commodities, and the home delivery of such items, have been kept out of the lockdown purview, she reminded at Nabanna on Wednesday.Late on Wednesday, health department sources said there was one more confirmed case at a private hospital in Kolkata.Banerjee asked people engaged in emergency trade and services to get in touch with local police stations and the state police headquarters at Lalbazar. “The police will issue passes to traders, who will distribute the passes to delivery boys,” she said.The CM took note of teething problems in enforcing “complete safety regulations” in and around the city. “Supply of essential commodities has to be there,” she said. “Delivery boys should be allowed to work. No one should stop vegetable vendors. Farmers should be allowed to work, two to three at a time. Those found obstructing these people will be taken to task.”Banerjee — unlike the Telangana government that has warned it would issue “shoot-on-sight” orders against those trying to break the lockdown — said her government wanted to enforce the regulation with a humane face. “We are not going to enforce the lockdown with an iron hand. People have to survive,” she said.The CM also hinted at some “relaxations” after a review on March 31. “The state government has powers to announce relaxations to the lockdown. Poila Baisakh (the Bengali New Year), comes within the regulation period. But we may consider it after taking stock of the situation on March 31,” she said. The Bengali New Year starts on April 14, the last day of the announced lockdown.Banerjee also acknowledged the plight of senior citizens in housing complexes, and appealed to housing committees to help them out with buying essentials. “I urge housing committees to help out senior citizens in their complex. These people can’t go to the grocery store for essentials. Committee members can help them out,” she said. Pavement dwellers, she added, were being shifted to night shelters.In view of businesses taking a hit due to the lockdown, the CM appealed to citizens and NRIs to stand by the people and the government at such an “extraordinary situation” and donate to the Emergency Relief Fund set up by the state government.“We haven’t got anything from the Centre yet. The government has been straining its coffers to run its social sector schemes even after a huge debt servicing of Rs 50,000 crore annually. We have set up a Rs 200 crore fund to fight the pandemic, which is not enough,” she said.The government has placed orders for four lakh personal protection equipment, mainly for health workers, two lakh surgical masks, 300 ventilators, 200 infrared thermometers and three ECMO machines, Banerjee said. They are, however, yet to reach the state’s healthcare facilities. A section of nurses at the Beliaghata ID Hospital reached out to the superintendent to complain that they can’t run the service without protective gear. Banerjee also addressed the difficulties faced by the state government regarding diagnosis. “We are yet to get permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to set up three laboratories in the state to undertake swab tests of patients,” she said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74820439,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-362135,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cm-asks-cops-to-issue-spl-passes-for-delivery-agents/articleshow/74819719.cms

And yet, the very same medical professionals who are lauded on social media by day are shunned by night at their societies, apartment complexes and rented houses when they return home from hospitals. Yes. we are talking about medicos who are met with discrimination ever since COVID-19 scare hit the state. “We’re being applauded with salutes on social media but in the real world, nobody wants to come near us,” say junior doctors , interns and medical students, who are working round the clock in the fight against coronavirus On Tuesday, Ahmed Uzair, a house surgeon from Warangal , took the Internet by storm when he wrote about how many doctors in the city are being asked to vacate their rented homes because people feel “doctors staying in their homes will make them more susceptible to the virus.” “One owner said that we were dirty. We were evicted without any notice and most of the doctors are now stranded on the roads with their luggage, with nowhere to go. Our campus hostels too are being converted into isolation wards,” Ahmed posted on his Facebook page.Like Ahmed, many doctors from across the country shared similar experiences of facing discrimination at their colonies or on the streets. Raghavi Latha, an intern at Nampally Government Hospital, says she might not have a home to live in after two months. “I stay at a paying guest accommodation in Ashok Nagar and my landlord is scared that I might bring the virus from the hospital. Thankfully, I have a signed agreement for the next two months so he cannot ask me to leave right away, but he has already indicated that I’ll have to make alternate arrangements once the contract runs out. It breaks my heart that we’re being kicked out of homes despite working selflessly round the clock to take care of the ill,” she says.Doctors who don’t have their own vehicles to commute in also faced discrimination while travelling in public transport before the lockdown was announced. Madhuri Ravi, a house surgeon at Gandhi hospital, says, “When patients who tested positive for coronavirus started getting shifted to isolation wards at Gandhi hospital, we noticed the traffic around the hospital almost disappeared. People ran away from us like we’re the plague. Autos refused to take me back home and cab drivers would cancel the ride looking at my pick-up location. They would think that because the hospital hascoronavirus patients, the doctors too are infected.”While the country is in lockdown mode for the next three weeks and public transport is non-functional, the discrimination of young medical professionals continues in other ways. “After the coronavirus outbreak in Hyderabad, people started thinking that every doctor treats only corona infected patients. I play with kids in my neighbourhood everyday but for the last couple of weeks, they stopped coming near me. I was told their parents asked them to stay away from me since Iwork in a hospital,” shares Swetha Sivalenka, a fourth year medical student from Hyderabad, adding, “Now, there is a lockdown. but still when people see a white coat and a mask, they get scared. Even when I go out to buy groceries or other essentials, people seem to be extremely wary of my presence and are uncomfortable around me. This ignorance and discrimination are disheartening.”The discrimination faced by healthcare professionals was condemned by the government with Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan taking to social media to express his concern. “I’m feeply angusshed to see reports pouring in from Delhi, Noida,Warangal,Chennai etc that doctors & paramedics are being ostracised in residential complexes & societies. Landlords are threatening to evict them fearing #COVID2019 infection. Pls don’t panic ! #CoronavirusLockdown (sic),” the Health Minister tweeted, adding, “All precautions are being taken by doctors & staff on #COVID2019 duty to ensure they’re not carriers of infection in anyway. Any harsh steps will demoralise them, derail the system.On Sunday,nation applauded their selfless services.

Yes. we are talkingabout medicos who are met with discrimination ever since COVID-19 scare hit the state. “We’re being applauded with salutes on social media but in the real world, nobody wants to come near us,” say junior doctors , interns and medical students, who are working round the clock in the fight against coronavirus On Tuesday, Ahmed Uzair, a house surgeon from Warangal , took the Internet by storm when he wrote about how many doctors in the city are being asked to vacate their rented homes because people feel “doctors staying in their homes will make them more susceptible to the virus.” “One owner said that we were dirty. We were evicted without any notice and most of the doctors are now stranded on the roads with their luggage, with nowhere to go. Our campus hostels too are being converted into isolation wards,” Ahmed posted on his Facebook page.Like Ahmed, many doctors from across the country shared similar experiences of facing discrimination at their colonies or on the streets. Raghavi Latha, an intern at Nampally Government Hospital, says she might not have a home to live in after two months. “I stay at a paying guest accommodation in Ashok Nagar and my landlord is scared that I might bring the virus from the hospital. Thankfully, I have a signed agreement for the next two months so he cannot ask me to leave right away, but he has already indicated that I’ll have to make alternate arrangements once the contract runs out. It breaks my heart that we’re being kicked out of homes despite working selflessly round the clock to take care of the ill,” she says.Doctors who don’t have their own vehicles to commute in also faced discrimination while travelling in public transport before the lockdown was announced. Madhuri Ravi, a house surgeon at Gandhi hospital, says, “When patients who tested positive for coronavirus started getting shifted to isolation wards at Gandhi hospital, we noticed the traffic around the hospital almost disappeared. People ran away from us like we’re the plague. Autos refused to take me back home and cab drivers would cancel the ride looking at my pick-up location. They would think that because the hospital hascoronavirus patients, the doctors too are infected.”While the country is in lockdown mode for the next three weeks and public transport is non-functional, the discrimination of young medical professionals continues in other ways. “After the coronavirus outbreak in Hyderabad, people started thinking that every doctor treats only corona infected patients. I play with kids in my neighbourhood everyday but for the last couple of weeks, they stopped coming near me. I was told their parents asked them to stay away from me since Iwork in a hospital,” shares Swetha Sivalenka, a fourth year medical student from Hyderabad, adding, “Now, there is a lockdown. but still when people see a white coat and a mask, they get scared. Even when I go out to buy groceries or other essentials, people seem to be extremely wary of my presence and are uncomfortable around me. This ignorance and discrimination are disheartening.”The discrimination faced by healthcare professionals was condemned by the government with Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan taking to social media to express his concern. “I’m feeply angusshed to see reports pouring in from Delhi, Noida,Warangal,Chennai etc that doctors & paramedics are being ostracised in residential complexes & societies. Landlords are threatening to evict them fearing #COVID2019 infection. Pls don’t panic ! #CoronavirusLockdown (sic),” the Health Minister tweeted, adding, “All precautions are being taken by doctors & staff on #COVID2019 duty to ensure they’re not carriers of infection in anyway. Any harsh steps will demoralise them, derail the system.On Sunday,nation applauded their selfless services. It’s our bounden duty 2 keep their morale high (sic).”",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/coronascare-casualty-medicos-face-discrimination/articleshow/74812550.cms
449,['26/03/2020'],Veteran lensman Nemai Ghosh dies,"Kolkata: When acclaimed photographer Nemai Ghosh breathed his last at his Kolkata residence on Wednesday due to cardiac respiratory failure, many referred to it as the end of a legend who among other attributes was known as Satyajit Ray’s Boswell and the only Indian lensman to have photographed director Michaelangelo Antonioni at work. Ghosh, a Padma Shri recipient, was 86 and is survived by wife Sibani, son Satyaki and daughter Sharmistha.

Even last September, Ghosh had asked his photographer son to keep just one camera for him at home. “The rest he had given to me. But when he suffered a fall at home in November, he asked me to take away everything,” Satyaki said, remembering his father’s last request. “He had asked me to do something with black and white films,” added Mumbai-based Satyaki, who wouldn’t be able to attend the last rites because of national lockdown.

However, it was theatre and not photography that was the first vocation of Ghosh, who was born on May 8, 1934 in Kolkata. While working as a theatre actor with the likes of Utpal Dutt and Rabi Ghosh, it was the receipt of a still camera left behind in a taxi that changed his course of life.

Through common friends, he ended up on the sets of Ray’s ‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne’. Impressed with the angles of his photographs, Ray asked him to click photos for him. He continued till 1992. In Ghosh’s words, the Rays were the “best models” he had ever had. In his kitty also lies a rare series of some unseen “romantic” photos which the couple agreed to click on their wedding anniversary (October 20).

Yet, director Sandip Ray wouldn’t limit Ghosh’s treasure trove to just his father’s 90,000 photos. “He photographed Kolkata, the world of theatre and tribals. He had gone to meet French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson,” Sandip remembered.

Alongside photos of Italian director Antonioni while the latter was painting, Ghosh also filmed Ritwik Ghatak, Mrinal Sen, Goutam Ghose, Roland Joffe and Mira Nair. Then, there are his exemplary visual essays in ‘The Faces of Indian Art: Through the lens of Nemai Ghosh’ and his four books with painter Paresh Maity. A copy of the yet-to-be-released book titled ‘Paresh Maity: A Portrait of the Artist in the World’ had reached Ghosh some days back.

“Simplicity was the hallmark of his works,” Maity said. “This book, a visual journey of two artists for 25 years where we travelled across the globe, has him taking some 5,000 black and white photos of mine on his analogue camera,” he added. “He was like a child. Every time I went abroad, he would ask me to get black and white films. As a mark of respect, I have kept the book on the altar in my puja room.”

An ambulance destined for Kanpur with a critical patient was also stopped. Cops said people crossing the border needed to establish their urgency.Police were especially stopping private vehicles at the Noida-Delhi border, like the one in which four medical staff of Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital were travelling. One of the staffers was made to get off and walk till he crossed the border and only then they were allowed to go.Ved Pal, who was asked to get down, told TOI that the cops said that more than three persons should not be seated in the car. “I showed my I-card but was asked to get down. We are on medical duty and returning to our home in Greater Noida . I was asked to cross over the DND toll after which I boarded the car again,” he said.Similarly, a bus carrying 70-80 nurses from a leading Delhi-based private hospital was stopped for checking by police in Noida and allowed to go only after the driver informed that they were medical duty. “We are on medical duty and reside in hostels in sectors 40, 41 and 46 in Noida. We went to Delhi around 7am and were returning from there where we were stopped,” one of the nurses said. The hospital, however, has not commented.There was also a case of ambulance carrying 8-10 people being stopped and heated arguments between attendants and cops. The personnel on duty were eager to know why so many people were seated in the ambulance that was ferrying a critical patient to Kanpur.Police said they were allowing only those with medical documents or patients to pass. “There were too many people in that ambulance, but a woman shouted that it had a serious patient inside who was possibly on the death bed. It was allowed to go,” a police officer deployed at the DND said.Dr Abhimanyu Thakran, head operations (north zone) SastaSunder, a portal for online delivery of medicines was also asked to show the documents authorising him to perform the duty. “We have a warehouse in Noida out of where some 20 people are operating and providing medicines online. I was allowed to go after I showed a letter from the company.”DCP (Noida) Sankalp Sharma said the medical staff is totally exempt from the restrictions and there is no limit on the number of the staffers who can travel since they were providing medical duty.Sector 53 resident Varun claimed that he was out to buy ration and insulin from Delhi as he could not do so in Noida, but was asked by police to show his documents establishing his medical emergency. He was later allowed to go when he got his medical prescription on WhatsApp.Noida police additional DCP Ranvijay Singh said cops on the ground are stopping the people only to understand why they are on roads without documents and understand their role. “We are very liberal with the medical staff but some people tend to make excuses and those, travelling without any documents need to prove they are out for a valid reason,” he said.",noida,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74819446,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-92098,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/nurses-to-ambulances-all-stopped-at-border-by-cops/articleshow/74819423.cms

And most have been pleasantly surprised.

The city's index patients - a septuagenarian and his 68-year-old wife - began their journey home in an ambulance from Kasturba Hospital on Tuesday evening. She had been suffering from side-effects of the drugs and was too weak to stand. So, the husband was worried how to reach their second floor apartment, but above all, he was fretting about how the neighbours would react to their homecoming.

A day after, he told TOI : ""They have pleasantly surprised us. They arranged for our dinner on Tuesday night. It was simple homecooked food. They also provided us with lunch on Wednesday and someone has promised us dinner too. We are happy to be back home"". The couple had gone to Dubai as part of a 40-member tour group. They were the first to test positive from Mumbai on March 11, two days after another couple from Pune had tested positive.

In a Ghatkopar slum, the son of a 68-year-old woman was apprehensive since people in the locality had treated them as untouchables after she was detected with the infection. However, on Tuesday, when his mother returned and they showed that her reports were normal, things were better. ""It will improve once she gets fitter,"" he said with relief.

In Ulhasnagar, after a 49-year old woman and her brother were discharged and reached home on Tuesday, their families were not only relieved that they made it safely, but said people living around them also were happy.

The couple in the western suburbs has also been awed by the support of the BMC. On Wednesday morning, members from the ward office landed at their house and sanitised it. ""They have also assured us of any help, including buying medicines during the lockdown,"" said the man.

The man said: ""Our worry now is how to shop for vegetables and fruits during the lockdown. There are long queues and we cannot step out for another 14 days,"" he said.

456,['26/03/2020'],"Of 25 lakh seized masks, BMC gets 6 lakh, rest for Haffkine Institute","Home minister Anil Deshmukh with the seized masks on Tuesday

MUMBAI: With the state government grappling with acute shortage of masks to tackle the Coronavirus outbreak, the seizure of 25 lakh masks on Monday has come as a major relief.

Sources said of the 25 lakh masks worth Rs14 crore seized by the city police, the BMC commissioner, in an order dated March 24, invoked the Essential Commodities Act and took possession of six lakh masks on Wednesday. These include one lakh N-95 masks and five lakh three-ply masks.

Deputy commissioner (Zone 7), Vishwas Shankarrao, is in possession of the masks which are likely to be distributed among health workers in various BMC-run hospitals, particularly Kasturba Hospital, which is the main hospital treating the Coronavirus patients. The masks are currently stored at Andheri Sports Complex in K-ward, said a source.

The remaining 19 lakh masks will be handed over to the Haffkine Institute in Pune as per the Collector’s order.

Seized goods automatically become court property and need to be produced during trial and returned. When asked how they could distribute these seized items, police said the Essential Commodities Act empowers the BMC and the Collector to take over such property.

In wake of the shortage of masks and sanitizers in the market, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution had on March 13 issued a notification bringing masks and sanitizers under the Essential Commodities Act.

""We have videographed the seizure and followed due procedure and will produce this in court during trial,"" said a crime branch official.

Meanwhile, the crime branch probing the blackmarketing of masks is looking for the key conspirators.

The city crime branch had on Monday raided two godowns, one near the international airport at Sahar and another at Bhiwandi, and had seized the huge stash of masks. Police had arrested Balaji Muthupedi Nadar, Shahrukh Shaikh, Gulam Murtuza and Mihir Patel, a Customs House Agent. A search is on for Mihir’s father, Darshan Patel, who, along with a few others, had allegedly hoarded the masks with plans to blackmarket them.

Several elderly persons of the city, especially in the sectors, live on their own as their children are now employed in far-away towns. It’s a tough time for them as they are now left without the support of helps, cooks and in some instances, drivers too.Domestic helps are a most important support system for the elderly people as many of them could be alone after their spouses’ death. The lockdown along with no help is now forcing them to manage their homes all alone and even give care to an ailing partner at the same time.Meenakshi Sharma, a resident of Sector 21, is somehow multitasking despite her ill health. “I have been unwell for over a month and my husband suffered a heart attack two months ago. Now I’m cooking, cleaning and taking care of his medical requirements, all by myself. We are managing somehow but the lockdown announced amid Covid-19 scare, of course, is taking a toll on us,” she said.In Sector 37, Meera Khanna has been living on her own, but she usually tries to keep herself busy.“I have friends here. I meet people and have social get-togethers, so I never feel lonely or helpless. But now suddenly without helps and other supports, I am forced to cook, clean utensils, and feel very disconnected. My daughters live in Ghaziabad and South Delhi. I could have gone there but the border is sealed, and it’s not possible to go now,” Khanna said.Meena Vohra, a resident of Sector 21, who runs a community facility for elderly citizens of the city, claimed most do not have the strength to clean homes, cook meals and get all essential commodities as they do not have the habit ogf going out of the house to make purchases.“In our group, there are elderly people who are suffering from several health problems. Some are frail and others have never lived without the support of helps, cooks and drivers. So, it’s a big shift to tougher situation. We are trying to make do with those helps who live with their families and those who are available now. Some of us are cooking for a friend who is too unwell. We are trying to be there for each other,” said Vohra, who lives with her husband. Her three children live abroad.Vohra said a friend’s driver was stopped at the society gate and she had to go to the hospital. “People are facing problems.

NEW DELHI: There is still no evidence of a wider spread of novel coronavirus through community transmission, the Centre said on Wednesday on the basis of sampling of ICU cases suffering from severe influenza symptoms. These patients are outside the testing focus on persons exhibiting symptoms who have travelled abroad or have been in contact with such a person.Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) has informed that “as of now there is no community transmission,” health ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said. The official's caution underlined the concern that the highly infectious disease has the ability of rapid transmission and the situation needs to be assessed on a daily basis.Yet, the conclusion spelt relief for monitoring agencies as it was drawn based on testing of over 2,000 random samples drawn from patients hospitalised in intensive care units with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) like pneumonia over past few weeks. These patients had no history of international travel, neither were they in contact with any such person who has travelled aboard recently.While the government took proactive steps to first lock down the affected districts where positive cases were reported, and then eventually shutting down all states except for essential services, it maintained “social distancing and lockdown is essential to break the chain of transmission”, triggered by increased influx of Indians coming back mainly from the US and UK in past few weeks.Rigorous testing of persons after they exhibit symptoms and contact tracing remain the basic elements of the government's strategy to combat the spread of Covid-19. Despite stringent restrictions on international travel, nearly 64,000 persons have arrived from other countries just ahead of the complete ban on such travel. It was also seen that appeals to stay at home were not working and large number of people were heading for their homes in states from big cities, raising the prospects of the disease spreading into the hinterland.""The steps taken by us are depending on the increasing trend in number of cases,” Agarwal said. Till Wednesday, the health ministry reported a total 616 confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the country. Of this, 553 were active cases, whereas 42 were cured and one was a migrated case. Besides, 10 deaths were also reported till Wednesday.To tackle the rising burden and enable testing at a larger scale, the government has also ramped up its laboratory network in both public and private sectors. So far, there are 118 public labs with capacity to test 12000 samples a day. Besides, ICMR has also approved 29 private labs chains with 16000 collection centres.“We don’t want testing without reason,” Agarwal said, articulating the view that random testing may be a waste of resource and even deliver a large number of false negatives, encouraging people who may later develop the infection to mingle freely. The government has held that only those who develop symptoms will be tested.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74820874,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-108444,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-evidence-of-community-spread-yet-govt/articleshow/74820200.cms

MUMBAI: A total of 178 people have been booked so far for allegedly flouting orders during the lockdown period, the police said.

Despite a complete lock down being declared in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, people still wander outdoors, shops not listed as selling ‘essential’ items have been kept open and those home quarantined have violated rules by stepping out of their homes, leading to them being booked by the police.

The city police also used drones in several parts of the city to monitor the situation. Joint commissioner of police (law & order) Vinay Choubey said no untoward incident was reported. He said shoppers were being allowed to visit groceries but they were required to maintain social distancing. He said the crime rate has gone down drastically over the last couple of days.

The maximum people booked on Tuesday were those who were found keeping shops stocking non-essential commodities open.

Also, cases have been filed against hawkers who did business and restaurants that remained open, said Mumbai police spokesperson, deputy commissioner Pranaya Ashok.

After prohibitory orders were passed, the police booked 18 between March 20 and 23. While 112 was booked on a single day on Tuesday, 48 were booked on Wednesday. These cases were registered in a single day on Monday despite the curfew order that was issued by the state government to take precautions against the Covid-19 virus. Apart from the above cases, another 35 cases registered from March 18 to 21 were for keeping establishments open. The police said action was taken for flouting lockdown rules and for disobeying instructions.

Farmers prepare to reap their crops and take it to their homes.However, this year, the nationwide lockdown has dampened the new year festivities while the famers scared by coronavirus threat are staying inside their homes after having already suffered substantial losses due to hailstorm and heavy rains lashing the state in February and early March.The strict lockdown for next three weeks has further deepened the worry lines on the foreheads of farmers as their ripe crops continue to stand in the fields due to lack of reaping hands. The situation is no less worrisome in west UP, where lakhs of farmers had prepared soil beds for sowing, but plantation of sugar cane nurseries has come to a halt since the exercise is labour intensive.The Yogi Adityanath government has announced a slew of relief measures for people living in cities like providing grocery and other essentials at their doorsteps, but farmers have not got any attention of the government.As the rural population is also not to cross “Laxman rekha” of their homes for the next three weeks, the farming activities have failed to take off during the strict implementation of lockdown. Officially, in UP, Rabi crops are sown in 136 lakh hectares of agriculture land, including wheat in 100 lakh hectares, 20 lakh hectares of pulses, 10 lakh hectares oilseeds and remaining miscellaneous.Last year, the state had produced 381 lakh metric tonnes of wheat and the target for 2020 was 391 lakh metric tonnes, but the untimely hailstorm and heavy rains harmed the crop severely and now the threat of delayed harvesting may further affect foodgrain production.Speaking to TOI, agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi said he had asked his principal secretary to speak to officials in Union government to seek guidelines on how to harvest crop in midst of lock down.“Though the farmers can wait for a week or so as their wheat crop is yet to ripen.

MUMBAI: A group of people in the city and beyond has set out to check if animals and birds kept for sale in pet shops need to be rescued. They fear that these creatures of exotic species could be cooped inside cages in shops, which have been locked for at least three days amid the lockdown.

Pet shops, across the city have animals and birds, mostly of exotic varieties, cooped up in cages. It is common practice to leave them inside the shops after business shuts for the day. The largest such market is at Crawford Market.

The group was cobbled up to check if animals in pet shops need help or owners have taken them home, said Dr Deepa Katyal, who has a clinic in Chembur. “Our fear was that most pet shop owners, if not all, see this only as a trade and are not passionate about animals. Someone posted on social media that such pets could possibly be left to die of starvation,” said Dr Katyal.

In Dombivli, owners of three shops were called by police and told to cart the birds away to a safe place, said an animal activist.

Ambika Hiranandani, member and legal advisor of state animal welfare board, said she has been trying to garner police help to check on animals holed up inside pet shops. “If there are pets inside shops, the owners need to be told to keep them at home till the situation normalises, or have an attendant at the shop feed them at least twice a day,” said Hiranandani. “If not, police need to open the shops and ensure the attendants do their job,” she added.

Meet Ashar from Peta India said he fears the worst. “The animals will be starving, probably lying on their waste. With pathogens flaring up, we can soon expect a disease outbreak in the vicinity, apart from dealing with a mass graveyard.”

484,['26/03/2020'],Coronavirus: Spain surpasses China’s virus toll,"MADRID: The death toll in Spain from the coronavirus shot up by more than 700 on Wednesday, surpassing China and is now second only to Italy as the pandemic spread rapidly in Europe, with even Britain’s Prince Charles testing positive for the virus.Spain recorded a record daily increase of 738 deaths, pushing it to 3,434 overall and past China’s 3,285, the ministry of health said. The country’s infections rose by 20% to 47,610, and more than 5,000 have recovered. The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 20,000 people worldwide and infected over 4,51,355 people, according to Johns Hopkins University. Overall, more than 112,000 have recovered.Spanish media reported that 23 residents of a Madrid retirement home had died from Covid-19 or symptoms related to the new virus, news reports said. National police also arrested two people in southern Spain on Tuesday for throwing stones and other debris at a convoy of ambulances and police vehicles as 28 elderly people were being transferred from a nursing home with a high number of infections to another facility in their town.With its health system overwhelmed, Spanish hotels have been converted into hospitals and a Madrid ice rink is being used as a temporary morgue. Lawmakers were set to extend the country’s lockdown for two more weeks, to April 12.Italy has been the hardesthit nation in Europe with more than 74,386 infections and 7,503 deaths. Italian doctors are being forced to choose who will receive desperately needed ventilators and who won’t.Ger many’s parliament was set to approve later in the day a series of measures that will allow the government to offer aid totaling more than 1 trillion euros for the country of 83 million people.There are signs, however, that drastic measures to keep people away from one another can push back the spread of the illness and flatten the infection curve. In China’s Hubei province, where the outbreak was first spotted late last year, started lifting its lockdown. Some train stations and bus services reopened in Hubei and people who passed a health check were allowed to travel for the first time since January. A similar easing in the hard-hit epicenter of Wuhan is planned for April 8.For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.It is the latter cases — often requiring ventilators and specialized care _ that threaten to overwhelm hospitals. Several countries are already running short of the critical equipment needed to treat patients and keep doctors and nurses safe. Doctors are dying in Italy and Spain says 14% of its infections are health care workers.Cases edged up in countries with fragile health care systems. Virus cases in South Africa rose to 709 as the country got ready to go on lockdown on Friday.After Russia reporting 163 new cases overnight bringing total cases to 658, the country’s prime minister ordered provincial governors to move more quickly to ready hospital beds for patients as the outbreak spreads across the vast country. President Putin, too, postponed a nationwide vote on proposed constitutional amendments that include a change potentially allowing him to stay in office until 2036. Putin didn’t set a new date for the plebiscite, which was originally scheduled for April 22, saying that it would depend on how the pandemic develops in Russia. The country reported its first two deaths on Wednesday.Canada announced that it was imposing mandatory self-isolation of 14 days for those returning to Canada under the Quarantine Act.In New Zealand, the government declared an emergency before an unprecedented lockdown began. “I have one simple message for New Zealanders today as we head into the next four weeks: Stay at home,” PM Jacinda Ardern said. “It will save lives.”Pakistan halted all domestic passenger flights to stop the spread of the new coronavirus after reporting nearly 1,000 cases in the country, just as Libya became the latest at-risk Mideast nation to report its first infection.About half of Iran’s government employees were staying at home on Tuesday as the country’s death toll rose to 2,077 after 143 deaths recorded in the past 24 hours. Iran may face a second wave of the outbreak, a government spokesman said, as some Iranians ignored guidance to contain the spread.Meanwhile in Hungary, Steven Dick, deputy head of mission at the British embassy in Budapest, died of Covid-19.

LUCKNOW: Legal experts on Wednesday described 'shaming' and 'public humiliation' of those caught violating lockdown by police as against the spirit of law. They suggested that at a time when India is facing coronavirus challenge, the attempt of police should be to gain people's confidence rather than resorting to measures which may cause psychological disorder.

Six persons, who were caught violating prohibitory orders in Aliganj and Indiranagar on Tuesday and Wednesday, were booked under Section 188 of CrPC for disobeying government orders. Thereafter, they were also made to pose for photograph with posters in hand stating ""Main samaj ka dushman hun, main ghar par nahi rahunga"" (I am enemy of the society. I won't stay at home). Supreme Court lawyer and former additional solicitor-general Ashok Nigam said the criminal procedure code of India has no provision of shaming people publicly in such a manner and the law states that police have to strictly go by the CrPC. Any step by police which is not covered by CrPC is illegal.

Senior high court lawyer IB Singh said there is no law by which police can do such an act. ""This act is similar to one when the district administration had put up posters of those served with recovery orders following the violent anti-CAA protests,"" said Singh.

People, too, have described the police action as unnecessary and discriminatory. ""I saw so many people in luxury cars who were politely told by police to return to their homes whereas people in the photographs appear to be commoners,"" Ayushman Singh, a teacher, added.

However, since the entire country is in a lockdown till April 15, the state government will decide where they will be relocated till then.

Eight of them were suspected to be infected when they arrived on March 13. ""The eight people showing symptoms were taken to Kasturba Hospital for examination and later kept at the naval quarantine facility in isolation. The 36 others did not show any signs of infection during the two-week quarantine. The eight were sent for medical tests on different dates, but both reports came negative. On Thursday, the formalities will be completed for their discharge on March 27 after undergoing final examination,"" a defence spokesperson told TOI on Wednesday.

Mohammed, a tour operator who is part of the group, said many among them had a wrong impression about the military and were pleasantly surprised by the care they received.
