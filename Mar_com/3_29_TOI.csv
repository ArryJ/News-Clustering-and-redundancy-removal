0,['29/03/2020'],"Times Kitchen Tales 2: So, you want to write from home?","I began my working life in the late 1990s. For my peers and me, the natural next step after our studies was to look for a white-collared job – at an office. As the years went by though, many of us dreamt of leading a life not confined to our cubicles. Thanks to what turned out to be a happy turn of events, I was able to follow that dream. I switched careers and eventually became a freelance food writer, from being a market researcher. I often come across folks who tell me they wish they could do the same. Well, it is my duty to tell you that working from home (WFH) is not as much fun as it sounds. Especially, for writers; at the start at least. It took me a while to find my rhythm and I am happy to share some steps that worked for me.It was really difficult to motivate myself to sit down and write in the beginning. I began to miss the routine of the corporate life that I had left behind. Blogging, to me, seemed like a hobby and a waste of time; not ‘real work’. My mind-set changed as I delved into philosophical texts. Buddhism specifically, which urges one to discover one’s mission in life. I realised that I wanted to be a writer... someone who was trying to connect to people by writing about food cultures of different communities, and bringing joy to their lives. I got back to my keyboard once I had a sense of purpose. And this belief has continued to bring me back to my desk every day for the past eight years!Writers (or artists in general) like to think of themselves as free-spirited people, not bound by limits of time and space. The truth is that if writing is going to be the mainstay of your life, then you might be better off having a routine. Slot times of the day dedicated to work. Time to nap.Time to spend time with friends and family. The latter is important as the temptation to keep writing non-stop increases as you begin to enjoy what you do. How you start the day is very important. I shower and change. Even if it is into a fresh tee and jammies, not a three piece suite and tie. Not that I ever wore that. I spend time making my breakfast. You need to have some good food in your belly to write long copy on food. Do not get carried away while writing. And drink water! It’s essential to keep yourself hydrated.Talking of breakfast, the best part of working from home is that you are in charge of your meals. Try not to order in or eat out of a box. Spend time planning and making your meals if you can. You will feel much closer to the world of food that way. You will learn to appreciate it more and that will show in your writing. And in terms of health too. Conscious and mindful eating does lead to a fitter body and livelier copy. Working from home means that you can click a lot of meals in natural light, and that will make for a happy Instagram page.This brings me to my last point. The one thing that writers love most is uninterrupted peace. I have some news for you. You will not get that at home. I can guarantee that the doorbell will ring each time you sit to write. That used to bug me. Then my physio told me to take breaks and walk, as sitting continuously is not good for the back. The doorbell ensures that I do so. There will be chores you will have to look at while at home.Earlier, I felt that I was losing out on precious time by doing these chores. Now, I tell myself it’s all fine because no one works continuously even at office. When there are deadlines, I have told folks at home (primarily our house help) to imagine that I’m not at home. If that does not work, I take my Notebook and head to the neighbourhood café; which is a good thing to do if the silence and emptiness at home gets to you; not now though.

1,['29/03/2020'],Times of India,"It was in 1919 that the jumpsuit was created as practical gear to be worn by parachuters and skydivers. So quite literally, a suit for jumping. Soon, the race car drivers and flyers jumped on to the style wagon. The suit got its style chops thanks to designer Elsa Schiaparelli and Yves Saint Laurent. The former, in fact, created an easy-on, easy-off air-raid suit, complete with matching gas mask, velvet turban and flask during the World War II era. Makes one wonder if fashion is missing an opportunity to roll out the chic hazmat suit. The hazmat is after all a jumpsuit on steroids! Recently, singer Erykah Badu set out in what she called “social distancing couture”. It was a “bootleg” hazmat suit adorned with Louis Vuitton logos, a giant Louis Vuitton pouch, gloves, a mask, a visor, big feathery booties and a face full of flawless makeup. While a hazmat suit hardly inspires a sense of style, the jumpsuit has long leaped over it’s humble, tactical antecedents.Thanks to Hollywood and pop icons, jumpsuits became more fashionable. Currently, wide-legged jumpsuits are having a moment – and that suits the Indian body type. Designer Swapna Anumolu calls it a spring-summer staple for every woman. She prefers jumpsuits with dramatic sleeves, as it adds more drama. Her tip is to keep your body type in mind before investing in a jumpsuit. Get one that is flattering – creates the right curves and hides flaws.Designer Nanki Papneja counts easy, flowy, printed jumpsuits as the season’s must-haves where you let the prints do all the talking. She adds, “Try to pick a jumpsuit that can give you good wearability. It’s essential to get multiple looks from one as it has the potential to cover up on days when you are extremely clueless of what to wear.”In fact, a jumpsuit is known for its increased adaptability – it can be sexy, chic, contemporary, formal, lounge-y or traditional.Rhea Pillai Rastogi, designer, says that if you are looking for a jumpsuit this season, go for any of the three styles: one shoulder jumpsuits (go for an alluring neckline, pair with stilettos and long earrings); industrial boiler suits (wear with statement shades and dad sneakers); and structured jumpsuits with lapels that you can wear with a belt for a work-ready look. It’s one-suit-fits-all style.Anyone can pull off this silhouette. Its versatility helps jumpsuits to blend inwell with various occasions, making a person either dress down for a casual date night or dress up for a formal business meeting— Pooja Shroff, designer- Keep your body type in mind before purchasing one.

3,['29/03/2020'],Sleep and Immunity,"Sleep tight to keep yourself sniffle-free this season. A study, recently conducted by a team from the University of Tübingen (in Germany), has found a mechanism linking sleep to the functioning of the immune system. While more sleep won’t necessarily prevent you from getting sick, skimping on it could adversely affect your immune system – leaving you susceptible to a bad cold or case of the flu.Stress hormones dip while the body is asleep. High levels of these substances might decrease the efficiency of T cell immune response to kill pathogens. Without sufficient sleep, your body makes fewer cytokines, a type of protein that targets infections and inflammation, effectively creating an immune response.To stay healthy, especially during the influenza season, get the recommended seven to eight hours of sleep a night. This will help keep your immune system in fighting shape. Napping is great. Take two naps of 30 minutes each — one in the morning and one in the afternoon — to decrease stress. Even if you do come down with a case of seasonal sniffles, you’ll be able to bounce back faster if your body is well rested.1. We must have a fixed bed time and wake up time. There is a sleep clock and we need to fix it to fight this issue.2. Too much of screen time must be avoided, especially close to sleeping hours.3. Try some relaxation activity before bedtime – yoga, deep breathing, calming music.4. Caffeine blocks sleep. Stop intake 4-6 hours before sleep. That includes coffee, tea, chocolates, colas, mixtures and powders used for gyms.5.

4,['29/03/2020'],Maximise your skincare,"It’s always a little disappointing to find out that the skincare that you’ve been investing in so far has little to no effect on your face. But there is a way to buy right and maximise the benefits. Here’s what to keep in mind:1.If you’re not, it’s hardly practical to expect visible results. To see results that are visible, you need to be consistent with your skincare.Applying any decent product on top of clogged pores causes breakouts. So, without washing your face, applying cleansing products is counter-intuitive.Adding a mask to your routine is going to give your skin the additional benefits – it will make your skin porous so that it can absorb the goodness from the products. Essentially, the mask acts as a catalyst for products, to enable maximum results in less time.In order to balance the pH levels of the skin, you need a toner. You can either use witch hazel or a toner. It helps against environmental stressors like pollution and bacteria.Not everyone uses facial oil but they should. Essential oil acts as a barrier against elements that might harm your skin.— Mensxp.com",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74843734,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-696930/74843734.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/beauty/maximise-your-skincare/articleshow/74843260.cms
5,['29/03/2020'],The art and science of kolam keep youngsters busy in the lockdown period,"When kolams get creative

Isai Kolam:

Neer Kolam:

Move over memes and videos as kolams take the floor, quite literally, too. Be it to protest against the government or create awareness about an issue, the simple and understated kolam can deliver the message effectively, say kolam enthusiasts.Thilagalakshmi Sridharan, a kolam expert who works in a central government office, has come up with two distinctive kolams — one highlighting the importance of washing hands and the other one titled, Stay home, stay safe. She has been drawing unique designs at home for the past four decades and is a specialist in free-hand designs. With nearly a lakh of followers online, she says, through her kolams, she is trying her bit to create awareness about the deadly virus. In the 4*4 design, she has used colours to highlight the virus particles in yellow spheres.Rasigapriya Lalitha Subramanian, a musician and kolam enthusiast, says that there is more to the simple kolams and one should not underestimate their influence on human beings and society.“Our lives and culture are quite entwined like the dots and lines in the kolams. Kolam has its origin in the vedas when lines and designs made of rice flour and natural colours were drawn before performing yaga and homam, and there is mathematics to it. Using kolams to send a message is not something new. In olden days, kolams were also considered as symbols,” says Lalitha, adding, “Kolams were considered an indication that a house is occupied. People believed that thieves used kolams as an identification mark to infer whether people were staying in a house or not. Often, they targeted unoccupied houses to loot valuables.”Explaining the significance of kolams in Margazhi, she says, “Those days, it was customary to draw huge kolams in the month of Margazhi and place a pumpkin flower in the middle of the cow-dung cake. If the flower kept was a big one, it denoted that the family had a girl of marriageable age — marriage brokers and grooms’ families could approach them for a possible alliance.”Devaki, aka Devi mami from Mambalam, is a veteran in drawing kolams. A sought-after person for weddings and other auspicious events, she says each kolam is closely associated with human lives.According to her, kolams were used as a way to find out whether a girl was happy to take forward an alliance or not. “With no mobile phones and WhatsApp then, people in the family used to observe the pattern a girl drew after meeting a prospective groom. If the lines drawn were not clear or proper and if the girl was seen drawing them at a disturbing pace, it was concluded that she was not in favour of the alliance.”Elaborating on the types of kolams, she says, “For mappillai azhaippu in weddings, ettu padi kolams are considered auspicious. I decorate the four corners and place kaavi (saffron colour) in the middle. There are also special kolams for muhurtham and oonjal — but all auspicious occasions should have padi kolams only,” she asserts, adding, “There are kolams drawn on the wedding stage in addition to the 18 small kolams that are drawn to appease the Gods, elders and the departed souls.”While big kolams are usually drawn at the entrances, some people draw them inside puja rooms too. “There are specific kolams for each day of the week, from Monday to Sunday and they denote the navagrahas. They are relatively small and also include writing the mool mantra inside them,” explains Lalitha.Another staple in the puja room is the Aiswarya kolam, which is often drawn on Tuesdays and Fridays. Kolams are also connected with months and festivals. “For Lakshmi Kubera puja, Kubera kolam is drawn; a coin and a flower are placed in each box,” says Lalitha. She adds that it’s chariot kolam or ther kolam that is drawn for Pongal and Rathasapthami as a tribute to Sun God.Youngsters like Saranya S are taking time to learn the art as well as the science behind it. A techie by profession, Saranya says that she found the joining of dots in big kolams similar to an algorithm. “The way we connect the dots to come up with a symmetrical design is no joke,” she says.According to her, to complete a sikku kolam (tangle), one needs not only practice but also a sharp brain. “But these days, not many know that there are certain norms while drawing a kolam. While the lines should be even numbers, 2, 4, 6 ... for an auspicious-day kolam, single or three lines denote inauspicious incidents like a death in the family,” she adds.Purvisha Ravi, a state government employee, has decided to make use of this lockdown period for acing her kolam skills. “I have a three-year-old and balancing work and home were taking a toll on my mental and physical health. So, during this lockdown time, I decided to go back to my earlier routine — sleeping early, waking up on time, drawing kolams and doing some exercises. I used to be good at kolams using rice flour paste. My mom has a collection of kolam books, which used to be popular in the 80s and 90s, but now I think I can sharpen my skills using YouTube videos.”Thilagalakshmi says, “I am very active on social media, YouTube and WhatsApp groups on kolam. I get a lot of requests for conducting kolam workshops and am interested in teaching, too. These days, many youngsters are looking at kolam to help them focus better and for improving their concentration,” she notes.This is a tool used in teaching classicalmusic to children. The teacher would draw dots on a blackboard and when teaching a song, a student would be asked to join the dots. By the time the student completes the kolam, the song too ends. This is considered as an effective way to teach music to children and enhance their interest as they would easily grasp the thalam.Oil is spread on a flat plate and a kolam is drawn using rice flour on it. Then, water is slowly poured on to it from one side, until it covers the entire design. The design looks as if the kolam is floating on water.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74863622,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1312659,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/the-art-and-science-of-kolam-keep-youngsters-busy-in-the-lockdown-period/articleshow/74863622.cms
6,['29/03/2020'],"Chill Karo Naa, say this group of musicians","During this period of lockdown owing to COVID-19, artistes are doing various things to relieve the stress and beat quarantine blues. While we just heard the parody version of Thillana Thillana as Corona Corona, these Chennai musicians have come up with an original song which goes as Chill Karo Naa Musicians Pranav Rajkumar Shyam Renganathan and SubZero ... all of them connected virtually and came up with this track in 48 hours. Pranav, who composed and recorded the track, says, “Mercy had called us and came up with idea of doing a song around the virus. We didn’t want to do something clichéd. Also, we wanted something that can be heard even after 10 years. Instead of making the song all about Corona, we wanted to use the word as a pun. Shyam has written the lyrics. If you take the song Maro Maro from Boys, every word in the song will rhyme. We wanted to do something on the same lines and that’s when he came up with Chill Karo Naa, punning on the word Corona. It was then that decided we do the song in Hindi.”He informs that this is a motivational song, “stressing on the importance of staying at home, communicating over the phone, and of course, chilling out. It is sure to releive you of the stress we are going through right now”.Pranav says that he came up with the tune almost instantly. “We all got cracking immediately. Shyam wrote the lyrics, got a friend in KL to do the harmonies, got SubZero from Hyderabad to do the rap portions, and later, Shyam, Mercy and I recorded the song in my place. We also shot a video for the same,” says Pranav.The musician says that he mixed and mastered the song in a day’s time. “We were supposed to launch before the Janta Curfew began last Sunday. But editing took time. By noon, we managed to upload the song,” he says.The response has been positive, says Pranav. “There is a signature step in the song that has gone viral. I think the song has worked well and we are happy about the response we have received so far.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74863194,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1186534/74863194.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/chill-karo-naa-say-this-group-of-musicians/articleshow/74863194.cms
7,['29/03/2020'],Calm-o-nomics in the time of Corona,"We are living in a panic-stricken world. Only the degree differs. With the novel coronavirus becoming a pandemic with little signs of abetting, even the most calm among us are living with daily anxiety. What better time can we have than now — with most of us working from home or under self-quarantine — to introspect about our daily lives ridden with anxiety? Come to think of it, our current health paranoia apart — we have been living with constant worry on a day-to-day basis for a while now.Long-standing research has shown that chronic TV watching and following news have in general elevated our fears over the years. Everything we see starts to feel real – like it’s happening right outside our front door. From a corona virus tweet to economic uncertainty, riots to stress-inducing headlines, daily commuting hassles to work pressure… everyone’s at the verge of losing their minds on a daily basis.Michigan State University psychology professor Jason Moser believes everyone needs to learn calm-onomics (or the science of being calm) in our times. While self-isolating at home for the pandemic, maybe we should start introspecting about quarantining ourselves from worry for the longer run.Psychotherapist and life coach Dr Saloni Singh tells us how to go about it. “Choose a conscious response to external panics. Limit the use of social media. Use it judiciously. Do things to enable feelings of well-being. Maybe just sit and enjoy one cup of tea before the next feeling overwhelms you,” she says. In the end, our perspective is the most powerful thing we can control in a situation that’s beyond our control.Several experts have several ideas. Now that we’re mostly home, we can give them all a shot and see which one suits us. For instance, Moser suggests people talk to themselves! “Third-person self-talk” can be used across board to calm our nerves” when you are anticipating a stressful event. Psychologist Jeffrey Nevid, PhD, proposes a simple experiment: Spend 60 seconds keeping your mind completely blank when you are super-stressed. While moksha is long way off, we can learn to still our minds. Because as someone said: our mindset is the only barrier between us and a possible breakdown.According to Psychology Today, some people stay calm relatively easily while others get hyper quite fast. And to stay calm, people have different preferences – exercise, drugs, shopping, meditation, prayer, conversation – the solutions vary from people to people.Life coach Ravneet Gandhok believes what really works is expressive writing. “Get the negative thoughts out of your head – journaling is basically giving yourself a ‘brain dump’,” she explains.Dr Ramon Llamba, doctorate in metaphysics and human psychology, says, “Everything in the universe has energy, and everything in the universe is vibrating at different frequencies. Keeping a high-frequency environment inside our body — mentally, emotionally and physically — help us face the onslaught of bad news with relatively calm demeanor.”How does one keep a high frequency environment inside our body? Practise this: do not plug yourself into fear. Easier said than done, you may say. But once you are conscious of the fact that you won’t let fear in, you’ll remember to tell yourself not to give in when you feel frightened. Lamba also asks us to keep our thoughts positive by arming ourselves with information from authentic sources. “It’s important to keep your emotional state happy and ‘high-vibrating’. Science has proven that when we are in a high-vibrational state, our brain releases some chemicals that help us build our immunity,” she says.Another quick way to calm down at extreme stressful times is deep breathing. Self affirmations also help. Keep telling yourself… I am Safe, I am Healthy, my body immunity is high.Adds Dr Llamba, “When the storm outside cannot be controlled, all you can do is strengthen your home so that the storm doesn’t cause any damage. Humming is one of the ways in which your brain produces a lot of nitric oxides, primarily called the laughing gas.” Look at Italy and Spain. They are all singing out of their balconies to keep themselves happy while entertaining others.Psychologist Stephen Kull had once said that human beings’ instinct to survive is strong, but the instinct to alleviate anxiety is even stronger.The first step to alleviate anxiety is to recognise the specific things that disturb our sense of peace and calm. Business coach Peri Pakroo says, “For many people, worries about money create stress, for others, it’s a conflict with spouse, friend or colleague. For still others, worries over health can quickly spin out of control. Whatever your triggers are, it’s incredibly important to recognise them.”This may seem strange but Pakroo says it’s essential for some time to allow these dark feelings to run in our heads as it aids us to learn about our triggers, and eventually figure out how not to get stuck with it. “Sitting mindfully with negative feelings can really lessen their strength,” she says.Regular exercise is widely recognised as a powerful positive influence on mood and emotions. Adds Pakroo, “Also remember that other people’s energies have a significant impact upon us, both positive and negative. If you are going through an anxious phase, try not to spend time around people who bring out your anxiety. Be honest with yourself about how others make you feel. Make it a point to spend time with people who make you feel loved and safe.”At the end of the day, the conversation we have the most is with ourselves – in our own head. So, it’s time to change our personal narratives. It’s time to promote internal well-being by initiating action, no matter how small or large.This time feels frightening, in part, because of our sense of powerlessness. Says Dr Peyush Bhata, life coach, “Understand that energy grows where focus goes. Shift your focus from negatives in your life to what’s positive. Stop thinking about ‘what if’ narratives. Bring your attention back to this moment.”Calming down IS hard work. But done it must be. The best hazmat suit in this Age of Paranoia is how we choose to treat ourselves.Self-Care: This is the time for utmost healing of mind. You’ll be surprised how frequently even the most dramatically apocalyptic thoughts and feelings turn out to be a result of insufficient food or sleep.Limit your exposure to social media: American Psychological Association advises people: “If the 24-hour news cycle is causing you stress, limit your media consumption”. Tune out to Tune in.Reframe your experiences, rather than viewing negative input as a bad thing. Switch your focus from ‘they are edgy, it makes me nervous’ to ‘I can handle it. 'Accept, don’t resist: A great deal of stress rises from trying to resist things. It is worth remembering that “anxiety and similar feelings are fairly appropriate reactions, normal responses, to completely abnormal things going on.”—Malminder Gill, hypnotherapistHumming is one of the ways in which your brain produces a lot of nitric oxides, primarily called the laughing gas— Dr Ramon Llamba, PhD in quantum physics",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74806894,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-113320/74806894.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/calm-o-nomics-in-the-time-of-corona/articleshow/74806629.cms
8,['29/03/2020'],Corona: Bengaluru citizens join government as ‘Corona warriors’ to fight the pandemic,"In the ongoing fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, enforcing the shutdown and ensuring those who step out maintain social distancing is quite a task for governmental agencies. Helping them out in this hour of need is a growing number of volunteers who have signed up as Corona warriors to distribute food from Indira Canteens, drawing circles in front of kirana stores to make sure customers stand far apart from each other and more. At 12,000 and counting, these warriors, under the aegis of the state labour department , are also being trained to handle any panic among the people that’s been induced by fake news on social media.

“The ‘Corona Warriors’ initiative is an opportunity for the people to come forward and help each other during these troubled times, when caregivers and civic authorities are struggling to handle the pandemic,” says Captain Manivannan, Secretary of Labour Department, adding that every ‘warrior’ is allotted a medical kit, masks and sanitisers, along with ID cards.

Volunteer Vipin Kuttadan says, “The focus is to get people to stay home and be safe. We also educate people in the lower socio-economic strata on the importance of hygiene and social distancing at this time. In urban circles, we are looking at dispelling myths propagated on social media, to ensure there is no panic among people.”

“The volunteers are coordinating with police stations across the city and their primary responsibility is to address issues in their immediate neighbourhood. Plans are afoot to roll out this programme across 198 wards in Bengaluru, followed by all the districts in Karnataka,” says actress-politician Malavika Avinash , President of Task Force Corona Warriors .

9,['29/03/2020'],Training mistakes to avoid,"Do not do anything your dog perceives as unpleasant when s/he comes to you.

Do not nag your dog by repeating commands — nagging teaches him to ignore you.

Do not yell at your dog. He’s not deaf. Raising your voice doesn’t improve understanding.

Do not confuse your dog with unrealistic, mixed commands.

Do not try to suppress behaviours that need an outlet.

Do not let training stagnate.

Do not lock up your dog or chain him/her outside because you haven’t trained him/her to behave.

Do not isolate your dog; he’s a social animal.

Do not expect your dog to obey a command you haven’t taught him or her.

Do not get too serious in your training. Have patience.

Do not reward undesired behaviours.

Do not make your dog neurotic by neglecting him.

Do not give up when the going gets tough.

In training their pets, people mostly go wrong with techniques. That apart, inconsistency, tone of voice and indulgences, are major no-nos, says Dr Sonya Kochhar.“Regularity in training is important. Pet parents have to be very patient while training and practice.Treats are a good way to start training, but once your dog starts to get the hang of the command, you must start cutting down the treats before it becomes a habit.Adds Dr Kochhar, “Another very common mistake we make is to not keep our pet’s emotions in check while training. Being focused and having the correct tone is crucial. Training in anger and frustration will leave a negative impact on your pet.

10,['29/03/2020'],Stay productive in your PJs,"For most office goers, earlier, work from home was an excuse to take a chill pill, make a few calls and finally call it a day. But now that work from home is the norm, make sure the newly- christened WFH does not become the new WTH. Recently, luxury fashion influencer Masoom Minawala — working from home in some location in Europe — posted about her hacks to hack work from home. She gave a five-point plan starting with how to maintain a schedule. Because not signing into office doesn’t mean you shouldn’t set a strict schedule.Agrees etiquette guru Suneeta Sodhi Kanga, who works from home on a daily basis. Kanga says the reason working in office is more productive is because of its enforced structure. “The everyday routine of going to work, getting up at a set time, taking a shower and getting your lunch ready, is enough to motivate you to work,” she says.And that is the first thing that takes a hit when it comes to WFH. A forced schedule: time to start, end, take calls and scheduling lunch breaks is what works. Minawala’s other suggestions are setting up a space that inspires you to work, and personalising it. She also suggests not over-reading news. She writes: “Avoid watching or reading the news first thing in the morning or right before going to sleep. Staying aware is AWESOME but coronavirus anxiety is real with all the different theories and articles (some real, most fake) booming on the internet. Read about the precautions, take them, and focus on the task ahead of you.”For Minawala, her phone alarm is her current virtual teammate that keeps a check on how productive she is being. She limits her social activity only up to her break time. Kanga notes that different hacks work for different people. The idea is to find yours – and it all boils down to self-discipline.Her tips: Shower up and get set to work. You can wear casual clothes but don’t stay in your PJs. Write your to-do list first thing in the morning. “Be online all the time, be available on phone and email and send your mails regularly. Take the usual lunch and coffee break. But remember that one of the most frustrating part for a manager is when his/her team is not available for contact,” she says.If your work involves video conferencing, make sure you look presentable. Go against a plain backdrop to take the call. If it’s a conference call and there’s a lot of background noise (especially, if you have kids or someone’s cooking in the kitchen), pre-empt and apologise in advance. She adds: “At the end of the day, this is an extraordinary situation and people will understand. Health is after all more important than etiquette.”Buy high-speed Wi-fi, sound-cancelling headphones and a high-definition camera for video-conferencing. Invest in a good work chairStick with your work-schedules and deadlines. Remain accessible to your clients and teamsDefine your work hours – your inability to do so will have you exhausted as you work over the weekends, stay up late or wake up early to meet deadlines, blurring professional, personal boundariesAs face-to-face meetings get compromised, your verbal and vocal presence has to be stronger to create impactSchedule e-meetings with colleagues, investors and clients and make a list of contacts you have lost touch with.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes social distancing as staying away from mass gatherings and keeping a distance of 6 feet or 2 meters – about one body length – away from other people. So, go outside, take a walk, take a mountain drive, go play in the yard with your kids… just don’t get within 6 feet of neighbours or others you may see while doing these activities! If going out is not an option, try the following home workout:-Morning 10 min stretches - Nothing beats morning yoga-High knee jog 1 min-Pushups on wall /knees 1 min- Squats 1 min -Alternating lunges 1 min-Elbow plank 1 min-Another very effective and doable workout is Sun Salutes, ideally it should be done in mornings but you can practice anytime on an empty stomach for numerous health benefits.

13,['29/03/2020'],Work(out) from home,"Home is the new supergym. Thanks to physical distancing, at-home workouts are the way forward in the world of fitness – and technology too is homing in on workouts. The idea is to bring studio-style, group fitness classes home, so you can access the motivation, power and intensity. From cycling to livestreamed yoga, the fitness world is expanding – to the size of your living room. What’s more, home gymming is the best way to survive a quarantine.Actor Mandira Bedi posted about working out at home in her living room, while Katrina Kaif posted a terrace workout with her trainer Yasmin Karachiwala. Melanie Griffith and Gabby Bernstein led meditation classes from their living rooms. Celebrities like Kelly Ripa and Busy Philipps have turned to at-home streaming workouts to keep fit during the pandemic.As gyms are being asked to shut down for some time, fitness expert Leena Mogre calls it the year of isolated workouts. “The coronavirus scare has brought fitness at home. Convert your patio or terrace into a fitness zone. If you want to pursue your personal fitness goals, home is the new workout paradise. At home, you can auto-adjust and correct your technique and tailor workouts to your personal requirements,” she says. The home gym is less about fancy equipment, more about having good weights at home, yoga and healing meditation spaces.It’s about creating corners that enhance emotional and physical fitness in your home. Think basics, like a stationary bike or treadmill, along with weights. Make space to exercise at home by transforming your extra square footage into a workout zone. If you don’t have extra space, even a nook or empty corner just big enough for your kind of training could become a spot to work up a sweat.Effective exercise consists of three core activities: aerobics, strength and flexibility. A 360-degree workout includes all of them, to varying degrees depending on your goals – and you can do all of them at home. Fitness apps allow you to replicate outdoor courses, indoors. Thanks to tech, we can train at home as if a personal trainer accompanied us. Use video, chat and other digital services to do “the right exercise at the right time”.To get into the at-home-workout mindset, decorate your gym corner with mirrors. Keep large mirror so that you can get a full view of your body while exercising. Mirrors also add depth and light to a room. Put a scent diffuser in your workout space. It may be where you work out, but you don’t want the place to smell like it. Working out is also a great way to handle the anxiety of distancing people. Now more than ever, a fit mind, body and soul begins at home.- To help boost your energy level during your workouts, make your home workout space as light and airy as possible. An ideal fitness space has lots of natural light- You don’t need a ton of equipment or bulky machines for effective exercise. In fact, some of the best home workout equipment are actually small and inexpensive- Use foam rollers because they’re so versatile – you can use them for ‘kneading’ out muscles, core strengthening, or as a prop for some of the yoga poses. Even resistance bands, weights are good investments- Get creative with ways you can store your fitness equipment to make sure it stays neat and dust free. Create invisible closets for your gym equipment so that that it can be put out of sight when not exercising",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74825506,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-108892/74825506.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/fitness/workout-from-home/articleshow/74825530.cms
14,['29/03/2020'],10 things you can do while practising physical distancing,"Amidst the outbreak of coronavirus, it’s essential to distance ourselves physically from other people to prevent the virus from spreading further. While introverts are enjoying this period of self-isolation, it’s taxing for the ones who are outgoing and like being around people. If you’re wondering what to do with limited company and having trouble killing time, here are a few suggestions.Thanks to the internet, there are loads of websites that offer a plethora of courses to choose from. And knowledge never goes to waste, whether it’s a course that will help you hone your skills professionally, or it’s something you want to learn for fun. Now is the time to invest in yourself.If you’ve always wanted to add a bohemian touch to your home, then macramé is the perfect art form for you to learn. The materials are pretty easily available – basic ropes and yarns that you’ll find at any local supplies store. Get knotting.Yoga, meditation, and breathing exercises help reduce stress and keep the blood circulation going. It’s always good to include some form of exercise in your life. Basic yoga poses are pretty easy to learn at home.You know how you’ve been meaning to read that one book, but you just end up on some streaming platform till 4 am? Go, read that book.Eat fruits and khichdi, drink immunity shots and juices, and add tonnes of antioxidants to your diet. This is probably the time that your body needs it the most.Of course, post detox you’ll want to commit the best of all the seven sins – gluttony. Avoiding food outside is advisable, and not stepping out (unless absolutely necessary) is imperative. The next best alternative is DIY, my friends. Learn how to make pizza from scratch, or bake a rum cake.Gardening is therapeutic. Research indoor and outdoor plants, and plant saplings and flowers. If you have a terrace space, now would be a good time to work on that mini garden. If you don’t want something that requires as much commitment, succulent plants and money plants are good. They are low maintenance options.If you’re working from home, it’s important to have a space in your home where you can sit and work. (Tip: As far away from a bed as possible.) Pick a corner, and customise so that you feel productive. Go all out with motivational quotes, hang a monthly planner... whatever works for you.No time like now to decide what “sparks joy”. I know you have too many clothes you don’t wear, too many books you’ll never read, and progress reports from Standard V when you got all straight A’s. Throw that stuff out, or better yet, donate.It’s a trying time for everyone. Your parents, old friends, cousins, everyone is going through a bad time. Keep in touch through social media. Physical distancing doesn’t mean you live in complete isolation. Talking or video chatting will help you keep your mental health in check. A simple chat is all that you need to let go of most of your anxiousness.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74825066,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-185417/74825066.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/10-things-you-can-do-while-practising-physical-distancing/articleshow/74825066.cms
15,['29/03/2020'],Protect yourself from the pandemic,"The current public health crisis is only peaking right now. Knowing the fact that physical contact with an infected individual or respiratory droplet is the most common mode of transmission, there are a few measures each of us can adopt to flatten the curve of this exponential spread.Practising good hygiene is primary here. This only means getting back to the basics – like washing hands, cleaning table tops and other surfaces and choosing the good old Namaste as a greeting gesture. Some practices you can follow and teach your kids too:1. Clean your hands with soap and water (preferably warm) at least for 20-40 seconds as the virus tends to attach to skin surfaces.2. Sanitise hands frequently with an alcohol-based sanitiser (60% alcohol based) while travelling. Essential oil-based sanitisers might not be adequate right now. Rub the sanitiser evenly on your hands, including the webs between fingers.3. Clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects, including cell phones, since they are closest to your oral and nasal passages.4. Carry tissues and handkerchiefs. Cover your mouth and nose with tissues if the person sitting next to you sneezes and then toss that tissue in the trash.5. Wear a mask (N95) for prevention, if you are sick or immuno-compromised, are a health care worker or a caregiver of someone who is sick. Wearing a regular surgical mask only works as a barrier and does not protect against the coronavirus . Discard masks after 6-8 hours of use. Needless storing of masks has to be stopped.6. Discourage spitting at any cost.7. Avoid touching door knobs, handles and switches in public places. If you do, make sure to sanitise your hands as soon as possible.8. Avoid touching your face, mouth and nose with hands.9. Don’t forget to carry exact money/change to evade exchange of currency through hands.Each of us must behave like responsible citizens and practise self-quarantine since human contact is the most common mode of transmission. This is highly important for senior citizens and those with underlying conditions, as they could be more susceptible to infections.1. Also, avoid visiting public or crowded places and social gatherings/parties.2. Avoid making use of public transport and do not travel unnecessarily.3. If you have a domestic help, make sure they follow good hygiene. Even better, you could give them leave for the time being.Having said all of the above, no number of masks or self-quarantining will help, if our immunity — the most important barrier for the virus — is weak and compromised. Immunity should be everyone’s area of focus right now. Stronger the immunity, higher the chances of prevention and faster the chances of recovering (if infected). Immunity doesn’t only depend on immunity- boosting foods, but also on other aspects of lifestyle, like movement and activity, emotional health and quality of sleep every night.It’s chaotic outside for sure, but you can develop inner calm by channelising your energy into the right direction. The energy you spend in worrying and fear can be converted into gratitude, prayer, meditation, pranayama and positive affirmations. No amount of worry, anxiety or stress will help. Instead, stress only suppresses the immune system by raising cortisol levels. Visualise and pray for good health. Affirm good health and safety. Simple positive affirmations to practice:-I am safe- I am healthy- I am protected- My immunity is strong and capable of keeping me safe.- Practise deep breathing, meditation as it can help lower stress levels by shifting you from a state of “fight and flight” to a state of “rest and digest”- Avoid groups and conversation that talk about how grave the situation is. All of the information you hear and see may not always be true.1. Top immunity boosting foods to include in your diet:- Cold pressed/wet milled coconut oil- Garlic and onion- Turmeric and black pepper combo, jeera, ajwain,- Tulsi/holy basil leaves- Star anise- Neem- Pumpkin seeds- Foods rich in Vitamin C, like amla/gooseberry, guava, lemons, bell peppers- Moringa, pumpkin, sweet potato- Best quality loose black tea leaves (in moderation)Apart from this, habits like smoking, consuming refined white sugar and alcohol can dampen our immunity by reducing the ability of white blood cells to kill germs. These habits also deplete vitamins and minerals from our body that are needed by our immune system.2. Sleep: Good quality sleep every night recharges our immune system3. Movement and activity: Daily habit of exercising in the form of yoga, walking and basic body weight exercises are adequate for a strong immunity and healthy lymphatic system. Your body relies on movement for proper circulation of blood, oxygen and nutrients – each of which are critical for immunity. Invest in yoga, body weight exercises, HIIT, skipping rope, dance or take up a game that involves physical movement.4. Boost gut health as 80% per cent of our immunity depends on gut health. Add foods rich in probiotics (rice kanji, fermented vegetables, homemade pickles, sauerkraut, good quality A2 yogurt, beet kvass) and prebiotics (garlic, banana, apple cider vinegar, apple).5. Top minerals to boost immunity: Zinc (pumpkin seeds) & Selenium (brazil nuts).Maintain optimum levels of Vitamin D3 (precursor to immunity). As per the British Medical Journal, the immune system uses Vitamin D to make antimicrobial weapons to puncture holes in bacteria and viruses. Vitamin D gives what our immunity desires at the cellular level",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74824154,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1047074/74824154.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/protect-yourself-from-the-pandemic/articleshow/74824154.cms

It works on all body types and creates a relaxed yet sophisticated silhouette. One of the most universally flattering pant styles out there, its finding favour with the B-town set. Go for this style in a tailored look with modern touches like paper-bag waists, patterns, and slouchy fits.The key to ace this look is to get a great fit. If you are scouting for these pants, go for a pair that feels comfortably snug through the waist, hips, and bum and flow over your thighs for a billowing effect. Avoid overt flares that can make you look wider. The length of the pants determine how it falls. The bottom should hit at the right place. Cropped style should end at ankles to showcase footwear and full-length cuts should barely skim the floor. The Instagram fashionista is now wearing longer, floor-grazing wide-leg pants in flowy fabrics to create ‘lewks’.Take a cue from Kareena Kapoor Khan who wore it casually in a statement colour.

Others trapped at their distant workplaces must be assured of a secure living space with enough food, soap, sanitary pads and medical care,"" it said.India is under the biggest lockdown with around 1.3 billion people asked to stay home in view of the coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed 19 lives and infected over 800 people in the country.There have been reports of a large number of migrant workers leaving their work places in different parts of the country and walking down to their native places, hundreds of kilometres away facing hardships on the way.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pay-heed-to-condition-of-migrant-workers-economists-activists-tell-centre/articleshow/74868241.cms
21,['29/03/2020'],"Recycle, reuse, follow a zero-waste drill: Take stock of your pantry in the time of #lockdown","Every problem has a solution, right? Now that you’re housebound till mid April, it’s likely that you can’t make frequent trips to the markets. In a scenario like this, learning methods of preservation and storing food items in the right manner can really come in handy. There are several traditional techniques, like sun drying, cool storage and pickling that help increase the shelf life of food. Subhasree Basu, who runs a catering and delivery kitchen in Mumbai, says, “In this time of crisis, treat your pantry as your friend and make your food work harder for you. Always remember that hoarding food is not a sustainable solution, if you want to be future-ready. Eventually, hoarded food will rot and go to waste. The wisest thing to do is try and cook one-pot nutritious meal, which will lower the stress of cleaning up later.” Food preservation can actually help you sail through in this situation and you can also save some money. So, here’s what you can try...You can freeze shelled peas, sweet corn, capsicum or bell peppers, deseeded and cut into chunks. Spinach can be boiled, pureed and frozen in icecube moulds. Everything must be zip locked first and then frozen. Slice bananas and freeze them. Put them in the mixer with yogurt or milk, some granola or breakfast cereal and your healthy breakfast smoothie is ready.The same can be done with any berry or mango puree. Peeled, cored and sliced apples freeze well too. However, they don’t taste great when thawed. So, you can cook them with some sugar, cinnamon powder and lemon juice to make some apple jam or baked apple for breakfast or dessert.Root vegetables, like potatoes, beetroots and carrots can be sun dried and stored in the fridge or airtight containers. Cut into thin slices and dry for at least two to three days. Rehydrate in warm water for about 30 minutes before cooking.It is the process that encourages the growth of good bacteria to inhibit the growth of bad bacteria that can spoil different food items. Fermenting can be used with items like fruits, vegetables, meats, seafood, grains, legumes, dairy and eggs. The process is used to make wine (from grapes), sauerkraut (cabbage), cured sausage (meat) and yogurt (milk). Even rice is fermented at home to prepare idlis.This is the process of soaking food in a solution containing salt, acid or alcohol. Items like fruits, vegetables, meats, seafood, legumes and eggs can be pickled.However, pickled food can be unsafe if prepared carelessly or stored at room temperature. Pickling is often combined with other methods of preservation such as fermenting, canning or refrigerating.Sun drying is a reliable method of preserving food during an emergency. It is also one of the primitive methods of food preservation. Fruits like apples, tomatoes, pears and apricots can be sun dried and stored for several days. In many regional cuisines, different types of fishes, seafood and meat are sun dried.Roast more chicken than you need or cook extra minced meat. The leftovers can be used in noodles, pasta, sandwiches or stuffed in rotis. Boiled chickpeas can also be used to make many dishes like chhole, hummus, salads or even chaats. Soak green moong dal or any other lentils in water for three days. The sprouts are not only healthy but tasty too.To keep lemons from drying, rub a tiny amount of vegetable oil on its skin.Coriander leaves will stay fresh for days if cleaned, dried and stored upright inside a glass jar and then kept inside the refrigerator.Traditional method of preservation is implemented in various cuisines of Bengal, Odisha, Northeast and even in the southern parts of India, where each item is considered a popular delicacy of that particular region. Doma Wang, an expert in Sikkimese cuisine and chef-owner of a Kolkata-based restaurant serving Tibetan, Nepali, Bhutanese and Chinese cuisines, says, “We sun dry the meat and also pickle and dehydrate vegetables that stay fresh for long. In times of crisis, one of our most common dish is Tsamba, which is sun-dried makai or corn seeds (you can also use wheat flour) — roasted, powdered and mixed with salty Tibetan butter tea.

The dish is served with roasted vegetables, such as potato, brinjal, saag or fried fish.The concept of zero waste is to prevent as much food as possible from ending up in the landfill. The first step is to go absolutely plastic-free. Replace all the storage items with glass jars, boxes and tumblers. As for food items, peels of many vegetables can be reused to whip up delicious finger foods or condiments. For instance, you can dry potato peels and then fry it in cooking oil with a little salt and pepper.In many Bengali households, peels of green peas are also fried and eaten with rice by adding a dash of mustard oil and chopped green chillies.

The middle-aged Kolkata-based Bengali sleuth became a national favourite overnight with this show. Written by Sardindu Bandopadhyay, it was directed by Basu Chatterjee. Rajit Kapur played the lead with KK Raina portraying his friend and assistant. Simple sets, a good script and nuanced acting made the edge-of-seat whodunits fun as well as an intense watch.Talking about the rerun, Rajit says, “It actually feels very strange. It was done almost 25 years ago, but I am suddenly inundated with messages and calls since two days. You know, over the last 20 years, the broadcaster has aired it many times. But I guess it’s making a lot more noise because people are home and they are looking for some kind of wholesome entertainment. It’s a show that a five-year-old to an 85-year-old can understand. It enjoys that range because it’s clean, wholesome entertainment and that’s why it became popular. They say, sometimes basic is more impactful. The show will strike a chord again because of the nostalgic value and the strength of its content and could even get in a new audience.”And is he looking forward to watching it again? “I don’t know. There is so much else to watch while I am home (laughs!), especially the stuff I haven’t watched.

Can’t let these strays be hungry

People like Alankrita Sarkar (above) have been feeding scores of hungry stray animals in Lucknow these days during this unprecedented lockdown in the city (BCCL)

Facing problems aplenty

The novel coronavirus pandemic has put almost the whole world in lockdown. People in countries across Asia, Europe, America, Africa and in India are confined to their homes. All commercial establishments, restaurants, offices and markets are closed due to the epidemic. Amid this, the stray animals, that depended on foods from the roadsie eateries, thelas and restaurants, are deviod of food and even water. But there are some in the city, who are turning saviours for them. These people are going out of their way to feed hundreds of stray animals every day. Today, we laud the efforts of these people, whose tribe is thankfullyincreasing day by day.Vishakha and (R) Kunal Lamba are also ensuring that at least a few strays get food (BCCL)On Tuesday, when the entire nation watched the Prime Minister announce the 21-day lockdown, what worried Alankrita Sarkar , a lawyer in Lucknow, was what will hapen to the stray animals. Alankrita, who is feeding more than 50 stray dogs daily says, “I was worried about the stray animals as where will they get their food from. I knew that they heavily depend on humans for food. And a 21-day lockdown would mean starvation for them. So instead of feeding just the few who live near my house, I started making more food and I feed as many dogs as I can in my areathese days.” Teacher and an animal lover, Caroline Borges Lamba and her husband businessman Kunal too have taken it upon them to feed as many stary animals as they can, daily. “We fill our car with food and at night my husband and I go around in Hazratganj feeding dogs. They are hungry and desperate for food,” says Caroline, who also gives medicines to the ones that require them.(L) Vedita Pratap Singh (R) TV actress and Lucknowite Jaya Bhattacharya has been doingher bit in Mumbai ad feeding stray animals and also providing them water to drink (BCCL)Animal lover and rescuer Cyrus Cowasji too has been doing that for more than a 100 animals daily. “If these animals, especially dogs, won’t get food, they may start attacking cattle and maybe even human beings. They are just so hungry. I’m petrified what will happen if they attack some human being. These animals will be blamed for no fault of theirs. They just want to eat!,” emphasises Cyrus, who’s not only feeding the stray dogs, but is also feeding stray cattle and horse, birds, among others.(L) Twinkle Lamba says giving stray animals food is the most satisfying for her (R) Caroline Borges Lamba is feeding nearly 50 dogs each day in her locality (BCCL)Entrepreneur Anurag Mishra too has been doing his bit and going around Hazratganj, Sapru Marg and Nawal Kishore Road apart from Gomti Nagar, feeding more than 100 animals daily. “Ab kya karein? Inko kahan se khana milega?” he says adding, “They are totally dependant on human beings for food, and with all restaurants closed and no roadside eateries open, they are roaming about hungry. So I make food with rice and kibblle and feed as many as I can every day in the night.”Animal lover and businessman, Arvind Khanduri, too is pitching in and keping the strays around his house properly fed. “With the scare of Coronavirus and lockdown, there has been a total shutdown of the restaurants and dhabas, as a result of which the stray animals are suffering the most. They are not getting enough to eat. So I am ensuring that I feed the strays in and around the area where I live. I also started the #feedthestrays initiative on social media to encourage others to do the same. It’s such a satisfying feeling feeding these hapless animals. I would urge everyone to do the same,” says Arvind.Actress and Lucknowite Vedita Pratap Singh too is feeding the animals in her colony in this time of crisis. She says, “It breaks my heart to see these poor strays suffer at this time. I am ensuring I feed the dogs in my area twice a day. It’s a wonderful feeling doing this. I hope others are also doing the same in their respective areas.”Twinkle Lamba, says she’s been feeding stray animals since she was a kid. “Earlier it was just a few but these days it’s more than 20 dogs that I give food to. How can I eat peacefully when I know these poor animals are hungry?” she says.People like Alankrita Sarkar (above) have been feeding scores of hungry stray animals in Lucknow these days during this unprecedented lockdown in the city (BCCL)Similarly for Vishaka Shukla , an animal care giver and volunteer, who says “I feel guilty if I can’t feed all the dogs that come and surround me when I go out at night to feed them. The numbers have increased exponientially since the lockdown. There are just so many. I am feeding them all as much as I can.”In fact, Caroline and Cyrus feels that they are “committing a sin” if they eats and don’t feed the strays.The good work that all these people are doing is not without its share of problems. In the initial days, the volunteers had to fight with the police for letting them feed the strays. “They just won’t let us step outside. But when I explained the reason to them, they let me feed the dogs now,” says Cyrus. A similar problem was faced by Caroline too but now she says the policemen have started to allow her to feed the animals and a few do so themselves. For Alankrita and almost all the others, the problem is of the cost incurred and also procuring kibble. “I am feeding these 50 plus dogs on my own and it takes a huge amount of rice and kibble to feed them.” Cyrus too is facing the same problem. “But if we don’t feed them, they will die and rot and that will cause so many more diseases,” he reasons. For Caroline the problem is of procuring the food too. “With all pet shops closed, it’s very difficult to find their food. Most chemists also don’t stock animal food. So the problem is of getting it and feeding them.”",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74864828,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-333386,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/compassionintimesofcorona-lucknowites-turning-saviours-for-the-strays/articleshow/74864676.cms

31,['29/03/2020'],"Coronavirus in India: Amid exodus, govt identifies districts, villages for surveillance","NEW DELHI: The Centre has rapidly expanded Covid-19 surveillance to track thousands of migrant labourers going out of cities, particularly large ones like Delhi and Mumbai, to keep an eye on incidence of the disease in villages and districts where these workers are headed.Throngs of people walking along highways set off fresh concern in the government, leading to the National Centre for Disease Control setting up mechanisms to follow the migrant paths. It has identified districts and villages where a significant number of people are arriving in states like UP, Bihar and Rajasthan (among others) and tagged them as “high risk”.The quick shift in strategy was needed as officials monitoring the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) were taken aback by the numbers setting off on treks despite the nationwide lockdown . The situation was seen in its humanitarian context as physically preventing people would be difficult, creating a law and order problem. “People were reacting to fears and concerns over livelihood and how long the current situation will last,” said a senior official.But with India locked down to prevent the virus from spreading into a wider community, migrant workers could be potential carriers of the disease into the hinterland, creating a serious healthcare challenge given that facilities for Covid-19 treatment are limited in rural areas. The tracking of migrants, with rapid response teams under the IDSP providing inputs along the way and at destinations, will give officials something to go by.While the exodus from major cities spells a new challenge for health authorities, officials said the situation could become stable in a few days. It is believed that those who needed to return home would largely have left cities and reached their destinations and there would be stable populations at both ends. “We will know there are some infected people in both locations and can hope that our tracking mechanism will bring them under scrutiny,” said the official.“We have already started the process to identify these districts and specific villages which are at high risk. We have asked states to ramp up preparedness at the district level and ensure facilities are extended to the last level in distant villages,” the official said, admitting that the walkers could hurt the objectives of the lockdown.“The lockdown is a process and we will see the results of the lockdown in the next few days,” Lav Agarwal , joint secretary in the health ministry, said at the daily briefing on Covid-19. He added that the lockdown would be successful only if people followed the government’s guidelines on isolation, social distancing and hygiene practices.Meanwhile, as part of its preparations to deal with a potentially large volume of cases, the Centre has directed states to keep some beds reserved for creating isolation facilities in public and private hospitals and ensure that stable patients are discharged as early as possible.It has also ramped up its lab network for testing, and ordered 40,000 more ventilators as well as augmented supplies of personal protection equipment and masks for healthcare workers.“The impact of the lockdown will be seen once the migrated population settles in their homes and we have all other means in terms of logistics, PPEs, ventilators, health resources in place. We are working in that direction,” the official said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74868603,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-605228,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-in-india-amid-exodus-govt-identifies-districts-villages-for-surveillance/articleshow/74868574.cms
32,['29/03/2020'],Coronavirus: Dire warning by health experts led to lockdown,"NEW DELHI: The assessment conveyed by experts to the government was urgent: The number of Covid-19 patients would increase as people returning to India carrying the infection would come into contact with others and this required an immediate response.Senior officials dealing with public health were unanimous in their opinion that a lockdown was the need of the hour. People needed to be immobilised so that those who developed symptoms would not become spreaders on a scale that would send the number of Covid-19 patients — and mortalities — soaring.The three-week lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi exceeded expectations within the government where experts felt that they may get less. A 21-day lockdown would allow the key teams monitoring the disease to push measures related to social distancing, symptom-based testing and expanded scrutiny of patients with serious respiratory illnesses to the fullest.While the largescale migration of people took officials by surprise, they still feel the lockdown will deliver benefits as appeals for work from home were being flagrantly violated. The benefits are seen in terms of stabilising numbers and ensuring that the disease does not spread exponentially in the community.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74868669,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-513386,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-dire-warning-by-health-experts-led-to-lockdown/articleshow/74868657.cms

The health ministry has confirmed 918 Covid-19 cases.The one spot of good news is that across the country, 94 Covid-19 patients – nearly 10% of the total cases reported so far, have recovered from the disease, data shows.Kerala, which is among the worst affected states, reported its first casualty on Saturday with the death of a 69-year-old man who had tested positive for the novel coronavirus . He had returned from Dubai on March 16. “The deceased had a history of heart ailment,” authorities said.Delhi reported its second Covid-19 death, with authorities confirming that a Yemen national who succumbed to illness at a private hospital two days ago had tested positive for novel coronavirus. “He was admitted to Apollo hospital with lower respiratory infection on March 23 and died on March 26.

Of these, nine cases were reported in Gautam Budh Nagar alone while one case each surfaced in Varanasi and Meerut.

37,['29/03/2020'],"UP, Bihar hit out at Delhi for exodus","LUCKNOW/PATNA: UP has blamed Delhi’s AAP government for the influx of thousands of migrant workers and others in the state, defying the 21-day lockdown order to counter COVID-19.

Hours after appealing to migrant workers to remain where they were and not attempt to cross the state border, chief minister Yogi Adityanath took a late-night decision on Friday to start operation of 1,000 buses to ferry people from the border, and those who had already entered UP, to their villages. Delhi government too deployed 100 buses on Saturday morning to ferry people from the border up to Hapur in west UP.

Meanwhile, Mrityunjay Kumar, advisor to the CM tweeted: “Lakhs of people are coming to UP from the Delhi border. Delhi government is unable to stop them. DTC buses are dropping them off at the border. I appeal to Arvind Kejriwal to make suitable arrangements for them in Delhi so that they can remain there. UP CM Yogi Adityanath has appealed to people to stay where they are. Arrangement for their food and stay will be made. Officials from UP have been given directions on this. Due to the irresponsible attitude of some, do not help in the spread of the Corona pandemic.”

A UP press note said migrantss arriving into the state were largely from Delhi and some from Punjab and Haryana. “The people... said Kejriwal makes promises for cheap publicity. He had recently promised free food for 4 lakh people but they got nothing. Like always, their own CM Yogi came to their rescue,” it said.

Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia told TOI that it was unfortunate for BJP to be politicising this issue. “Unlike what the UP CM has said, anyone who is living and working in Delhi is one of ours, irrespective of what state they originally belong to. I have personally met many labourers and offered them food and stay in our government schools but they were adamant about going home. Till this morning the border was closed and the police had been told to now allow border crossing. As soon as a decision was taken that they would be sent home, we arranged for 100 buses to help them across,” he said.

Joining the politcal slugfest, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar said that sending stranded migrant workers to their respective states would be a wrong step as it would defeat the very purpose of nationwide lockdown and lead to further spread of coronavirus.

On Friday night, as reports of people being stranded at the Delhi-UP border started increasing, the CM summoned the principal secretary transport and directed him to start the operation of buses from Noida, Ghaziabad, Bulandshaher , Aligarh, Hapur, Meerut and Agra. By midnight, many of these buses had started on their first round of ferrying passengers.

The bigger worry for the state now, said an official, was to ensure that none of these at least two lakh people who were being escorted to their villages and home towns, were carrying the COVID-19 infection.

“All passengers are being given food before they are boarding buses and a doctor on duty is carrying out a thermal scan for each of them. We are getting people from all states, not just Delhi but also Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. It is crucial to keep a watch on them to ensure that the virus does not spread in rural UP,” he said.

The CM helpline, which has been calling councilors and gram pradhans and asking them to keep an eye on those people who entered their areas within the past two weeks, is now changing strategy. In the second round of contact, directions are being issued to keep all such people, who have just reached or will be arriving in the villages from other states, in strict quarantine. Their families will also be isolated and at the first sign of illness, the concerned chief medical officer is to be contacted.

In Patna, Nitish said it amid reports that the Delhi and Uttar Pradesh governments were making arrangements of special buses to send stranded migrant workers to their respective states. “It will also lead to such a situation where putting an effective check on spread of epidemic disease will be a difficult task for all of us,” Nitish said.

Nitish further suggested that people should stay wherever they are in the wake of the lockdown. He said necessary arrangements for their stay and meal should be made by the respective local administration. Local administration should make a camp to ensure the stay of migrant workers.

NEW DELHI: A national lockdown in place, the finance ministry found itself wrestling with an unusual problem: The government printing press would not publish the amended finance bill passed by Parliament without getting written orders in physical form in hand.

The rest of the work had been done online and remotely, including file work that is part of such time-honoured processes. But the government printing press protocol was another matter altogether. Now, the ministry came up with a solution. A DO (demi official) letter was generated under a rule change that carried the phone number of the signatory. The folks at the press called the official to complete verification and the finance bill was finally printed well in time.

The nationwide lockdown has led to the adoption of innovative practices in the government to ensure the wheels of governance continue to move. Several of the relief measures announced by the government in the wake of the lockdown will require ordinances to be signed by the President, said sources. The paperwork will be done remotely but since the final stage will need the President's signature, a ""fully sanitised"" messenger will be sent to Rashtrapati Bhavan to present and receive the documents.

There are similar tales of ""jugad"" in other departments. On Thursday, the Smart City Mission of urban affairs ministry held seven official meetings through Zoom ( video conference) over six and a half hours. A total of 86 people took part.

On the same day, new and renewable energy minister R K Singh chaired a review meeting through video conference with officers and ministry officials who are working through e-offices from home. Even movement of files and notings are being done online to ensure no necessary work suffers.

Physical movement of files and normal meetings have almost stopped, and different departments are working on alternative models to see that office work doesn’t suffer.

While curfew passes have been issued to a few officials in each department and ministry who may need to clear some important files, many are finding it safer to work remotely.

“Email, Whatsapp and video conferencing are better ways to deal with the current situation. We are going through a new phase,” said a senior official of National Informatics Centre. An NIC software is providing a video interface.

A senior functionary of the Smart City Mission said they have decided to document the outcomes of implementation of work-from-home set up within the mission, which will help study the impact and propose suggestions should there be need to continue this pilot further.

39,['29/03/2020'],Young doctors and nurses refuse duty,"CHENNAI: Most private hospitals in the Chennai have cut down on elective surgeries and nearly stopped outpatient services, but hospital managers are worried because young doctors and nurses who are usually posted on duty in the wards are now refusing duty.

Doctors say they have reasons. “I stay at a hostel. The hostel is now closed. I returned to my native place because I don’t have a place to stay in Chennai,” said Dr Sathish A, who works for a 650-bed private hospital. Some others like Dr Shanthi S and nurses Ranjita R and Suchi G told the TOI their parents did not want them to report for duty. “Masks and protection gears are given only to staff attending to covid-19 patients. But we don’t know what will happen if a patient with the infection walks into the out-patient unit without knowing about it,” Suchi said.

Sudar Hospital chief Dr TN Ravishankar said that dwindling staff could be one of the biggest challenges for the health care system. Some hospitals have already started training doctors and paramedics through an online module. “We tell them what to expect, how they should protect themselves, and the things they should remember,” said Dr Ilankumaran Kaliamoorthy, chairman of medical advisory board of the Rela Institute of Medical Sciences.

PATNA: A special chartered flight brought a fresh stock of Covid-19 test kits from Pune’s National Institute of Virology (NIV) to Patna late on Friday night.

Health department additional secretary Manoj Kumar said, “The testing kits came in a special chartered flight, which landed here at 2am on Saturday and were immediately sent to Rajendra Medical Research Institute (RMRI) of Medical Sciences.”

He added, “The state government currently has the capacity to test 600 to 700 samples in a day. The fresh stock will fulfil the requirement for the next two weeks as at least 10,000 tests can be done now. We have ordered for one lakh more Covid-19 test kits.”

On Friday, the Union minister for health and family welfare, Ashwani Kumar Chaubey, had said that at the request of RMRI director, who had requested for immediate availability of kits, he had arranged for the kits to be flown in from NIV, Pune on a special flight.

Patna civil surgeon Dr Raj Kishore Chaudhary said, “Testing work was halted for a few hours at RMRI on Friday because they were carrying out disinfecting work on the premises. But that does not mean that testing was not done at all. It was being done at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS). Now after a few days, we will disinfect the IGIMS lab and then testing load will be at RMRI.”

However, the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), which has got permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to carry out such tests in Bihar , is yet to begin the Covid-19 testing. Apart from RMRI, DMCH and IGIMS are the other two institutes with permission to carry out Covid-19 test.

Sources claimed that testing at DMCH has not yet started because of lack of RNA extraction kit required to carry out the test for Covid-19. Hence, samples from DMCH are being sent to RMRI. DMCH principal Dr Raj Ranjan Prasad said, “Government is getting those extracting kits and we will begin the tests in a couple of days.”

So far, IGIMS had been given one unit of testing kit, which has the capacity to test around 300 samples.

As per data shared by the state health society, 592 samples had been collected across nine medical college and hospital for testing in Bihar, of which results of 15 were awaited till Friday evening.

PATNA: Summer is gradually setting in as the day temperature at most places across the state hovers in the range of 33 to 36 degrees Celsius these days. Weather experts have claimed that dry weather, which will lead to further surge in mercury, is expected soon.

An official at the Patna Meteorological Centre told TOI, “We expect dry weather at least over the next five days along with hot westerly winds blowing at an average speed of 10-12 knots. The direct solar radiation will lead to heating of the lower level of the atmosphere, which in turn, will result in a surge in the day temperature.”

The official added, “The maximum and minimum temperatures across the state are likely to be around 35 degrees C and 20 degrees C, respectively. The maximum temperature in Patna, on the other hand, can surge up to 37 degrees C by April 3.”

Asked about heatwave , the Met official claimed that it was too early to make any prediction as such a condition usually occurred during the peak summer months of May and June.

As per meteorology, heatwave condition is said to prevail at a place when the normal temperature is 40 degrees C or above, and the actual temperature continuous to be 4.5 notches above the respective normal for two consecutive days.

Even severe heatwave conditions prevailed on several days in June last year and claimed more than 30 lives in three districts of south Bihar from June 16 to 18. Restrictive orders under section 144 of the CrPC were promulgated in some districts in June last when heatwave swept the state.

The India Meteorological Department ( IMD ), the national weather forecasting agency, had stated in February that this year, April and May would be hotter than normal.

The local Met officials have predicted that the state will face normal temperature in the peak summer months.

A decision in this regard was taken by the temple’s trust committee and the district administration on Saturday.District magistrate (DM) Saurabh Jorewal told this newspaper, “Lakhs of devotees from all over Bihar and other states visit the Deo Chaiti Chhath Mela, bathe in the holy ‘ Surya Kund ’ and offer ‘arghya’. They are likely to get infected by coronavirus. Hence, the fair will not be organized this year and the temple and the ‘kund’ will remain shut.”This is for the first time that the Chhath Puja is not being celebrated at the Sun temple. Deo’s Up-pramukh Manish Pathak said, “All roads have been blocked to prevent the entry of outsiders.”Patnaites rue lack of resources: Amid the coronavirus lockdown, many devotees have decided not to celebrate Chaiti Chhath this time. Others will keep it low-key due to the lack of resources.Danapur resident Rashmi Sinha (42) faced a lot of difficulty while arranging the items necessary for observing Chhath Puja.“From the time I heard of social distancing, I began gathering all the essential items required for the festival. I, however, did not buy fruits and milk as they do not stay fresh for long. Later, I asked a local shopkeeper to provide me with six litres of milk on the day of ‘ kharna ’ and he agreed,” she said.Another devotee, Prabha Shrivastava, claimed that performing the Chhath rituals was easier than making all the arrangements. “We always celebrate Chhath at our native village in Siwan district, but could not go for the first time because of the lockdown,” she rued.Like Prabha, Sarita Devi (55), a resident of Rajiv Nagar, will not be able to celebrate Chaiti Chhath for the first time in 15 years.

47,['29/03/2020'],A fighter ready to face ‘bullets’ to save tigers,"Dr Jerryl Banait’s work mainly focuses on bringing policy changes to ensure justice for wild animals. He has e... Read More

Trees, forest and wildlife have been Dr Jerryl Banait’s greatest companions since his childhood. An avid nature lover and an ardent wildlife activist, he has dedicated his life to protection of tigers, Chalisgaon leopards, Bandipur Tiger Raja and migratory corridors. The young doctor has approached the high court against orders to shoot tigers that were dubbed as man-eaters.

In his early childhood days, when he used to visit villages and forests with his parents, his creative mind would always find peace in the lush green jungles. His mentor was a famous hunter-turned-conservationist Madhav Rao Dongewar. “He taught me the value of forest and how to live in harmony with them,” he says.

“I remember going to jungles as a 3-4 years old. During a drought situation in Navegaon , I saw many animals and birds dying due to dehydration. My brother and me built a water tank for them with our pocket money,” he says. He has designed, constructed and donated fibreglass saucer shaped water tanks to the forest departments, and also solar water pumps.

One may find hundreds of articles about him on goggle, written in 37 languages. He fought against orders to shoot tigress Kismat (T27-C1) and Avni (T1) . “The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) clearly says that a differentiation should be made between ‘human kill’ due to chance encounters and ‘habituated man-eaters’. As most of our forests outside protected areas are surrounded by villages, the probability of chance encounters is very high.” he says.

His work mainly focuses on bringing policy changes to ensure justice for wild animals. He has even approached the Supreme Court for this. The RTI activist says, “I am heartbroken on learning about poaching. Entering migratory corridors of tigers must be completely prohibited.”

About his fight to save tigress T27-C1, whom he had named Kismat, Banait said she was a sub-adult tigress when shoot order for her was issued. He challenged the order and got it quashed in record time. The tigress was later tranquillized and brought to Gorewada rescue centre where expert veterinarians and high level forest officials declared her as not being a man-eater and released her back in the wild.

Subsequently, two more shooting orders were given for Kismat, all of which he challenged in the Bombay High Court, Nagpur bench. The tigress was ultimately electrocuted. “I then made a video to create awareness against electrocution of tigers. This video went viral and the Maharashtra government and the forest department had to launch an awareness drive in villages about electrocution,” he says.

Tigress Avni was named by him after his father Dr Avinash Banait. Because of his timely intervention, her two young cubs could survive. “I even approached the Supreme Court to save her life. I have requested the government to form a special investigation team to look into the entire episode,” he says.

He has found support from various quarters, including Bollywood celebrities like John Abraham, Raveena Tandon and Rupa Ganguly. He is Guinness and Limca World records holder and also a TED Speaker. “The journey has been overwhelming with the kind of support I have received from across the world,” he says.

Banait has had his own share of struggles. He is determined to ensure strict implementation of policies against poaching and electrocution of tigers. “We don’t like to be disturbed in our house, so why are we disturbing homes of tigers and wildlife? Without tigers, there won’t be any eco-system and wildlife left,” he signs off.

48,['29/03/2020'],Daily wagers in Patna unable to support their families,"Some youth labourers resting on footpath of Buddha Smriti Park in Patna on Saturday.

PATNA: Daily wage workers, street vendors, autorickshaw drivers and push cart vendors in the city, who depend on their daily earnings, are struggling to support families due to the 21-day nationwide lockdown .

“As construction activities have come to a halt, daily wagers are battling hunger,” said Sachin Chandra, president of Bihar chapter of Builders’ Association of India.

He added more than 90% of the construction work has stopped and the workers have returned to their homes. “As the workers used to earn money on a daily basis, it has become difficult for them to run their families. Many workers are still stuck at various construction sites as they are unable to go back to their native places due to the lockdown,” Chandra added.

Asked about the Building and Other Construction Welfare funds, Chandra said around Rs 200 crore was already collected. “The money is for the welfare of workers. However, our biggest challenge at this point of time is identifying the workers as all of them are not registered,” he said.

More than 90% industrial units in the state have also been shut. Bihar Industries Association (BIA) president Ram Lal Khaitan said industrialists have made arrangements, like accommodation and food, for all the workers and staff who are still working. “For the industries which are not functioning, we have made sure that the workers get money for running their families,” he added.

The lockdown has also hit autorickshaw drivers, who used to earn money on a daily basis. Rinki Devi, a woman autorickshaw driver, said the lockdown was announced so suddenly that she couldn’t even save money. “It is quite difficult for me now to maintain the family,” she added.

Rajkumar, general secretary of the Bihar State Autorickshaw Drivers’ Association, said the association has demanded a financial package for the autorickshaw drivers. “Even the packages announced by the government are for ration card holders. E-rickshaw drivers and autorickshaw drivers can’t get benefited by these packages. We have requested the government to look into the issue. Otherwise, the autorickshaw drivers might starve to death before coronavirus strikes them,” he added.

With film and TV serial shoots coming to a halt, people working in the entertainment industry are also feeling the pinch. Rajesh Gupta, a director, said almost everybody involved in the industry are affected. “Spot boys, cameramen and light men, who do not earn a big amount of money per day, are completely jobless these days. In a situation like this, we can only pray that things go back to normal as soon as possible,” he said.

With three new cases, the number of persons infected with the virus in Bhilwara has increased to 24. Among the three new cases, two were posted as nurses at emergency department at the private hospital, which is the epicentre for spread of the virus. One was posted as a typist at the hospital.

Apart from six persons, rest of the 18 persons infected are hospital staff. In Ajmer, a 23-year-old person tested positive “He is a salesman of a private company and after travelling from Punjab, he reached Ajmer on March 22,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary (health).

Keeping in mind the increasing number of cases, chief minister Ashok Gehlot consititued a advisory committee comprising seven pulmonologists including former SMS Hospital medical superintendent Dr Virendra Singh and other health experts. Health minister Raghu Sharma said they were taking measures to buy new ventilators.

TOI had highlighted in a story published on March 24 that in the entire state, there are only 1,500 ventilators and they are not sufficient to deal with the crisis situation. Sharma acknowledged that the state requires 10,000 ICUs anticipating the emerging crisis siuation. “There is a need of two ICU beds and two ventilators per 10,000 population of the state, which means that the state requires at least 10,000 ventilators,” said Sharma.

Moreover, he said they have written to the Indian Council of Medical Research to allow a private hospital in Jaipur for conducting Covid-19 test. Sharma said in the state they have facility for testing 2500 samples of Covid-19 per day.

Owners of these spaces said the system has two advantages. First, they can continue to earn even when all restaurants are closed. Second, essentials can be sold to those who need them instead of letting them go waste.

“Since Sunday the stall is closed. We had actually bought the eggs and vegetables in bulk from wholesalers and sooner or later these would get wasted. So it’s better to sell them and make some money,” said Cherukuri Hymavathi, owner of a restaurant.

On Saturday morning STOI spotted a food van on the road leading to Kommadi village from Kommadi junction on National Highway-16. The van which sold snacks every evening closed down last Sunday and on Saturday morning, the owner placed a table adjacent to the van and was selling eggs and vegetables.

At Kommadi junction, staff at Nawab Biryani restaurant that had also been closed since last Sunday were selling vegetables such as tomatoes and cauliflower.

“We are not selling them at an exhibortant price. Rather, we are selling vegetables and eggs at the same price that local shops are selling at. One egg is Rs 5 and one kg of tomatoes is Rs 20,” said an employee at the restaurant.

A similar situation was seen at several other restaurants and food stalls across the city. Officials at the AP Hotels Associations said even though online food delivery is exempted as per a government notification, police restrictions on movement of delivery executives, they said, are forcing them to shut down their kitchens. “Under such circumstances owners would be the worst hit. Our chefs or labour would manage to find an alternative ‘job’. But how would owners survive who had made huge investments and have no other businesses,” T Satyanarayana, president of AP Hotels Association told STOI.

54,['29/03/2020'],"Bread, flour back on grocery store shelves","People queue up at a bakery on Saturday

KOLKATA: There was some good news at the grocery stores on Saturday morning as the supply of flour and bread was restored, although in low quantities. Many shop owners were even seen rationing the products to cater to the maximum number of customers.

Both flour and bread, staples in most households, had disappeared from the shelves along with other essential commodities after a three-week long lockdown was announced earlier this week. While the supply of most edibles was restored, flour and bread were not available at most markets across the city due to unavailability of labour, collapse of supply chain and hoarding.

Several people took to social media to enquire about the crisis of the two commodities. Wholesalers of flour and members of the bakery association have now assured that both products will be available in adequate quantities from early next week. “The supply chain of a popular brand of flour collapsed, which led to panic buying of loose flour and packaged products of other brands. The wholesalers have stock in their godowns, but there are no labourers to load them on vehicles to deliver them to the shops,” said a shop owner in Entally Market. However, once some wholesale outlets opened in Posta on Friday, many shop owners fetched sacks of flour on their bicycles and two-wheelers, some making multiple trips. A few small goods vehicles, too, delivered consignments to markets in north and central Kolkata.

Many bakery units in the south-western part of the city either scaled down their production or suspended it to cope with the absence of workers and non-availability of raw materials. New Ram Krishna Bakery, for instance, suspended production for couple of days due to acute shortage of man-power. “Moreover, we had issues with the supply of major ingredients for making bread. Hopefully, with raw materials trickling back into the market, we can resume production in a day,” said an official of the bakery.

On Saturday, several people tried to buy flour in bulk, but shop owners did not comply, assuring them of regular supply in a day or two. “It is not fair that some buy in bulk while others don’t get anything. So we are just selling 2kg per person for today,” said Ganesh Sau, a grocery store owner in Tiretta Bazar.

PATNA: A truck driver getting shot at by cops in Danapur for refusing bribe on Wednesday has brought the focus on the hassles being faced by truckers, which is disrupting the supply chain of essential commodities reaching the city.

The truck owners associations in Bihar have claimed that movement of trucks across states and on national highways is getting affected as drivers are being stopped, sometimes unnecessarily, by cops to enforce the lockdown .

Bihar Trucks Owners’ Association (BTOA) president Bhanu Shekhar Prasad said, “Lakhs of truck drivers have become jobless because of the sudden lockdown. They are being stopped and investigated at several points for no reason at all. And despite showing proofs and documents, the drivers are getting harassed by the cops.”

He added, “Prices of vegetables, including potatoes and onions, are going up almost every day due to trucks not being allowed into the city. We have requested the state government as well as the central government to look into this problem.”

Citing the case of a truck driver being shot by cops, Prasad said, “The driver of a mini truck, Sonu Sao (22), a resident of Patlapur village in Patna district , was shot at in Danapur after he refused to give bribe to police constables on Wednesday. Even though, the three cops were arrested but it is a major issue and a matter of concern.”

Rajesh Kumar, general secretary of BTOA, claimed that trucks from Bihar are stranded on the roads in the state and even in Maharashtra . “Most of the vehicles have been abandoned. Several trucks that are loaded with goods are also stuck on the roads as they are allowed to move only if they are carrying essential commodities,” he said.

Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, on the other hand, said movement of vehicles carrying essential commodities is allowed across the country. “The district administration has also been instructed to ensure hassle free movement of such vehicles for which they have issued passes. However, in case the truck drivers face any kind of problems, they can report it to the district magistrate or police personnel. Thereafter, the problem will be resolved,” he said.

He, however, added that vehicles cannot be given the provision of free movement. “They can only commute on the roads if they are carrying important items. The state transport commissioner, who has been made the nodal officer for movement of vehicles, is looking after all the hassles faced by the truck drivers,” Agarwal said.

59,['29/03/2020'],"Kolkata eateries may deliver food, locally for now","Delivery partners on the road must carry a letter of approval from cops

KOLKATA: Several restaurants and fast-food outlets will resume home delivery following a Kolkata Police initiative to sort out logistical issues that had been blocking the service. Police stations across the city have asked restaurants and food chains to write to them seeking permission to operate in their respective areas.

“We will allow three to five delivery persons to operate from each unit. The restaurant manager has to indicate how many will be employed, but they cannot breach the upper limit. We will issue a letter of approval to each eatery, which must be carried by the delivery partner on the road. The cooking staff, too, must carry a copy of the letter,” said an officer.

Though online food delivery was included in the list of exemptions during lockdown, the logistical challenges had made operations difficult in the past few days. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had then instructed cops to ensure that online delivery was not hampered, after which Lalbazar swung into action, reaching out to restaurants.

Desperate calls from citizens — especially the aged — who complained of not being able to buy ration during the lockdown prompted the police to act. “For two days, we helped with the procuring of ration. But that didn’t solve the problem since cooks and domestic help are not being able to travel. Hence, there was a pressing need to get the delivery system up and going,” said an officer.

Cops said that though they have not limited the area of operation for each online food chain, for all practical purposes, the service is likely to be available locally. “We are not allowing too many delivery boys to ply. Even the exemption provided to them has mentioned that the operation has to be carried out with the least number of people,” said an officer.

Meanwhile, a directive from MHA to all police forces holds importance for the departmental stores which, too, can accept online orders. Those, however, will only have to deal in essential goods for now.

PATNA: A 20-year-old boy allegedly killed his childhood friend after the latter objected to his illicit relation with his mother at a village under the Barh police station area in Patna district around 9.30am on Saturday.

The victim was identified as Suraj Kumar alias Golu, who used to work at a village shop.

SHO of Barh police station Sanjeet Kumar said the accused, Pankaj Yadav, was absconding. “Suraj was sitting on the stairs of a locked house at the village when Pankaj shot him in neck from a very close range,” the SHO said, adding Suraj was immediately rushed to Barh sub-divisional hospital where the doctors declared him brought dead.

The SHO said preliminary investigations revealed that Pankaj had an illicit relation with Suraj’s mother, a widow. “Villagers told police that Pankaj used to visit Suraj’s house regularly,” he said, adding Suraj had asked Pankaj not to come to his house on Friday evening.

“Both had a fight over the issue and Pankaj threatened Suraj with dire consequences. Pankaj’s family members, including his uncle and father, had also thrashed him for frequently visiting Suraj’s house,” the SHO added.

“In her statement, Suraj’s mother told police that Pankaj killed her son after a fight,” the SHO said, adding Suraj’s body was handed over to his family members after postmortem at Barh sub-divisional hospital. “Raids are on to arrest Pankaj,” the SHO said.

61,['29/03/2020'],E-passes a click away for essential service workers in West Bengal,"The applicant is free to fix his route but he won’t be able to stray beyond his designated routes

KOLKATA: Police commissioner Anuj Sharma on Saturday launched the e-verification portal for essential services to ensure the service providers get the passes without physically visiting police stations.

“The police commissioner launched the e-pass facility for essential services and online delivery services. All you need to do is to go to the link and fill up your detail. You will receive your e-pass on your email. This pass can be pasted on your vehicle,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Police have also provided two emergency numbers where people can call up and seek any clarification about the process.

Traders have welcomed the move but have raised a few practical issues. “We were having problems reaching the wholesale and retail markets. This will hopefully stop all confusion. However, a small vendor from Noth 24 Parganas or Nadia might not have all the documents to support him. We need to ascertain which documents to be uploaded to get this pass,” said Tapesh Saha, a trader at Sealdah.

Though the scene has improved in the past 48 hours, suppliers have been complaining that cops were stopping their vehicles, especially empty ones that were on their way to fetch goods. Supply chain workers are scared to report to work, they had claimed. On two occasions earlier, Kolkata Police had to call up their counterparts in Dankuni and Burdwan and ask them to release supply vehicles. The suppliers said they were hoping these passes are introduced across the state.

Cops have explained that five categories of people will receive the e-passes. This will include those on emergency duty, those on duty for essential supplies of food, groceries and medicine and those involved with e-commerce delivery. “The user is free to fix his route. But once the e-pass comes through, he cannot stray beyond his designated routes. Our naka checks will ensure that,” explained an officer at Lalbazar.

Cops have worked out the logistical issues accompanying three critical sectors — groceries, medicine and e-commerce. Each police station has asked people from these sectors to write a letter to them, seeking permission to operate in their respective areas for those not availing the online service.

According to Lalbazar, desparate calls from citizens — especially the aged — had prompted them to take a more hands-on approach.

Apart from Kolkata Police, e-passes were also introduced by Diamond Harbour police on Saturday. It is being distributed through WhatsApp across 11 police station areas, including Rabindranagar, Maheshtala, Bishnupur, Diamond Harbour, Usthi and Mograhat.

PATNA: A special cell will be formed in each district of the state to assist the families of all police officers and personnel facing problems due to the lockdown , according to an order issued by the state police headquarters .

Sources said the order for the formation of the cells, which would operate round-the-clock, was issued on Friday evening by IG (headquarters) Nayyar Hasnain Khan after a proposal to this effect was mooted during a video conferencing meet of officers across the state held on March 25.

The state police has a strength of 90,000 of whom around 18,000 are officers.

An IPS officer requesting anonymity, said while police officers and personnel are away from their homes enforcing the lockdown, their family members are often without help.

“It may become difficult for female family members along with children to cope up any emergency arsing suddenly amid the lockdown when these is no transportation available and all shops except of those involved in essential services are closed,” he said.

Khan has ordered all SPs and SSPs to make the cell phone numbers of officers available to all men in uniform posted in a district along with state police headquarters numbers.

Another police officer, posted in field duty, said, “Amid this lockdown, this initiative would give mental satisfaction for cops that their families would not suffer in any emergency.”

Bihar Police Association president Mrityunjay Kumar said the headquarters’ decision for oour welfare is commendable, but the SSPs and SPs have to properly execute it else the order would remain on paper only.

64,['29/03/2020'],Maharashtra: Midday meal grains in rural schools to be given away to students,"NAGPUR: The lockdown had put a big question mark on midday meals scheme which was important for children in villages. The state government has now decided that all leftover foodgrains currently stored at rural schools will be distributed among students equally.

With schools closed, there is no possibility of cooked food being provided to them on a daily basis. Hence, Maharashtra government decided to permit distribution of stored foodgrains and other ingredients among students.

School principal, teachers and even management have been asked to deal with this at their level and ensure the process is carried out fairly. Schools have to first inform all students about the government’s decision and fix a time and day for them to come to school and collect the material.

Sticking to social distancing norms, schools have been asked to ensure that when recipients come to collect, they should maintain at least one metre distance between them while standing in line. Education department has also suggested students be called in phases to ensure there is no rush in school during distribution.

A ZP school teacher, who did not wish to be identified, said the decision was good but it may again require travel. “In ZP schools there are hardly two to three teachers on average. But even then one or two teachers may be from other village. Now this means traveling 15 to 20 kms to school and getting this thing done during lockdown. What if police stop us and are not convinced with our explanation? This should ideally be done by the local staff member. I can do it in a village nearest to me even though it may not be the school I am posted at,” said the teacher.

Education minister Varsha Gaikwad issued a statement saying this decision was taken specifically for rural children who will now get access to foodgrains during the lockdown.

Varanasi: A number of individuals, government and non-governmental organisations have come forward to take care of food problem of the needy persons during the lockdown period, while some even arranged food for the stray animals like monkeys, bulls, cows and dogs.

Though feeding monkeys, bulls/cows and stray dogs has been in general practice for long in this temple town, the lockdown caused by the threat of coronavirus has definitely posed a serious problem.

Taking note of it, former minister and BJP leader Maneka Gandhi had also appealed to the people to feed these animals. She had also asked the animal welfare workers to take care of animals during the lockdown. The Animal Welfare Board of India had also issued an advisory for the care of animals in lockdown.

In Kashi, the people associated with a local group of ‘Ghat Walkers’ feed these animals every day believing that all the creatures in this world have right to food. “We arrange roti (bread) and grains for these animals and birds ,” said a ghat walker Dr. Vijay Nath Mishra. Like morning walkers these people, who love to be called ‘Ghat Walkers’, too take regular round of the majestic riverfront of Ganga not only to have a free walk but also take care of the things all around.

“There are scores of dogs, birds and also few sheep on the ghats. Out team regularly feed them with our own resources,” said Mishra, a neurologist at the Banaras Hindu University. The team members like Abhay Tiwari, Rajan Upadhyaya, Pramod Kumar and many others have become familiar with these stray animals. Besides the stray animals and birds, they also take care of fishes in the Ganga by arranging atta balls, said Mishra. Groups of monkeys are very common sight at the temples, particularly the Sankat Mochan Temple and Kashi Vishwanath Temple. Since all the temples have been closed for the devotees, these creatures might be in trouble in getting food. The temple devout and management are arranging food for them during the lockdown. Besides, a number of individuals put breads and other edibles on their gates so that the cows roaming in the lanes can get them.

A three and a-half year-old boy, who was admitted at the SKMCH on Friday, has tested positive and his condition is stated to be critical.

Aditya Kumar, a resident of Baiju Bujurg village under Sakra block in Muzaffarpur district, was rushed to the SKMCH in Muzaffarpur after his condition worsened at the Sakra referral hospital. He was admitted there with complaints of high fever, convulsion and body ache.

“Test report has confirmed AES. He is being treated for hypoglycemia, which implies a sudden drop in glucose level. He is on ventilation and his condition is critical,” Dr G S Sahani, head of the department of paediatrics at SKMCH, Muzaffarpur, said on Saturday.

A five-year-old girl from Chiraiya in East Champaran district, has been admitted to the ICU with similar symptoms. The test report of Sapna Kumari is awaited. “It’s expected to reach here by late evening on Saturday,” Sahani added.

Superintendent of the SKMCH Dr S K Shahi said, “The report of the AES patient, a three-and-a-half-year-old boy from Sakra block in Muzaffarpur district, has already been sent to the health department. The hospital is gearing up to deal with such cases in the days to come.”

Last year, AES had claimed the lives of over 120 children below the age of 15 years and majority of them belonged to Kanti, Minapur, Musahari, Aurai and Sakra blocks of the district. A few cases were also reported from neighbouring districts like Sitamarhi, East Champaran and Vaishali districts.

The medical experts had blamed delayed arrival of ailing children to the hospital for treatment for the maximum number of casualty reported in 2019.

Meanwhile, CM Nitish Kumar has stressed the need for preparedness for AES at a high level meeting held in Patna to take stock of the coronavirus in the state on Friday. The CM also instructed officers that expansion of the capacity of the SKMCH paediatric ICU to 1,000 beds, which he had ordered in the AES outbreak last year, be completed at the earliest.

He asked officials to get the under-construction 100-bed paediatric intensive care unit at the SKMCH, Muzaffarpur, ready at the earliest.

Around five to six blocks in Muzaffarpur district last year reported the maximum number of AES cases in summer. The number of AES cases registers a sharp rise after increase in heat. CM asked health officials to be on their toes from today itself so that proper treatment could be provided to all patients in case of a rise in the number of AES patients in the days ahead. He also asked officials to launch a special campaign to create awareness on AES.

Nitish also took stock of the situation on the spread of Covid-19 cases in the state and issued directions for officials involved in the operation of relief camps for stranded people.

He reviewed the bird flu and swine flu cases from officials of animal and fisheries resources department and asked them to maintain a close vigil on areas where the cases of unnatural death of birds were being reported.

Being the sole breadwinner of a family of six, Kudmethe does not leave home for work just because it puts food on his table, but because he is passionate about his job.

“Everyday, my children, wife and mother say that it’s a bad idea to be out on the streets doing this job. They are hearing so much about the Coronavirus and are scared,” says Kudmethe.

With a calm and composed mind, Kudmethe is going about his job in a practical manner. “My company BVG has provided us with all safety gears like quality masks and gloves and cap as well. With few people on the streets, our job has become easier,” said Kudmethe.

He leaves home around 6am for work which gives him immense pride.

“The city needs to be clean so that diseases don’t crop up. It’s our responsibility to ensure that garbage is collected from every house and disposed off in a proper manner. Everyone knows that we are doing an important job and many are appreciating it as well. With coronavirus spreading across the world, we have to ensure that citizens don’t face problems,” says Kudmethe.

Apart from the responsibility, there is a sense of ‘privilege’ too for Kudmethe. “Cops don’t stop us during this curfew time because they know we are providing a very important service. I have my uniform and my I-card which allows me to report for duty and go back home without any hassles,” said Kudmethe.

He knows that his job is not directly connected with coronavirus, but is aware of its importance. “One resident asked me why our team does not go on leave for three to four days and then resume after things are relatively stable. But I told them that garbage collection is one of the most important jobs. If we do not turn up for work for four days the garbage at home will start stinking and people will start dumping it in open places leading to more diseases and unhygienic conditions,” he said.

70,['29/03/2020'],What corona? Over 5k people throng Cotton Market to sell and buy veggies,"Nagpur: Cotton Market, biggest wholesale and retail vegetable market in the city, on Saturday witnessed at least 5,000 people jostling for essentials overcoming the fear of coronavirus.

Between life and death scare, it was the story of farmers’ survival who struggled to sell their produce even at throwaway prices; women labourers called as ‘hara’ who eke out a living by carrying veggies on their head and hundreds of retail vendors who buy from here and panicked customers.

Taking a quick look at this 110-year-old market, it was difficult to believe that city streets outside are so empty due to Covid-19 scare. While coronavirus has led to social distancing at most places, one couldn’t see it at Cotton Market.

Despite curfew in the city, small-time vendors and customers thronged here to buy vegetables and fruits. There are 4-5 entry points to the market and flooded in from all of them.

Even as NMC drew lines, social distancing seemed a big joke here. “What can I do? It’s question of me and my family’s survival. I earn hand-to-mouth by selling vegetables. If I don’t do business even for a day, it will be difficult to make ends meet,” said Gopal Nanhe, a vendor in business for 15 years.

Most of those who came to the market though wore masks. But if they feared the lurking lurking disease they did not show it on their face. Stocking up on vegetables was their first priority. This was despite the fact that virus is spreading in the city with 12 positive cases till date.

“We are using sanitizers and taking precautions but social distancing can’t happen in the small lanes of Cotton Market. Another reason is that people are apparently thinking they have no symptoms and hence nothing will happen to them. These people are risking their life and of others too,” says Ramesh Raut, a vegetable broker.

On Saturday, among the customers were affluent and educated people who had come in their cars as routine to procure bulk fruits and vegetables. There was more of panic buying though as there was no dearth of supplies.

Ram Moundekar, a wholesale vegetable trader, said, “On Friday the market had a weekly holiday. Another reason for the rush is closure of Kalamna Market for three days. All street vendors and sellers have turned to Cotton Market for purchases creating a crowd. They fear veggies supply will be stopped and there would also be price rise.”

Vegetable dealer Sohanlal Verma said, “There is no price rise owing to huge stocks. On Saturday the rush was due to farmers, who usually sell their produce at Kalamna, turning up at Cotton Market.”

Pravin Dabli, who went to buy some fruits, said, “I was there at 8.15am and was really shocked. The administration is putting cat among the pigeons. You never know who the carrier of virus is. There is no awareness among the people and newspapers, which do the job, are not being distributed.”

Dabli said, “With Railway Protection Force (RPF) help, many vegetable vendors in Motibagh on Kamptee Road have set up shops at safe distances on colony ground and customers too are maintaining social distance. One should buy from them.”

On Friday, TOI wrote that only 40% of the outlets had opened, a number many in the food trade said was inadequate to meet the demand from retail markets across the state. “Most have kept their outlets shut. Some of them stay in other districts and cannot come as trains are not running while others have a shortage of labourers,” said Chandan Chakraborti, president of the Posta Bazar Merchants’ Association.

“But we have adequate stock in our godowns. We are hiring local labour and convincing others to open their arhats so that we can meet the demand by early next week,” he said.

Additionally, with cops starting to issue online permissions for vehicles ferrying essential goods, the crisis will ease further.

74,['29/03/2020'],West Bengal: Market stabilizes as supply mechanism gets back on feet,"TimesView It is time to stop stocking up unnecessarily now that we have seen most essentials are still available. Panic buying can create an artificial shortage by disrupting the normal demand-supply dynamics.

KOLKATA: Supply chain bottlenecks have started to ease following chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s tough talks against over-zealous police personnel. Eight such personnel were closed from their duty. With supply line hindrances removed, prices of vegetables cooled off significantly. Though the demand-supply gap still exists in grocery items, it has been reduced considerably.According to shopowners, panic buying has started subsiding with households having stocked up already. Moreover, consumers have also adjusted to the lockdown routine. That markets have not been shut even for a day since the lockdown started has also worked as a confidence-boost. Shelves were also replenished regularly. It has sent a message to consumers that food will be available in the markets despite the lockdown.Instead of waiting for deliveries to their doorsteps by distributors of grocery and FMCG goods, retailers and kinara shopowners have taken it upon themselves to fetch the stock from the city's wholesale hubs in Burrabazar and Posta. They travelled to the wholesale hubs in cycles and two-wheelers to pick up stocks. Some shopowners got together and hired mini-trucks and entrusted the purchase to one amongst them. “A lot of retailers came and picked up their quota of goods. This has hastened the process of delivery to customers,” said Biswanath Agarwal, general secretary of Post Merchants’ Association.By Friday evening, several shops had replenished the stock of rice, flour and edible oil. In addition, most retailers rationed the stock, allowing customers to purchase maximum 5kg rice and flour and 1litre each of vegetable and mustard oil to ensure that they could cater to more customers.Vegetable prices, which saw the sharpest rise, stabilized across markets on Saturday, thanks to acute shortage of supply. The plunge of price has been to the extent of Rs 20 per kg. Shops selling vegetables were found to have been well-stocked, giving people hope that they would be available even a week or 10 days into the lockdown. The administration has been taking steps with the CM visiting markets herself to take stock of the situation, said Arun Kar of South Suburban Traders Association.“Thanks to the timely intervention of the chief minister, there is now much more ease in vendors’ movement and their access to market places. I was very anxious that over-zealous police might send the market into a coma. But CM’s warning against police did the magic. We have a very good crop on the field, there should not have been any shortage of supply,” said Kamal Dey, president of the West Bengal Vendors’ Federation.There is, however, still a shortage of some daily essentials like milk products like paneer and chicken. “The buying pattern has returned to normal in the last 24 hours. The scramble of panic buying has stopped. On the day the lockdown started, people were purchasing in bulk. This continued till Thursday evening but from Friday morning, the purchasing pattern has returned to normal,” said Tarak Nath Trivedi, secretary of the Entally market committee.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74869163,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-254574,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/market-stabilizes-as-supply-mechanism-gets-back-on-feet/articleshow/74867665.cms

PATNA: One Amit Kumar (25) was abducted by some people travelling in an SUV when he was on way to Jandaha market in Vaishali district along with his father to meet a doctor on his motorbike on March 24. The father-son duo was taken to Baruna Rasalpur village in neighbouring Samastipur district where Amit, a quack, was forced to marry a girl at gunpoint.

The matter came to light after Amit’s father, Musafir Rai, somehow managed to escape from the clutches of the abductors and reported the incident to the Jandaha police in Vaishali district on Friday.

Police rescued Amit from Samastipur late on Friday evening. On Saturday, Amit recorded his statement in a court at Hajipur under Section 164 of CrPC. The court later allowed him to go to his native village Naurangpur under the Mahnar police station in Vaishali district.

On Friday, a video of the ‘pakadua vivah’ also went viral on social media. In the video, Amit can be heard crying at the top of his voice for help. However, his cries went on deaf ears.

The video showed a group of youths jostling with Amit and exerting pressure on him to follow the marriage rituals. Even the priest was pressured to complete the process as early as possible.

According to the viral video, the authenticity of which TOI doesn’t confirm, an elderly man, who Amit called ‘chacha’ (uncle), seems to be aware of the whole kidnapping drama. “Had you (chacha) told me about this (marriage), I would have accepted it without demanding any dowry. But the way it is happening is not right,” Amit is heard saying in the video.

SHO of Jandaha police station Ajay Kumar said five people, including Vinod Rai and Nawal Rai, have been made accused in the FIR lodged by the victim’s father, an affluent farmer. “The girl is staying with her family. Further action will be taken on the basis of the court’s directive,” the SHO added.

According to the FIR, five people travelling in an SUV intercepted Amit near the primary health centre at Jandaha, forced him and his father to sit in the moving vehicle and took them to Baruna Rasalpur village under Halai police outpost in Samastiur district for marriage.

‘Pakadua vivah’ is quite common in districts like Vaishali, Samastipur, Begusarai, Lakhisarai, Khagaria, Nawada, Patna and Sheikhpura. Some cases have also been reported from Gaya and Jamui districts. “The disconcerting trend is a matter of concern,” said Sanjay Singh, a social activist.

According to an official data, altogether 4,488 people were abducted in the state for marriage in 2019.

PATNA: The Covid-19 threat is looming large over the state with new cases being reported almost every day. With questions being raised over the health infrastructure needed to tackle the pandemic, which has claimed over 5,500 lives worldwide, state health minister Mangal Pandey assures TOI's Sheezan Nezami that the government is doing its best to handle the crisis. Excerpts:

So far 10 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in Bihar. What is the state government, especially health department, doing to curb its spread?

Bihar has less number of Covid-19 positive cases than most other states, even though it is a densely populated state. Our government is identifying all those who are infected with this virus and quarantining them, so that it does not spread further. At this stage, identification of all those infected by Covid-19 virus is the most important thing.

Are you planning to increase the number of beds in the isolation wards, what about the 100 ventilators that the state government had planned to procure?

We have already made Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) with 800-bed capacity as a dedicated hospital for Covid-19. Besides, isolation wards have been created in all the medical college and hospitals and at present these beds are not fully occupied. If need arises, we will increase the number of beds. We have given the order for 100 ventilators and have also requested the Centre for help.

Doctors at government medical college and hospitals have complained that they are working without personal protective equipment (PPE) kit. What is the scenario now and what is the government doing to resolve this issue?

Shortage of PPE kits is a nationwide problem but we have provided sufficient kits in our hospitals. We have also requested the Centre to provide us PPE kits and they have given us positive assurance for the same.

Being the health minister, what message would you like to convey to the people?

I would appeal to people to not move out and abide by the instructions of the government. Also there is no need to worry about food and other basic commodities, because we have everything in abundance in the state.

Do you think we, as a country, have not taken enough measures to prevent the Covid-19 spread?

No I do not think so. Cases in India are much less than those in developed countries like France, Germany and USA.

VADODARA: Saturday brought in a mixed bag of news for Barodians. While a 56-year-old male with no foreign travel history was alarmingly declared Covid-19 positive on Saturday morning, three of the seven COVID-19 positive patients admitted at the isolation ward of state-run SSG Hospital tested negative.

The newly infected person is a friend of the 55-year-old London resident who is already getting treatment at the isolation ward of GMERS Gotri Hospital after he tested positive of the deadly virus. With this new case, the total number of infected cases rose to nine in the city.

Meanwhile, the three patients were tested twice at a gap of 24 hours for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) after which they were declared negative. Officials of the government hospital, however, said that the patients will remain under hospitalization for the next 14 days.

“We will again re-confirm by sending their samples for test after 14 days. Only after that and also looking at the condition of the patients that we will take a final decision on whether to discharge them or not,” said Dr Rajeev Daveshwar, medical superintendent of SSG Hospital.

Daveshwar said that there are less chances of any medical complications of these three patients. “But as per government guidelines, another 14 days isolation is mandatory,” he said.

The three who have tested negative include the NRI male from Spain, who was among the first to be declared COVID-19 infected in the city, while the two other are females who had come in contact with COVID-19 positive patients having travel history of Sri Lanka.

Now, there are six infected cases currently undergoing treatment, four at the SSG Hospital and two others at GMERS Gotri Hospital.

By Saturday evening, 85 individuals were screened at the SSG Hospital where two new suspects including a 85-year-old female and a 61-year-old male, were admitted. Their reports are awaited.

There have been far too many complaints from readers who have had to face harassment for not wearing masks even after health officials have repeatedly said they may not be necessary for a large section of the population.

KOLKATA: Venturing out without a mask is often resulting in harassment for citizens across Kolkata. Over the last one week, many have been accosted by policemen and civic volunteers and stopped from entering shops or queuing up at them without wearing mask. While the police said that they have no guideline, which says a mask is mandatory for citizens, experts have maintained that only healthworkers need to wear them apart from those who have Covid-19 symptoms.A senior citizen was intercepted by a constable at Maniktala market earlier this week for not wearing a mask. He was stopped from entering the market and asked why he was not wearing one. Civic volunteers have been accosting people without masks at Girish Park as well. Many have failed to acquire masks as they flew off the shelves after a huge spurt in demand. Doctors believe that the bulk of the masks are being used by those who don’t need it. “Unless you are venturing close to suspects or a crowd, which very few are doing now, you don’t really need a mask. Also, many are using it as a fashion accessory or just following the trend. This has deprived healthworkers of masks even though they need it most,” said a medic.A leading departmental store chain has refused to let customers in its outlets without masks. Those without one are being asked to wait outside and receive goods from a store assistant wearing a mask.“There is no official direction to make it compulsory. We are merely encouraging people, especially vendors at the markets to wear masks as they are vulnerable,” a senior police Kolkata Police officer said.A mask protects you, but you can’t use it for several days, said pulmonologist Raja Dhar. “It must be sanitized after 5-6 hours of use and discarded after 4-5 days.

84,['29/03/2020'],"Beggars are choosers, thanks to this Gandhian","Neelam Patel along with district health department carried out a health check-up of all beggars on Friday

Surat: Ever since Novel coronavirus started spreading its tentacles in the state, the beggars in Valsad town of South Gujarat were left with no choice but to go hungry as people were scared of going close to them.

This grim situation caught the attention of young Gandhian Neelam Patel, who has dedicated his life to the upliftment of tribal people in and around Khoba village in Dharmapur taluka of Valsad district on Gujarat-Maharashtra border.

“My native Gundlav village is just 3 km from Valsad town. When I was in Gundlav I noticed that lockdown had left beggars in a worst situation as people were scared to offer food to them at their doorsteps. Hence, I along with some volunteers decided to start a kitchen in my village to feed these people in Valsad town,” Patel (35) told TOI.

“We feed them twice a day and ensure that they don’t go hungry. There are around 172 beggars. Also, there are around 30 construction labourers who are stuck in the town due to the lockdown. On an average, we provide food to 200 people in Valsad town,”' adds Patel.

On Friday, Patel along with a team of district health department carried out a health check-up of all the beggars to ensure that they were not infected with the virus.

“Even if they have money, they can’t buy food as all restaurants and lodges are closed. They have no cooking facility. Hence, we have decided to give priority to these needy people,” Patel explains.

“Neelambhai and his team are doing a commendable work to help those in need in Valsad. Our district administration is helping them amid the lockdown situation,” said C R Kharsan, Valsad district collector.

Patel, a post graduate from Gujarat Vidyapith in Ahmedabad (2007), decided to go to a remote village (Khoba) and started work on education, health and environment in tribal areas, practising Gandhian principles. Two weeks ago, he along with others were felicitated by Gujarat Vidyapith and the US-based Gandhian Society for his exemplary work at the grass roots level. The awards were conferred by Elaben Bhatt, chancellor, and Anamik Shah, vice-chancellor of the Gujarat Vidyapith.

This comes after police in different parts of the country are being criticized for using unwarranted force against people, without checking if they came out of their homes for genuine reason like to get essential commodities or medical purpose.

The list of written instructions mentions the services and businesses that have been exempted from the current lockdown. At the same time, policemen have been instructed to intercept and tell people to return home if they have come out for something apart from necessity work and those not maintaining social distancing at public places.

SP Mokshada said, “I have instructed my staff to differentiate between trouble makers and citizens who go out to get essential commodities. We are here to stand guard in the true sense of the term.”

Another officer said that the police have got a chance to become the commoners’ hero by helping them in this time of crisis instead of using unwarranted force against them. Police sources said that they have been asked to abstain from using force. The superintendent of police has even warned of action if any video or photograph of using unwarranted force is found.

All the police station chiefs have been asked to personally ensure that these set of instructions are followed and compliance reports are submitted at regular intervals. To ensure that the instructions are implemented properly, the sub-divisional police officers have been asked to remain on continuous patrolling duty of their respective jurisdictions.

The district hospital has two isolation wards with 10 beds each.

Additional director (health) Dr Rakesh Dubey who inspected the wards on Saturday said, “I have directed officials to create two-metre distance between beds. I also told them to make a partition between beds.”

According to officials, when a person shows symptoms of Covid-19, he or she is admitted to the isolation ward and a sample is collected for novel coronavirus test. The patient is discharged only after they are tested negative. However, Bareilly has not reported any positive case so far.

A patient who was admitted at the isolation ward for two days said, “I shared the isolation ward with four more patients, and we had a common washroom. Though we all were tested negative, it was a risk to be in close contact with other patients as any positive case would have transmitted the virus to people who were tested negative.”

Meanwhile, Dubey has asked the officials to isolate the area near the wards and patients, and said vehicles should use alternate route to go to the women district hospital.

It is believed around 2 lakh of them have crossed Shahjahanpur district in the past 24 hours on their way to Bihar taking the Ghaziabad-Rampur-Bareilly-Lucknow-Gorakhpur-Muzaffarpur route.

Most of them have started to leave Delhi-NCR as they have nothing to do and nowhere to go as many of them were asked to vacate their houses. “At least, the wheat crop is ready for harvest now,” one of them said, while another retorted, “It is better to die at home than left stranded in Delhi alone.” Many of them have paid Rs 2,500 for their ride home in auto-rickshaws.

Shahjahanpur additional DM Ram Sewak Dwivedi told TOI, “We have arranged buses to ensure that the migrant labourers are sent back home. Hundreds of thousands of people have passed through Shahjahanpur in the past 24 hours and we are trying to provide maximum possible support to them in every possible way. The medical screening of the migrants will be done after they reach their destination.”

Police inspector Deepak Shukla deployed at Hardoi- Shahjahanpur National Highway-24 said that hundreds of auto-rickshaws, bearing Delhi registration, passed by in the past 24 hours. Shukla said he stopped a few of them, but all of them said that they were owners of the vehicles and had no other means of transport to travel back home. “Since we had orders to ensure that the migrants reached their homes safely, we didn’t ask many questions and offered them eatables,” Shukla said.

One of the migrant told TOI, “We had to leave in the auto as there were no buses available at Anand Vihar on Friday. We have been offered food at several places. We just want to reach back home as there was no one to support us there. With no income, we could not have been able to pay for our rented houses and make our both ends meet. We will have work at home as the wheat crop is almost ready for harvest.”

Another migrant, who was travelling in a mini-truck, said, “We were travelling on foot when police supported us and made us board this mini-truck so that we can at least reach Lucknow where can get a bus for Bihar. Our factory owner immediately sacked all of us and didn’t even arrange for our accommodation or food. We just want to reach back home as it is better to die there rather than staying elsewhere.”

91,['29/03/2020'],"As Mumbai docs test positive, mood in fraternity sombre","MUMBAI: Four of the 108 patients who tested positive for the coronavirus in Mumbai are doctors who reportedly got infected in the course of their work. One of the four dead patients was an 85-year-old retired urologist. Medical professionals face the highest risk of infection in the ongoing pandemic, with China and Italy losing tens of doctors in the past few months.

The mood among Mumbai’s doctors is hence predictably somber. “There are many among us who want to help the government, but there should be systematic way of using private doctors more effectively in the public health system,” said radiologist Dr Jignesh Thakkar .

While the authorities have cancelled leave for all public doctors, there are private doctors who want to help the public health system. This can be gauged by the fact that 75 private doctors signed up within 24 hours of BMC’s appeal to help at five of its peripheral hospitals. Now, the BMC has asked the Indian Medical Association (IMA) for a list of another 150 doctors who will help out.

However, a doctor who was first keen to help out said he is in a dilemma. “There is little in terms of protective equipment as the general people have bought off all the masks and sanitizers that should ideally have been used for the medical staff on the frontline,” he said. Dr Shivkumar Utture , president of Maharashtra Medical Council, said, “The large-scale buying of these medical safety devices by the public leave the doctors vulnerable.”

There is a feeling that the government should provide minimum protective devices for doctors as these are not available in the marketplace. A senior doctor asked, “If a doctor cannot have protection, how can she or he protect others?”

“The suspect, Rasool Sattar Qureshi, has confessed to the crime and said that he drew inspiration from a TV serial and hatched the plan,” Beed superintendent of police Harssh Poddar said on Friday.

“The suspect smashed the victim’s face beyond recognition, replaced his clothes with that of his own with identity cards after the murder in the early hours of March 17.”

The murder of the youth, Aleem Ismail Shaikh, had initially led police to believe that it was Qureshi’s body, but a detailed investigation, led by Poddar, revealed the truth, leading to the arrest.

According to the officer, Qureshi’s family identified the body and claimed it. Based on his brother Saber’s complaint, a murder case was registered against unidentified suspects and investigation launched.

“Spouse’s murder leaves a person in shock and grief, but Rasool’s wife did not show any such signs, raising our suspicion. We broadened the investigation and also focussed on the woman, whether she was herself directly or indirectly involved in the murder,” said Poddar.

During the course of investigation, police found Aleem, a liquor addict, was missing from the same locality. Police reached out to the missing youth’s family and gathered details such as his appearance and body structure and got an inkling that the deceased man could be Aleem and not Qureishi.

Police used informers and discovered that Qureshi was hiding in Hyderabad. He was nabbed with the help of Hyderabad police and brought back to Ambejogai on Thursday. A local court on Friday remanded him in police custody for four days.

According to Beed police, Qureshi revealed during questioning that in the year 2016, he along with his other accomplices had looted a petrol pump employee of Rs 3.20 lakh. After making desperate attempts to make the complainant as well as witnesses turn hostile in court, he planned the murder to evade punishment in that case.

Qureshi confessed that as per the plan, he returned to Ambejogai on March 14 from Hyderabad. On March 16, he went to the house of Aleem, who asked him for money for liquor. He, however, offered the victim food along with liquor in the evening.

Aleem reached out to Qureshi and both of them went to the Gawlipura area and consumed liquor. Aleem also smoked marijuana and fell asleep. The accused then returned home, collected his dress and a sharp weapon and returned to the spot and murdered Aleem in the early hours of March 17.

Qureshi smashed Aleem’s head beyond recognition and threw the weapon in the nearby bushes, parked his vehicle near a hospital and fled to Hyderabad.

99,['29/03/2020'],Jaipur women firefighters who are taking on coronavirus,"JAIPUR: Basant Kanwar’s day begins much before dawn as she has to report for duty at 7am. Before leaving her house at 6.15am, this 31-year-old firefighter not only takes care of the daily chores, but also prepares meals for her family members who are yet to wake up.That is just the beginning of the day and tougher tasks await. Basant is one of the six women fire officers of Jaipur Municipal Corporation’s fire brigade who are sent out to disinfect the city. Not an easy job not because of the health hazards, but the fact that people do not trust them to do such a job well.“It is not easy to fight the patriarchal mindset of people. When we go for disinfecting work or even on a fire call, some people mock us. Initially, they doubt our capability. But after they see us work, people clap and cheer for us. Elders give us their blessings it gives me joy, pride and immense satisfaction,” says Basant Kanwar.A mother of two children - aged four and one - Basant says she is extra careful about sanitising herself on reaching home. “My shift ends at 3pm and on reaching home, I take a bath and properly wash my uniform daily and only then touch my children and get started with daily chores. My in-laws are also elderly so precautions are a must,” she adds.While her family supports her, she admits that her neighbours are a bit sceptical about her current duty. “I don’t care. They need to realise that somebody will have to do this. Spraying disinfectants is necessary,” she says.Another fire officer Sushila Kumari (28) posted at Bindayaka fire station said her family including her in-laws are really proud of her. “I got married at the age of 20 and it was the support of my husband that I am here. They want me to serve in the time of crisis. It is discouraging when we are laughed on field by people. But I keep doing my work and also ask people to stay inside.”Currently, there are 50 women fire officer in Jaipur out which 20 have been deployed in spraying disinfectants. There are other women officers who are currently posted in the control rooms. From 8am to 7 pm, these women fire fighters play their role in trying to keep the city safe.People do appreciate their work but in the time of pandemic, families worry as well.Sita Khatik, working in control room says, “I have to keep a watch on the vehicles operating in the field. Give them instructions based on the inputs from JMC about the next place they should visit. It is a 12-hour job in the time of emergency. My husband and family members are worried and have asked me apply for leave. But how can I do that? Citizens trust us to do out jobs and we can’t break that trust.”“I am getting calls from my family members everyday asking me to stay inside,” said Raju Budadak, a 27-year-old fire officer posted at Jhotwara fire station. “They are worried as we are on field. But this is my job. If an army official can fight on the battle field leaving behind his family, why can’t I do that. Duty is always our priority,” said Raju.Authorities have provided them with gloves, masks and goggles especially for disinfectant work. While spraying, the officers cover their face and body completely as any drop of disinfectant leaves irritation on skin. One of the officers, on condition of anonymity, admitted that the disinfectants often cause headaches and burning in the eyes.“We do not have body suits but that does not deter us,” said one.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74870031,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-114312,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/women-firefighters-who-are-taking-on-the-virus/articleshow/74868211.cms

101,['29/03/2020'],Bus stands witness rush of migrants,"Jaipur: Amid the lockdown, various areas in the city including Sindhi Camp bus stand, Transport Nagar, Narayan Singh Circle witnessed the usual hullabaloo and frenzied activity.

Initially, things started on a disciplined note as migrant workers were made to sit on the road while maintaining proper distance, but later things got a little out of control.

By the evening, a large number of migrant workers from Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab had gathered at the bus stands. Some got lucky while many were sent back by the administration.

Soon after the state government announced to arrange RSRTC buses for migrants, over 35,000 workers gathered outside the Sindhi Camp bus stand while many were seen moving to other places where buses were to meant to halt.

In the beginning, policemen deployed in and around Sindhi Camp bus stand managed to keep the migrant workers in a queue on the road with safe distance, But, the numbers started increasing. Soon the exercise seemed to be going out of hand.

“We have some 5-6 buses now equipped with our staff. Gradually, we will get more buses. Our men announced on loud speakers and appealed to the gathering to go back home as we had a few buses to start with,” said Sudhir Bhati, manager, public relations, RSRTC.

The decision to start the buses led to a wave of euphoria among the migrants.

“I started walking at 11am from Sanganer to reach here in four hours. Now, they are saying they have no buses for Uttar Pradesh. This is wrong,” Abid Ahmad, a labourer who came along with wife and two children aged 5 and 8 years, told TOI.

Migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar were upset when they were told that RSRTC buses were not available for them since their state borders were closed. This triggered panic for a while, however, it was contained.

Naveen Jain, managing director, Sindhi Camp, also rushed to the Central bus stand to help control the situation. “The Uttar Pradesh border is sealed presently so we are not sending any buses there. We are in touch with the authorities. When the border opens, we will surely arrange for buses,” Jain said.

Nagpur: City police on Saturday may not have used canes in their new ‘humane approach’ but have come down heavily on violators straying onto the road breaching the section 144 imposed to break the coronavirus chain scare. The cops have also now put a restriction on issuing emergency passes to vehicles from police stations after misuse was reported from different places.

City police have stepped up checking on roads at nakabandi points. Around 979 persons faced the music, which included 68 people for straying onto roads without valid reasons. Five were booked for different violations imposed due to corona outbreak.

Police fined 906 vehicle users for moving without passes or having failed to furnish valid reasons after being intercepted.

District guardian minister Nitin Raut, who had briefed chief minister Uddhav Thackeray about the situation in the city and district, also had asked CP BK Upadhyay and rural SP Rakesh Ola to strictly enforce section 144 and restrict movement. He has also through a press communication appealed people to observe ‘social distancing’.

Upadhyay said checking has been increased across the city at every nakabandi and legal action is being taken. “We have now stopped issuing any emergency passes from the police stations unless an officer of deputy commissioner level approves it. There have been reports of misuse of the passes. We have found out that people are distributing copies to others too which is wrong. Hence the decision,” said Upadhyay.

“We have already distributed substantial number of passes but it has to be lessened now to ensure less people turn up on roads as we are going through critical phase of the viral infection,” said the top cop.

The top cop also made it clear order has been given to detain vehicles of people who coming out on roads without valid reasons not falling under essential commodities and emergency services. City police till Friday had distributed 16,554 passes but gave away just 280 on Saturday.

Upadhyay and his second-in-command joint CP Ravindra Kadam said the police are also focusing on inducing the ‘social distancing habits’ among the masses. On Friday, Upadhyay visited numbers of places including Itwari market and Kamal Chowk to check the grocery and other shops of essential commodities.

He also instructed several shopkeepers to drawn circles to ensure social distancing by their customers. “NMC should draw the circles with some paints and not lime which gets washed out or fades fast,” said CP.

TOI on Saturday spotted Ganeshpeth police visiting the fruit market outside eastern side of the railway station. The cops explained the fruit vendors the importance of social distancing and urged them to draw the circles in front of their outlets.

TOI also was present with cops at nakabandis at Dosar Bhavan Chowk and later at Marwadi Chowk. “We are checking vehicles too at the nakabandis and recording the names of riders or motorists along with their registration numbers,” said sub-inspector Vijaykumar Punde of Lakadganj police station who was leading the nakabandi at Marwadi Chowk near Itwari.

Senior PI of Lakadganj Narendra Hiware, ACP Balchandra Mundhe and Zonal DCP Rahul Maknikar too were present.

Upadhyay, despite being at home, was available on wireless and walkie-talkies supervising checking of citizens and vehicles at the nakabandi points with the zonal DCPs and crime branch.

The decision to register offences has been taken by police commissioner Chiranjeev Prasad, after it was noticed that the pleas of the district administration, health authorities have fallen on deaf ears.

Police said many were stepping out of their homes without sporting mask. As per the data available on Thursday, two offences have been registered and six people booked. Authorities said the cases were being registered under IPC section 188 (disobeying order duly promulgated by the authorities) and also under relevant sections of National Disaster Management Act, 2005.

“People stepping out of their homes without appropriately covering their mouth and nose are posing a serious threat of either getting infected and becoming a carrier, or infecting others they come across,” Prasad told TOI.

The officer said he was worried about the police personnel on the roads, who are at the risk of getting infected due to non-serious approach of some citizens.

Sources said that the police have even decided to initiate stringent actions against those found violating the lockdown orders repeatedly. “We have decided to use local intelligence for identifying people repeatedly violating lockdown orders,” said an officer.

Meanwhile, Muslims community avoided offering Friday prayers at mosques. The management of many mosques had also locked their respective premises and displayed board requesting people to offer even Friday prayers at home.

According to BMC sources, the civic body has sought a list of shops from the councillors; following which around 300 shops have been identified and roped in to provide the doorstep service, while the process of identifying more shops is underway. Meanwhile, effort is also on to rope in Zomato to deliver necessary items to the customers.

Speaking to TOI, Bareilly municipal commissioner Abhishek Anand said, “All councillors were directed to collect details of big and small grocery stores located in their respective wards. So far, around 300 shops have been identified from across the city. These shops are located at the prime locations as well as in the interiors of the city. The identified shop owners will depute helpers to deliver necessary household items at the doorsteps of the residents. Meanwhile, we are identifying more shops to expand the doorstep delivery.”

“We are also trying to rope in Zomato for the delivery of necessary items. Their employees will be in contact with the identified shopkeepers and when customers place orders with the shops, they will deliver the order to their doorsteps. The councillors will provide contact details of the identified shopkeepers to the people in their respective wards. The service will be initiated in a day or two,” he said.

Is there any medicine to cure

virus?

Amid panic,

is at its peak. How should people stay away from it?

What are precautions to be taken for keeping away from Covid-19 virus?

Why did the virus spread rapidly in China, Italy and Iran?

Despite screenings, whey were such a large number of patients not detected?

How is IMA helping out the government to tackle this epidemic?

During his visit to the city on Saturday to launch a campaign against fake news on coronavirus , state president of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Dr Avinash Bhondwe warned that the deadly virus could take form of an epidemic if precautions aren’t taken. In a tête-à-tête with TOI, he spoke on various aspects of virus that has caused a widespread panic across the globe and led to over 5,000 deaths.It started from China but there is no point in believing that it leaked from a biological weapon which their authorities were testing. This virus is found in bats and snakes from where it transformed into the human body. Interestingly, the virus mutated in the humans and started multiplying.This seems to be similar to HIV.Like AIDS virus came from apes, even this one is transmitted from animals. Other viruses like Ebola, Nipah, SARS, and Swine Flu among others, came from animals and had caused widespread havoc in the world.The Chinese authorities reported the virus on December 31 to the World Health Organisation (WHO) authorities. According to scientists world over, it would take over a year to find out a breakthrough on it. However, when it caused deaths in China, the scientists there conducted some research. They’ve shared their findings with the United States, who would be carrying the research further. Unlike, common perception, there is no concrete proof that Covid-19 may not survive beyond 25 degrees. So, the people shouldn’t believe on any such myths, unless declared by WHO. However, any virus can’t survive any temperature over 55 degrees.Various misconceptions and theories are doing the rounds on the social media and people are blindly forwarding them without verifying its authenticity. Right from prescribing wrong medicines to stopping certain kind of foods like eggs and chicken, everything is blindly posted on the social media which has its repercussions. The poultry business suffered adversely and the poor farmers who were dependent on it are on road after suffering massive losses of over Rs800 crore.Even government agencies and doctors are found to be spreading lies.Correct. On January 30, AYUSH, the government of India’s apex body for alternative medicine, had advertised two homeopathic medicines, including Aresinicum Album-30, for curing the novel coronavirus. After IMA authorities came to know about it, they immediately lodged the complaint and subsequently, the advertisement was removed. Now, when apex government agencies are indulging in such things, what to expect from common public. We’ll be lodging a police complaint against one doctor from Mumbai for misleading the people and also will be raising the issue with Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC).Pune always hogs limelight when it comes to such deadly diseases.I don’t know the reason, but yes Pune, remains epicentre for such diseases like dengue and Swine Flu, which was first detected on August 2, 2009, in the school. In fact, the ‘Epidemic Act’ of 1897, which was invoked by the Maharashtra government to close down malls, theatres and other establishments, originated from Pune, when it was struck by plague in 1896. The legislation was previously implemented during outbreak of swine flu. The imposition of this law that time led to assassination of British plague commissioner WC Rand and military escort Lieutenant Ayerst by Chapekar brothers in Pune on June 22, 1987. The brothers didn’t like British government removing people and their articles, including gods, from home for disinfecting their homes.Some senior health officers revealed patient’s name to media in city, due to which his family suffered.It’s completely wrong and unethical to disclose names of any patient due to social stigma attached to it, which continues for lifetime for them. Though, there are no such rules against revealing the names, the people should understand that it brings troubles to the patient’s family members who were ostracized by the society at times. In one case in Pune, relatives of a patient were not allowed to enter the society premises. Unfortunately, we’re yet to mature as the society and therefore, patient’s names should be strictly withheld.Apart from the government’s advisory, the citizens should avoid attending the mass gatherings and also wear masks. But there is no need to wear N-95 masks which are only for the doctors. Ideally, the masks shouldn’t be used more than once and should be disposed of properly in dustbins. If people feel that there are symptoms, they should immediately report to the government hospitals only which are well equipped to handle such cases. Washing hands with either soap or sanitizer is same, there is not much difference.Frankly, all these countries didn’t take it seriously and were ill prepared. China, later made a strong comeback after losing thousands of lives. They’re now in complete control. In India, the government is really doing a commendable job and seems to be well equipped to meet any eventuality.The screenings at airports are very poorly done and many of them escaped. However, even the virus takes time to multiply in some cases and therefore such people also got away.

He didn’t have to look for long as he soon ended up working at a construction site and even started saving to send money back to his ailing parents.Just weeks later, the contractor who hired him said that he couldn’t pay him any more as the government has put all construction on hold in the wake of the lockdown announced in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Mahajan and his family were among the group of eight who were heading back to their hometown Suhagi in Madhya Pradesh on Saturday, after being laid off.“The contractor says he would not be able to pay me anything for the next three months. We have nothing to do here. Hence, we are going back to our village,” said Mahajan.TOI spotted hundreds of migrant labourers returning to their hometowns after being stranded in the city with little to no money following the lockdown. With train and bus operations suspended during the 21-day lockdown, the group has no option but to cover the distance on foot. Mahajan and his wife take turns to hold their son Shivam who gets tired easily. In his 20s, the youth isn’t too hopeful about what awaits him back home. “There are hardly any jobs in my village. I don’t know how I will look after my family,” he rued.It’s the same scene every few kilometres — exhausted men, women and children walking for miles, carrying their belongings bundled in sacks and sometimes a toddler or two on their shoulders. The crisis hasn’t been any kinder to the elderly who are left in a lurch and have to join in the exodus despite their fragile bones. Near the city limits, Amal leads a group of six men who have been walking from Shahdol, around 300 kilometes away, and are going to Bareilly. “We left our workplace on Thursday with a heavy heart after the factory where we worked shut down. I wanted to stick around and see if I could find something else. However, I had to leave when I realised there is no work,” said the landless daily wager. A group of Good Samaritans who distributed food packets in Prayagraj was the only bright spot on his gloomy day. The water and food they gave him the strength to keep walking.TOI also came across a group of around 100 labourers who were going towards Satna and Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, near Sulemsarai in Dhoomanganj. “As all construction has stopped in the city and even small businesses like dhabas and roadside eateries have shut, we are forced to go back, ” said Sandeep, a youth who whitewashed homes and buildings for a living. He and his four brothers were leaving the city along with their families.Help arrived soon after district magistrate Bhanu Chandra Goswami and SSP Satyarth Aniruddh Pankaj were informed about the labourers’ plight. Dhoomanganj police served the group food. While police told them that they were welcome to stay at the shelters set up by the district administration during the lockdown, the latter chose to continue their journey.“Sir, please don’t stop us. We don’t want to stay here because this we will not be able to earn anything for the next two weeks. If we don’t earn, how will our families survive?” said Govind, one of the labourers of the group. However, later in the evening, the labourers finally agreed to stay back after the SSP assured them that the administration would send them back to their hometowns in trucks and buses on Sunday.

Dr Ashutosh Sayana, principal GDMCH, told TOI that the telemedicine service was started from the day of Janata Curfew (March 22) onwards after a team of eight doctors, including two women, was designated by the medical college for the purpose. The team has been receiving calls not just from Dehradun but from cities like Meerut, Noida, Saharanpur, Bijnor, Chandigarh, and others.“We started telemedicine services in order to reduce the influx of patients in the OPD. So, the phone numbers of the doctors were circulated via newspapers and social media platforms. We are taking calls from 9 am to 10 pm and every doctor has designated hours for providing consultation,” said Dr Sayana while adding that although the telemedicine services is getting an overwhelming response, some people are misusing it by sending lewd messages to female doctors. The official added that the team received 200 calls on Day 1 (March 22) and this number has been rising since then.

115,['29/03/2020'],"Rain spells, Covid-19 lockdown to reduce wildfires in U’khand: Experts","yyyyyyyyyy

Dehradun: The intermittent spells of rain and the lockdown imposed to combat the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to help Uttarakhand in escaping the wrath of forest fires which engulf huge swathes of green cover and claim lives (both human and animal) almost every year, say forest experts.

The wildfires usually start in the state from mid-February onwards but this year, Uttarakhand has recorded just three instances of forest fires so far. In 2019, Uttarakhand had lost 2981.55 hectares of forest cover in 2,158 instances between February and early June and had spent over Rs 55 lakh to douse the flames.

“The state may record lesser number of wildfire incidents this year because the periodic rain spells are moisturising the forest floor and tree leaves haven’t become completely dry as yet, so they are less inflammable,” Amit Kumar Verma, a scientist at Dehradun-based Forest Research Institute (FRI), told TOI. He added that good rain spells during the last months of 2019 reduced the chances of massive wildfires this year. “Analysing the data of last 15 years, we can say that forest fire instances are usually low when precipitation during winter season is high,” Verma added.

Adding to Verma’s observation, SR Reddy, assistant silviculturist at FRI, told TOI, “Extended winters and sufficient rainfall have reduced inflammable materials in the forest. Just atmospheric temperature and wind direction alone cannot set the forests ablaze as wildfires require dry leaves as well.”

Along with good rain spells, less movement of people inside forests due to the Covid-19 lockdown has also reduced chances of massive wildfire instances. “Some of those who come to the forest carelessly flick cigarettes or beedis and matchsticks into the bushes. This often becomes the cause of a forest fire. The less movement of people in and around the forests due to the imposition of the lockdown will further reduce forest fire incidents,” BK Gangtey, chief conservator of forests and state nodal officer of Uttarakhand forest department, told TOI.

Notably, the state government had released Rs 20 crore for the forest department to douse wildfires in 2019 and that fund hasn’t been exhausted yet. “We still have some of the amount that was sanctioned to us in 2019 and that money is to be used for fighting forest fires till March- end. We will get more funds to combat wildfires by the second week of April,” added Gangtey.

The panchayats have asked farmers to make arrangements for their food and shelter.

Dinesh Shiddhapara, sarpanch of Juangavad village in in Jasdan, said, “We have directed all farmers to ensure labourers do not leave villages. The season is over and they were about to leave but due to this virus situation we have asked them to stay back. Several panchayats in Jasdan and Junagadh have told farmers to give them shelter in the fields and ensure that their daily needs are met.”

Shiddhapara said farmers are finding it difficult to convince them to stay. “Labourers tell farmers that they are fit and nothing is going to happen to them,” he said.

Valji Solanki of the panchayat of Juni Mengani village in Rajkot district said, “We have given responsibility to farmers that under no circumstances should labourers be allowed to leave the village. Some of them had left for Holi and had not returned. They are sent to nearby fields at a higher rate to pluck cotton. The panchayat has also appointed people who make rounds of the village to check if the labourers are there or have left.”

Mahmad Sidha a farmer from Junagadh says, “The labourers are taken care of but late in the night they leave the village. I had 10 labourers and all of them left at three in the night and they even switched off their phones so that they cannot be contacted.”

Sidha said that in the absence of migrant labourers, demand for local labourers has suddenly increased. Earlier when they use to settle for Rs 200-250 a day, these days they are asking for Rs 400 a day as they know that the farmer will need help for plucking, loading and unloading.”

Heena Patel, sarpanch of Kachigam in Valsad, said, “All migrants have left and villagers are now forced to work with local labourers.”

QRT has informed police who contacted the foreign return and asked him to observe home-quarantine in Bihar.

One of the deputy collectors told TOI, “QRT of ward no. 30 on Friday received complaints from people about the foreign returned person. He is a resident of Ashirwad Nagar and had returned from Qatar on March 16. His name is not in the list of home-quarantine people as it was being prepared from March 18. Still, QRT has written to Sakkardara police about tension among people,” the official said.

Sakkardara PI Ajit Sid told TOI that a team of Sakkardara police station and NMC employees visited the house of the foreign return. They learnt that the person and his parents have gone to Patna in Bihar to attend a marriage ceremony of his relative. His wife was already in Patna. We contacted the person on mobile and asked to observe home-quarantine. The person claims he is negative for coronavirus,” he said.

Satish Bihare, husband of ward corporator Snehal, said the man should be tested in Patna and people should be informed accordingly. “He met many people and stayed here till March 18. Currently, his sisters and their children are at home here. Whoever met him are afraid. He returned from Qatar so might have asked to go for home quarantine at the airport. He should have not gone out of city,” he said.

Bihare further said that NMC employees have told him that family members of the person who are here have refused to go for testing.

A social worker from Ashirwad Nagar, Ishaq Mansoori, said, “The foreign return is my neighbour. He met me after returning from Qatar. Tension is obvious as none of the authorities are telling whether the person is negative or positive,” he said.

TOI on March 25 had reported Sonegaon police registered an offence against a woman who went to UP despite being advised home-quarantine for 14 days.

There are around 1,012 persons who have been asked to ensure home quarantine for 14 days. QRTs are visiting all these people from Thursday. Until now, the NMC and collector office were monitoring them only through calls.

SURAT: At least 48 truck drivers of Bardoli sugar factory , accused of indulging in rioting and attacking police and factory officials, were sent to Lajpore Central jail here on Saturday.

About 300 drivers and cleaners of transport trucks owned by Bardoli sugar factory had gathered at the factory premises on Thursday night, refusing to transport sugarcane from the fields due to lockdown and harassment by police at check points. When the management asked them to continue the work, they got agitated and indulged in rioting, causing damage to property of the sugar mill.

A police team led by Bardoli police inspector MM Gilatar rushed to the spot but were pelted with stones by the truck drivers and cleaners. Cops were also beaten up by wooden sticks. Five policemen, including police inspector Gilatar, received injuries in the attack, sources said.

Gilatar told TOI, “The truck drivers and cleaners wanted to go home due to lockdown amid the scare of COVID-19 everywhere. They refused to transport sugarcane from the fields, but the management wanted them to stay for another 15 days. However, the drivers got agitated and attacked the officials of the sugar mill and later us.”

Gilatar added, “Four constables sustained injuries and they were shifted to Sardar Hospital in Bardoli. I too received an injury in my left leg. We managed to nab 48 drivers and cleaners from the spot, while others escaped. A case of rioting and damaging property, including public, has been registered against a mob of 100 people.”

The 48 accused were produced in a local court on Saturday which sent them to judicial custody. They have been lodged at Laljpore Central Jail, the police inspector said.

Bhavesh Patel, vice-president of Bardoli sugar factory, told TOI, “Many truck drivers were beaten up by police when they were coming to the factory with sugarcane from Uchhal and Nizar talukas. The truck drivers wanted to stop the supply of sugarcane to the factory due to the attack. We tried to pacify them over the issue, but they were adamant on their demand. First they attacked us and when the police arrived at the factory, they started throwing stones and also attacked them with daggers and sticks.”

Dr Smita Nalgirkar, who is heading the Covid-19 control room of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), said increasing awareness about the pandemic as well as fear about the disease has led to an increase in the number of screening.

“The rise in suspected cases of Covid-19 is not a reason to worry unless lab reports confirm the disease. Many people with common flu-like symptoms are getting themselves tested voluntarily as awareness about the pandemic has been heightened. The phobia associated with the disease has also led to increased voluntary screening,” she said.

The change in weather conditions due to unseasonal showers is also being blamed for the spurt in flu-like cases. Aurangabad had reported one case of Covid-19 positive patient, who has been cured and discharged from hospital recently.

A total of 49 suspected cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the past 72-hours in the city, taking the total number of such cases to 113 on Friday.

Meanwhile, the number of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) cases has increased to 11 with one patient succumbing to the disease. As per official data, 118 individuals are home quarantined besides 11 of those who are facing institutional quarantine at state-run health facilities.

Health authorities said an official follow-up has been taken of over 600 people who were in contact with the woman. The total number of individuals whose health follow-up is being taken by the authorities is 713.

The civic body has also initiated a door-to-door health survey of citizens as a preventive measure against Covid-19. The field survey, which is carried out using 150 teams, has visited 20,126 houses covering 92,571 people by Friday. “The field survey has not reported any suspected case so far, which is a good sign. The citizens should follow the social distancing norm and abide the rules of ongoign lockdown,” Nalgirkar said.

On the surge in cases of SARI, health authorities said special attention is being given to such patients. “SARI patients admitted at health facilities are being tested for Covid-19 and their lab reports are awaited. We appeal to public not to get panic and approach nearest healthcare facility in case of any respiratory related complaints,” authorities said.

Notably, based on the results of around 1,000 random tests of SARI patients, the Indian Council of Medical Research said on Thursday has stated that there is no community transmission of Covid-19 in India.

Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) has deployed only two 108 ambulances , which are specially equipped to care for patients with critical health problems, for ferrying suspected cases to test them for Covid-19 virus at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH), also known as Mayo hospital . On Saturday, one of them was seen overloaded while several suspects had to wait for hours on end.

Until Thursday, the emergency medical services (EMS) vehicles had comfortably ferried suspects in batches from different areas to Mayo hospital. But from Friday onwards, the NMC began containment drive in mainly south-west Nagpur and has continuously been tracing several close contacts of positive patients in south-west and north Nagpur.

On Friday, 18 suspected persons were called for testing while on 12 were taken in the night. All were from south-west Nagpur. On Saturday, the focus shifted to north Nagpur and 14 close contacts of the 10th patient were taken in two batches.

ut before the 14 reached Mayo hospital, they had to wait for over an hour for the EMS ambulance which was reportedly dropping other suspects to MLA hostel quarantine facility. An elderly woman, who was working at the 10th’s patient’s home, was forced to wait outside. Others waited inside their homes.

The suspects are not allowed to use even their private vehicles.

NMC’s health department in-charge Dr Bhavana Sonkusare said though there are around 42 EMS ambulances and 10 owned by the civic body, only two are specified for suspects.

“We have been sanitizing them with 5% sodium hypochloride each time. The ambulances are spacious and can accommodate six suspects. But, the ambulance is not relieved immediately before taking next trip because of the formalities of the suspects who have to remain seated till their entries are made at the hospital,” she said.

When informed that more than six travelled in the ambulance, she thanked TOI for pointing out and said she will look into it.

The two ambulances are one each under Laxmi Nagar zone and Mangalwari zone.

She agreed that the vehicles were stressed because of increasing demand from different areas.

Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy held a meeting with the ministers, aqua exporters, representatives of the aqua industry and officials of the fisheries department and fixed the price of Vannamei shrimp. The price fixed will continue till April 14.

Minister for fisheries Mopidevi Venkataramana said aquaculture is being undertaken in over two lakh acres in seven districts. China, the US and European countries are AP’s major market (90% of aqua produce is exported). However the global pandemic has hit the aqua sector, he added.

Venkataramana said in a bid to rescue aqua farmers, the government has fixed the price for Vannamei prawn . The price of Vannamei for 30-count is Rs 430 per kg, while the 40-count is Rs 310 per kg, 50-count is Rs 260 per kg, 70-count Rs 220 per kg, 80-count Rs 200 a kg, 90-count Rs 190 and the price of Vannamei for 100-count is Rs 180 per kg. The price will remain the same till April 14 in spite of market fluctuation, he added.

Admitting that coronavirus scare has hit the aqua and poultry sectors, Venkataramana ruled out rumours that the two sectors will shut down completely in coming days. If the traders and exporters cheat the aqua farmers, the government will register criminal cases against them and cancel their licenses, he added.

The government has directed officials of police, revenue, and other departments concerned to not prevent vehicles carrying marine and poultry products. The lockdown will not apply to vehicles transporting marine, eggs, and chicken products. Besides, they were instructed to allow workers in aqua farming sector to travel and implement social distancing.

Hundreds of migrant worker have started leaving their workplaces due to the lockdown after being abandoned by their contractors and employers. With the movements of vehicles being reduced to only those ferrying essential goods and for emergency services, the workers are left with no choice but to return on foot.

Joint CP Ravindra Kadam said there is an advisory from the central government stating that migrant workers need to be rehabilitated and such mass exodus is not allowed. “The civic administration has identified few government schools where the labourers will be sheltered. The district administration will be providing them with food and other facilities,” he said.

“The labourers are abandoned by their contractors and employers who sneaked away from the work sites leaving them with instructions to leave the place. The labourers do not even know the names or the mobile phone numbers of their contractors. “Still police managed to arrange their stay at the sites where they worked after contacting their contractors,” the joint CP said.

CP B K Upadhyay too said police have already started sending them back to their workplace or retaining them at the temporary shelter sites in the last two days.

SP Rakesh Ola said on Saturday that around 70 migrant labourers were sheltered at a temporary place at Narkhed after they were found travelling in a private bus which was detained. “Police, the district administration and NGO will be providing food and other needs in collaborative manner,” he said. “The numbers have become less though,” the SP said.

Vadodara: The never-say-die spirit of Vadodara’s vanguards — the firemen of Vadodara Fire and Emergency Services — have helped save the citizens during all kinds of emergencies.

Not only in the city, they have even reached out to neighbouring talukas too, and remarkably the first ones to arrive the spot and last ones to leave — be it a man-made calamity or a natural disaster.

Likewise, these firemen are once again risking their lives to sanitize the city in order to contain the spread of coronavirus. In the process, at least eight firemen have suffered major reactions on their skin from the exposure to raw chemical – sodium hypochloride – which the Vadodara Municipal Corporation had been spraying everywhere mixed with water.

The fire department started sanitization activities on March 23 and have been carrying it out continuously across the city. The civic body had given them face masks, gloves and gum boots. But in absence of a proper protective suits, these firemen have to handle the chemical laced water directly leading to rashes and burning sensations on their skin. Many firemen’s uniforms have also lost their original colour after being exposed to the chemical water.

“Reactions on the skin had started from day one itself, but we continued working thinking that it may be normal. But as more and more firemen started complaining about similar symptoms, we realized that it is due to the chemical water,” said an affected fireman.

Another fireman said that the burning sensation is very strong. “I am not even able to wear long pants. The rashes had developed two days back, but the burning sensation is still there,” he said.

“We are going to raise this issue with the chief officer so that we can at least get proper gears. A large part of our workforce is involved in sanitization activity and if all of them get affected, the department will run into difficulties during emergencies,” a fire officer said.

“Only four of our men have been affected till now but are continuing their work after treatment. The skin reactions have been caused because of improper proportion of chemical which was added. They added higher than what was prescribed,” said in-charge chief fire officer, Parth Brahmbhatt.

143,['29/03/2020'],"192 undertrials, 500 convicts may be out from Central Jail","Nagpur: In all, 192 undertrials, having offences with punishment upto or less than seven years and not of any heinous variety, are likely to be released on interim bail of 45 days from Nagpur central jail as per the guidelines of the Supreme Court to decongest the prisons against the backdrop of coronavirus spread. Another 500 may be released through parole after government issues notifications.

On Saturday, eight inmates were already bound for home after release orders were executed. The rest would likely to leave late on Saturday evening and taken to their home by city and rural police vehicles.

Superintendent of jail Anup Kumre said the list of 192 release warrants was being scrutinized. “We have finalized the release of around 130 inmates who have been taken out of their barracks but their process will take time to be finished,” he said. “Through parole another 500 are expected to be released for 45 days,” he said.

In Nagpur, the process of bail process was coordinated by District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) secretary and civil judge senior division Abhijeet Deshmukh under the guidance of principal district and sessions judge Sanjay Mehare.

Along with release of the undertrials, the jail authorities are now likely to decide on the release of the convicts through emergency parole. The inmates, booked under serious offences and stringent enactments like Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA), narcotic cases and so on, would not be considered.

The 192 undertrials also include 13 from the three taluka courts of Kalmeshwar, Katol and Bhiwapur. The undertrials whose release orders were issued by city-based courts on Saturday could not be released as the orders were yet to be processed by the jail authorities after being received post-noon.

State home minister Anil Deshmukh had issued an order on Friday stating around 11,000 inmates would be released through emergency parole. The decision was taken following a supreme court order on March 23 instructing states to take measures to de-congest jails as a step to avoid the corona infection among inmates. Most Indian jails have more inmates than their capacity.

A high power committee has been set up by the state under a high court judge to decide on the modalities. The Maharashtra Legal Services Authority (MLSA) is co-ordinating the release of the inmates.

“DLSA had applied for the bail of the deserving inmates before the courts and later orders were sent to the jail along with the PR bonds and release warrant,” said DLSA secretary Deshmukh. “The bail orders initially are for 45 days and may extend to another 30 days depending upon the situation,” he said.

UP has 119 sugar mills, of which 29 had sought permission from the state government to manufacture alcohol-based sanitizer. Among the 25 mills that have got the nod, five are in Bijnor district.

The initiative will help to boost revenue of the sugar industries. Alcohol is produced from molasses, a residue of sugarcane after sugar is extracted from cane juice. Hence, these mills will have the raw material to produce sanitizer.

Additional cane commissioner VK Shukla said, ""The demand for sanitizers has skyrocketed since the coronavirus scare gripped the nation. There is a demand-supply gap the market.""

The government had invited application for licence to manufacture sanitizer a few days ago. A total of 29 units in the state had applied for it. Now, these 24 units will start producing sanitizer from Sunday.""

Talking to TOI, Narpat Singh, unit head of Barkatpur mill in Bijnor, said, ""Our mill will produce around 5,000 litres of sanitizer per day. We are waiting for the packing machine, and production will start from Sunday. Once adequate supply is maintained, the prices for sanitizer in the market will become cheaper.""

According to official sources, after nationwide lockdown, demand for petrol has gone down drastically. Mills produce ethanol from alcohol, and the former is mixed with petrol in the ratio 1:10. As ethanol is not lifted these days, mills have been facing storage problem. The production of sanitizer will to some extent boost the sugar industry.

Though the state government has been giving priority for public welfare and releasing funds to tackle coronavirus spread, it is worried that it has a mountain to climb to pay salaries, pension to government employees and also to release amounts for regular welfare schemes if the situation does not ease by April.March being the closure of the financial year, the government had hoped to net more revenues than the monthly revenues from various revenue earning departments such as commercial taxes and transport department.Official sources said the government earns about Rs 9,000 crore every month through various taxes and from the Centre’s share. Of this, the state gets about Rs 7,000 crore from GST, excise, stamps and registration and transport department.“Of the total revenues, about Rs 3,500 crore is required for salaries and pensions to government employees and the rest is required for payment of bills and implementing welfare schemes like Aasara pensions. Our assessment is the government has only 40% revenues in its kitty this March. For payment of salaries and other expenditure, there will not be any problem for this month (April 1). But, if the lockdown is extended, the state may face problem for payments for April (May 1),” a senior finance official averred.Sources said the commercial taxes department, which is the primary source of the revenues, had earned Rs 45,000 crore during 2019-20. Thanks to the lockdown, the department has not been able to garner much. “In March 2019, collections from GST and VAT were Rs 5,200 crore.

For instance, for February 2020, they have to make payments by March 20. Though the payments can be paid online, many have not paid their taxes due to the lockdown.“We have asked the respective tax officials to call up the traders of their respective circles to make payments for this month,” an official of the commercial taxes told STOI.Many traders are reluctant to pay as they have no business and also have to make salary payments for their workers, sources said.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74870420,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-785018,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/huge-salary-pension-bills-worry-state-govt/articleshow/74868537.cms

Besides causing damage to crops, the showers, which were accompanied by strong winds, also uprooted trees and disrupted power supply in several parts of both districts.

As per the official data, Marathwada, as a whole, has reported 12mm average rainfall in March so far. Hingoli has reported the highest (23mm), followed by Aurangabad (17mm), Jalna (12mm), Beed (11mm), Nanded (10mm), Latur, Parbhani (both 8mm) and Osmanabad (6mm).

As per the forecast released by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Aurangabad is likely to witness partly cloudy skies with possibility of thunder-lightning over the next 48 hours, followed by partial overcast conditions in the subsequent two days. The Met department has also predicted rain or thundershowers for two days from April 2.

Farmer activist Deepak Joshi accused the government of not helping the farming community enough. “Despite strong demand, no action was taken by the authorities to assess the damage caused to crops due to the recent untimely rainfall. The unseasonal rain is causing problems for farmers already hit by a lull in the market due to the coronavirus outbreak,” he said.

Aurangabad divisional commissioner Sunil Kendrekar could not be reached for his comments.

Meanwhile, rainfall activity has lowered the mercury level in the city. At 19.2 degrees celsius, Aurangabad reported a drop of one unit in average minimum temperature. The data related to maximum temperature was not available.

155,['29/03/2020'],Disruption in water &amp; power supply adds to citizens’ woes,"Aurangabad: Citizens confined to homes due to lockdown were at the receiving end of disruption in the water supply as well as frequent power cuts.

Parts of city areas, including HUDCO, Mukundwadi and Chikalthana reportedly received water during evening hours instead of morning. While the city gets tap water after a gap of four days, the delay in supply posed difficulties before affected residents.

“We get water by 6.30 am but did not receive it without any intimation. The stored water also exhausted and we did not have water even for bathing. The water supply finally started by 4.30 in the afternoon,” said Guari Relgaokar, a resident of the N-11 area.

When contacted, Kiran Dhande, in-charge of water supply at the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), said that the disruption in power supply had its effect on the water supply for the city.

“The water treatment plant at Farola was operating below capacity due to disruption in power supply and therefore the schedule of water supply was collapsed. We, however, distributed water with certain delay,” he said.

Amid untimely showers and heavy winds, power supply continues to play hide and seek with citizens. While power outage was witnessed for a considerable time on Friday night, frequent power cuts were observed in many city areas during subsequent 24-hours.

“The power cuts were rampant during morning hours on Saturday. It was nuisance when the entire family is confined to home due to the current lockdown,” said Swati Pawar, a resident of the Garkheda area.

When contacted, MSEDCL authorities said that the restoration work resulted in power cuts in parts of the city. “The unseasonal rain and winds had damaged the distribution network in some areas and power cuts were imposed when the repair work was on,” authorities concerned said.

MSEDCL consumers from Aurangabad zone can contact on designated helpline numbers to address complaints of power disruption due to inclement weather. These numbers are — Aurangabad city 7066042410/7066042412, Aurangabad rural 7875756652 and Jalna circle 7875764144.

The residents stressed the civic administration should put in efforts to maintain hygiene in the city, especially amid the coronavirus scare.On the flip side, workers of the solid waste collection and handling (SwaCH) collective revealed that some societies did not allow them to go inside for door-to-door collection because of the fear of coronavirus. Residents then dumped garbage along the roads or burn it, they claimed.SWaCH workers in Sahakarnagar, who normally go door-to-door for collecting garbage, have stopped going inside the buildings. They now blow a whistle when they come near a building.“How will we hear the whistle in the morning hustle and bustle? We did not even know that they have started this new system. Our garbage was not lifted for five days. The absence of the contract workers is another issue we have been facing,” said a resident.In some places, the societies’ office-bearers proactively went to the local police chowkey to get permission for the SWaCH workers to come inside the buildings to do their job.A section of residents raised alarm over burning of garbage in the open in the past few days. The unattended waste and burning of garbage would not only lead to health-related issues but also attract stray dogs, the residents stressed.Santosh Shah, a resident of Shivajinagar, said garbage was set on fire at least thrice in the past four days in the area. “Even this (Saturday) morning, people from our locality sniffed burning garbage. People should not feel suffocated at home because of burning of trash. Attempts to burn waste should be stopped,” Shah said.Residents from the NIBM Road area said the garbage collection was irregular off late and they could spot garbage dumped along roads. “The situation has become more challenging after the rain on Saturday,” a resident said.Similar concerns were raised in Hadapsar. Some residents claimed that garbage was not being lifted regularly from public places.The civic administration claimed the garbage collection had not stopped at any place and that focused attempts would be planned to clear the waste on priority from the areas where the nuisance was more.According to the PMC officials, the number of cases pertaining to throwing garbage on the road and garbage-burning have gone down compared to other days. The administration has filed only six cases in the past couple of days.During the lockdown, the number of people venturing on the road has reduced and so has such offences. The ward offices and the main office of solid waste management department has deployed manpower for cleaning garbage.“The action against such (garbage-dumping) offences has not stopped. Though the cases have not stopped totally, the number has reduced.

157,['29/03/2020'],That strange feeling at night on deserted roads,"Pune: Friday midnight. The road the city’s young and old throng to live their dreams on weekends sports a deserted look. No roadside birthday parties around Vaishali, no hugging.

Not a single wrong-side biker to yell at. The so-familiar high decibel bickering of pavement dwellers is also missing.

Everything is amiss. The silence on FC Road is eerie. It’s lockdown, just Day 4.

As the car rolls along Apte Road, dry leaves rustle under the wheels. A couple of healthy dogs march outside a private bank’s ATM — popular with late night revellers wanting to withdraw cash. The security guard inside is in deep slumber.

Soon after taking a left turn, on JM Road, near Lakdi Pul, policemen stop the vehicle. The “Press” sticker is the permit to drive on after a sermon on wearing “masks”.

The left lane on Lakdi Pul is barricaded. So, wrong becomes right in times of Covid-19. The car negotiates the barricades at Alka Chowk and takes a left towards Tilak Road.

Barring barking dogs running after the four-wheeler and newly planted trees on the roadside, there is no one else for the next 3km. Only silence.

The usually crowded Swargate bus stand wears a deserted look. No hindrance of haphazardly parked long-distance private buses. Only a few barricades put up by the police to restrict the movement of people at the junction.

The pitch-dark stretch of Shankar Sheth Road till “Seven Loves Chowk” and barking dogs here and there nearly creates an unusual feeling. Not a single Gultekdi-bound vegetable van passes by till Golibar Maidan.

Usually, one needs to be extremely cautious while taking a right turn just after the Pune Cantonment Board office even late in the night or at dawn. Not so in the early hours of this Saturday.

Speeding young bikers generally zip past the 3km stretch towards Lullanagar during weekends. No such luck now. They, too, have locked down.

No taillight in sight. No irritating flashes of headlights on the rear-view mirror. Once again, trees and barking dogs tailing the car are the only signs of life. The road leading to Salunke Vihar society from Kondhwa Road is also deserted. An eatery that usually wakes up at night on Salunke Vihar Road is shut, too.

Finally, an open medicine store, but with its grilles down. Outside, a young couple enjoying their ice cream.

158,['29/03/2020'],Nurses and paramedics stage protestagainst substandard protective gear,"Meerut: Just two days after a Baghpat-based man was diagnosed with Covid-19 infection, nurses and paramedic staff staged a sit-in against “casual attitude of health department” towards their safety.

According to protesting staff at Baghpat district hospital, they have been provided with either substandard protective gear or the one used in fight against HIV protection. Staff nurse Mukesh Nagar said, “We have been deputed at the coronavirus isolation ward. We are ready to discharge our duties, but at least, we should be provided with proper protective gear. We are being provided with substandard gear. Also, the ones used against HIV infection are ineffective in defence against the deadly virus. How can we work under such circumstances? Besides, there are no hand sanitisers and no proper changing rooms in the facility.”

Baghpat chief medical officer Dr RK Tandon refuted the charges and told TOI on Saturday, “This is just a way of avoiding duty. Be it coronavirus or HIV, they are both viruses and same protective kit is used for treatment of patients. And there are enough of such kits in Baghpat.”

However, KK Gupta, director general, UP department of medical education and training, admitted that there is a difference between the two. “There is no denying the fact that we are running short of personal protective kits used for coronavirus and we are trying to bridge that gap. Nevertheless, the currently available HIV kits are equally effective with certain modifications.”

Baghpat additional district magistrate Amit Kumar, said, “We have assured the staff of better facilities. Regarding sanitisers and other things, we have taken action on that. They all have resumed their duties.”

Farmers who can’t immediately sell their produce due to the Covid-19 crisis and the 21-day lockdown can store them in the godowns across the district for 30 days, an official of the agriculture marketing committee said. “There are godowns in the city, Kinathukadavu, Thondamuthur, Sulur, Annur, Karamadai, Senjeri, Negamam, Pollachi and Anamalai. We used to charge farmers five paise per quintal and others 10 paise per quintal to use the facilities. But due to the lockdown, we have made the facilities free for 30 days,” she said.

“Earlier, farmers could get up to 50% of the value of the produce they store in the godown as loan. Now it has been increased to 75%, up to a maximum of Rs 3 lakh. Earlier, there was an exemption on interest for the first 15 days of availing the loan. Now that has been made 30 days,” the official said. “Some farmers have already stored turmeric and Bengal gram in some of the facilities.”

A medical officer at the Sassoon General Hospital, where a post-mortem was conducted on deceased Naresh Shinde (49), told TOI that the preliminary cause of his death was indicative of a heart attack. His viscera had been preserved for further analysis, the doctor said.

Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Dhakane said, “Case of accidental death has been transferred from the Shikrapur police to the Pimpri Chinchwad police. I have started the inquiry process.”

Shinde’s son, Nilesh, told TOI he wanted an FIR to be registered against all the policemen present at the toll plaza when the incident occurred. He said the Pimpri Chinchwad police assured him the FIR would be registered.

When Nilesh and his father were taking a patient and his relatives from Mumbai to Ahmednagar on Friday, police allegedly stopped the ambulance at Urse toll plaza suspecting that they were ferrying passengers. “When my father told them we were carrying a patient, they did not listen and hit him on his thigh,” Nilesh said.

Shinde said the police had demanded Rs5,000 from them, but later took Rs3,000. As he drove further, his father fell unconscious. “I tried to admit him to a few hospitals near Chakan but in vain. Later, when we went to a hospital in Shikrapur, my father was pronounced dead by the doctors,” he said.

While Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University ( Bamu ) has announced that it would resume functioning only for essential work from April 1, Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University (SRTMU), Nanded, has declared such reopening only after lockdown is over by April 14.

A section of staffers, including higher-ups from both these universities, have started ‘work from home’ practice to deliver essential work.

Student activist Tukaram Saraf on Saturday said that Maharashtra governor, who is the ex-officio chancellor of the state universities, must intervene and ensure uniformity in the reopening of varsities.

“It is high time that the chancellor steps in and draws somewhat uniform timetable for universities during the current time of crisis. The universities are bound to face academic and non-academic issues and, therefore, an official intervention from the governor is required,” he said.

An official mail sent to the office of Maharashtra governor highlighting the aforesaid demand remained unanswered till Saturday evening.

In view of state government imposing Section 144 of CrPC to contain the spread of Covid-19, Bamu has announced closure till end of the current month. Different university departments, sub-centre at Osmanabad and Model College at Ghansawangi in Jalna district have been witnessing complete closure currently. The SRTMU has extended closure period till April 14 and allowed staff to execute essential work as allowed by the government in the meantime.

It was also inviting breeding of mosquitoes, they stressed.Ramehs Thakar, a resident of Dhankawadi, said a lot of water accumulated near Padmavati Chowk on Satara Road over the past two days because of rain. It had not been cleared by the corporation, he said.“Today (Saturday) the rain was heavier than the past two days. Instances of waterlogging are bound to go up. The civic administration should deploy its machinery to clear the water and ensure that the roadsides remain dry,” Thakar said.The instances of waterlogging went up on Saturday after many areas in the city received a heavy spell of rain. Several roads were submerged in the accumulated rain water, especially in the low-laying areas.Vivek Dani, a resident of Shivajinagar, said waterlogging was a major problem on the entire stretch from Patil Estate on old Pune-Mumbai highway up to Khadki. “The accumulated water outside the new bus terminus of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation looks like a pond.

NAGPUR: Rising above all hurdles of class, caste and curfew, several citizens are making food arrangements for the needy, daily wagers, stranded drivers, migrants and the elderly in different ways.

Some are providing cooked food packets daily, handing over monthly quota of groceries , while others are seeking donations and sponsorship for crowd funding. These Nagpurians, separated by occupations and personal belief, are now united against hunger .

Misal Layout (Jaripatka) Gurudwara is daily serving 500 slumdwellers on the outskirts of the city. “We decided to focus outside as usually they go unnoticed,” said Gagan Singh Raina.

Chartered accountant Shilpi Agarwal said they have provided groceries to 100 families from Khapri, Mihan, and railway station through her NGO ‘Power of One’. “The NMC has assigned us Dharampeth to provide food,” said Agarwal. Her husband Ajay, who too is a CA, had been working on the initiative.

Ashraf Ali, who works in a private company, said him and his relatives have pooled in funds for the cause. “We are serving food and will distribute kits at Central Avenue slums.”

NGO Khoka Foundation too is sending cooked food and groceries to people by going to their hometown on foot. “We will serve till the lockdown is over,” said its founder Sanjay Nagar.

Organizations like Gurudwara Guru Nanak Darbar based at Pachpaoli are distributing hot food to the poor and needy. So far, its young volunteers have distributed packets to over 8,500 persons, which mostly included migrants, labourers and those living in slums.

“Ever since we started, we’ve been receiving numerous calls. Even people moving to their native places in Madhya Pradesh are calling us. Most of them hadn’t had anything since the last few days and it was evident the way they were eating and thanking us. We’re serving them hot pulao, chapatis and sabji,” said Jasmit Singh, a volunteer, adding that they were also receiving foodgrains for langar from the citizens.

Rotary Club of Nagpur Ishanya is distributing packets containing foodgrains in slums at Mankapur and other areas like Bhandewadi, Nagalwadi and Isasani behind Lata Mangeshkar Hospital. “We’ve distributed 4,000 bags so far weighing 10kg each. Those contain 2kg wheat flour and rice 1kg pulses, 3kg potatoes and onions, half litre oil, six biscuit packets and a soap,” said member Kirti Agrawal, a chartered accountant.

She added that those who want to join them or donate can contact the club members or through Facebook.

A group of like-minded professionals have come together to help the needy and they’re getting overwhelming response to their drive. They’re distributing packets containing foodgrains and other essential items to the needy which would last for a month.

“We’ve so far handed over 300 bags in various areas across the city. Our target is to donate 500 bags. It contains foodgrains, oil, sugar, and even a sanitiser. We’ve received donations from a majority of our friends and we’re also contributing on our own,” said Pramod Batra, an advertisement professional.

PUNE: The state government has decided to convert civic schools and marriage halls into temporary shelters as a part of an action plan to accommodate stranded migrant labourers.

Pune collector Naval Kishore Ram told TOI that the temporary shelters will be set up at 150 sites to accommodate over 50,000 homeless and migrant labourers. He said work is on to ready the structures and the workers will be shifted.

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday directed officials to locate safe spaces or temporary shelters to self-isolate the homeless population and prevent them from moving out of the city. Empty civic schools were chosen since they have water supply facilities and rooms to shelter the migrants.

Along with schools, disused marriage halls were also discussed as possible solution and the same has been explored.

“There will be no worker on the road and all of them will be provided shelter,” said Ram, who held a detailed discussion with the labour commissioner. He has also requested non-governmental organisations to ensure that there is enough provisions for them.

While developer bodies have started distributing food and provisions to construction workers in camps, they have also agreed to pay them minimum allowances too.

The district collector said that the food and civil supplies department will be roped in to provide cooked food or ration to the homeless.

The lockdown has left thousands of migrant workers from Bengal Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and other states stranded and helpless in Pune, Mumbai and other metros.

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has directed collectors from metro cities to locate safe spaces or temporary shelters to self-isolate the homeless population.

The officials have zeroed in on available empty civic schools as they have facilities for water and rooms. With the government having invoked emergency provisions under the Epidemic Act, 1857, to acquire these, the collectors have been given the responsibility of mapping the homeless population and community outfits working for their welfare.

SURAT: Don’t think this forced stay-at-home is a vacation and that studies are over as you have been promoted without exam! Valsad police are out with a new devise to check if the students are also studying during the lockdown period.

Brainchild of Sunil Joshi, superintendent of police, Valsad, Sarjan 21 — a project was launched on Thursday wherein cops have started a testing facility through WhatsApp in which school students can participate and submit their answers.

Named after the 21 days lockdown, the project aims at breaking children’s boredom and also keep their academic activities alive. Already 250 children have participated in the project, while the police are encouraging more children to participate in it. While cops in some other districts of the state have started encouraging indoor games and activity for children, Valsad is the only district in the state that has started academic tests for the students.

The top scorers will be given a prize and all the participants will be felicitated once the lockdown period is over.

A student can take part in the tests by sending WhatsApp message on a mobile number with basic details. Once approved, the participants will receive question paper daily on their WhatsApp and the candidate will have to reply with answers written on a page. The question papers are in multiple choice question (MCQ) format.

""Though simple it is very effective. Expert teachers have prepared the question papers and students will have to just write question number and the option number of its answer in front of it on plain paper. They can share the image back on WhatsApp,” explained Joshi, while saying that top three scorers will be felicitated daily.

A regular participant will be felicitated at the end of lockdown period, Joshi added.

Apart from school students, people from all age groups too can participate in multiple other activities that have been planned. Police has organised competitions in various categories — ranging from literature, art, to games like carrom board and chess, videos and musical instrument performances too. The police will also be distributing books, sources said.

Literature has been divided into three categories, namely essay writing; story writing and poetry, gazal and shayari writing. Art will comprise drawing competition and all of it will be held through WhatsApp daily.

People can also practice playing musical instruments like guitar, keyboard and mouth organ and after the lockdown is lifted, a competition will be held for the best performer. Cops are also delivering carrom and chess kits to participants at their doorstep after they buy these kits at affordable prices.

""We have arranged enough number of indoor game kits and musical instruments to involve maximum number of people. We are delivering properly sanitized products to the participants,"" said Joshi.

While one can showcase talent through video recorded and WhatsApped to the cops, book-lovers can select books from the list provided by police on WhatsApp which will get home delivered post payment.

The workers reached their homes in WB after a four-day long journey on March 24, a day before the national lockdown came into effect. The move came at a time when many guest workers are still stranded across the country following nationwide travel disruptions.

The society, which has 2,500 guest workers on it rolls, engaged the buses when some workers expressed their desire to stay with their families during the Covid-19 situation. “Though train services were open, we decided to book buses so that the journey was safe and comfortable for worker as trains were too crowded then,” said ULCCS chief project coordinator TK Kishor Kumar, adding that the society had ensured that its workers were all in good health before the journey from Vadakara on March 20.

He said the workers were dropped off at Malda. “Though workers reached home safely, the return journey for the buses was difficult; one is now stranded at Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh due to the lockdown,” he added.

He said that the remaining guest workers, staying back in Kerala, have their food and accommodation though the works of the society remains suspended.

The workers-owned society had in the past too adopted guest worker-friendly policies and had given society membership to some of them.

Among the stranded seafarers are five each from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and others from Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Harayana and Maharashtra. “They are in dire need of help,” Capt Sanjay Prashar of Forum for Integrated National Security (FINS) said.

Sangeeta Bhagwan, who lives in Hyderabad, said her brother and other seafarers needed help to provide for their necessities and also for their repatriation.

According to Sangeeta, they were offboarded from cruise ship Pullmantur Sovereign from the port of Malaga in Spain on March 21. Since there were no flights, they could not fly back to India.

“My aged mother is worried about the well-being of my brother just like the families in Spain, ,” she said. Sangeeta said the Indian embassy in Spain had responded positively. The embassy said it had spoken to the group and was in constant touch with their employer Pullmantur Cruceros who also confirmed their accommodation at the hotel till April 2.

Meanwhile, six more people approached the ESI Hospital with flu-like symptoms on Saturday. While none of them have much of a travel history, officials are testing them for the virus to rule out infection.

As part of the containment exercise, health department officials said they would monitor all the residents in the 5km radius of the city’s first Covid-19 patient’s house, including a 2km buffer zone.

Dr G Ramesh Kumar, deputy director of public health, said, “We have been instructed to allocate one trained health worker for every 50 houses and one doctor for every 200 houses. The health worker will go door to door and check people for symptoms of flu. People with cold or cough will be asked to isolate themselves within their houses or take up room quarantine. Those with fever or breathlessness will be hospitalized and tested. This is because the virus transmits via droplets too.”

Officials would execute the containment exercise at Saibaba Colony and KK Pudur, as the patient had visited and spent time at both the locations. “This is to ensure we do not miss out on even a stray case or miss detecting a chance of local transmission,” said another public health department official.

This containment exercise is expected to be completed by Tuesday or Wednesday, the latest. “The lockdown and restriction on movement are also expected to be more stringent in these two areas,” he said.

A source with the ESI Hospital said 14 of the 16 people, whose throat swabs and blood samples were sent for test on Friday, have tested negative for the virus. “The test results of two people, who were in contact with the doctor who treated two Covid-19 Thai nationals, are inconclusive. We have sent their throat swabs and blood samples for retesting. The test result of the doctor is also yet to arrive,” the source said.

180,['29/03/2020'],‘Unlikely people testing +ve but no community spread yet’,"NEW DELHI: Testing of hospitalised cases of severe acute respiratory infection ( SARI ) has brought forth some sporadic cases of Covid-19 without travel or contact history, but the government and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said the instances are inadequate to conclude there is community transmission .

“There are some sporadic cases of Covid-19 where the patients do not have travel or contact history but those numbers are too few so it cannot be said that there is widespread community transmission yet,” said Dr R R Gangakhedkar , head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at ICMR.

“Sometimes, patients do not remember their exposure history and there have been instances where some patients even try to hide their travel history,” he added.

Experts say community transmission in India would mean clusters, more than one, that mix to spread the infection in the community where the link in terms of contacts with patients and foreign travellers go missing. India has not yet reached that stage even as the virus infection has spread into clusters with localised transmission.

“There would be 8-10 clusters in a city like Delhi which then sees cases burgeoning,” said a senior health official. So far the Centre and states have acted fast to contain outbreaks like the one at Bhilwara .

To keep a check on the transmission level, ICMR was initially doing random sampling of hospitalised SARI cases to check if there are Covid-19 cases among such patients with travel or contact history. While initial two rounds of sampling tested negative for Covid-19, ICMR stopped random sampling exercise. Instead, the government eventually shifted its testing strategy to expand it to include all hospitalised SARI cases which also helped the council to asses whether there is any community spread happening.

Around 4000 such samples have been tested so far in an increase from previous exercises while ICMR has tested 27,688 samples for SARS-CoV2 till Friday. “Till we see a significant number of cases to indicate community transmission, let us not over-interpret things,” Gangakhedkar said.

SURAT: Two women labourers were killed on the railway bridge on the Daman-Ganga river between Vapi and Karambeli railway station in Valsad district in the early hours of Saturday. Sources said the incident occurred about 5am when the duo was crossing the railway bridge and a speeding goods train going towards Valsad knocked them down.

It is believed that the women were walking in the middle of the track as the movement of passenger trains have stopped due to the nation-wide lockdown.

A team of Vapi town police immediately rushed to the spot and sent the bodies for post mortem at the Vapi public health centre (PHC).

Vapi town police said, “The women were labourers and were going to their native due to the lockdown. As train movement have been stopped, the deceased were walking in the middle of the tracks, unmindful of the fact that that a goods train was approaching them from behind.”

The officer further said that the police found the bodies lying on the tracks and there wasn’t anybody around. We are yet to ascertain the identity of the women, he added.

A statement from the Western Railway (WR) said, “Two women crossing tracks at 5am got hit by a speeding goods train between Vapi and Karambeli railway station. People should keep away from railway tracks and not cross or walk over them as goods trains are being run to supply essential commodities to various parts of the country for general public in the lockdown.”

Sub-inspector Santosh Shinde from Kondhwa police station told TOI, “Arao came with his luggage around 10pm and told us that he had left his residence because it had become difficult for him to survive without money as he was not getting help from his acquaintances. He was looking restless and hunger-struck. We connected with an online aggregator and supplied him food. We also provided him ration for around 10 days.”

187,['29/03/2020'],Poultry farms feel heat of lockdown,"Coimbatore: Vincent, who owns a poultry farm that has more than 7 ,000 birds near Sathyamangalam, says he has lost 200 chicks in the last one week. He blames it on underfeeding as he has not received fresh feed for the last eight days, despite it being classified an essential commodity. Now, he is forced to ration the three bags of feed left.

Like the 30,000 poultry farm owners in Coimbatore, Vincent hopes the chief minister’s announcement on no restriction on transport of cattle, poultry, fish, eggs and cattle feed will give some relief.

Layer poultry (egg laying birds) farmers in Namakkal were also not receiving feed till Friday, says president of the Tamil Nadu Poultry Farmers Association R Nallathambi. ""Trucks carrying oilseed cakes and rice husks could reach here after repeated requests. But it meets only 30% of our requirement. We are struggling without soya cakes that come from Karnataka via Hosur and maize and small millets like jowar and bajra that come from Mysore via Dimbam,"" he says.

Feed shortage has led to many poultry farmers starving their birds, Nallathambi says. ""Production in the poultry cluster has fallen by 50 lakh eggs. We have 4.5 crore to five crore birds and used to produce four crore eggs a day. But now we are sending only 3.5 crore eggs. As we can’t even sell our birds to markets in Kerala and Karnataka, we have no choice but to see them starve.""

“We could bring vehicles carrying rice husk and oilseeds only after pleading to district collectors and submitting the vehicle numbers,” says Nallathambi.

Though the collectors and animal husbandry department officials have slotted livestock feed under ‘essential commodities’ and promised not to hamper movement, revenue officials and police personnel on the roads have not received the instructions, says general manager of Suguna Foods Ravindhara Babu. “So, trucks carrying feed from Udumalpet to other districts often get stopped and officials harass the drivers. Due to this, drivers are afraid to come for work, hampering feed distribution.”

Meanwhile, severe drop in business has affected the broiler chicken farms in the Palladam region. There are 26,000 broiler chicken farms in Palladam alone.

""We are able to send only 30% of our stock though people are now consuming chicken confidently. This is because all chicken shops are closed,” says Saadhai Kannan of the Broiler Chicken Farmers Association in Palladam. “As we can’t send the birds to markets, they are just consuming feed and getting fat. Some weigh three kilograms.”

“All these will eventually affect our ability to buy feed and pay our employees,” Kannan adds.

Local administration minister S P Velumani on Saturday reiterated that vehicles carrying livestock feed will not be stopped. Poultry farmers hope police will listen to the minister.

The move will also benefit the partners who deliver as their earnings had dipped substantially following the lockdown with only a handful restaurant kitchens operating now and order count declining sharply.The decision to pool in the delivery partners of Swiggy and Zomato to meet the demand for grocery delivery was taken at a meeting convened by chief secretary Rajeeva Sinha at Nabanna on Saturday.

The monitoring committee, with judicial secretary, superintendent of police, South Andamans and president of bar association of Port Blair as other members, has been directed to make assessment of all relevant factors including supply of essential commodities, medicine and fuel for residents of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The directives were issued based on an email and WhatsApp message by an advocate to the chief justice of Kolkata high court.

The bench also directed district judge to notify the public that in urgent situation they can file petitions before the registry with soft copies and email them to Kolkata registry to be placed before the chief justice. Similar directive was also issued to judicial secretary, who is the member secretary of state legal services authority, Andaman & Nicobar Islands.

The letter by the advocate said the lockdown goes far beyond what was mandated by the Union government and that it is not possible to step out of the house for any reason whatsoever. ""Despite three days having passed, there is still no clear system in place for provision of essential food supplies to all persons.""

A government official said they have been receiving distress calls from people because of lack of food and medicine. ""Some of them even threatened suicide. There are mothers who can’t get milk substitutes for babies. The situation is quite bad,"" said the official.

A former ward councilor said they have now started to break the guidelines and start opening shops.

Deployment of residents in various facilities has been designated for screening and management of patients with Covid-19 and non-Covid areas at the hospital. The hospital would be divided into 3 broad zones — non- Covid area, Covid area (looking after patients with mild to moderate illness) and critical area like the ICU. In addition, a triage area needs to be developed in the emergency where patients with acute and severe respiratory illness will be treated. SOP for reallocation of residents/ PG and nursing students is part of the hospital management to treat Covid.

The government has formulated two schemes and will transfer the funds directly into the bank accounts of those registered with the department with no application required.

Minister for labour and employment Jennifer Monserrate said that 15,000 construction workers would receive financial support equivalent to the wages of 15 days while around 4,000 labourers would get a one time grant of Rs 4,000.

“As we navigate one of the toughest challenges of our lives, our labourers and construction workers are facing severe hardships due to the loss of their livelihood. I am extending support through two schemes from the labour and employment department,” Monserrate said.

She, however, did not specify when the funds would be released and how much the government had allocated for the two schemes.

As an emergency measure, all registered construction workers shall get a monetary package equivalent of 15 days of wages of a semi-skilled worker, under the Goa Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board Assistance Scheme Covid-19, the department said.

Under the Goa Labour Welfare Board Assistance Scheme Covid-19, Rs 4,000 has been sanctioned as “a one-time relief” to all Goa building and other construction (GBOC) workers, with around 4,000 eligible beneficiaries identified.

“All transfers shall happen transparently through direct benefit transfer to their bank account without any application. I truly hope this support may help them to tide over this calamity with dignity,” Monserrate said.

Apart from the registered construction workers, there are hundreds of migrant workers stranded in the state after the state closed down the borders.

With all economic activity halted, many of these workers who survive on daily wages, face a grave crisis with food and money running out.

201,['29/03/2020'],Students relieved as NEET and CA exams postponed,"Nashik: Many students expressed relief after it was announced that the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test ( NEET ) and the Chartered Accountancy (CA) examinations have been postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The NEET, conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA), was scheduled for May 3. The examination is conducted for MBBS and BDS aspirants.

Prasad Rokade, a second-year junior college student, said the NTA’s decision to postpone the exam was a good move. “We have been unable to attend tutorials because of the outbreak. Our parents too were starting to panic. We will now get more time to study. The situation is also expected to get better,” he said.

Students appearing for the exam have been stuck in a state of uncertainty for a while now. It’s a one-day pen and paper test in which students have to answer multiple-choice questions on OMR sheets within three hours. The NEET has a total of 18 examination centres across the state. Nashik is one of the most important centres as nearly 20,000 students from the city appear for the exam.

Sandeep Badgujar, who conducts private classes for NEET, said the NTA’s decision to postpone the exam was a wise move. “But the testing agency should announce a new exam date as soon as possible. That will give some direction to the students,” he said.

The NTA was supposed to release hall tickets on March 27. The tickets will now be released once the exam dates are announced.

The CA exams , meanwhile, will now be held on June 19 and July 4. The examinations were earlier scheduled from May 2 to May 18.

“We will now get more time to study. Both the libraries of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India libraries (ICAI) have been closed in the city. We have also been unable to attend coaching classes,” Rachit Kulkarni, a student appearing for the CA final examination, said. Kulkarni added that studying at home has not been very efficient for most students because they have been distracted by family members watching television during the lockdown.

Over 3,000 students are set to appear for the foundation, intermediate and final examinations of chartered accountancy in the city.

Subsidized wheat and rice are made available to them under this scheme. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the quantity of rations provided would be increased and lentils would also be provided free of cost. However, the district administration is yet to receive a written order in this regard.

Bhaskar Tayade, district civil supplies officer (DCSO), told TOI that there were 15.45 lakh beneficiaries in the city and 16.26 lakh in the district. “Beneficiaries from the city need 4,634 quintals of wheat and 3,528 quintals of rice per month. If three months’ ration is provided in one go then we will need 13,902 quintals of wheat and 10,584 quintals of rice,” he said.

“Rural beneficiaries need 4,801 quintals of wheat and 3,940 quintals of rice every month. The figure for three months is 14,403 quintals and 11,820 quintals respectively,” said Tayade. The department has enough stock for beneficiaries. “There are 698 ration shops in the city and 1,292 in the district,” he said.

The state government has stated that rations of April, May and June should be provided to beneficiaries with effect from April 1. However, this announcement made on television along with that of Sitharaman’s resulted in long queues at ration shops. In many places, police had to disperse the crowds.

The government resolution (GR) states that the contractors who transport foodgrains from the godowns of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) to ration shops should be asked to carry extra quantity. No fresh tenders should be called for and the registration numbers of vehicles, names of the drivers and their mobile numbers should be noted.

The contractors should be instructed to put up boards displaying Maharashtra government, essential services and public distribution system so that the vehicles are not stopped by police personnel.

The department has been asked to publicize provision of ration for three months in one go widely. Deputy commissioner (supplies) should constantly monitor the distribution of foodgrains and if problems arise, they should be immediately brought to the notice of government.

BENGALURU: An activist and his friends, carrying food packets and oodles of compassion, fan out to various areas to help people struggling without employment and basic resources.

AS Khan, a resident of Shivajinagar, said he and his friends provide meals auto drivers, beggars, homeless and other vulnerable groups. The initiative began on March 21, the day the government asked eateries across the city to suspend operations, and it was expanded on March 24, the day the three-week national lockdown was announced.

In the past six days, they have distributed over 3,000 packets of meals such pulao, ghee rice and curd rice in City Market, Gandhinagar, Majestic, Mysore Road, Victoria Road, near Bowring Hospital, and other areas.

“We have all the comforts we need, but there are people who struggle to eat even once a day. When I realised that, I decided to head out to help them,” he said.

Khan is the Karnataka president of NGO Council of Human Rights and Bhrastachar Mukt Samaj. His initiative is mostly self-funded with support from a few of his friends.

“I have spent about Rs 70,000 to date, but the satisfaction I get when a hungry person smiles on getting food is priceless,” he said.

Khan said he found a man in Gandhinagar who was starving and didn’t know where to go. “He was wearing a gold chain and had a high-end phone but was helpless because everything was shut. He was simply looking for a place to eat. When I gave him a food packet, he broke down,” Khan said.

Khan, along with friends Shamshuddin, Waseem Pasha and Amjad, move around the city from 12.30pm to 4pm every day to offer assistance to people. Police have appreciated the efforts. “They are more than happy to help us,” Khan said.

The group takes precautions, wearing masks and gloves and frequently washing their hands. “We also hand out masks along with food packets,” he said.

“The patient must first get consent from their ART centre or contact us, after which we can collect the drugs on their behalf. Many cannot travel because public transportation has been suspended. Others are too afraid to go out on their two wheelers. These are important lifelong drugs to suppress the virus and prevent it from attacking their immune system,” CEO of Human Touch Foundation, Peter Borges, told TOI.

The ART drugs are otherwise dispensed to those people with HIV on a monthly, or three-monthly basis.

The foundation has also been delivering grocery items along with the ART drugs, especially for adolescents living with HIV.

Although they began working on Thursday, the volunteers on their two-wheelers have been able to deliver the essential drugs only to seven HIV positive people and children scattered across the state.

“We lost time getting permissions and passes to be able to deliver the drugs. We deliver them to their homes or at a place convenient to them,” Borges says. The foundation has received a donor who has volunteered to pay for 3kg rice, flour and pulses and 3l each of milk and oil for 50 children and adolescents with HIV, but is struggling to find a supplier.

“Those living with HIV have also not received Rs 2,000 this month under the Dayanand Social Security Scheme. This money is usually credited by the 14th of the month. Many families are dependent on this amount,” Borges said.

There are 75 employees at the resort. According to industry insiders, each resort along the coastal belt has 50-75 such employees.

The first instalment of the grant should be given to states based on per person population. Later, the grant amount can be given more to the states where the infection rate is high, and proportionally to the remaining states, the chief minister said in his letter to Modi.

Gehlot, while extending gratitude to the prime minister for announcing an economic package in the wake of the pandemic, said the Centre and states have to jointly fight it.

He said the Centre should direct the Reserve Bank of India to provide Rs 1 lakh crore to states as an interest-free advance. This should be done for 11 months from April 1, the chief minister said in his letter.

He mentioned that economies of the states have been adversely affected due to the pandemic.

Noting the huge decline in tax and non-tax revenue, he said permission for additional two per cent credit limit should be given immediately from the Net Credit Limit which the states get.

The chief minister said states expect that the Centre should grant moratorium of at least three months in the payment of instalments due to the RBI and other financial institutions.

Chief minister said the state government had increased expenses in the health sector and has taken measures to stop the effect of this pandemic.

He said the Centre has the power to use monetary, fiscal and credit policies to raise money, which the state governments do not have. Therefore, the states should be provided with sufficient financial resources to deal with continuous changing situations due to the virus attack.

230,['29/03/2020'],Pune: Surge of motorists on roads a concern for police officers,"Police check vehicles at Swargate Chowk on Saturday

PUNE: Many vehicles were seen on the roads in different parts of the city on Friday night and Saturday morning, following chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s announcement that grocery and medical shops would remain open 24x7.

The surge of vehicles posed a concern for police officers. Areas such as Fatimanagar, Salunkhe Vihar Road, Wanowrie, NIBM Road, Kausarbaug, Meethanagar, Kondhwa Road, Camp, Koregaon Park, Kothrud, Sinhagad Road and old parts of the city witnessed the rush of vehicles.

Joint CP Ravindra Shisve told TOI, “We will be stricter in securing an effective lockdown. We are issuing warnings to people daily against coming out on the roads and have started filing cases against violators.”

Shisve said that given the situation, they were trying their best to enforce the lockdown in a humane way. “With limited manpower, we have ensured that essential and medical services are not affected. We have stopped over crowding at shops and markets by carrying out distance marking and are helping the people in need who are in distress.”

Fatimanagar resident Sher Khan said, “I am facing frequent call drops and net connectivity issues and want these problems to be solved. It is critical for my work and for me to stay in touch with my relatives, so I had stepped out.”

Maithili Manakawad, the secretary of Wanowrie Residents Association, said, “Restricted availability of vegetables had forced people to travel a distance in search of fresh produce. People are also running short of groceries.”

Car drivers were also seen on Sinhagad Road, while two-wheeler riders were seen in old parts of the city where most distributors and wholesalers of medicines were located. In Camp, two-wheelers were seen riding double or triple seats, some even filming the situation on the roads on their cell phones.

A police officer at a check point in Kothrud said people had started coming out ever since the police stopped using force, following strict instructions from the top brass. “On Saturday morning, people came out to buy groceries and milk. In the afternoon, few vehicles were seen,” the officer said.

Senior inspector Pratibha Joshi of Kothrud police got barricades installed near the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj statue to block the road.

Laxman Sable, a security guard of a college on Karve Road, said he used to go to work on his two-wheeler, but he now walks to the college office because of the blockade.

An elderly man wanted to go to the bank. He was stopped at the check post at Paud Phata. The police did not allow him to go and told him to return home. The officer even requested him to stay home as the persons of his age were at high risk.

BHOPAL: A day after the district administration clarified that grocery shops in the state capital would remain open till the normal hours of the market, most of the retail grocery shops in the city were closed on Saturday.

Ravishankar Market at 5 No. stop or 6 No. stop market, which have plenty of grocery shops, saw most of them closed on Saturday though it was not weekly off day of the markets. Owner of the only grocery shop open at 6 No. stop market when asked why other grocery shops in the area are not open said, “Either they are not expecting sales or may have run out of stocks.”

President of Jumerati Wholesale Grocery Merchants ' Association, Sunil Punjabi , however, said that there was no shortage of stock. It is different that everyone in the supply chain from miller to transporter to wholesaler to retailer is trying to earn a little extra.

“There was panic buying for a few days, but now people have stocked up grocery enough for next few days. Now, people are coming out to buy milk, bread and vegetables and therefore it does not make sense to open the shop in such a situation”, said Punjabi.

Another wholesale dealer, Kundandas Bhurani , also said that there was enough stock of grocery in the market, but after a buying spree of some days, crowd at the grocery shops has receded, he said.

Meanwhile, an official press communique said that home delivery plan of the district administration has started giving positive results. Essentials like grocery, milk and vegetables were delivered to 500 households on Saturday, said the communique.

233,['29/03/2020'],"3 +ve patients recover, two return home to traditional welcome","SLUG: Nothing like home

Nagpur: Amid rising Covid-19 concerns in the city on Saturday, some good news poured in as well. All three positive patients admitted to the GMCH isolation ward recovered on Saturday with two of them getting discharge.

Now, GMCH has only one patient — 43-year-old wife of first Covid-19 positive patient in the city. She was also tested negative on Saturday, but doctors decided to conduct some check-ups and X-rays of her. She will be discharged on Sunday.

“Two software professionals, who had travelled to the US have been discharged. This is good news for us. Patients are recovering and going home brings smiles for all of us,” said divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar.

Even after getting discharge, all the recovered patients must observe 14 days of home quarantine strictly. Doctors will constantly monitor their health parameters.

Both the discharged patients were accorded a warm welcome by their respective family members in traditional Indian style after coming out of what they termed as “vanvas” in isolation. The GMCH authorities released them in the afternoon after all their tests turned out to be negative.

The two little daughters of the second Covid-19 patient were eagerly waiting for him since morning and even made a beautiful drawing for him.

“It was very emotional homecoming. We were badly missing home all these days. Everything seems to have changed when I was returning from my company’s vehicle. The roads without regular traffic were looking vacant. At home, my wife, daughters and mother received me,” the relaxed second patient told TOI.

Similarly, the parents of fourth patient were looking at the clock for their son to return home. For him, homecoming was just like getting a second life. “My parents received me while I spoke to my sister and other relatives. My phone was flooded with calls from friends and relatives, till I told them that I need time to settle down and would speak with them in a couple of days. Many of them wanted to come home, but I requested them to defer it till I get fully fit,” he told TOI.

Both were strictly advised home quarantine for another 14 days to avoid any chances of infection. “My family members have already fixed a room where I will be staying and had made all arrangements accordingly. It’s a big relief now that I am home,” he said.

The fourth patient had already told all his friends, colleagues and relatives to wait for another 14 days to meet him till he’s under home quarantine. “We’ve been given a list of dos and don’ts by the doctors to follow in this period. Both of us weren’t prescribed any medicine by them, but we were put under observation at the GMCH, being asymptomatic,” he said.

Emotional farewell by GMCH nurses, ward boys

Both patients were given a warm farewell by nurses and ward boys of GMCH. They took pictures and wished them good health. In the morning, all four patients talked on phone via video while greeting and congratulating each other. According to them, those who turned positive or were suspects shouldn’t get disheartened as coronavirus was very much curable. They advised them to maintain positive attitude and believe in doctors. Both of them thanked Dr Gosavi and his team of nurses, ward boys and other staff for taking good care.

234,['29/03/2020'],Vehicles on road without reason to be impounded,"Pune: Vehicles of people found roaming on the roads without a valid reason during the lockdown period will be impounded, the Pune police have said.

People, barring those in the essential and emergency services, are expected to stay at home.

The lockdown directives allow only those out to buy essential commodities such as grocery, milk and for medical emergencies to use the roads. Petrol pumps in the city have stopped fuel sale to vehicle users, other than those in the essential services.

Despite such stringent measures, several people are on the roads defying the lockdown.

A milk vendor on Paud Road told TOI that people came to his shop to buy curd worth Rs10.

“We know the person wants to roam around and bought the curd to fool police. People should know that the lockdown is for their safety,” he added.

Bavdhan resident S D Deshmukh was out to buy medicines on Saturday when he was stopped by the police at Bhusari Colony. They told him he could buy the medicine in Bavdhan.

“I wanted to drive so I told him that the medicine was available at a pharmacy on Karve Road and was allowed to proceed,” Deshmukh said.

A senior police officer told TOI that people are on the road for petty reasons. “Most cite medical reasons. Many carry old prescriptions,” the officer said.

As a deterrent, vehicles of those on the road without a strong reason will be impounded, he added. “We do not have any option, but to impound their vehicles so that they stay at home,” the officer added.

Pune rural SP Sandeep Patil said the borders of the district have been sealed after people from Navi Mumbai, Mumbai and Thane were travelling to Pune, Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli in their private vehicles.

The police will not allow such vehicles on the highways, he added. Any one violating the lockdown orders will have cases filed against them.

235,['29/03/2020'],Gehlot demands Rs 1L-crore grant for Covid-hit states,"Jaipur: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday urging him to take measures like granting of Rs 1 lakh crore to states to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic and problems during the lockdown to stop the spread of the disease.

The first instalment of the grant should be given to states based on per person population. Later, the grant amount can be given more to the states where the infection rate is high, and proportionally to the remaining states, the chief minister said in his letter to Modi.

Gehlot, while extending gratitude to the prime minister for announcing an economic package in the wake of the pandemic, said the Centre and states have to jointly fight it.

He said the Centre should direct the Reserve Bank of India to provide Rs 1 lakh crore to states as an interest-free advance. This should be done for 11 months from April 1, the chief minister said in his letter.

He mentioned that economies of the states have been adversely affected due to the pandemic.

Noting the huge decline in tax and non-tax revenue, he said permission for additional two per cent credit limit should be given immediately from the Net Credit Limit which the states get.

The chief minister said states expect that the Centre should grant moratorium of at least three months in the payment of instalments due to the RBI and other financial institutions.

Chief minister said the state government had increased expenses in the health sector and has taken measures to stop the effect of this pandemic.

He said the Centre has the power to use monetary, fiscal and credit policies to raise money, which the state governments do not have. Therefore, the states should be provided with sufficient financial resources to deal with continuous changing situations due to the virus attack.

But this time even before they could set up base, the coronavirus crisis upset their plans.

Left to fend for themselves after the imposition of curfew, the groups decided to embark on their 650-km-long trek home.

One such group of dozen people, including a woman and a two-year- old boy left Ludhiana to trek to Ajmer in the wee hours of Friday. They had landed in Ludhiana just three weeks ago but the curfew locked down their plans. They spent two days trying to approach the authorities to make any arrangements for their journey back home, but didn’t find any help.

“We have been coming to Ludhiana for the last 7-8 years to sell ice cream. This time, we arrived here separately in the end of February. We had taken rooms on rent and had started selling ice cream, but then curfew happened. We tried our best to seek the authorities’ help, but when nothing happened, we started the journey on foot the early morning Badri Lal, 35, told TOI.

Around 588 undertrial prisoners have been released on bail for offences punishable up to seven years’ rigorous imprisonment since Friday.

Additional DGP (prisons) Sunil Ramanand told TOI, “On the second day, we released 138 undertrial prisoners, including some women, on bail as per the letter sent by the high-power committee appointed by the Supreme Court to the courts for releasing such prisoners on bail to prevent the spread of coronavirus across jails in the state.”

He said all central jails were heavily congested with inmates in the state. “For instance, Arthur Road jail has a sanctioned strength of accommodating 800 inmates, but it is housing four times more than the actual strength. Similarly, the Yerawada jail can accommodate 2,440 prisoners, but the strength of the inmates lodged there is double. I am happy that our jails are getting decongested.

BHOPAL: A large number of migrant labourers continue to return to their hometowns and villages from Rajasthan . In the wake of Covid-19 lockdown, many of them walked down empty stomach to take a bus.

For a couple of days now, Sheopur district, bordering Rajasthan, has become an epicentre of reverse migration as batches of labourers pour in.

After the number of positive cases climbed, more labourers started migrating from several cities of Rajasthan. So far, more than 9000 labourers—majority of them belonging to the Sahariya tribe — have returned to several villages of Sheopur.

Buses with labourers on board drop them at Pali village of Sawai Madhopur on other side of Chambal river dividing the two states. From there, they walk down to about 2 kms to the Chambal Bridge to reach Sheopur.

Several districts of Bundelkhand also saw similar mass migration of migrant labourers. The administration has been tracking them for screening.

“After corona screening at the district border, we then allow them to board the buses made available by us for their onward journey,” said district collector Pratibha Pal, denying that labourers are made to walk down a long distance to their villages. Even the labourers from Uttar Pradesh were also being helped with conveyance, said Pal.

“A large number of labourers from Agra and as far as Ferozabad in UP were made available buses. Labourers from Katni, Damoh, Sagar, Mandla and Umaria also proceeded to their villages in buses made available,” she said.

Every year, thousands of Sahariya tribesmen and women migrate to earn their bread.

“In some states like Karnakata , Maharashtra, West Bengal and Orissa, the proactiveness of the government, police and district administrations has enabled stranded goods vehicles to resume their journey. But in states like UP and Rajasthan, the situation has got worse,” Kultaran Singh Atwal , president of the AIMTC, told TOI.

“Some states worked overnight to ensure trucks start moving, including those carrying non-essentials. But we also have states where there is needless hassles and red tape,” he said.

With many drivers and helpers abandoning their vehicles within the first two days of the lockdown, transporters have arranged food and water for the rest in states where they have been stuck for the fourth consecutive day. The AIMTC has flagged police demanding hefty bribes from truckers at some places as another major problem. “On an average, we give truck drivers Rs 10,000-15,000 for a journey to cover food, diesel, toll and other expenses, including money paid to cops. But demands for bribes have now multiplied. Vehicles are being stopped arbitrarily, saying they are unclean and not sanitised,” said Bal Malkit Singh , chairman of the AIMTC.

At some checkpoints, the lockdown has allegedly created a new illegal business — people demanding Rs 1,000-2,000 from each truck on the pretext of carrying out mandatory fumigation of the vehicle.

In Mumbai and Delhi, prices of vegetables and other essentials have soared.

BHOPAL: Former chief minister Kamal Nath on Saturday sent two letters to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan asking for immediate survey of crop damages in districts hit by unseasonal rains and hailstorms. In another letter, he asked the government to send relief rations to migrant labourers from the state who are returning because of the Corona crisis and have nothing to eat.

“In the last one week, many districts in the state recorded unseasonal rains and hailstorms. In some places, it is still continuing,” senior Congress leader Kamal Nath wrote to Chouhan. “There have been damages to standing crops and harvested produce by the untimely rains and hails in the Malwa, Nimar, Bundelkhand and Gwalior regions,” the letter said.

The former chief minister argued that rural Madhya Pradesh is distressed by the devastation of the Corona pandemic and the natural crisis in the form of rain and hail. He wrote that facing such adverse circumstances, farmers are trying to save their crops from destruction. He reminded chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan that on March 26, he asked for interim relief to farmers, but no announcement has come from the state government, yet.

“I request you to immediately start surveys on the field to ascertain the extent of crop damages. The state should without further delay start the process to seek claims under crop insurance,” Nath wrote. He added that seeing the present Corona crisis, the government should pay an interim relief to farmers at Rs 7,500 per month for two months.

In the second letter, the state Congress president said that after lockdown, many working-class persons who had migrated to other states are returning since they no longer have any source of earning.

“There is an acute situation before them when they have nothing to eat. In the state, there are also many middle-class and grade IV employees including ASHA workers, aanganwadi workers, homewards and other lower income groups who are living facing financial crisis,” he wrote. Ëvery citizen has the right to live life with dignity and to ensure this is the duty of the state,” Kamal Nath’s letter said. He demanded that all these sections be given two month ration forthwith and an additional month’s ration free of cost.

With 426 Kalasipalya Market vendors shifting to National College Grounds and thousands of customers flocking to the venue, residents panicked and made distress calls to police and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials.

Close to 300 trucks had entered the grounds to unload vegetables and fruits, causing a traffic jam in the south Bengaluru locality. The market which opened at 5.30am was filled with hundreds of customers in no time.

BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar, DCP (south) Rohini Katoch Sepat, Bengaluru South MP Tejaswi Surya and corporator Poornima Ramesh rushed to the spot. After frenetic discussions, the Palike ordered the vendors to vacate the grounds immediately.

The residents blamed BBMP for allowing the vendors to occupy the grounds. “The civic agency did not bother to consult anyone; this is unacceptable. Everyone’s health is at risk, thanks to this,” said Abhishek P, a resident of Basavangudi.

BBMP officials, however, denied asking the vendors to shift. They said some overzealous traders had jumped the gun and moved to the grounds on their own. The officials said they had a meeting with APMC officials and Kalasipalya traders on Friday evening to discuss the issue of shifting the market to National College Grounds to ensure smooth business and maintaining of social distance.

The one-hour meeting ended inconclusively with APMC officials refusing to shift the city's trademark market. ""Traders even threatened to shut it down,” said SG Raveendra, special commissioner (welfare-markets).

But what happened the next day was a complete turnaround. “It was shocking when we realised the traders had relocated on their own on Saturday morning,” said Raveendra.

BBMP has now decided to close Kalasipalya Market completely and move it to Singena Agrahara, Bommasandra, on Monday. “This will affect us badly because we will be travelling to one end of the city,” said Rajappa S, a vegetable trader fom Kalasipalya.

Another trader Ramasamy PK felt Bommasandra would be ideal for unloading trucks because most of the vegetables and fruits come from the outskirts, but their income would be affected. “We easily earn about Rs 10,000 per day in Kalasipalya as customer flow is good. But in Bommasandra we might face difficulties, he said.”

A BBMP official said the traders want clean toilets, 24/7 water supply and food in the Bommasandra market and “we are ready to provide everything”.

MUMBAI: When a police officer intercepted an autorickshaw at Dahisar check naka for checks amid the national lockdown , he was stumped to find a rabbit staring back at him. Perched on the lap of its owner, the furry animal was unwell and was being taken to a vet. The owner of the animal pleaded with the police to let him go as the rabbit needed urgent shots.

Police personnel posted on duty at the Dahisar check naka have been facing a strange predicament. Hundreds of vehicles , whether motorcycles, private cars, autos, tempos or buses, have been requesting to enter and exit the city limit daily and each traveller claims to have a valid reason to do so.

Kiran Sawant, a resident of a highrise off the Western Express Highway , said she counted over a dozen buses pass by during different times of the day. “Isn’t the whole purpose of a lockdown being defeated?” she asked.

Inspector Sanjay Hazare of Kashmira police station said several essential services workers employed in the western suburbs live in Mira-Bhayander or Vasai-Virar and are ferried by buses every day. “We check the ID cards of those in buses; there are BMC employees, medical workers, conservancy workers, BEST employees etc. Bank employees, gas deliverymen and petrol pump employees commute on motorcycles or in autorickshaws,” he said.

Earlier this week, the police got an SOS from a US national that her elderly mother lived alone in Mira Road and needed to cross the check naka to travel to a relative’s place and stay there. “We took her across in a policeman’s car,” said an officer. Then there was an IT professional who approached us about having to cross the check naka to collect her laptop which had been given for repairs. It had vital work data and work from home was not possible without it, the officer said.

Scores of tempos and three-wheelers with foodgrains, eggs, chicken, meat, perishables cross the check naka for delivery in the western suburbs. “One of the cars we intercepted had a motorist carrying tiffins for his employees at a supermarket. He said all eateries in the area were shut and the supermarket was operating 24 hours so the employees needed to be fed. There are patients using urinary catheters or headed for chemotherapy in autos. Then, there are Mira Road residents wanting to travel to banks in Dahisar or looking for antibiotics which are not available in their areas. We cannot ask any of them to turn back and have to let them pass through,” said the officer.

But there are some who fake excuses. A family of four in a car was booked at Mira Road when one of them falsely claimed he was a Covid-19 patient. “We are vigilant. But our personnel have also been instructed to not act high-handed. None of our personnel carry lathis,” said an officer from Dahisar police station.

Gaude, however, said that this supply would strictly be through volunteers appointed by locals MLAs and civic bodies, and that no fair price shop would be open to the public.

Gaude also said that the government may allow credit facility to ration card holders who can’t afford to buy stocks of three months worth of foodgrains. The minister said that he has asked fair price shops to make available other essential commodities like sugar, salt, tur dal and oil. “Wholesale traders who have to source goods from neighbouring states have been directed to bring only essential commodities like rice, salt, turdal, oil and atta (wheat flour). I request them that this is not the time for business, but to shoulder responsibility.”

He said the civil supplies department has sufficient stock of rice and wheat that could last for over three months, and that the department would distribute grains in April for the months of April, May and June.

Following the national lockdown and the government’s order that people stay home, the state has allowed all MLAs to appoint twenty volunteers each, and every civic body ten each, to deliver goods to people’s homes.

Stating that the decision to allow people to make purchases on Thursday has created chaos and mess across the state, the minister said that staying hungry for day by staying home is better than getting infected by going out. He requested people to please cooperate and prevent the situation from turning like that in Italy and other European countries.

However, under the prevailing lockdown, no blood donation camps are being organized and even people are scared to step out of their houses,” an SBTC official said.He said the council has reached out to various organisations to hold blood donations, wherein a batch of five can be called at a time and enough social distancing can be maintained.On Friday, state health minister Rajesh Tope too had requested people to donate blood to avert severe shortage. “Blood supply stocks are required for various patients and even as there is a lockdown, camps can be conducted in accordance to the prevailing restrictions,’‘said the minister had told TOI.A senior SBTC official said the camps should be held in April, May and June as the requirement can shoot up any time, with Covid-19 cases continuously rising in the state. “Every blood bank has been told to keep extra stock of 10 days for emergency,” he said.SBTC officials have also requested police and the administration to hold blood donation camps.The director in-charge of Pune-based Jankalyan Blood bank, Atul Kulkarni, said their blood bank had stock to last up to 15 days as over 1,000 people made the donations over the last two weeks, though in a staggered manner. “In spite of the lockdown, the residents of Pune are willing to donate blood, while maintaining the social-distancing norms.

BENGALURU: Twelve fresh cases of Covid-19 were reported in Karnataka on Saturday, taking the total number to 76. Of the 12 cases, 10 are secondary infections caused by Covid-19 patients.

This is the steepest increase in positive cases in a single day. While five cases have been reported from Chikkaballapura, four are from Uttara Kannada, two from Bengaluru and one from Davanagere. Of the 12 patients, five are women.

The wife and two daughters of a 65-year-old man from Uttara Kannada (who had returned from Dubai on March 18 and tested positive four days ago) have now tested positive. The woman, 54, and her daughters, aged 28 and 23, are in a designated hospital in Uttara Kannada. This is the third case of an entire family being infected in the state.

A 24-year-old resident of Uttara Kannada has also tested positive. He was a relative and primary contact of a 40-year-old Covid-19 patient who returned from Dubai on March 21 and tested positive on March 24.

Bengaluru has reported two new cases; both patients have travel history to London. A 21-year-old-man who had returned from London to Bengaluru on March 17 has tested positive. His father, 51, had also tested positive on March 22 after returning from London on March 13. The security guards and a domestic help working in their house had also contracted the infection. A 63-year-old woman from Bengaluru who had returned from London on March 16 has tested positive. With this, Bengaluru has seen a total of 41 cases, including one fatality. Five people have been discharged.

A 20-year-old man from Davanagere who had no travel history but was a primary contact of a patient from Chitradurga has tested positive. The Chitradurga woman, 37, had returned from Guyana on March 20 and tested positive on March 25. She had chosen to undergo treatment in a private hospital in Davanagere. Her father, a sitting MP, who had accompanied her from Delhi to Chitradurga, however, tested negative.

Chikkaballapura count goes up by 5

What has turned out to be problematic for the health and family welfare department is Karnataka’s 19th patient — a 31-year-old-man from Chikkaballapura who had travelled to Mecca and tested positive on March 21. On Saturday, five of his relatives tested positive. They include two male relatives aged 18 and 23 hailing from Hindupur, Andhra Pradesh. The other three are two men, aged 70 and 38, and a 32-year-old woman from Chikkaballapura. All five new patients are being treated in the isolation ward of the district hospital.

252,['29/03/2020'],Lockdown dampens Gangaur spirits,"Jaisalmer: The threat of coronavirus outbreak played spoilsport to the celebration of the Gangaur festival in Jaisalmer.

The festival, observed by married women and even unmarried girls, could not be celebrated with the traditional fanfare and fervour, as district administration has been strictly monitoring that people do not violate the lockdown and social distancing rules. The women thus could not immerse the Gangaur idols, neither could they take out any procession for the same.

As per the tradition in Jaislamer, women celebrate this festival for 18 days and the Gangaur idols are immersed in the Gadisar lake. But this time the women were disappointed as district administration was strict due to which they could not immerse the idols and nor move around in groups. The women immersed the Gangaur at the peepal trees near their houses instead.

The Gangaur idols are worshipped for 18 days and are immersed on chaturthi. Although at other places, Gangaur is immersed on teej.

On Friday, women observed a fast and a few of them went to the Gadisar lake in a group, but the police sent them back. District administration, issuing an order, had appealed to the women to immerse their Gangaur near their houses.

On Gangaur festival usually, the royal family takes out royal procession. On chaturthi, a grand procession is taken out in the market and in the late evening, a fair is organized at Gadisar lake where bholavani takes place. This time, the royal procession was not taken out.

SDO Dinesh Vishnoi had asked people to immerse Gangaur near peepal trees and also directed to close all mosques.

253,['29/03/2020'],Crime drops as people stay indoors,"Nashik: The lockdown has made an impact on the crime in the city as hardly any street crime has been reported. Overall, just sporadic cases of theft have been reported over the past few days.

Since March 22, there have been no cases of vehicle theft and chain robberies in the city. However, theft cases have been reported at one or two police stations.

Senior police officers attributed the drop in chain snatchings and vehicle thefts to the fewer number of people or vehicles on the roads.

Chain robberies had become a menace in the city with unidentified chain robbers committing crime in some or the other part of the city. Same was with motor vehicle theft.

The police said that chain robberies or vehicle thefts are easy crimes. Criminals find vehicles lying unattended in every lane or bylane of the city and the same is with chain robberies. Women step out wearing gold ornaments of five to 10 grams. However, deserted roads have ensured these crimes do not take place.

According to the police, on March 20, the city had registered 14 offences of house break-ins, robberies, thefts, accidents, vehicle thefts, etc. A day later, the number of such offences dropped to nine.

However, on March 22, there were only three cases registered in the city. One was an accident and two about voluntarily causing hurt.

Since then, every day, just two or three have been registered with the 13 police stations in the city. Most of these cases are related to thefts, accidents or brawls.

The police said there were very few people out on the streets and hardly any vehicles. This had led to the drop in the street crime.

“With lesser number of people on the road, burglars are also afraid of getting spotted, which has brought the crime rate down. Incidents of burglars committing thefts in closed houses are, however, being registered at some or the other police station,” officers said.

Similarly, the dogs chased the vehicles plying on North Main Road, South Main Road and along lane numbers 5, 6 and 7. “We have never come across anything similar in the past,” Patki said, adding, “We observed the dogs’ behaviour for two nights before realizing that they were hungry and had not eaten anything for the last three or four days and thus we took this step.”

255,['29/03/2020'],Delhi government scales up food relief as crisis grows,"Delhi government has mounted a herculean effort to ensure that poor people don’t go hungry

NEW DELHI: Thirty-year-old Chandni collected her food packet from a government school in Neb Sarai, south Delhi, on Saturday afternoon and burst into tears. The food was hardly enough for her and her three teenage children. Her husband left her six months back and she doesn’t have cooking gas or any provisions at home. Many migrant labourers like her said they could die of hunger before the novel coronavirus got them.

A Delhi government facility working from the Radha Soami Satsang at Bhati mines has been preparing food packets for 30,000 people and distributing at 500 locations in the city. Food is being cooked in many other areas in southwest Delhi for distribution.

When Chandni, who belongs to Samastipur in Bihar , opened her packet, she found three puris and aloo sabzi. “We have been waiting since the morning for this. How can four people survive on three puris?” she asked. She used to work as a labourer but now there is no work.

“They should see the number of people residing in each house and distribute the food accordingly. We do not have provisions and only people who have ration cards are able to get some. All of us are daily wage labourers or do menial jobs,” said Kiran Chauhan of the same village.

Delhi government has mounted a Herculean effort to ensure that poor people don’t go hungry but the scale of the humanitarian crisis is so large that things are taking time to settle down. Sonalika Jiwani, SDM, Mehrauli, said they were taking all measures to ensure that food reached every household and scaling up wherever they see an increase in demand.

“Most of us are daily wage labourers who can neither go to work, nor return to our villages,” said Renu Gupta, collecting her share. “We live in a joint family and not everyone can come to collect but I am glad we have got something to eat.”

Though civil defence volunteers and officials made sure they sanitised the hands of people and asked them to stand apart on marked lines, as soon as the people walked out, they began huddling together for comfort.

Indu Prakash Singh, a member of the advisory panel on the food relief work, said the government has decided to attach one or two members of civil society or NGOs with each DM to attend to complaints. “A big problem is of the poor being unable to reach the centres because of the police coming in the way. We have written to the police commissioner,” he added.

Kamlesh Agarwal and his wife had come to the capital in the first week of March from Panna district in Madhya Pradesh and couldn’t even settle down before the crisis hit them. “Back home, our daughter is down with fever for the last couple of days and I just wish to return. My parents are too old to take care of her.” said Kamlesh as he sobbed, clutching a food packet at Neb Sarai.

In other areas like north and southwest Delhi, the tie-up with agencies that provide midday meals has turned out to be a boon. In north Delhi, food packets were distributed from 34 schools catering to about 17,000 people. However, with the demand increasing, 10 more schools have been added to the list. Mobile vans are, meanwhile, distributing food to people who are squatting at Singhu Border, hoping to return home.

Village pradhans and local political functionaries have been roped in in south-west Delhi to gauge demand and needs of people. Soumya Sharma, SDM, Najafgarh, said: “We provided food to around 11,000 people and are also in touch with others to ensure no one is hungry. We are also changing the menu every day.”

With 350 Delhi government schools being designated as meal distribution centres, teachers have been roped in for supervising the meals. This is under the overall supervision of the district magistrate.

NEW DELHI/AMROHA: National Highway 9 is the scene of the great escape. Men, women and children are marching on its wide lanes from the capital to Bareilly (281km away), Lucknow (500km), Bahraich (650km) and even villages in Bihar over a thousand kilometres from Delhi. Lugging bags, carrying tots and dragging infants, the people are trudging along like characters in a post-apocalyptic movie. But the hunger, fear, tiredness, helplessness and uncertainty are real enough.When their limbs refuse to move, the migrant labourers, rendered jobless by the lockdown to arrest the spread of the novel coronavirus, doze fitfully under trees and flyovers and at closed dhabas. Having hiked 20 hours on their way from Inderlok in northwest Delhi to Gonda, 600km away, three families rested under some trees at Simbhaoli in UP’s Hapur district. “We are rickshaw cart pullers,” said Shyam Singh. “All our acquaintances have left for their home villages. We did not have money to pay our rent or for food so we also had to leave.” The three rickshaw carts are laden with household goods. While the adults walk, the children sometimes get on the carts.A seven-year-old girl is among the travellers. “Kamayenge nahi toh khayenge kya?”she asked with native wisdom. Like her, several children are marching with their parents. They will probably drop out of schools and jeopardise their futures. But future is too fancy a dream for those fighting for survival.People are embracing another threat while trying to escape one. Vanwasi and Ganga, a couple in their 20s, left Haridwar for Chhattisgarh three days ago. They were at Hapur having partly walked and partly hitchhiked their way. “I lost my job and no one was ready to give us food. Police beat me when I went out looking for food,” said the worn out Vanwasi. They have pleaded with truck and bus drivers to take them to Lucknow from where they can proceed to Chhattisgarh, but no money for fare means no rides.It was their stroke of luck that Hapur MLA Vijay Pal arrived with food packets. Pal’s bodyguards forced a bus to stop and asked the conductor to accommodate the couple. The MLA also gave them Rs 500. “For the last three days, a sea of humanity has been walking on this highway. I have requested the government to start a bus service for them,"" said Pal.There are government buses running on the highway. “200 rupaiya lagenge!” shouted the conductor of one such bus bound for Bareilly when Sanjeev Kumar and 20 others rushed to catch it. The youths walking from Punjab to Badaun were left dejected. “If we are destined to die, we will die among our own people,” said Kumar, a construction worker. There are a few minors among the 20 boys in the group. They reached Hapur on foot and after requesting lifts in trucks, milk vans and tractors.While private buses, as is their wont, are charging more from these desperate men and women, the government buses too are making money on the side. UP state bus service conductor Vivek Kumar of Muzaffarnagar depot said the fare for Delhi-Lucknow journey was Rs 582. “I will request the government to make the bus service free,” assured the Hapur MLA.In this bid to escape hunger, the danger of community transmission looms large. There is no social distancing, and TOI could see no medical facilities available between Delhi and Amroha. The buses make a mockery of the lockdown, crammed as they are and with dozens riding on the roof.Around 10 young men, all juice sellers in Gurgaon, left for Bahraich around 7pm on Friday. ""We know about the quarantine, but quarantine is a luxury the poor cannot afford. We live together in one small rented room,"" said Ashok Kumar. His friend Rampal Yadav said a 600-km walk does not frighten him as much as the uncertain future.Down the highway, a couple carrying a large stock of bread in their car was giving out bread packets and hand sanitisers to the walkers. Villagers and some cops are also chipping in with food and water. “We are doing what we can to assist them in this unprecedented crisis,” said Narendra Kumar Jain, doling out biscuits and food items.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74868956,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-216226,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hunger-fear-fatigue-hordes-of-migrants-take-dangerous-trek-home/articleshow/74867953.cms

VADODARA: K V Dangar, police sub-inspector of Chhani police station, was suspended by a senior official on Friday after members of Sikh community complained against him. The community members had approached senior police officials alleging that Dangar had stepped inside gurdwara at Chhani and beat up some of them.

The suspension was ordered by police commissioner Anupam Singh Gahlaut on receiving a complaint from the community members. They alleged that they had met at the gurdwara to plan a ‘langar’, a gathering of people where food is served free to everyone. Members said when they were holding the meeting, Dangar and a few other policemen walked into the gurdwara and asked them to vacate the place. When they tried to explain him the situation, the suspended cop allegedly started commenting about the community and beat a few of them. The situation was brought under control after some officials intervened.

After Dangar’s suspension, several messages in his support were circulated on WhatsApp and other social media platforms. The messages stated that cops have been risking their lives to ensure that complete lockdown was observed so that people do not contract any infection. “If police are using light force, it is only in the interest of public. If all policemen continue to be suspended like this, then there will be nobody to protect the country,” one message read.

Another message said Dangar was a victim of political pressure and that his suspension should be revoked.

They reportedly got infected in the course of their work. One of the four dead patients was an 85-year-old retired urologist.Medical professionals face the highest risk of infection in the pandemic, with China and Italy losing tens of doctors in the past few months.On Saturday, after the fourth doctor in the city tested positive, a civic official said, “The Worli doctor does not have a travel history, except he visited Surat where he met people who had returned from overseas.”The mood among Mumbai’s doctors is hence somber. “There are many among us who want to help the government, but there should be systematic way of using private doctors more effectively in the public health system,” said radiologist Dr Jignesh Thakkar from Kalwa.While authorities have cancelled leave of all public doctors, there are private doctors who want to help the public health system. This can be gauged by the fact that 75 private doctors signed up within 24 hours of the BMC’s appeal for help at five of its peripheral hospitals. Now, the BMC has asked the Indian Medical Association for a list of another 150 doctors.A doctor who was keen to help out said he is in a dilemma. “Doctors seem to be at the highest risk and there is little in terms of protective equipment as people have bought all masks and sanitizers that should ideally have been used for medical staff on the frontline of the pandemic.”Dr Shivkumar Utture, president of Maharashtra Medical Council and a leading member of Indian Medical Association’s Mumbai branch, said, “Large-scale buying of medical safety devices has left doctors vulnerable.”Several clinics are shut. In Thane, the association has decided to not open clinics to avoid crowding. Dr Rohan Sequeira, consultant cardio- metabolic physician at Jaslok Hospital , said keeping clinics open will expose the staff, patients and their families.However, Dr Utture said, “IMA has asked doctors to keep clinics open, observe certain protocols such as consultations only by appointment, no overcrowding in clinics and use of mask.” MMC has allowed tele-consultations.There is a feeling the government should provide minimum protective devices for doctors as these are not available. A senior doctor said, “Even doctors have parents and children and their families are worried .” Another asked, “If a doctor can’t have protection, how can she or he protect others?” (With Richa Pinto & Yogita Rao)",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74870163,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-474410,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/as-4-doctors-test-ve-anxious-medicos-seek-more-protection/articleshow/74867898.cms

The victim, who worked at home delivery service for a private restaurant in the national capital and was a father of three, was on way to Morena district of Madhya Pradesh, another 85 km from Agra.Identified as Ranveer Singh , the man was a resident of Badfra village of Amba police jurisdiction in Morena, and was heading home on foot.According to police, the victim collapsed near Kailash Mod on national highway-2, after which a local shopkeeper rushed to his help.“He made the victim lie on a carpet and offered him tea and biscuit. The victim complained of chest pain and also spoke with his brother-in-law over the phone to share his health condition. Around 6:30 pm, the victim died and local police was informed,” said Sikandra station house officer Arvind Kumar.Hariparvat circle officer Saurabh Dixit said, “Autopsy report cited heart attack as cause of his death. We assume that exhaustion of the long walk might have triggered his existing heart condition.”“It’s likely that exhaustion might have triggered chest pain. On the entire NH-2 stretch, UP policemen were present with food packets and water for such travellers, but Ranveer’s death is an unfortunate incident,” SHO Kumar said.The victim’s younger brother, Sonu Singh, said, “Ranveer was working in Delhi’s Tughlakabad for the last three years. He is survived by three children, including two daughters. We are poor farmers and don’t know how his children would survive now.”“He had called us up before starting his arduous journey home early on Thursday and said there was no public transport available.

As accurate data for Covid-19 in the Indian scenario is not available, the government has taken the step on the basis of the best estimates, they add.From the available data, it appears that the vast majority of individuals exposed to the virus—around 97 of 100 exposed —will develop clinical symptoms within about 12 days. But there will be a small fraction of people who will develop symptoms between 14 and 21 days too, said Partha Majumder, professor at National Institute of Biomedical Genomics and president of Indian Academy of Sciences, quoting a recent study in Annals of Internal Medicine.“Nobody can be absolutely sure about an appropriate period for lockdown at this stage, as we do not have any information on the natural history of this virus. Most infected persons are recovering, which means their immune system is able to eradicate the virus,” said Majumder.“The chance of death is small. Of 100 individuals who get infected, only two or three are dying on an average. But in view of our high population density and the size of our population, a large number of people may die if Covid-19 spreads widely,” added Majumder.Strict adherence is critical for us, and if we fail, many infected persons will remain in an infecting stage and active Covid-19 will persist for a longer period, he added.Shobhona Sharma from the biological sciences department, TIFR, said the government could probably do random sampling in clusters, where a few cases of infection have been found. Anirban Banerjee from the biosciences and bioengineering department of IIT-Bombay said a four-week-long lockdown is a strict measure but three weeks too is good enough to break the chain.

261,['29/03/2020'],8 booked in Vaijapur for violating home quarantine,"Aurangabad: The Aurangabad rural police have booked eight people on charges of violating the mandatory home quarantine that they were supposed to undergo after returning from abroad.

An offence against the suspects has been registered with Gangapur police station under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code. In addition, sections of National Disaster Management Act, 2005, have also been slapped on them.

According to a police officer, these people returned from Jordan and were living in Vaijapur. “Despite directives from the administration, they kept travelling in different parts of the district, including Gangapur and Pandharpur, to meet their relatives and friends. District collector Uday Choudhary got to know of this and after cross-verifying the information, he ordered registration of an offence against the suspects on Friday,” he said.

Authorities informed that all the suspects, after their return, were stamped on their hands and counseled about staying at home for a period of 14-days.

Choudhary said that no one is expected to violate the lockdown and risk the lives of other people. “We are initiating legal action against all those violating the lockdown orders. Moreover, we appeal to the people to come forward with whatever information they have regarding violations of the current lockdown and bring it to the notice of the administration, so that appropriate and timely action can be initiated.”

Meanwhile, health department is also keeping an eye on these suspects to see if they have started showing symptoms and if need be they may be shifted to an isolation ward.

Sources informed that the health authorities – after learning that people who have been stamped on their hands are violating the home quarantine – have decided to make random visits and check if they are available at the addresses given to the health officials.

The drive is set to kick start in Aurangabad city which has a higher number of people with travelling history.

While fishermen in Goa have been told not to venture into the sea until further notice in view of the novel coronavirus, these traditional fishermen have managed to accumulate some catch to be sold by village vendors.

“Fishing activity cannot be stopped. People need fish to eat. They cannot go hungry. We are therefore managing somehow,” MLA Alexio Reginaldo Lourenco said. They are getting a mixed variety of inland fish and prawns, he said.

Lourenco also said that necessary precautions are being taken right from fishing to selling. “The boats are being sanitised. We are maintaining a metre’s distance while giving out the fish. In cases where people rush, we have been intervening and acting quickly,” he said.

However, not all traditional fishermen have been as lucky. Nerul-based ramponkar Ozer Mendes said that the other traditional fishermen in his area were lathi-charged by police for attempting to venture into the waters.

“Are we supposed to end our livelihoods and die?” he said.

General secretary of the Goencha Ramponkaranchem Ekvott (GRE) said that survival for traditional fishing community has become difficult. “Our families are hungry because of suspension of fishing activities. Fish is also an essential commodity so we should be permitted to carry out fishing activity,” he said.

A notice was recently issued by the state fisheries department. “In view of the prevailing situation in the country due to the health emergency posed by Covid-19, all fishermen are requested not to venture into the sea for fishing until further notice,” it stated.

265,['29/03/2020'],"Plans afoot to use railway, bus stations for housing migrants &amp; labourers","NAGPUR: The district administration and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) are exploring plans on whether railway platforms and bus stations could be used to house migrants and labourers till the lockdown period.

According to municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe , over 2,500 such persons were forced to stay on roads and footpaths after the curfew was imposed. He said the NMC was in talks with the railway authorities and state government to use their respective platforms for accommodating this large population.

Seconding his views, divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar attributed the exodus of these poor people to the lockdown, stating that they were left stranded in the city after all transportation services were stopped.

“The railway and bus stations could be ideal place to make temporary shelters for these poor people who hail from other states, due to facilities like proper toilets. With the help of NGOs, we can provide them food and water. We will ensure that nobody remains hungry in the moment of unprecedented crisis,” Kumar told TOI.

NMC has five night shelters in various areas of the city, but these have a limited capacity of 220 beds collectively. Till a few days ago, half of the beds were vacant. It was only after TOI highlighted the issue that NMC officials swung into action and shifted some homeless people there.

“These are economically backward people who’re forced to live on streets due to current crisis. We’re of course using our night shelters, but their numbers are more. We can’t create additional shelters, so we thought of using railway and bus stations along with temples for such aggrieved persons for a temporary period. Even mentally challenged persons wandering on roads could be kept at mental hospitals,” Mundhe told TOI.

The civic chief added that educating such migrants and labourers on social distancing was a big challenge, but their officials were on it. “As a society, we need to rise to the occasion and support these poor people, who’re in need. Currently, the results of our efforts are positive, but I don’t know what will happen next. Therefore, we need to be fully prepared to meet any exigency,” he said.

Kumar said the administration had formed ward-wise teams along with the NMC to check whether the residents were getting adequate supply of groceries and vegetables. “It’s the government’s responsibility to provide livelihood to poor people in such critical conditions. We’re looking forward to provide more help to such persons through public distribution system (PDS),” he added.

JAIPUR: At least 1.5 lakh workers entered Dungarpur from Gujarat and Maharashtra walking on feet in the past 10 days.

Since two persons who travelled from Indore on a motorbike and entered into Rajasthan from Banswara and reached Dungarpur, have tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, the state government is on alert mode.

According to a district administration official, Dungarpur, the state government has decided to screen the people entering the state at the district to which they belong to. “Earlier, we were doing screening as they enter the state, but now it has been decided that the officials of the districts to which these migrants belong, they will also conduct their screening,” said a district administration official.

Initially, 25 teams of heath department were deployed at Ratanpur , which have screened thousands of people entering the state from Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh through Ratangarh in Dungarpur. The border had been ordered to be sealed yesterday, but following immense pressure, the border has been opened for migrant labourers on Saturday. However, the number of migrants has decreased significantly now. On Friday night, at least 2,000 people entered Dungarpur and crossed the border unscreened by sideways. Till afternoon, there were only 121 people who were screened. Currently, there are five doctors and eight nursing staff deployed at Ratanpur.

However, people are entering from Gujarat from Ratangarh block of Dungarpur. Officials said that there are also those who belong to Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and other such states and are covering the distance by walking. “We have provided buses to them, but they would not suffice,” said the official.

The district administration has taken measures to provide them food packets and water. However, these migrants can be seen resting in parks, footpaths and other public places in the night and they start walking when sun rises. Most of them continue to walk even in nights. “For the past 10 days, at least 15,000 to 20,000 such migrants entered Rajasthan from Dungarpur every day,” he said.

269,['29/03/2020'],Only 30-40% of e-commerce fleet back on the ground,"Pune: As of Saturday, only about 30-40% of the pre-lockdown fleet of e-commerce companies, such as Amazon, Big Basket, Dunzo and Grofers, was back in action despite e-commerce being exempt from the restrictions.

The companies have to get passes prepared for their executives so that when checked by police, they get the go-ahead. Passes are also required for delivery executives at petrol pumps.

“E-commerce services were marked essential in the Union government’s first lockdown notification. However, it looks like this did not percolate to the ground — our executives were roughed up and police on ground ordered the closure of fulfilment centres and delivery hubs,” said an executive of a e-commerce giant.

Over half-a-dozen companies are taking things up with the Pune police collectively. “Even so, as one issue gets resolved, another is cropping up. For instance, even as Pune police moved to the system of issuing e-passes to the executives, they are not getting honoured in PCMC limits,” an executive said.

“Our executives have to show the passes to even get fuel. As things stand, only a few fuel stations are open and when the executives come to PCMC limits, petrol pumps don’t accept this pass. Even police think these passes are doctored, though it is clearly written that it is issued by the Pune police,” an executive of another delivery chain said.

In the confusion, important consignments of medicines, perishable food items, grocery, among others, have been held up.

“If home delivery is enabled, there will be fewer people seeking to go out. This will help the cause of social distancing,” an executive of a leading delivery chain said.

To add to the woes of the delivery chains, about 20% of their executives have left Pune for their hometowns and some are still reluctant to return to work.

E-commerce players are having to work district-by-district, jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction to get passes arranged and this is adding to the delay. Also, what qualifies as essential is not clear to anyone, an executive said.

“In some cases, our executives were roughed up for carrying routers and headphones. When lakhs are working from home, these are workplace essentials, but police on the ground seem to have a different view,” said an e-commerce giant’s executive.

Ramnath Pokle, additional commissioner of police, Pimpri Chinchwad, said these companies will need to apply to the zonal deputy commissioners of police for approval. The PCMC commissionerate is divided into two zones. “During this lockdown, essential and emergency services shall remain functional. Those who require passes for essential and emergency services may contact zonal offices and passes will be issued after verifying the required documents,” he said.

“The railways has been continuously running its goods trains to ensure rakes of grains are transported in every nook and corner of the country. We have now resumed the parcel services as well so that the people with small amount of goods can also make full use of the services,” Anil Kumar Jain, senior public relations officer, said.

The railways has decided to run the parcel services from Kalyan to New Delhi, Guwahati (via Patna) and Howrah (via Nagpur). The starting of the services will help in faster and efficient transportation of goods at the earliest.

“Transportation of goods by road involves risk for people like drivers and cleaners. When it comes to trains, the loco pilots and guards work relatively in a safer zone and hence it involves lesser risk. The transportation is also faster,” the official said.

People interested in booking an entire wagon or piecemeal transportation – only of essential goods like grains, vegetables, medical supplies, among others, can now start with the registration process.

“If the quantity of goods is huge then people can book the wagon or even rakes – depending on the requirement. If goods are lesser in quantity, space can be reserved in the parcel train originating from Kalyan. If the volume is good a train can originate even from Nashik and deliver the goods at any station falling on the aforesaid routes,” the official said.

Onion traders have welcomed the move. “This would cut down the inter-state transport issue that is currently hampering the movement of goods. By trains, the agricultural produce will move swiftly instead of getting damaged,” Rohit Warungase, an onion farmer, said.

JODHPUR: Police have started tightening noose around those violating the lockdown orders in the city. On Saturday, a case was registered against a hotel owner for allowing a large number of persons for offering namaz.

On the information, when the police raided the hotel, over a hundred persons were found offering namaz in a large hall of the hotel, while some were found present in different rooms of the hotel.

“We have seized Ababeel Hotel and filed a case against the hotel owner,” said a police officer adding that some of the devotees have been sent to the hospital for the check-up.

Police have also started dealing with those escaping the medical check-up and quarantine orders sternly. On Saturday, a suspect, who had reached the MG Hospital for check-up following some symptoms, fled during the medical examination.

“He fled from the hospital, the moment, the doctors expressed their suspicion to him to be infected. The hospital staff ran after him as well as the policemen on duty. They got hold of him outside the hospital and made him sit until an ambulance was not called in, which took him to the MDM Hospital for examination,” said the police.

274,['29/03/2020'],Workers held back by fear of being ostracised by villagers,"Nashik: The rural police have received feedback that many workers have been warned — by the residents of villages they live — against working in the fields or in the markets/mandis.

The government is planning to regularise the supply of agriculture produce and other essential services from the point-of-origin to destinations. However, a major problem is the shortage of workers to load/unload the goods even at railway stations and agriculture produce market committees.

“Just when the issues of manpower channelising are being sorted out, other problems are cropping up. Villagers are discouraging people from joining any work in the urban areas,” said Sachin Patil, a transport contractor.

Workers are in demand at Lasalgaon, Pimpalgaon, Nashik, Satana and many other locations, including the railway stations, for loading and unloading of goods. However, they are being warned against taking up these jobs — some villages have even threatened that such workers will not be welcomed back if they work in these places. Moreover, even their family members may not find any support from the villagers.

“The workers are ready to work, but they are being held back by the fear of being ostracized or even being barred from entering their villages,” Shankar Rawat, another contractor, said.

Nashik Rural SP Arti Singh told TOI that she had received such complaints from her sources and warned that any move to stop workers would face stringent action.

“There are certain reports about workers being threatened and warned. We assure all the workers that none of them would have to face problems for two reasons — firstly, all precautionary measures will be taken to ensure their safety and secondly, we have instructed officers to attend to such complaints on a priority basis,” she said.

“I am in touch with my officers across the district and have asked them to register complaints against the individuals concerned — be it the sarpanch or the police patil — if anything like this happens,” Singh said.

275,['29/03/2020'],Intelligence agency warns of terror threat in Delhi,"Security has been stepped up and states and metropolitan cities have been alerted

NEW DELHI: The threat of a terror attack looms large over the capital. An intelligence agency on Saturday received a specific input about a possible strike being planned by Islamic State operatives in the coming days.

The input, accessed by TOI, mentions human intelligence sources stating that two Pakistani terrorists, who were operating in Shopian region of J&K till now, had moved out to launch a terror attack somewhere in the mainland. “The terrorists owe their allegiance to ISIS and are using Telegram to communicate,” it added.

The agency was given the tip-off that the two terrorists had left the Valley last week by road and were going to reach Delhi in a couple of days.

Security has been stepped up in Delhi and efforts are on to disperse the crowd gathered at various interstate bus terminals and at the UP border. Police of states like Punjab and metros like Mumbai have also been alerted.

The threat is being taken “very seriously” as IS magazines like al-Naba and Voice of Hind have written cover-page articles urging Indian Jihadis to capitalise on the “enemy’s preoccupation with novel coronavirus” and wage attacks.

In an editorial piece in al-Naba, Islamic State mentioned that jihadis could exploit this opportunity as the security apparatus of all countries was busy fighting the pandemic. The article elaborated on how the ability of the governments in coordinating counter-terror operations was reduced as it was focusing on dealing with casualties, price hike and product shortages.

“We are preparing for new attacks, which will be the last thing they want. The military apparatus is also crippled because of restriction of movement. The overburdened hospitals will have a nightmare if the mujahideens greet them in the morning,” added the article, which was widely circulated on pro-ISIS channels and chat platforms like Rocketchat, TamTam, Threema and Telegram.

Intelligence sources said they were well aware of these communications and were closely monitoring them.

276,['29/03/2020'],The Ups and Downs of Lockdown,"Ahmedabad: Since the Janata Curfew held exactly a week ago, followed by the nationwide 21-day lockdown imposed by the government of India to curb the spread of Covid-19, trade and industry — except those engaged in essential items manufacturing — have come to a complete standstill across Gujarat. TOI’s Niyati Parikh takes stock of the impact of lockdown in the first week of enforcement.

98% transport vehicles off the road

The number of transport vehicles plying on the roads has reduced considerably owing to the lockdown and more than 98% transport vehicles are currently off the road. “Barely 2% of the vehicles are moving including petrol, diesel tankers and milk tankers. Moreover, numerous cars are stuck along the state and district borders as they have been sealed,” said Mukesh Dave, president, Akhil Gujarat Truck Transporters’ Association (AGTTA).

“Movement of essential commodities is so far allowed. However, since businesses are interdependent, there are a lot of glitches. For instance, if packaging material for milk tetrapaks doesn’t reach the milk processing unit, milk cannot be dispatched. Besides, validity of e-way bills is for a limited period and if shipments are delayed due to vehicles getting stuck at state and district borders, this will expire. These are issues which require urgent attention from the government,” said Dave.

Industries stare at liquidity crisis

The complete lockdown has brought production at manufacturing units and economic activity in businesses to a grinding halt and manufacturers across sectors including textile, dyes and chemicals fear a major liquidity crisis. “With the lockdown situation prevailing globally, export orders are either getting cancelled or indefinitely deferred. Europe and US, which are key export markets, are under lockdown too and as a result, payment fulfilments aren’t expected. With lockdown in India, demand will take a further hit, whereas funds invested in procuring raw materials will get stuck, thus resulting in a major liquidity crunch,” said Chintan Thaker, co-chair, Assocham Gujarat State Council.

Dyes and chemicals manufacturing units too are staring at losses to the tune of Rs 1 lakh crore over the 21-day lockdown. “We will neither be able to cater to local demand nor global as the shutdown has halted manufacturing and business operations completely. If this further extends, our payment commitments to clients as well as to our own employees will also be impacted,” said Yogesh Parikh, president, Gujarat Dyestuff Manufacturers’ Association (GDMA).

Low turnout at operational units

Units engaged in manufacturing essential items like medicines have seen a drop in worker turnout due to the lockdown. Drug makers suggest that only 40% of the workforce is able to report to work on account of issues related to transportation as well as the fear of getting infected. “Permits from collector offices are now being issued to essential item makers so that movement of their workers is not restricted,” said an industry insider, who did not wish to be quoted.

“Some initial hiccups will be there when such a massive lockdown is enforced. We expect workers’ turnout to start increasing from Monday,” the industry player informed.

Petrol-Diesel sales decline 90%

With all private vehicles going completely off the road and that too with minimum essential movement coupled with bare minimum movement of transport vehicles, the sale of petrol and diesel have declined by at least 90%, according to industry estimates.

“Fuel stations across the state will remain open from 8am to 4pm only. The timing restrictions will remain till the lockdown situation continues across all 4,000 petrol pumps in Gujarat,” said Arvind Thakkar, president, FGSPDA.

Meanwhile, petroleum dealers are finding it extremely difficult to keep the business running. “A huge operational cost is involved in running a petrol pump. With a sharp decline in sales, we will not be able to sustain business beyond a month or two,” said Padmajay Rathod, owner of a fuel station near Shyamal Crossroads.

“Against a daily sale of around 50,000 litre, the sale has dropped to 1,500-litre since the shutdown was imposed,” he added.

Retail vegetable prices go up; grain supply intact

While there is no short supply of vegetables and grains, the retail prices of certain vegetables have gone up significantly. “There is no change in the wholesale prices of vegetables. However, due to transportation issues triggered by the lockdown, the supply of some vegetables such as lemon and ginger has declined by 50% over the past couple of days, as they come from neighbouring states,” said Deepak Patel, secretary, APMC – Ahmedabad.

Retail prices however, have skyrocketed by at least 15% amid increased demand, according to estimates by retailers. On the other hand, while there is no shortage of grains and pulses, the supply is a little delayed than usual due to the lockdown. “The APMCs and market yards are shut in some places and therefore, transportation is a major concern. While there is no shortage reported yet, the supply chain has been affected due to the slowdown. The entire stock of pulses in Gujarat comes from neighbouring states. The government has already facilitated movement of trucks and thus, stocks will soon start reaching,” said Rajesh Dalal, president, Ahmedabad Grain Merchants’ Association.

Electricity consumption drops

The demand for power across Gujarat has plummeted with industrial units and commercial establishments remaining closed due to the lockdown. The state’s peak power demand has declined 6,348 MW since Saturday last week.

The maximum power demand of 10,468 MW was recorded on March 26 as against 16,816 was registered in Gujarat on March 21, a day before the nation-wide Janata Curfew was observed on March 22, shows data compiled by the Western Region Load Dispatch Centre (WRLDC), a central government entity.

Reduction in demand from the industrial, commercial and office segments has brought down electricity consumption in the state. The demand from agriculture and residential consumers has not been affected, said power sector experts.

LPG demand goes up

Even as the demand for regular petro products declined, demand for LPG cooking gas went up. The daily supply of LPG in Gujarat has now surged to 1,900 million tonnes (MT) from 1,870 MT a month ago. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd is taking also taking steps to increase LPG production in its major refineries. IndianOil’s all 509 distributorships in Gujarat are functioning normally, the company said.

Gujarat Dairies Have More Milk, Smaller Market In Lockdown

Prashant.Rupera@timesgroup.com

Vadodara: The dairy sector in Gujarat is witnessing a peculiar situation under the current lockdown.

Usually, with the onset of summer, milk procurement starts declining across the state. But milk unions in the state, which are members of the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), are witnessing record milk procurement.

“We witness drastic decline in milk procurement during summer, which is a lean season. But currently, we are procuring 260 lakh litres per day (LLPD) which is 6-7 % more compared to last year. This is happening because the milk that was going to private players is also coming to co-operatives,” said R S Sodhi, managing director of GCMMF that markets brand Amul.

Ahead of Sunday’s ‘Janata curfew’ and during the initial days of lockdown, Amul had witnessed sale of milk and other dairy products rising by 15-20% in the state.

“Now, sale of milk products is coming down. Initially, people had resorted to panic buying. From Friday, we are witnessing a decline of nearly 20% in sales,” he said, adding that sales of milk and some other products are likely to witness twists and turns during the remaining days of the lockdown.

In the long term, however, Sodhi foresees a decline of nearly 10% in sales of dairy products. Sale of ice cream has already witnessed a decline of 50-60 % while sales of other dairy products like cheese, cream among others has also seen a beating.

“There is 10-12 % decline in sales of such dairy products due to closure of hotels, restaurants, caterers, eateries and cafeterias among others,” he said, adding that although dairies will compensate during the months of summer, the impact of lockdown will be seen for nearly three months.

277,['29/03/2020'],"Shortage of sugar, cooking oil looms over Nagpur","Kirana shops in Wadi are witnessing mad rush during lockdown

NAGPUR: Even as the supply situation of essential commodities in the city is normal as of now, Nagpur may face a shortage of sugar, cooking oil, etc unless the district administration ensures that transport of these goods is not hindered.

Pratap Motwani, secretary of Wholesale Grain and Seeds Merchants Association, said that many commodities were not reaching the city from other states and thus, a shortage scenario was looming over the city.

“We have about 15 days stock of wheat and rice in the city so it is not an immediate problem. However, the stock of sugar, cooking oil, etc is only for two to three days. These things are not being sent to Nagpur from other states. We have informed district collector Ravindra Thakre in this regard,” he told TOI.

According to Motwani, wheat comes from Madhya Pradesh while city’s rice requirement was met mostly from Vidarbha. “In the long run, we don’t see a problem with rice but transport problem has to be solved for wheat supply,” he said.

Motwani said that the Indian Army based in Kamptee Cantonment was stocking two months’ provisions. “This shows that the lockdown is not going to end on April 14 and will continue for some more weeks. Hence, logistics problem has to be solved on priority basis,” he added.

Prabhakar Deshmukh, a grocery owner, said the same thing. “Wheat and rice are not a problem but sugar, sago (sabudana), cooking oil, asafoetida (heeng) and mustard are in short supply. I have heard that the government is not allowing trucks from other states to enter Maharashtra,” he added.

Mataprasad Gupta, a vegetable vendor, said that barring potatoes and onions, the supply of other vegetables was normal. “Today, the two vegetables were in short supply in Kalamna APMC. The wholesale rate of potatoes has shot up from Rs25 a kg to Rs40 while onions were available at Rs35 a kg instead of the usual Rs30. This has increased their price in the retail market,” he said.

“A fruit vendor from Lokmat Square said that while all fruits were available, police personnel were harassing fruit vendors when they brought fruits from Kalamna APMC. He urged the police commissioner and district collector to issue necessary directives.

Poultry and fish are again available in the city after a gap of four to five days. Overzealous cops had closed down these shops. The police commissioner had to issue directives to stop them. Goat meat shops are, however, still closed.

Even if the price rises a bit, no one really cares during such times,” he said.At Mayur Vihar Phase I, onion is Rs 60 per kg, potatoes Rs 50 and tomatoes Rs 45. “Though expensive, vegetables are almost stale and dry. The vendor says he can’t go to the mandi to get fresh stocks. So we are forced to pay a premium for inferior items,” alleged Ratna Shama, a 45-year-old homemaker.The chairman of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) at Azadpur, Adil Ahmad Khan, blamed retailers for the price rise. “The government has started issuing challans of Rs 1 lakh each. We are also appealing to people not to hoard,” Khan told TOI.Sellers, however, claimed they were only reacting to the market. A seller at south Delhi’s Kishangarh said the prices had marginally reduced on Saturday compared to Friday. “Today potato is Rs 24, onion Rs 25-30 and tomato Rs 30 per kg. On Friday, these items were slightly more expensive. Fresh stocks have arrived at the mandi,” said Ajay Kumar of Rohit Fresh Vegetables.At a departmental store in Dwarka, the prices are a little higher but its owner claimed there was no hike though it meant incurring losses on some vegetables. “People are selling at random rates. We have maintained a uniform rate for potatoes, tomatoes and onions — Rs 38 per kg,” said Narender of Babaji Farm Fresh Vegetables and Fruits departmental store at Dwarka’s Sector 7. “Normally, people are selling onions for Rs 48. We are incurring losses but helping people in our own way,” he added.APMC’s Khan made it clear that there was more than enough supply for the city at the mandi. “Although the number of trucks is less now and the supply of vegetables is down by 50-60%, enough stocks are reaching Delhi. There will be no shortage,” he said, urging people not to panic and hoard. The government is acting against hoarders, he reiterated.In normal times, the mandi caters to the whole of north India, but not many trucks are going out now, Khan clarified. “Usually 1,300 tonnes of apple pass through the mandi daily while Delhi needs around 200 tonnes.

281,['29/03/2020'],"Food, veggie delivery allowed using online payment, citizens happy with move","Nashik: The city police and district administration has permitted the food delivery apps and home-delivery of vegetables to start their services starting Saturday using only a contactless payment system.

This comes as welcome news for the elderly and those who cannot cook for themselves. The police have allowed about 100 restaurants to serve food in their jurisdiction so that the food delivery executive does not have to travel long distances and thus does not violate the purpose of the lockdown to contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus.

The district administration, on the other hand, has asked the people to get the vegetables delivered by ‘Sahyadri Farms’ — started by a group of farmers coming together.

“They have good aggregation and packaging facility and they have also displayed the rates for their goods, which the people can order through the social media numbers given by them,” said collector Suraj Mandhare.

As far as the food delivery is considered, the city has been divided into several zones and the food delivery app has been asked to limit their services from a particular restaurant within the zone. The restaurants have been told clearly that they would not allow anybody to sit and eat there but only deliver the parcels.

“The idea is to ensure fast delivery, maintaining the safety of producers, transporters and the receivers as well. The contactless payment and delivery is the key in the process,” the police official said.

The move has been devised to cut down the need to travel or any social contact with the people. “This is an excellent thing that has happened. We were waiting for such an arrangement so that we could get food to eat. During the last two to three days I managed to the get some snacks for us,” Lakshman Sing, the resident of Kamgar Nagar said.

However, many people gathered outside the restaurants to get food, which defeated the purpose of a lockdown. The police warned the people against coming out for any reason — especially under the pretext of getting food.

283,['29/03/2020'],"Market Yard to open today, adequate supply of essentials a priority","Pune: The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Pune on Saturday decided to reopen the Shree Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard from Sunday.

A decision in this regard was taken after a meeting with representatives of the commission agents association, porters and traders.

“We have decided to conduct trading on alternate days to avoid mass gatherings,” Balasaheb Deshmukh, the chief administrator of APMC, said. “It means, on Sunday, vegetables (except potato and onion) and fruits will be sold in open auction as usual. Onion, potato and fruits will be auctioned on Monday,” he said.

He said the APMC’s primary priority was to make adequate supply of all vegetables and fruits available in the city.

“We heard issues of the commission agents, porters and other staffers on Friday. To resolve their queries, the APMC is going to issue identity cards to them as well as registered traders. The police will not allow anyone in the market without the identity cards,” Deshmukh said.

He added that they would take appropriate action against those commission agents who will not open their shops in the coming days for defying the collector’s order. “We have also appealed to farmers to bring their produce to the market,” he said.

Vilas Bhujbal, the president of the commission agents and traders association, said maximum commission agents and traders have responded positively to the government call.

“One cannot deny there is fear among all. We have requested the APMC authorities to take due precautions so that more people will work willingly in the coming days,” Bhujbal said.

Meanwhile, a section of traders and commission agents have expressed concern about the decision.

“Holding open auction is risky. One needs to understand that thousands of people will come to one place. We can’t hold auctions without mass gatherings. How can we sell the farmers’ produce? The APMC is only going to allow big traders to participate in it. They will take advantage of the situation and quote lower prices,” a commission agent said.

Another agent said maximum porters and clerical staff have gone to their native places.

“Who will unload and pack the auctioned produce? Without adequate manpower it is impossible to do it. How will the APMC deal with this situation,” he said.

Many farmers are worried about their produce, especially onion farmers, as they don’t have a dedicated facility to keep it safe. For the last two days, a lot of the produce has been affected by the rain in the district, the agent said.

A senior district administration official said, “At present, demand and supply of vegetables and fruits has been hit badly in the city. If we can’t open the Market Yard, how can we meet people’s requirements? There is shortage of all agricultural produce in the market.”

NAGPUR: In a letter written by NMC to police commissioner , the civic body states that it is now allowed to feed stray dogs from 6-7am and 7-10 pm. More than two people are not allowed to feed the animals. “It is mandatory to take prior permission from the police station of your area for feeding,"" said Smita Mire, founder of Save Speechless Organization.

A businessman, a police head constable, a medical shop owner, a hotelier and among the animal lovers who have joined hands with Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to feed the stray dogs during the lockdown following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's appeal.

This newly-formed group in the city has hired cooks who are making over 2,000 chapatis everyday for the street dogs. The initiative began in the city on Saturday when the group members fed hundreds of strays in Gandhibagh, Itwari, Wardhaman Nagar, Maskasath, Railway station, Sitabuldi and others areas.

According to animal activist Karishma Galani, who is sponsoring the payment of cooks, the group is focusing more on commercial areas of Nagpur. “Stray dogs in these areas were mostly dependent on shopkeepers or leftover food from restaurants. With all of it shut down now, these dogs have no source of food,” she said.

Extending its support to the group, NMC has allotted them a vehicle and driver for transporting the food to different areas. The food is being prepared at Ghate restaurant near Ambazari. The owner Vinod Ghate, who has been working for animal welfare since years, has provided his premises and cooking facilities. “He is also sponsoring milk and sugar. We are preparing special sweet chapatis to ensure the dogs eat them,” said Galani.

Founder of Spacewood Kirit Joshi, who is sponsoring nearly 30 kilograms of wheat flour daily, stressed strays were suffering a lot during the lockdown. “Residents who would feed them regularly are not stepping out now. Hence it is very important to ensure that they get a regular supply of food. We will keep doing this till the lockdown continues,” Joshi said.

He added that individual animal lovers and NGOs should come together to cover most areas in the city. “Working in isolation won’t work now,” he added.

It’s been four years since head constable at Lakadganj police station Ishwar Potdar has been feeding 7-8 stray dogs in the station’s premises. However, since the lockdown, the 56-year-old cop took upon himself to feed street dogs of as many areas as possible. “Every day, I stuff my vehicle with different food items and feed them to stray dogs I see on my way. The dogs are in a very poor condition as they are dying of hunger. They can’t even leave their territory and go to other areas in search of food,” said Potdar.

On Day 1 of the initiative itself, many animal lovers in the city came forward to help. Carpenter Yogesh Hanwate accompanied the members and fed dogs the entire day. Animal lover Sudha Agrawal offered 100 chapatis and 5kg rice.

The group has appealed to the citizens to come under one platform and carry out stray feeding in a systematic manner. “This is the time to show kindness and compassion,” they said.

NEW DELHI: The ones most likely to end the day without a morsel with everything closed are the street children. Fortunately, some NGOs are reaching out to such kids not only with food, but also social media videos about how to fend for themselves in the coronavirus lockdown.

NGO Child Rights and You (CRY), for instance, is trying to make basic health and hygiene kit available to every. child. Puja Marwaha, CEO, CRY, said, “We want to stand by the children in the worst affected of our operational areas.” Besides the health and hygiene items, CRY plans also to support the children with dry rations. “We will also provide indoor games to keep them happily engaged during the period of lockdown.”

Marwaha added, “Apart from directly interacting with the children, we will also support the government workers involved in schemes like ASHA and aanganwadi centres to enable them to work with children and pregnant and lactating mothers.”

Another NGO, Chetna, has adopted innovative ways to keep in touch with street children at a time when its members cannot venture out into the streets. Director Sanjay Gupta explained, “We observed that at least one of every five children had a mobile phone. Since these children live together, we send messages or TikTok videos on social media platforms. In this manner, we are in contact with them while simultaneously keeping them up to date with the coronavirus situation and the precautions they absolutely must take.”

Realising the threats they faced in living on the streets, Chetna had distributed face masks to the children even before the lockdown was announced and asked them to use them at all times. Gupta added that many of these children live in or near railway stations, and others near the open drains where the hygienic conditions were very poor. “Many of them don’t have families and it becomes all the more important for us to stay in touch with them monitor them on an everyday basis,” said Gupta.

Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) has also been active in helping the underprivileged children and their families under these unprecedent circumstances. “We have made a list of people and since Thursday have been distributing food to them,” informed a DCPCR official. “We are yet to check some areas but will do everything to ensure that food and medicines reach everyone during this tough lockdown period.”

Teja, a vendor in Kondhwa, was apprehensive of going to the Market Yard on Sunday to replenish his stock.

“I have no idea what the scene is going to be like at Market Yard on Sunday, but I am sure it will be chaotic. Moreover, the main problem is transportation. We are facing tremendous hardship without any income. We hire vehicles to bring the vegetables to our shops. I would pay Rs200-250 for transportation, but now they are asking for at least Rs800. Add this to the high vegetable prices, and I may not be I might not be able to transport the vegetables,” Teja said.

I’ve heard of instances where police have hit people,” he said.

A customer, who was buying vegetables from Teja, requested him to at least try and get the basics. “One cannot find basic vegetables like potatoes, onions and tomatoes. The government had said all essential items will be available during the lockdown, but we are facing problems. I have requested the vendor to get the basic vegetables at least,” he said.

At a supermarket on NIBM Road, customers could be seen hunting for essentials like flour and pulses. “Also, food items like noodles are missing from the shelves,” Rashmi, a customer, said.

“Trucks carrying stock are stuck in different areas and so, we have not been able to restock. Customers have been complaining, but we cannot do much. Our stocks are over. On Friday, we sent an employee to get some items, but he was harassed by police,” an employee of the supermarket said.

PANAJI: BJP legislators have urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to allow the state to re-implement a total lockdown in Goa.

In a letter, MLAs informed the PM and home minister that without a total lockdown, people will crowd in large numbers at shops and social distancing norms will not be adhered to. They also pointed out that the vehicular movement has to be completely stopped.

The state has 27 BJP MLAs, including chief minister Pramod Sawant . On March 24, Sawant had announced a total lockdown in Goa. It was relaxed on March 26 in keeping with the Centre’s directives on provision of essentials.

After the announcement of a nationwide lockdown for 21 days on March 24, all the legislators were looking forward to implement the same in the state.

“We feel that the purpose of lockdown will be futile if shops are kept open. People resort to panic-buying and show least concern for social distancing. Recently, crowds were visible near milk booths and grocery shops,” MLAs said.

“Goa being a touristic state, spread of the epidemic would have a long lasting impact on the economy and livelihood of the people too,” MLAs maintained.

MLAs stated in the letter that it was a humble request from the people not to allow any vehicular traffic, shut down all grocery shops and ensure their safety.

DIG Rajesh Kumar visited the district headquarters and reviewed the security arrangements in the district. The paramilitary force will be deployed across South Goa, in addition to the local police, from Sunday.

Four days after the state lockdown, people were still struggling to get their essentials. Despite the government allowing all grocery shops to stay open, only a few stores did on Saturday, where large queues were seen. However, the situation was more orderly and no overcrowding was seen.

In some villages of South Goa, people resorted to blocking the borders thereby preventing entry of vehicles from other towns. In Davorlim, a group of locals came out on the streets and urged people to stay indoors. In Rivona, Sanguem, people resorted to 100% lockdown with all shops remaining shut.

Though milk supply was normal on Friday, milk booths were closed stocks soon ran out.

Offices of the MLAs of various constituencies were engaged in making arrangements of essential goods.

Most of the distributors shut shop on Monday and have been receiving calls from vendors and grocers, who are looking to restock.

Members of the association said their vehicles have not been permitted to ply, while their employees are unable to reach their warehouses. “For several days now, we have been running to various police chowkies and even the collector’s office to seek permission to ply, but to no avail. On Friday, we went to four police chowkies, where we were told to apply for permission online. We filled up the form online, but hadn’t got a response till Saturday evening,” Sham Mundada, an association member, said.

Mundada said distributors of various goods had stocks sufficient to last a couple of days. “Since we were operational till Monday, stock was dispatched to the market. The shortage will become acute now. We need to restart the supply chain to avoid shortage and price rise,” he said.

The association’s president, Anand Munot, said there was an urgent need for clarification on the goods falling under the essential category. “Does packaged food, like ready-to-cook meals, fall into this category? If the lockdown continues for much longer, these products are going to be very important. We need to know what can be delivered to stores,” he said.

Association members said they were making an all-out effort to seek permission. “We are planning to raise the issue with the police commissioner now,” Munot added.

Mundada said the association will provide all possible help to ensure a steady supply of only essential products by identifying the distributors concerned.

“Packaged products like flour, frozen foods, toiletries like hand wash, disinfectants and others are essential products and this has already been discussed. There should be free movement of these products and this has already been communicated to the police. We have already given out 8,000 passes for delivery of essentials. Distributors can display that they are carrying essential goods on their vehicles. If they are facing any problem, they should contact us,” Pune collector Naval Kishore Ram said.

303,['29/03/2020'],Bengaluru: Doctor rush to start apps as telemedicine takes off,"Doctors and hospitals are reporting a surge in the number of enquiries for online consultations

BENGALURU/MANGALURU: The nation-wide lockdown has spurred a demand for online medical consultations, and many doctors are trying to start their own apps. Hospitals with telemedicine services are reporting a surge in the number of requests for video-call appointments from people who need medical advice or attention.

Divakar’s Speciality Hospital in JP Nagar, Bengaluru, does 50-60 online consultations with pregnant women. “The session must be booked via the hospital’s app. We are on 100% video consultations. However, the mandatory antenatal scanning in the 12th week and 28th week of pregnancy has to be done at the hospital,” said Dr Hema Divakar, the hospital’s medical director.

The Medical Council of India, in consultation with government policy think tank Niti Aayog, has issued telemedicine guidelines to enable registered medical practitioners to provide remote diagnosis and treatment with the help of technology such as videoconferencing.

RxDx, a chain of multi-speciality clinics, attends to 80-100 teleconsultations a day; all its doctors are available online. “The government has legalised teleconsultations in India at the right moment. This was needed as it helps patients see doctors during lockdown. It also allows doctors to evaluate the patients without the risk of acquiring any infection,” said Dr Sunita Maheshwari, a paediatric cardiologist with RxDx.

Remote monitoring, telemedicine and home healthcare are becoming popular in the country and around the world amid coronavirus-linked lockdowns and movement restrictions. Most of the corporate hospitals in Bengaluru offer the services.

Bengaluru-based Practo Insights, a healthcare teleconsultation platform, said this month, queries regarding fever, cough, cold, sore throat and body ache had soared by 200%. Most of the queries are from people in the 20-30 age group.

Vaibhav Tewari, chief operating officer of Portea Medical, a home healthcare service delivery platform, said people were now wary of calling healthcare workers to their residences because of infection concerns. The company has therefore started offering physiotherapy sessions on video calls. “A trained person will demonstrate physiotherapy routines on videoconference and help patients and their families learn the same. Close to 25 physiotherapy services a day via videoconferencing are happening in Bengaluru. That apart, we receive over 300 calls for teleconsultations,” Tewari said.

Teleconsultation trend has also taken off at private facilities in other districts. Nitte Justice KS Hegde Charitable Hospital and Yenepoya Medical College Hospital in Mangaluru offer the services.

Dr Padmanabh Kamath, head of cardiology department at KMC Mangalore, has started an online clinic and also uses his Facebook page to answer cardiac-related queries. But he stressed that this was a stopgap arrangement in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis and it would not replace cardiac care in person, especially in emergency cases.

“We don’t know how long this uncertainty will last, but in no way can we deny a patient his right of consulting a doctor. This is an attempt to extend technology-based expertise to the patient. A doctor must ensure patient’s privacy and prescriptions should be sent in PDF format on email,” Dr Kamath said. “In the current situation, the arrangement helps the public and doctors follow social distancing while maintaining the channel of communication and consolation between them.”

Dr Kamath plans to launch an app called Hrithum, where patients can upload prescriptions and medicines would be sent to their homes.

Dental surgeon Dr Sanjay Nayak said the use of telemedicine would be limited in dentistry. “Patients are sending us WhatsApp images of their teeth in cases where the crown has come out, there is swelling or a tooth has fallen. Right now, it is about providing temporary solutions, like prescribing antibiotics and painkillers,” he said.

Meanwhile, the state government has also launched a talk-to-doctor Covid-19 helpline.

The daily pollution curve has been flattened by as much as 69% (Gurgaon) in terms of PM2.5, while NO2 has reduced by 79% (Noida) so far.The masks, however, are yet to come off because of the impending threat posed by Covid-19. Data analysed by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) shows that the reduction during janata curfew was not as high as during the lockdown because the former had a duration of just 14 hours.Track the pollution level in your cityCSE executive director (research and advocacy) Anumita Roy Chowdhury said, “During the lockdown, the pollution levels are not only low but are also flatter. PM2.5 levels show a similar pattern, but with more variability as it is influenced by other sources.”The study took average readings of March 18 and 19 as the base, comparing it with readings on March 22 (janata curfew) and the average of March 25 and 26 (lockdown).During lockdown, Gurgaon has fared the best in terms of PM2.5 reduction and remained above 50% in terms of reduction across the NCR. The PM2.5 reduction in Ghaziabad has been 64% compared with the peak, 62% each in Noida and Faridabad, and a drop of 57% in Delhi. The drop in NO2 has been more significant, dropping by 79% in Noida, 75% in Ghaziabad, 66% in Gurgaon and 64% in Delhi.During janata curfew, PM2.5 reduced by 36% in Noida and 24% in Delhi. However, there was only 10% reduction in Faridabad and 7% each in Gurgaon and Ghaziabad. The reduction in NO2 levels was higher due to reduction in vehicles on the roads. The highest NO2 drop was in Noida (74%), followed by Ghaziabad (63%) and Delhi (62%).The CSE analysis said, “This shows that the hourly pollution trend, which is greatly influenced by traffic peaks on regular days, have nearly flattened out after the lockdown. Both the pollutants show a nearly similar trend, but NO2 (more directly correlated with traffic) shows a more pronounced effect.”Chowdhury said the data can help the government and private bodies understand the strong impact of traffic volume on hourly variability. “We all know that the overall air pollution levels have dropped sharply after the lockdown because vehicles, factories and construction have stopped. We don’t want to depend on this kind of emergency to bring change. But this experience has helped us understand the strong impact of traffic on pollution,” she added.“We are already making massive lifestyle adjustments to practise social distancing. Can this crisis-induced change throw up long-term solutions to the impact of traffic on air pollution?” asked Chowdhury, adding that this would help set a benchmark for future solutions and could even drive collective community action going forward.Meanwhile, the regional weather forecasting centre in Delhi released historical data for the maximum temperature recorded in April which ranges from 39.6 degree C in 1994 to 43.7 degree C in 2010. “Data analysis since 1992 shows maximum temperature over Delhi reaches 40 degree C during April 17 to 20.

308,['29/03/2020'],Quarantine safari: When the nilgai goes to the mall,"It is said that the East Delhi colony of Mayur Vihar got its name because of the number of peacocks in the area before it became so densely inhabited. A week into the lockdown, the mayur (peacock) has returned to Mayur Vihar. It’s not just in the capital. With humans out of the picture, animals are coming out to reclaim the streets. A nilgai calmly strutted outside a usually bustling shopping mall in Noida while Chandigarh and Mumbai residents did some deer and dolphin spotting.

A couple of days ago, residents of Kerala ’s Meppayur city were amazed to see an Indian civet on the road, that too one obeying traffic rules by using the zebra to cross. There are no forests in the vicinity so many wondered how the animal, usually a nocturnal one, had turned up in the city.

Mohammed Jafer Palot, scientist at the Zoological Survey of India , Western Ghats Regional Centre, Kozhikode, said that the Small Indian Civet was normally found in the rural areas of the state where there is tree cover. “It is a nocturnal animal and that is why normally it doesn't get spotted much. The one captured in the video seems to be unwell going by the way it is walking,” he added.

Even the mammals seemed to be enjoying the clear skies and tranquil shores. Wildlife conservationist Darshan Khatau shot a video of dolphins splashing around Marine Drive waters though experts later said that it wasn’t very unusual as there had been some sightings earlier as well.

Conservation biologist Latika Nath said that it was a heartening sign that pollution levels in the air and water had come down enough for rare birds and animals to be seen in urban habitats. “The water near Marine Drive is cleaner and there is little disturbance because of the boats, which is why we are seeing dolphins near Marine Drive,” she said.

Other parts of the country also reported wildlife action. Four Asian Palm Civets and two sloth bears were spotted close to human habitation near Telangana ’s Siddipet. In Kamareddy district, villagers spotted a Rusty-spotted cat cub — one of the smallest wild cat species in the world — in a tree trunk at Bhavanipet village.

In Tamil Nadu’s Coonoor area, residents have seen sloth bears and even the reclusive black panther in the past two-three days. “With no vehicle and human movement too, the wild animals have started coming out of the forest area. Last evening we saw a pair of sloth bears roaming in our area,” said residents of Drummulla located 8 km away from Coonoor.

The lockdown has also been a boon for birders. Bird Count India has launched a lockdown birding challenge. Suhel Quader from the Bengaluru chapter said this was an attempt to document birds in the neighbourhood. “It is not only about documenting rare species, but to understand and record common birds around us, “he said.

Meanwhile, birder Mohit Shenoy from Manipal said that birders of the region including Tejaswi Acharya and Arun Prabhu have sighted the Indian Pitta, a colorful stubby-tailed bird, and the Thick-Billed Flowerpecker, a tiny bird from the flowerpecker group which is not very commonly seen in and around Manipal. Since birders cannot step out, most of them are using this time to document birds from their balconies or compounds, he said.

Of course there are still animals who might miss us such as stray cattle, dogs and monkeys since they rely on humans to feed them but the others seem to be enjoying our retreat.

The two men climb the hill everyday and water about 200 plants between 6.30am and 8.45am. Each of them carries about 10-15 litres of water from a nearby tank to water the plants.

“Only two of us have police permission to water the plants. Before the lockdown, many people would come to water the plants everyday. Hence, the work was divided and about 1,000 plants could be covered. Now, it’s just the two of us to water the plants,” said Bhujbal.

The two men target each area in rotation and water about 190-200 plants every day. “We have been planting in this area for the past 14 years. So, the older plants do not need our support, they can absorb groundwater and grow on their own. The plants growing since the last three years are still very young and need our help to sustain through the summer months,” said Bhujbal.

In the past three years, the group has planted over 7,500 plants. Every year, the group plants about 2,000 plants during the monsoon months in addition to whenever people want to celebrate an occasion. “Obviously, watering the entire area is not possible as we have to manually water the plants. So we make sure that we water one plant at least every 10 days,” added Bhujbal.

The group has built 26 tanks in the area and an underground pipeline supplies water to the tanks.

311,['29/03/2020'],"Noida Covid-19 cases linked to UK auditor rise to 13, firm faces FIR","NOIDA: One of the longest chains of the novel coronavirus infection to be detected so far in India is emerging in Noida, which on Saturday recorded its highest single-day spike as nine persons tested positive, among them a an 11-year-old girl. She is the youngest Covid-19 patient in the city.Five of those who tested positive are employees of Cease Fire, a fire safety company in Noida that a British man, who is believed to be the source of the infection, visited earlier this month. He had fever and was coughing at work, people he met have said. It takes the total number of Covid-19 infections linked to him to 13, which is 50% of the total number (26) that the city has recorded so far. The health department has asked police to lodge an FIR against the company for not informing the administration about the visitor from abroad.The new cases include the company’s managing director, who lives in Sector 44, and his colleague, one in Sector 37, one in Sector 128, and two at Accheja village in Greater Noida. The residential premises of all four are being sanitised and have been sealed for the next two days.The four other patients who tested positive for Covid-19 are family members of a woman and her son, residents of Sector 2 in Greater Noida, who had tested positive on March 22. A health department official said the woman’s younger son had travelled to Denmark and there were 10 people at home when he returned, including his 11-year-old niece, who also tested positive on Saturday. She is the youngest Covid-19 patient in the district so far. The three other patients from the family include two men and a woman.“All patients have been moved to isolation wards at GIMS in Greater Noida and the child PGI in Sector 30. We now have 13 cases from Cease Fire and three cases from the same family in Greater Noida. In the district, the source of transmission of all patients so far can be tracked,” said Dr Anurag Bhargava, chief medical officer.“The MD of Cease Fire had returned from the UK on March 1 and another employee had returned on March 7, which was declared. However, they had an auditor from the UK who was in Noida from March 15 to 19 about which we were not informed, despite clear directives by that time. This is highly irresponsible as we can source 13 infected patients so far to this person, all employees of Cease Fire and their family members,” added Bhargava. “It also highlights the urgency and importance of social distancing in Noida and proper sanitisation, which could have prevented the spread of the disease. We hope people follow these and report anyone who has come from outside India.”Officials said families and direct contacts of all Cease Fire employees were being traced. Officials said 707 employees from a company related to Cease Fire have also been checked, but no one has shown symptoms so far. “There are some employees living in other places like Delhi and Ghaziabad. We have informed authorities there,” said Bhargava.",noida,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74871194,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-193031,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-covid-19-cases-linked-to-uk-auditor-rise-to-13-firm-faces-fir/articleshow/74868019.cms
312,['29/03/2020'],Medical infra overburdened &amp; supplies short: US Telugus,"Hyderabad: With New York becoming an epicentre of coronavirus, Indians there are having a tough time getting medical help. People with mild symptoms or suffering from other diseases say medical attention for them is not a priority in an overburdened healthcare system.

A Telugu woman from Andhra Pradesh said she had symptoms like severe cough, fever and bodyaches, but when she went to get checked the doctors turned her away, saying they could not test her for Covid-19 because kits were being reserved for elderly with underlying ailments.

The 32-year-old, who preferred anonymity, said she developed symptoms after she continued to travel to work. The resident of Westchester, New York, added, “When I waited for seven hours and the symptoms continued, I again went to the ER where they finally took an X-ray confirming pneumonia. They still did not test for the novel coronavirus.” Speaking to TOI, Dr Madhu Korrapati, who lives in Long Island, said the healthcare system had been overburdened and when symptoms were not severe enough patients were being asked to stay in home isolation. Explaining how precarious the situation is, the nephrologist gave an example of a hospital he goes to. “Among 200 beds, only 20 have non-Covid cases and 20 are in ICU. Among the cases in ICU, 18 patients are Covid-related cases with five developing kidney failure and five heart failure.” He said in 30 years of his practice, he had not seen anything like this.

Krishna Kotha, director in a pharmaceutical company, stressed on being patient in trying times with delays expected in the system. “Several of my colleagues have a normal cold and cough and they are not allowed to visit doctors’ offices. Most appointments are virtual, if they are being held at all. Regular illnesses are not getting any treatment,” he said.

He added, “There is a shortage of medical supplies and personnel, including doctors, nurses and hospital staff in cities like New York where thousands of cases have been reported.” Hospitals had been asking medical students and other volunteers to sign up for help, said Kotha.

Dr Raja Talluri, practicing in Louisiana, the second worst-affected state in the US, said he had admitted 11 patients the day before. ""Out of 11, eight were cover cases."" He said taking a call on whom to treat first was the discretion of doctors as they may want to focus on people with compromised immunity. “If a chemo session can be put off or gall bladder surgery postponed, we will do so.” It is better that people with minor issues do not come to hospitals at this point, he added.

313,['29/03/2020'],"Stranded workers cheer as UP govt makes special arrangement of over 3,000 buses","AGRA: In a major relief for some of the stranded migrant workers, the government of Uttar Pradesh has made special arrangement of over 3,000 buses to ferry them to their destination. Around 300 buses operated from Agra region to different parts of the state on Saturday. Thousands of migrant workers are leaving major cities for their homes, often travelling hundreds of kilometres on foot, after the nationwide 21-day Covid-19 lockdown.

The arrangement of food and drinking water for migrant workers was made by the police and district administration with support of social organisations following orders of UP CM Yogi Adityanath .

As a precaution against Covid-19, the workers of Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) sprayed sanitisers inside the buses. Police officials also assisted the migrant workers, who were walking on road, to avail the buses.

Boarding a bus to Jhansi, construction worker Vimal Kumar who along with his wife, two daughters and brother had come from Delhi to Agra on foot said, “We have been walking day and night for the past three days. Getting a bus to reach our destination is like a dream come true. We have got sufficient food to eat and were provided a few food packets for our journey by the police. We are very tired and just want to go home.”

According to UPSRTC officials, most of the stranded migrants were on their way to Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Jhansi, Azamgarh , Faizabad , Basti, Pratapgarh, Sultanpur, Amethi, Rae Bareli, Gonda, Etawah, Bahraich and Shravasti. It will take around a week to transport all the migrants to their destination, officials added.

UPSRTC service manager SP Singh said, “A total of 3,050 buses are operating in the state to ferry migrants from different places. From Agra region, 300 buses are operating on different routes. Majority of them are ferrying passengers from Delhi border. We are also dispatching buses as per police demand. Our workers are making best possible efforts to help the stranded people reach their destination.”

UPSRTC regional manager MK Trivedi said, “As a precaution against Covid-19, our workers are giving sanitisers to the passengers. Adequate arrangement of drinking water has been made at the bus stands. High level of cleanliness is being maintained. Major traffic is on Delhi-Agra, Agra-Varanasi and Agra-Jhansi routes. People of the neighbouring states are being dropped at the borders. Tickets are being issued for only those who are willing to pay. Drivers and conductors have been directed not to harass any passengers who cannot pay.”

A resident of Chityala in Nalgonda district, Sangishetty Upender and his wife of Swetha met Nalgonda SP AV Ranganath and handed over Rs 50,000 to the police welfare fund. Upender, a small trader, said he has high regards for cops who are serving people by braving against all odds despite the coronavirus fear.

Realising the need to help people during the crisis, a farmer from Adilabad made a donation of Rs 50,000 and handed it over to district collector A Sri Devasena. M Hanumanlu said the amount was half of Rs 1 lakh profit that he had made from the soya crop he harvested. “He is a true hero,” said former MP of Nizamabad Kavitha Kalvakuntla, appreciating Hanumalu’s gesture.

Children are not far behind in making donations from their savings. Vicky and Nikki, studying in classes II and V made a donation of Rs 2,518, their father Marpally Sudhakar said. The children from Marpalli village in Vikarabad district received a ‘thank you’ letter from the government.

Kasu Venakata Ramireddy, a self-employed person, donated Rs 500. “Your kind gesture will go a long way in supplementing the efforts of the government in fighting Covid-19,” a letter from the government said.

Srikanth Gundekarla contributed Rs 5,000 and said he did not even hesitate to make the donation. Kiran Gunde chose to donate Rs 1,000 and Nishanth Sappidi contributed Rs 200. “If every citizen donates Rs 2,000, Rs 8,000 crore can be collected, which the government can use to fight Covid-19,” Pavan Kumar, who gave away Rs 2,000, said.

Some people want to contribute their voluntary services and asked how they can help the government. Kalyan urged minister KT Rama Rao to enable international transaction option as they were unable to donate from the US on the CMRF link.

Tea production activities had come to a standstill in the district after the nation went into lockdown mode four days ago.

However, the state government on Saturday said tea manufacturing activities could continue in the district as usual, subject to general restrictions and other safety measures.

B Kumaran, vice-chairman, Tea Board of India, told TOI, “It will surely bring about normalcy in the district. In these difficult times, we should adhere to the government’s plea to stay at home. When Assam and West Bengal governments have limited the tea industry activities to ‘spraying and irrigation’, what is the necessity to allow tea production in the Nilgiris? There cannot be two rules in a nation.”

Ramesh Bhojraj, president, Nilgiris Bought Leaf Factories’ Association told TOI that their factories would continue to remain shut until the lockdown was over. “We know the price we have to pay if we resume operations in the present conditions. So, irrespective of the government guidelines, we will remain shut.”

B Bellie, a small tea grower and tea collection agent, said, “We have been remaining at our houses. Resumption of tea leaves plucking in this time means nothing but inviting risk, which would eventually lead to community spreading of Covid-19.”

321,['29/03/2020'],Women face difficulty in getting hygiene products,"Hubballi: Women in Hubbali-Dharwad and many other places are finding it difficult to get hygiene products because of restrictions on movement and home deliveries and reluctance among a section of men to visit a store and buy the items.

Many men avoid conversations on menstrual health and hygiene because they are not comfortable talking about it or hold outdated opinions on the subject.

However, there are also instances where men stepping out to buy sanitary pads from medical stores are being turned away by police enforcing the three-week lockdown.

“Male members of families are not being allowed to visit medical stores. Some men feel embarrassed and are reluctant to go out for the task,” a homemaker said. “We are running out of sanitary pads and may have to start using home-made cloth pads.”

Vijaya Kulkarni, a working professional, shared an account on Facebook page ‘ Dharwad Bond’. “I found it difficult to get sanitary pads at right time. My husband went to buy them from the pharmacy, but police did not allow him to visit the shop. Finally, I went to the store. My house help faced a similar problem and started using cloth. I gave her some pads.”

Vijaya said many women were struggling with the issue. “We don’t know how long this can go on,” she said.

Purti Sharma, a nutritionist in Dharwad, said if possible, women should buy a month or two months’ worth of supplies as using cloth pads was not advisable.

Ramesh Patthad, an employee of a private firm, said he was on the way to a medical store to buy hygiene products for his wife when police stopped him. “I had never bought it before, so I felt a little embarrassed explaining the purpose of my visit to police,” he said.

Another resident said he waited for other customers at a store to leave and then placed the order.

“It is really difficult situation for women going through menstrual cycle . We usually don’t advise women to use cloth pieces. But if it’s an emergency and they can’t find sanitary pads, they can use pure cotton clothes,” said Dr Kasturi Donimath, a gynaecologist in Hubballi . “We will speak to the district administration for supply of sanitary pads in residential areas at least twice a week.”

As we have also started home delivery of all essential items like vegetables, milk, and groceries, they will no longer require to step outside. We have received a very good response to all the competitions, which will be judged by a team of three senior police officials.”

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday called CM Arvind Kejriwal to know about the situation at Anand Vihar ISBT where thousands of people had walked down hoping to get buses to their hometowns.

Sources said Kejriwal informed the PM that Delhi government had made arrangements for food and shelter and his ministers had been requesting people to go back to their homes, but to no avail. He also told Modi that the spike in crowd was witnessed after UP government announced that it would provide buses at Delhi borders to ferry them.

Kejriwal and deputy CM Manish Sisodia have been urging people leaving the city to stay back. They also made an appeal to them to learn from the situations arising in other countries. At a time when Covid-19 cases are increasing, migrating in huge groups will put them at risk. Sisodia tweeted that the crowd at Anand Vihar also included people who had come from Punjab, Rajasthan and Haryana.

Delhi government provided food to four lakh people in the city on Saturday. Kejriwal asked AAP MLAs to reach out to people in their constituencies and appeal to them not to leave Delhi.

Since the lockdown was announced, people have started marching on foot with their children in tow to their hometowns in UP, Rajasthan, Haryana and Bihar. They are throwing all caution of social distancing to the wind and exposing themselves to novel coronavirus. Since the number of positive cases are rising, the authorities are worried about the vulnerability of such people.

326,['29/03/2020'],Rise in doctors opting for telemedicine,"Slug: Lockdown effectMangaluru: Due to the lockdown imposed by the government, more doctors are opting for telemedicine. There has also been a rise in the number of patients seeking teleconsultation on digital platforms. The Medical Council of India , in consultation with Niti Aayog , have issued telemedicine practice guidelines, enabling registered medical practitioners (RMP) to provide healthcare using telemedicine. This has encouraged many private medical colleges like Nitte Justice KS Hegde Charitable Hospital and Yenepoya Medical College Hospital to offer their services over telephone, and launch telemedicine clinics.Dr Padmanabh Kamath, HoD, cardiology and professor, KMC, was quick to start an online clinic and is using his Facebook page, to answer cardiac related queries. This is a stopgap arrangement owing to the Covid-19 crisis, and is in no way a replacement for seeing a patient who is facing a cardiac emergency. Patients have been requested to post heart related queries on WhatsApp.He said: “We do not know how long this uncertainty will last, but in no way can we deny a patient his right to consult a doctor. This is an attempt to extend technology-based expertise to the patient. A doctor must ensure the patient’s privacy. Prescriptions will be sent in PDF format through email. In the current scenario, it helps the public and doctors to follow social distancing, and not deprive the right of a patient to consult a physician. Also, with rumours being spread with regard to Covid-19, the rates charged for consultation are high, and clinics, crowded OPDs and waiting areas are not possible. From a patient’s perspective, when he sees a doctor talking, it increases his confidence. Patients outside districts or states can stay connected through this approach,” he said.On the first day, 25 patients reached out to Dr Kamath. People wanted to clarify whether cardiac patients were easily prone to Covid-19. They also wanted to know how long they should continue with their medicine, since it is not possible to physically see the doctor. “It is definitely an exercise that boosts morale, and helps cardiac patients seek advice directly from their family doctors. Cardiac patients need not be scared of the coronavirus, but must strictly follow the guidelines and advise as prescribed by the doctors.”Dr Kamath will soon be launching an app called Hrithum, where patients can upload their prescriptions, after which medicines will be delivered at their doorsteps.Dental surgeon Dr Sanjay Nayak said, “For dentistry, the telemedicine option is limited. We are receiving messages on WhatsApp where patients post pictures of their teeth, where the crown has come out, chipping off of a part of a tooth, and swelling or fallen tooth. Right now, it is about giving temporary solutions, like prescribing antibiotics and painkillers. Dentistry, ENT and ophthalmology disciplines are going to be affected due to the lockdown, and returning back to normalcy may take about three months. The good thing is that we can reassure patients, and they in turn can consult a doctor before going in for self-medication. The issue of compensating the doctor too has to be addressed.”The state government has also launched a Covid-19 helpline for patients to talk to doctors.Meanwhile, Bengaluru-based Practo Insights, a healthcare teleconsulting platform, has stated that from March queries regarding fever, cough, cold, sore throat and body ache have increased by 200%. Teleconsultations on Practo are witnessing an average increase of over 100%, week-on-week, and 53% of all general physician e-consultations were related to coronavirus. Most of the queries are from people in the age group of 20-30. Close to 50% of all teleconsultations on the Practo platform are happening from tier-2 and tier-3 cities across India, and peak timings for queries related to fever, cough, and cold are 9am-12pm to 7pm-9pm.",mangaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/rise-in-doctors-opting-for-telemedicine/articleshow/74868037.cms

334,['29/03/2020'],Novel coronavirus may get efficient at infecting humans during early phase: NIV,"Pune: The novel coronavirus — SARS-CoV-2 — can adapt to survive and may become “more efficient” at infecting humans during the “initial phase of its outbreak”, especially when immunity within a population is absent or at its weakest.

But this efficiency and adaptability will only be fully understood once the outbreak ceases and a strong clinico-epidemiological database is made available for researchers and experts to analyse, said scientist-professor Priya Abraham, director of the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, during an exclusive interview with TOI.

“Analysis of the viral genome data, along with the clinico-epidemiologic profiles of cases from whom isolates of the virus were obtained will be able to provide answers to these questions. We are working on it,” Abraham said.

When asked if the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 — referring to its spread over time, which can occur slowly or rapidly — and if its behaviour in India is different from what has been seen in China or Italy, Abraham said a detailed epidemiology was still under “active study”.

“Generally speaking, there are many factors that can contribute to the epidemiology of a virus infection in a country: population density, average age of the population, social behavior, hygiene levels, travel patterns, rate of case reporting, preparedness and containment efforts by a government,” she said.

Abraham added that the rate of virus spread, effectiveness of infection-control practices, weather conditions and human immunity will all also determine how this pandemic plays out in the country. “The rate of spread depends on quarantine and isolation efforts; effective laboratory screening; and adherence to strict infection-control practices, including stringent hand hygiene, cough etiquette, proper doffing (removal or disposal) of medical masks and other personal protective gear,” she said.

“Also, unnecessary travel and use of public transport should be avoided. Avoiding mass gatherings can further reduce community transmissions. Immunity of the individual also plays an important role on the outcome of this infection.”

Her message to the general public was simple: “Follow good hand hygiene and comply with the guidelines that have been issued by our authorities. There is no need to panic.”

She added that people will also need to keep an eye out for symptoms. “Be alert. Seek immediate medical assistance if one feels unwell. Also, ensuring prioritised medical care for persons with underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease is also of paramount importance.”

Not only have all the seed processing and packaging facilities in Telangana, which accounts for 70-80% of India’s seed processing with players like Corteva Agriscience (formerly DowDuPont), Bayer, Shriram Bioseeds, NSL, Kaveri Seeds, UPL, come to a grinding halt, dispatch of processed seeds to farmers nationwide and inbound stocks of seeds, especially maize, are rotting at plants or enroute due to lack of labour and transportation, according to said seed industry. The Federation of Seeds Industry of India (FSII) estimates nearly 3.4 lakh tonnes of seeds are to be processed, packed and transported from south India to rest of India in April and May, including 2.72 lakh tonnes from Telangana.

FSII has sought Union commerce and industry ministry’s intervention in restoring seed production and transport and said the first impact will be felt on cotton cultivation, which begins early May.

“Since the lockdown there is a break in operations of our members plants and transportation. Movement of cotton, maize cobs, hybrid rice seed, jowar seed, bajra seed and vegetables seeds from production areas to plants needs to be taken up on priority to protect the quality of the seed, especially maize,” said FSII director general Ram Kaundinya, adding that seed companies undertook the largest volume of seed production in the just concluded rabi season.“The seed was arriving from fields at plants, where companies were busy cleaning, grading, processing and packing them. The industry will require an estimated 30,000 trucks in the next two months to transport seeds before monsoon arrives, in time for kharif season,” he explained.

Sharad Sharma, ED, Shriram Bioseed Genetics and director, FSII, warned of a severe food supply shortage in the coming year if the issue is not dealt with on priority. Subbarao KV, MD (South Asia), Corteva Agriscience, said the next two months are critical for backend processing to supply seeds in time for the kharif season in June.

Pointing out that the window for seed processing and supply to 29,000 destinations nationwide is these 45-60 days, Sandip Gupta, president, Hyderabad Goods Transport Association, said though central and state governments’ orders are not being implemented at the grassroots level.

BHOPAL: The Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology ( MANIT ) extended the date of submission of project thesis of postgraduate courses after a furore among the students.

The institute had issued a circular on March 26 to submit their thesis by April 30. Students said it would be very difficult to abide by the date given the countrywide lockdown.

Even members of the faculty found the deadline difficult to meet. Thorough groundwork goes into preparing the project, thesis and dissertation. “For this, students need to work in labs. Hardware equipment students will only get in labs. Apart from this, there are some documents that can only be accessed by the local network of MANIT. It is a licensed software. Therefore, students may have difficulty in writing their thesis,” said a faculty, without quoting his name.

Students of various departments of MANIT are doing research work at various institutes across the country. Their internship is also in limbo due to the lockdown. “In such a situation, they cannot even write their thesis until their internship is completed as they are also stuck up at different places,” said a student.

Moreover, after the call for nationwide lockdown, most of the students have left the hostels. They have left the study material back in their hostel rooms. “Academic activities are suspended. If MANIT opens after April 14, then it will take at least three to four days to return,” said another student.

Apart from this, students of undergraduate courses have been asked to submit the project before the end-term examination. They have been told that the examination is likely potentially be held in the first week of May.

When contacted, dean academics, Prof N D Mittal said revised dates will be declared soon.

“It was decided that students can work online. These dates will be revised when new academic calendar will be released,” said Prof Mittal.

We are scared of contracting the virus but we cannot stop working.

Besides, commute by buses is longer as there are several stops and I have to leave home much earlier in the morning,” he says.For Kadam, who lives in Borivli, finding an autorickshaw in the morning helps. “If I don’t get an auto, then it’s a really long walk till the ward office and then to Prem Nagar,” she said. At home, her four-year-old daughter waits eagerly for her to return in the afternoon. “My husband, a chauffeur with a private company, is home looking after our daughter while I work.

341,['29/03/2020'],Gujarat dairies in a quandary over milk surplus owing to decrease in demand,"Villagers continue to deposit milk like normal days at collection centres

VADODARA: The dairy sector in Gujarat is witnessing a peculiar situation in the wake of the current lockdown.

Usually, with the onset of summer, milk procurement starts declining across the state. But Gujarat milk unions, which are members of the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), are witnessing record milk procurement.

“We witness drastic decline in milk procurement during summer which is a lean season. But presently, we are procuring 260 lakh litres per day (LLPD) which is 6-7% more compared to last year. This is happening because milk that was going to the private players is also coming to the co-operatives,” said R S Sodhi, managing director of GCMMF that markets brand Amul.

Ahead of Sunday’s ‘Janta curfew’ and during the initial days of lockdown, Amul had witnessed increased sale of milk and other dairy products registering a rise of 15 to 20% across the state.

“Now, sale of milk products is coming down. Initially, people had resorted to panic buying. From Friday, we are witnessing a decline of nearly 20 % in sales,” said Sodhi, adding that the sale of milk and some other products is likely to witness twists and turns during the remaining days of the lockdown.

In the long term, however, Sodhi foresees a decline of nearly 10% in sale of dairy products. Sale of ice-cream has already witnessed a decline of nearly 50 to 60% while sale of other dairy products like cheese, cream among others are also taking a beating.

“There is 10 to 12% decline in sale of such dairy products due to closure of hotels, restaurants, caterers, eateries and cafeterias among others. Although dairies will compensate during the months of summer, the impact of lockdown will be seen for nearly three months,” Sodhi added.

On Friday night, the Kolhapur police stopped two ambulances and one tempo carrying 18 and 8 passengers, respectively. The ambulance was stopped at Kini toll plaza while the tempo was stopped at Vikaswadi, on the Pune-Bangalore highway.

According to the police, ambulances are exempted from the prohibitory orders. “People are also using motorcycles to travel from Pune and Mumbai to their native places,” a police officer said.

Superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh said, “Action has been taken against the 26 people under the relevant sections of the IPC. We have asked the cops to let vehicles pass through toll plazas only after screening all the passengers and confirming their details.”

Pradeep Kale, police inspector in-charge of Peth Vadgaon police station, said, “The first ambulance travelling from Pune reached Kini toll plaza around 7pm on Friday. We suspected that passengers are travelling in the ambulance. When we checked the vehicle, we found that 8 passengers were sitting inside with their luggage. Two of them had also put on bandages, but they did not have wounds. They were traveling to their hometown in Karnataka. We have detained the passengers and the driver.”

He added, “We also spotted another ambulance at Kini toll plaza at around 11 pm. It was coming from Ahmednagar and was moving towards Karnataka. In this vehicle too we found 9 people, including the driver. They have also been booked.”

Police have booked all the suspects under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of IPC and section 51(B) of National Disaster Management Act, 2005.

“The ambulance drivers had charged each person Rs 5,000 for taking them home,”the officer said.

Tanaji Sawant, police inspector in-charge of the local crime branch (Kolhapur), said, “We have appealed to the people to stay wherever they are till the lockdown continues. We are taking strict measures before allowing the vehicles pass from Kini toll plaza to Kolhapur. We are taking utmost precautions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.”

On Thursday morning, a driver of a milk tanker was detained by police in Satara district after it came to fore that people were being transported in the vehicle. An alert citizen had informed the police after he saw few people getting down from the milk tanker and made a video of the incident.

Though police immediately swung into action and managed to trace the tanker, the people in it were missing. Following this, the driver of the vehicle was detained.

MADURAI: Madras high court has modified the conviction and life sentence awarded to a person by a trial court and directed him to undergo seven years imprisonment in a case where he attempted self-immolation along with both his children in which his six-year-old son died.

The appellant Mayakannan, an alcoholic, was married to Shanthi and the couple along with their children - daughter Rathi and son Ashok - were residing at Thanichiyam village in Madurai district. There were frequent quarrels between the couple due to Mayakannan’s addiction. During one such quarrel, Shanthi took her children and went to her father’s house.

On January 20, 2013, Shanthi left her children at Mayakannan’s sister Kanchana’s house in Vadipatti. Mayakannan came to Kanchana’s house, took his children to his house and attempted self-immolation by pouring kerosene on himself and his children. While Rathi ran away from the house, Mayakannan set fire to himself and his son. In this incident, Mayakannan sustained burn injuries while Ashok died at the hospital few days later.

The Vadipatti police registered a case and arrested Mayakannan. The Madurai I additional district court in 2016 convicted Mayakannan and awarded life sentence under IPC Section 302. Challenging the conviction of the trial court, Mayakannan filed an appeal before the high court Madurai bench in 2018.

Hearing the plea, a division bench of justice P N Prakash and justice B Pugalendhi observed that the entire prosecution case hinges on Rathi’s evidence, who had testified about the whole incident.

The judges also observed that from the evidence of Shanthi, it was clear that after the appellant was released on bail, they reconciled and a son was born to them.

Partially allowing the appeal, the judges set aside the sentence imposed on Mayakannan for offence under IPC section 302 and instead convicted and sentenced him to undergo seven years imprisonment for the offence under IPC section 304(II).

Basavaraj Dollina, a district health supervisor , was on his way to work from home,when he encountered the police at Gandhi Nagar. Basavaraj was stopped by the police, despite wearing his ID card.

Basavaraj said, “I was riding my motorbike when the police stopped me. The moment that a police constable approached me, I showed him my ID card.” However, the police adamantly instructed me to return home, as they had orders from superiors not to allow anyone to move on the road, he said.

Basavaraj said he told the police that he is a government employee at the district health department. “I told them that I am like other health officials who are risking their lives to protect people from coronavirus, and that my services were required in this time of crisis,” he said.

The police constable was not in the mood to listen to him, and started beating him up. Basavaraj alleged that he was beaten for at least ten minutes, because of which his left hand got fractured. He said he was admitted to a hospital after the jurisdictional police sub-inspector came to the spot.

Belagavi city police commissioner Lokesh Kumar said that he is aware of the incident, and that it is unfortunate. He said, “According to my knowledge, the health worker did not show his ID card and there was some verbal spat which led to the incident,” he said.

RAJKOT: Two persons including a married woman committed suicide in Jamnagar on Saturday, allegedly driven by fears over the nationwide lockdown imposed by the central government to contain novel coronavirus spread.

The first case was reported from Gokulnagar locality of Jamnagar, where a 21-year-old carpenter, identified as Kaushik Mandera, hanged himself from the ceiling fan in his house on Saturday morning.

“Mandera used to work as a carpenter in Rajkot. After the outbreak of coronavirus, Mandera had returned to his native Jamnagar, where after the lockdown he was forced to stay indoors. In his suicide note, Mandera said that as he was sick and tired of being confined to his house and therefore decided to end his life,” said R R Verma, investigating officer, Jamnagar C-division police station.

In the second case reported from Dared GIDC adjoining Jamnagar city, a 20-year-old woman, identified as Neha Kathiriya, hanged to death from the ceiling of her house on Friday evening.

Preliminary investigation revealed that Kathiriya was extremely upset after her brother-in-law told her husband over phone from Surat that he along with his family members were coming to their house to stay. They told her husband that due to the lockdown there was no work in Surat.

“Kathiriya feared that her brother-in-law and his family members from Surat might have been infected with Covid-19 and she lodged a strong protest with her husband Piyush. However, he did not accept her demand and said he would welcome the relatives. This drove Kathiriya to take the drastic step,” said H B Pandav, assistant sub-inspector with Jamnagar Panchkoshi B-division police station.

HYDERABAD: Thanks to the lockdown, wild animals that were rarely spotted have started comig back in towns and urban areas in the last few days.In one such instance (on Thursday morning), four Asian palm civets were spotted in a human habitation at Siddipet’s Dubbaka mandal. Similarly, in Kamareddy district, villagers spotted a rusty-spotted cat, one of the smallest wild cat species, and two sloth bears in Kagaznagar town in Asifabad-Kumaram Bheem district.“Civets are nocturnal animals and they usually can’t be seen because they don’t come out during day time at all. It is difficult to spot these animals even if we go in the forests because they are solitary animals. They usually sleep on tall trees during the day to avoid predators and actively forage at night,” said senior forest department official A Shankaran.He said a gaur calf was sighted in one of the villages a couple of days ago. “Gaurs are wild bovine species that usually live in small herds and do not venture out of the forest,” said Shankaran. Forest officials recorded an increase in wild animals crossing roads in Amrabad mandal. They attributed the wildlife sightings to lack of vehicles plying on the roads.“The lockdown is a reminder that animals have always lived in areas that we now call cities. Due to lockdown, people movement is restricted and perhaps animals are getting cues to get active much earlier and even in daytime. Sightings might increase but in any case translocation of animals during this time should not be done and it cannot be termed as rescue but forced displacement,” said Imran Siddiqui, a biologist afounder of city-based Hyderabad Tiger Conservation Society.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74869114,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-665860,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wildlife-sightings-bring-cheer-amid-virus-gloom/articleshow/74868406.cms

“It is my appeal to my fellow Indians. Kindly contribute to the PM-CARES Fund. This fund will also cater to similar distressing situations, if they occur in the times ahead,” the PM tweeted sharing the link through which one can contribute to the fund.

Sharing more details about the Fund, Modi said PM-CARES Fund accepts micro-donations too. “It will strengthen disaster management capacities and encourage research on protecting citizens. Let us leave no stone unturned to make India healthier and more prosperous for our future generations,” he said.

Donations to this Fund will be exempted from income tax under section 80(G). The Prime Minister is the chairman of this trust and its members include ministers of home, finance and defence.

The PM’s appeal yielded immediate response with contributions pouring in. Film actor Akshay Kumar promptly announced a contribution of Rs 25 crore, which was acknowledged by Modi.

“Great gesture @akshaykumar. Let’s keep donating for a healthier India,” Modi said in response to the actor’s declaration.

“This is that time when all that matters is the lives of our people. And we need to do anything and everything it takes. I pledge to contribute Rs 25 crores from my savings to @narendramodi ji’s PM-CARES Fund. Let’s save lives, Jaan hai toh jahaan hai,” Kumar tweeted.

Sharing details about necessity of a Fund dedicated to fight against a situation like Covid-19, the government said the Prime Minister’s Ofice had been receiving spontaneous and innumerable requests for making generous donations to support the government in the wake of this emergency.

“Distress situations, whether natural or otherwise, demand expeditious and collective action for alleviating the suffering of those affected, mitigation/control of damage to infrastructure and capacities etc,” the government said adding, “Therefore, building capacities for quick emergency response and effective community resilience has to be done in tandem with infrastructure and institutional capacity reconstruction/enhancement.”

The government said the Fund was set up keeping in mind the need for having a dedicated national fund with the primary objective of dealing with any kind of emergency or distress situation, like the one posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, and to provide relief to the affected.

“PM Narendra Modi has always believed and shown in actions that public participation is the most effective way to mitigate any issue and this is yet another example. This fund will enable micro-donations as a result of which a large number of people will be able to contribute with smallest of denominations,” the government said.

It said citizens and organisations can go to the website —pmindia.gov.in —and donate to PM CARES Fund using the following details:

Even though there are no restaurants open and no app-based food delivery at home, many of us are surviving the lockdown with an array of delish meals. While mother’s time-tested recipes have come to the rescue of many, several chefs are also using social media to post recipes one can try at home.

Chef getting men to cook!

Ahmedabad-based businessman, Vishal Amin , who has always been fond of cooking and has a sizable fan-following on social media, has taken the lockdown as an opportunity to encourage men to cook. “Cooking has conventionally been a woman’s role in the family but it is time equality prevails in that sphere too,” said Amin. “While a lot of men do cook, most don’t and some don’t know how to. So lockdown is the time when men can utilise the down time more creatively. Over the past 15 days, I’ve been busy on Instagram posting recipes and cooking tips that people can try at home.”

Simple meals cooked with love

Vadodara-based celebrity chef and entrepreneur, Shagun Mehra, has been busy responding to the messages she has received from her friends and fans thanking her for the recipe of rice ‘bhakhri’ or ‘kadhi patta’ lemonade. For Mehra, who is currently living in Goa, this is not her usual practice. Since the lockdown, Mehra has been making simple meals and sharing videos of her making these dishes along with her daughter on her Facebook page. “Since I have this talent, I think of it as a service while sitting at home and also motivating people to cook staples that they have,” she said. “I am also including my 11-year-old daughter so that people can understand the cooking is a family activity,” she added.

Italian and Chinese delights

The head chef at the plush weekend address hotel on the Surat-Dumas Road, Pintu Biswas, has taken this opportunity to connect with the people on social media with his mouth-watering easy-to-make delicacies. “When people are literally under house arrest due to lockdown, I thought of sharing easy-to-cook recipes on social media.”

Harsha Shroff, a celebrity chef providing consultancy to many hotels in the city said, “This is very critical period for the people when they are under lockdown. To get their minds off the virus, I am sharing recipes on Whatsapp and FB,” Shroff said. “Right from Gujarati dishes to Chinese and Italian, there are lot of recipes people can learn when they are locked up in their houses.”

The company has cited the “devastating effect” the coronavirus pandemic has had on commercial aviation and the travel industry fir its decision. Fareportal employees claimed that the company had terminated the services of around 500 employees across the country.

Almost all the employees had joined Fareportal less than a month ago. Between March 24 and 25, the company’s HR department called up these employees and asked them to submit their resignations citing personal reasons.

“I was literally forced to either resign on my own accord or face termination. I just didn’t know what to do. Soon, I started getting messages from colleagues about similar calls they had received from office,” a 30-year-old Fareportal employee said. Hailing from Nepal, the woman is now worried how she would pay her room rent and the fact she can’t even go back home.

In its notice, the American firm allegedly invoked clause 10A of the contract, which apparently states that for those in probation period , the company can at any point terminate or take action against them. “First they said if we resign on our own, we’ll get our salary till March 31. They gave us only a few hours to respond. Many didn’t even get any calls,” said Nabil Ahmad, who had joined just two weeks ago.

Officials in the HR department have switched off their phones. However, TOI managed to contact one of them, but he declined to comment saying he was not authorised to speak on the matter. The company’s PR head, Kathi Moore, however, cited decisions by a few other companies. “Marriott has laid off 4,000 employees and warned they might have to cut tens of thousands more. Norwegian Air has laid off 50% of the workforce,” he said.

According to municipal commissioner Mallinath Kalshetti, a man recently returned from Pune to Kolhapur before the lockdown was announced last week. He neither turned up for the screening conducted by the administration, nor did he divulge his travel details to the authorities.

The man’s swab sample was sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), in Pune on Wednesday. The results declared on Thursday revealed that he tested positive for the contagion. He is currently undergoing treatment in institutional quarantine.

“We will bring all the people who have come from abroad or from high-risk cities under institutional quarantine. They will be looked after by our health staff. We have already set up beds in our hospitals. Now, many private hospitals have also offered their infrastructure for institutional quarantine,” said Kalshetti.

Hoteliers too are ready to provide rooms for the quarantine process. Kalshetti has given the option to the concerned people to either stay in institutional quarantine or confine themselves to the rooms identified in various hotels. “The hotels will take a nominal charge. All that they (identified people) have to do is not move out or come in contact with others. Their hands will be stamped with the number of days they have to be in quarantine,” said the civic chief.

Meanwhile, several complaints are emerging from the area where the confirmed case has been reported, which has been earmarked following the identification of the case. Locals claimed they have not been allowed to step out of their houses or societies to buy milk and other daily essentials.

30 people from the housing society, where the first case has been reported, have been compulsorily put in home-quarantine as they came in contact with the confirmed patient. Kalshetti said that five relatives of the patient, whose swab samples have been sent for testing, have been put in institutional quarantine.

“We have set up teams under local corporators to look into the concerns of the people in their wards. We have provided the details of the local grocers after consulting with the retailers. Only thing people have to do is to dial them and the essentials will reach their doorstep,” said Kalshetti.

Jha said they are receiving complaints that during the lockdown people gather in large numbers in the common plots of housing societies. “This also can cause spread of the virus infection and action will be taken against those gathering in large numbers in society common plots,” Jha added.

“Our drones will fly over societies to see if people are gathering. Action will be taken against them,” said Jha.

355,['29/03/2020'],Gujarat: Worst brings out the best in these pregnant doctors,"Dr Dimple Pandya visits a home in Porbandar

RAJKOT: Until four days ago , Dr Dimple Pandya and Dr Manali Bhatt were tirelessly working in the field, visiting homes and examining suspected Covid-19 patients in Porbandar. While many medical officers across the state have been assigned this duty, what makes their case precarious is that both are pregnant.

While Dr Pandya is expecting a baby next month, Dr Bhatt is four months pregnant. Despite the threat of infection looming large, this valiant moms-to-be are in no mood to take leave now, especially at a time when the administration is in the dire need of capable hands owing to the lockdown.

The duo were visiting homes of suspected cases based on the list prepared by female health workers. They had to examine people with Covid-like symptoms and recommend medication, hospitalization or quarantine. She also had to scan those people who were entering the city including crew members at the Porbandar port and train or bus passengers.

Both of them work for the Rashtriya Bal Swasthay Karyakram and their duty includes examining primary school students in the villages. However, looking at the demand for doctors and health workers due to the pandemic, they were shifted to work with the district health department.

In all, there were 22 suspected cases of Covid-19 in Porbandar district and 21 have tested negative while report of one is pending. Also, 115 are in home quarantine in the district, said V K Advani, district development officer.

Looking at their pregnancy, especially Dr Pandya’s who is eight-months pregnant, the duo have been allotted office work now.

Talking to TOI, Pandya said, “I don’t want to stop working now. Senior officials shifted me to office work looking at the high risk of infection, but I will work till my health permits me and serve my country.”

Her office work isn’t simple either as she has to be on the alert all day replying to phone calls of people and also preparing reports to be sent to the state health department. Her job also entails providing information to the doctors in the field.

Her dedication to duty has, however, not gone wasted as people appreciate her for her yeoman services. “When I was in the field and examining a patient, his relatives came to me and thanked me profusely for doing my job in the villages despite my personal condition,” said Pandya.

Dr Bhatt added, “My job is to visit people under home quarantine and observe their condition and report it to the higher officials. I have been also asked to shift to office work but I am available for whatever work assigned to me by seniors in this critical time,” asserted Bhatt.

Appreciating their work, district health officer A G Rathod said: “Both women are doing a really good job in these testing times. We appreciate their dedication, and for providing inspiration to the other staff members.”

HYDERABAD: A five-foot-long rat snake was rescued from Cyberabad commissioner VC Sajjanar’s house on Saturday morning. On spotting the snake, Sajjanar alerted Venkatesh Naik, a police constable from Hussaini Aalam Police station. Naik is an expert snake- rescuer and has rescued hundreds of snakes in the last 10 years.

“Fearing that the snake might be killed by others, the commissioner immediately called for rescue. The snake might have sneaked into the house from the garden. Rat snakes are very common in the city and are non-venomous,” Naik said, after rescuing the snake. Naik will be handing over the snake to Nehru zoological park. Sajjanar also rewarded Naik for the good work.

Sajjanar appealed to public to not kill snakes. He said citizens must alert Friends of Snakes Society or forest department on spotting snakes.

357,['29/03/2020'],Mumbai's packed chawls gear up to keep coronavirus at bay,"MUMBAI: To people zipping along Western Express Highway (WEH), Shivprerna chawl, a block of 15 kholis would seem no different from its neighbourhood huts and slums that skirt the south-west border of Mumbai airport.But to enter or exit this chawl, you need to fill a visitors’ register, a book placed on a steel stool at the sole point of entry, manned by a local resident, wearing a mask. You enter your name, mobile number, reason and time of visit, and only then will the ‘immigration officer’ let you enter.The chawl is part of the sprawling Rajendra Prasad Nagar airport slums that houses 8,000. It’s one of the few measures put in place by the airport slum’s ‘ coronavirus samiti, formed by members of their local Navratri and Ganapati mandals, early this week to keep Covid-19 from encroaching their settlements.“The samiti decided to scan log entries every 2-3 days for repeat offenders, people who keep on stepping out and violating curfew. Only one person per household can go out to buy essentials,’’ says Rupchandra Mandavkar, a samiti member. “Other chawls and slums in Rajendra Prasad Nagar will follow this model in few days,’’ he said. Among the other decisions taken by their 25-member core samiti, that functions out of a WhatsApp group, is to send workers who cleaned public toilets and lanes on leave. “We have taken up cleaning jobs to ensure no outsiders enter our chawl. The women who work as domestic help have stopped going out. We spoke to some disgruntled employers and convinced them. Vegetable and fruit vendors, gas cylinder suppliers are called in so that our residents don’t have to step out and go up to crowded Vile Parle station road to buy that,’’ he added.Most of these dwellers live in 100 sq ft kholis, packed so tightly that sunlight breaks in only over its narrow, winding lanes. Each kholi is shared by four to six family members, making even metaphorical social distancing impossible. As if to drive the point home, Mahesh Pardule, an insurance agent, who lives in Walter Misquita chawl, part of Rajendra Prasad nagar slums, stressed, “Not average of 4-6 members per family okay. Minimum of 4-6 members sharing a 100-200 sq ft home.’’The scene will repeat in each of Mumbai’s slums that house over 48 lakh people or 40% of the city’s population, according to the 2011 census. “From coronavirus outbreak point of view, it is critical to note that 40% of Mumbai lives in slums that occupy only 18% of Mumbai’s land,’’ said Paraj Alavani, MLA from Vile Parle, highlighting the role population density could play in spread of the virus in Mumbai. Of all battlegrounds around the world where a war against the highly contagious respiratory disease is under way, Mumbai perhaps is the only one with half its population standing as dominoes stacked too close to each other.At Bandarpakhadi and Renuka Nagar slums in Kandivli (W), the seriousness of a possible Covid-19 outbreak has steeped in and people have honoured the curfew, have avoided crowding when buying essentials, said local corporator Pratibha Girkar. But not at Abhilakh nagar, a slum of 10,000 residents along Link road. “There is a crowded market road, packed with vendors. Hawking has been decentralised, with the help of Kandivli (W) police. Each hawker is allowed to vend only on alternate days, onion-potato carts that attract most crowds have been segregated from those selling vegetables and buyers have to stand metres apart,’’ Girkar said.The curfew has not worked at some airport slums too, though their ‘corona samiti’ had Vile Parle airport police visit the place and blare out warnings on a speaker on Friday evening. But given the size of slum rooms and number of people who share it, it’s no surprise that a full house happens only during meals and at night. “People come out to chat. Every chawl has 2-3 groups. They have dedicated locations, it’s a force of habit. By evening it’s an all-out jatra (fair),’’ rued Pardule.With failure of social distancing, what most slums are banking on is sodium hypochlorite solution, used as a common household disinfectant since 18th century. BMC ’s insecticide officer approved its use, but only where Covid positive patients are reported. But in many Mumbai slums, disinfection has begun.Then, there are those where starvation continues to be a bigger threat than any virus. Raju Korde, from Dharavi Redevelopment Committee, said their 12-15 lakh residents are concerned with feeding 10,000-odd workers who work in small manufacturing units. “They eat and sleep in these units, which are temporarily closed now, so there is no food. These migrants can’t go back as trains and buses have stopped,’’ Korde said. “We might die of corona, but no one should die of starvation,’’ he said.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74870664,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-305335,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/packed-chawls-gear-up-to-keep-coronavirus-at-bay/articleshow/74868272.cms
358,['29/03/2020'],Madurai: Businessman with no travel history tests positive,"Representative Image

MADURAI: A 60-year-old businessman from Rajapalayam in Virudhunagar district tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday. Health minister C Vijayabaskar confirmed it in his official twitter handle on Saturday evening. The minister stated that the man is undergoing treatment in the isolation ward at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) in Madurai and his condition is stable. This takes the number of people who tested positive for Covid-19 in the southern districts to five.

Virudhunagar district collector R Kannan said that the man does not have any recent travel history abroad. “We have identified 71 people including his family, friends and others who were in close contact with him during the last two weeks and have been kept under home quarantine. The source of his infection is unknown,” the collector said and added that identification of more people is still under way.

His wife, son, daughter and daughter-in-law are doctors. As the man frequently showed symptoms of fever, the family grew suspicious and took a CT scan on March 26, which revealed that he had lung infection. “They took him to the Rajapalayam hospital on Thursday and then to the hospital in Madurai, where samples were taken for testing on Friday. His family is already under home quarantine,” Kannan said.

Their worst fear is that whether the infection had spread during the wedding of the man’s son that took place in Madurai on March 5, three weeks before he started developing strong symptoms. The wedding was attended by nearly 1,500 people. Till the first week of March he had travelled to Madurai and Tirunelveli districts to invite his relatives and friends for the wedding. Efforts are also on to find out whether he had contacted anyone who had recently travelled abroad.

Health and revenue officials of Virudhunagar and Madurai are clueless on tracking those who attended the wedding, which would be a herculean task. “According to government guidelines, we will begin screening houses within three kilometre radius from the patient’s house. The area will be divided into clusters of 50 houses. A health or revenue department staff will be assigned for each sector,” the collector said.

Residents within the three kilometre radius will be screened for fever, cough or breathing difficulty.

359,['29/03/2020'],‘Corona’s lover’ awaits violators in Kanyakumari,"Kanyakumari: “Who is corona’s lover?” is one of the 10 questions in the questionnaire titled Kanyakumari District Police Covid-19 Awareness Test – I that was prepared by the police for youth caught loitering in streets during the lockdown. Around 200 youths have taken up the test over the last two days.

For each wrong answer, they have to do 10 squats (thoppukaranam) as punishment. After the test, which aims to enlighten them on the magnitude of the Covid-19 crisis, they are made to take an oath to abide by the government’s lockdown. The questionnaire is now being fast circulated on social media.

“The questionnaire is to enlighten the youth who have not taken the lockdown seriously. Everywhere videos of the police beating the violators are being circulated. Such beating only makes the violator angry and he does not realise the purpose of the stringent enforcement by the police,” said Thuckalay DSP M Ramachandran.

The police came out with the alternate approach to make violators understand the reason behind implementating the lockdown. The questionnaire begins with a question about the country where Covid-19 first spread. The question on corona’s lover is the second one aimed at arousing the curiosity of the violator and make them go to the next questions, he said.

“Though it is not that difficult, none has answered the lover question correctly. We are planning to announce the answer to that question post April 14 when the lockdown comes to an end. At the most, the violators have got eight marks out of 10 and the average is six,” the DSP said.

Questions for which most of them gave wrong answers include on social distancing, the country most affected for not abiding by the lockdown and which part of the body the virus affects. After punishment (squats), the police tell them how Covid-19 affected people in Italy.

As the questionnaire has been “leaked,” the police are planning to prepare another one with a set of 10 true or false questions.

Patil’s order comes in the wake 23 positive patients being reported from Islampur and one of their relative from Kolhapur. Patil held a review meeting with the local administration on Saturday.

In the first step, the administration cordoned off the area, where these patients reside. However, later, the entire town was closed off.

Officials said that only one person from one family will be allowed to come to the streets with proper identification card. The person will be allowed to leave home only to purchase essential commodities. Stern action would be taken against those who move around without authentic identity, officials said.

District collector Abhijit Chowdhary has asked the police to have stringent check of all the vehicles, which were coming in the district despite sealing of the borders. The order has been issued as administration has noticed that large number of people were coming to the district by vehicles, which were involved in transportation of essential commodities. Collector has asked to act against vehicle driver and owner and the people travelling in the vehicle.

Through another order, Chowdhary has ordered industrial establishments to provide all the essentials to the employees, who are from outside Maharashtra,

This order is also applicable to the cane cutting workers, who have migrated to Sangli district because of crushing season of the sugar mills. The order has been issued to ensure that cane cutting labour do not travel to their native places.

The decision came after police struggled to control the crowd at the makeshift markets set up in Nehru Ground , Old Bus Stand and New Bus Stand on Friday. The squares and circles drawn at these places to ensure social distancing failed to discipline people. On Saturday, residents purchased vegetables from pushcarts and vans in their vicinity without any chaos.

Police here have been acting strict on the violators of lockdown norms . Those found loitering on the streets on Saturday were promptly asked to return home. Only those venturing out due to compelling reasons were allowed to proceed. Police have placed barricades using bamboos in many parts of the city to prevent the movement of vehicles .

NGOs and former HDMC members on Saturday distributed food among security guards, civic workers and beggars on the streets.

And so, when the lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19 was announced, her first thoughts turned to the children who will be celebrating their birthdays without the fanfare and the mandatory cake.“While growing up in Kolkata, I remember celebrating birthdays without a cake. For children, it can be very disappointing. I live by myself and I like to bake, so I have all the basic ingredients available with me. And I thought of sending out a message offering to bake a cake for any child who has his or her birthday during the lockdown period,” said Mishra, who has received requests to bake cakes for two children with their birthdays on March 31 and April 5.In a period when supplies are limited, Mishra has promised to make the cake as ‘fun-looking’ as possible with the available ingredients.Rather than payment, due to the shortage and inaccessibility, Mishra has told the parents to bring her some white flour or maida, if possible. This will ensure she has enough to bake the next cake for any child in need.“I am highly diabetic and can't step out as my immunity is very low. I will bake the two cakes I have been asked to, now let us see how they manage to pick it up,” said Mishra.A resident of Altinho-Panaji, Raunak Hede turned 18, amidst the lockdown, on March 25.As he was busy preparing for his now postponed Class XII ICSE exam, his architect parents Rajini and Roheet did their best to make the day memorable for him.“We sent out an invite to friends and relatives to join in via Zoom, so they could sing while we cut the cake. They had to use a password to be connected. I baked the cake at home from scratch. Since he had his exams we had anyway not planned anything big, and were supposed to celebrate once all his board and entrance exams are over. But since everyone was at home, we thought we will get them to join in online ,” said Rajini.“It was nice, it was different,” said Raunak.Santa Cruz-resident Lucy Mergulhao celebrated her birthday on Thursday and said that it was the first time in her life that she was unable to begin the day by attending mass at Church.“I used to make it a point to take our son out for at least one meal on my birthday.

A district health official said the couple, who had gone to meet their relatives in Islampur, was admitted to civil hospital on Friday. “They were identified after the administration undertook an exercise to trace people with whom the Islampur family had met after their return from Saudi Arabia.

The couple was kept in the isolation ward of the civil hospital even though they did not show any symptoms.

“Their swab samples, which were sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV) on Friday, tested negative on Saturday. The couple has been advised home-quarantine,” he said.

In another case, the reports of two boys – a three-year-old and 15-year-old – admitted to Krishna Charitable Trust hospital in Karad came negative. “Their swab samples were taken as they were suffering from cough and fever. Their report came negative,” district civil surgeon Amol Gadikar said.

Earlier, Satara had registered its first positive case on March 23, the same day when four positive cases came to light in Sangli district. The first patient from Satara was a 45-year-old woman who had returned from Dubai on March 22.

The second patient, a 63-year-old man, was identified on March 24. He had come back from California. His wife was also tested for Covid-19 but the result came negative.

In Satara district, 30 suspected cases were reported, of which two have tested positive. The district administration has discharged 24 patients who were kept in isolation. However, they have been advised home quarantine.

As many as 425 people with travel history have been checked so far and all of them are under surveillance. Of these, 246 people have been asked to observe home quarantine.

Satara district collector Shekhar Singh has appealed to NGOs and volunteers to register their names with the administration for better coordination in carrying out the relief work. They have been asked to contact on toll-free helpline number 1075 for registration.

Singh, who has been made the district in-charge for monitoring measures being taken to contain the spread of coronavirus , also said workers who stay in these shelter homes would be given cooked food.He told TOI that officials from the administration and Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon ( MCG ) have been directed to ensure better accommodation and arrangements to feed the workers. “We have already set up shelter homes and relief camps at IMT-Manesar, Sohna, Bhim Nagar and Kadipur. They have a capacity to accommodate over 600 people. Night shelters can also be used to house these workers if the need arises,” he said.Asked about food, one of the main concerns of daily wage labourers, he said: “At the camps and shelter homes that we are setting up, these workers will be provided cooked food. At the same time, those staying in slums will also be given ration and other essential items by the MCG and administration.” He said the government was using the labour welfare funds for the well-being of the migrant workers and discussing with departments concerned how they can be utilised in a better way.But keeping the workers inside shelter homes would be easier said than done as most daily wagers have been insisting on getting home somehow in the wake of an uncertainty surrounding their jobs. Officials monitoring these shelter homes and relief camps will also have to ensure that social distancing is maintained, which, otherwise, threatens to defeat the purpose that this lockdown aims to achieve.Singh said he had directed officials to ensure that migrant workers get to talk to their family members at home. Several helplines have been launched, he said, not only for migrant workers but also for residents to reach out to the administration in case of emergencies.Asked about supply of essential items, Singh said the deputy commissioner and his team were conducting regular checks to ensure there is no shortage of groceries and medicines. “Shopkeepers have been directed not to sell items above the MRP. Such violations can be reported to the district administration and MCG,” he said.On allegations of police excesses hampering deliveries, the MP said, “The police are doing their duty in a challenging situation. They are acting with caution to ensure that permission for movement is not misused.”Deputy commissioner Amit Khatri also appealed to workers not to panic and assured them of full support. “A shelter home was built on the Delhi-Jaipur Highway near IMT-Manesar on Friday night. About 350 people have been provided accommodation there. At the same time, they will get cooked food,” Khatri said.Initially, a shelter home was set up on the campus of the Government Girls Senior Secondary School in Manesar, but as it a little far from the highway, few people showed interest in going there.

372,['29/03/2020'],Hotel shelters 5 amid Covid-19 lockdown,"Hyderabad: At a time when many landlords and hostel owners are apprehensive about retaining their tenants, for fear of contracting the coronavirus, a hotel in Shamshabad has opened its doors to guests stranded in the city following the nationwide lockdown.

With all domestic connections suspended and borders sealed, the Airport Palace Hotel — not too far away from the RGIA police station — has sheltered two families and an airline captain, providing them with essential services. Among them is an elderly couple from Visakhapatnam, who recently returned from Kerala after attending an Ayurvedic treatment camp.

“Initially, we were a little apprehensive about staying open as most hotels in Hyderabad have pulled their shutters down. But then we realised these people have nowhere to go and it would be inhuman on our part to evict them,” said Ram Chander, owner of the property.

Apart from the rooms, he has also stationed one staff at the hotel who can run errands for the guests particularly in times of medical emergency. There is also a cook who plates up three meals a day. “While we are charging a fee, it is a nominal rate. We decided to forgo profits at such a time,” Chander said.

Apart from the sexagenarians, there’s another young couple from Rajahmundry, who were on their way home from Ahmedabad when the lockdown was announced. The airline crew is from Mumbai. “Though we aren’t being able to provide any luxuries, we are making sure they get all that’s absolutely required,” Chander said.

Kumar Raju, who helped the elderly couple find accommodation here, is all praises for the hotel. “I am really thankful to the hotel staff for taking such good care of my friend’s parents. I get restless and worried at times. But then I know they are in good hands. I just pray they can reach home safely, soon,” said Raju.

Station manager Rajinder Negi told TOI on Saturday that they are updating their audience regularly with Covid-19 specific news . “Our main focus is on providing daily updates regarding the lockdown and what all essential services are available. We are regularly updating our listeners with the announcements of the district administration. If there is some scheme or service being provided by the district administration, we are promptly passing in on to the people,” Negi said.“We record interviews of doctors and health experts and use them in our shows. Their points are informative and help our audience to be more aware of Covid-19. We also take questions from our listeners and try to answer them in our programmes. Currently, most of our programmes are related to Covid-19, but in between, we do insert some entertainment shows as stress-busters,” Negi added.Another community radio named ‘Kumaonvani Community Radio’ based in Nainital district is playing a similar role. The radio’s station manager told TOI that they are making sure that their listeners are not becoming victims of fake news on social media. “A lot of fake news related to Covid-19 is being circulated on various social media platforms. The sad part is that a lot of people believe in it. They don’t cross-check. This leads to a lot of panic. We are trying hard to bust such fake news and have asked our listeners to read authentic information being provided in the newspapers,” said Mohan Karki, the station manager. When asked about the condition of revenue in such trying times, Manvendra Negi at 'Mandakini Ki Awaaz Community Radio' in Rudraprayag district said, “Private advertisements have completely stopped. It was natural since the local shopkeepers are not operating much. But, the good part is that there has been a little increase in the advertisements from the state government.

KOLKATA: The five Covid-19 patients, who tested positive in Nadia’s Tehatta on Friday, were brought to ID Hospital in Beliaghata on Saturday afternoon. Treatment had started on the five—two sisters and their children, aged nine months, six years and 11 years.

“Our Covid-19 medical team conducted a thorough check-up on the five after they reached our hospital. All of them, including the three kids, are fine with no severe symptom. They are now in our isolation cabin,” said ID Hospital principal Anima Haldar.

The five have been put in a big isolation cabin, as the two women have to be with their kids. “We had included a paediatrician in the medical team handling Covid-19 patients even before we started getting kids testing positive. The paediatrician is very dedicated and hence, the three children would get the best medical care,” the principal told TOI.

One sister and her family now live in Uttarakhand’s Uddham Nagar and the other in Delhi. One of their relatives in Delhi had returned from the UK on March 16 and all the five, with other family members, had attended a get-together at his place. The man subsequently tested positive for Covid-19. Health department officials have traced the five’s source of contact to this relative.

After the get-together, the two sisters and their kids reached Kolkata by Rajdhani on March 20. From there, they took Lalgola Passenger and then an auto to their Tehatta home. They were to attend the death anniversary of a relative on Friday. Given that the sisters now lived in Delhi and Uttarakhand, district health officials claimed the five were not Tehatta residents.

Home department officials have identified 16 people from Tehatta who came in contact with the five. Eight are in New Town quarantine centre and the rest in home isolation.

As the five travelled in a reserved compartment on Rajdhani, health officials said tracing those sharing the coach would be easy, but it would be a mammoth task to identify co-passengers on the local train to Bethuadahari. “We are trying to trace the auto driver and others they came in contact with in Tehatta. We have asked the authorities to identify the local train passengers and gave out the coach and seat numbers,” said Nadia deputy CMOH II Asit Kr Dewan.

Late on Friday, the man ran out naked and bit Natchiammal on her throat as she was sleeping outside her home in Baktha Seva Street near his house. Hearing her cries, neighbours rushed in and overpowered the man. They tied his hands and legs and that was when they noticed the home quarantine mark on his hand.Soon, Kana Vilakku police arrived at the spot and took him to the station. He has been booked for murder but the action would be initiated based on the recommendations of the health department, said police sources. He has been admitted to the Theni government hospital. The woman who was admitted to the same hospital succumbed to her injuries on Saturday morning.The incident has brought up the importance of assessing the mental health of people in quarantine, says the nodal officer for Tamil Nadu’s mental health programme Dr C Ramasubramanian. Such abnormal behaviour including the recent suicide in Pudukottai by a man who was forced by relatives to self-isolate makes it important to assess the mental health of these patients before they are quarantined, he said. ``Any person kept in isolation has to be counselled and his history of medication taken into account,’’ he said. ``We have to take psychological aspects into consideration before quarantine,’’ he said. Periodical counselling must also be given during the period of quarantine.A sudden sedentary lifestyle will result in sensory deprivation and they will start experiencing an emptiness syndrome. Hence, they should be provided avenues to help overcome it like visual media, books and video calls with family members if isolated.Similarly, if a person was suffering from psychiatric problems, drug or alcohol addiction, the sudden unavailability of medicines, drugs or alcohol can lead to severe withdrawal symptoms. “They would first become sleepless and restless. And they would show lack of interest in food, and later become suspicious and violent. Usually, they become violent to people who are near them, this particular case is very abnormal,” he said.",madurai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74869411,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-135478,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/quarantined-man-runs-out-naked-bites-woman-90-to-death/articleshow/74868116.cms

The health directorate of railways has also issued instructions to the zones to engage retired doctors at divisional, production units and at headquarters level for different hospitals for one month as per local requirement. It has said first preference may be given to retired railways doctors who are below 65 years.Engagement of these contract medical practitioners (CMPs) will be over and above the vacancy to contain the spread of Covid–19 pandemic.While converting a sleeper coach into an isolation cabin , the middle berth has been removed from one side and all the three berths have been removed in front of the patient’s berth.Since isolation wards need full ventilation, sleeper coaches with open windows are the best option, officials said. The details shared by railways showed that there is a provision of air curtains in the compartment.To meet the requirement, bathrooms and aisle areas have been modified. Bathrooms have been created by renovating toilets and electrical modifications done for medical instruments. The other modifications include removal of all ladders which are used for climbing up to the middle and upper berths, 230V sockets in each cabin and plastic curtains.In a tweet, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal shared some of photographs of the prototype unit.

“Many people from Odisha are stranded in various states and some may be in distress. I requested the chief ministers to assist them with the help of the local administrations. Now, I request all the Odia associations in various states to come forward to help their fellow Odias,” Naveen appealed in a pre-recorded video message.

Naveen also said whatever cost the organisations incur while taking care of the stranded Odias will be reimbursed by the state government from the chief minister’s relief fund if they provide bills. A number of videos have recently emerged in which workers and pilgrims from Odisha were seen requesting the state government to help them return home. In many such videos they were seen saying that they have to go without food, water and shelter.

The government has already set up 24x7 helpline numbers (0674-2392115, 9438915986) in the state home department to help those who are stranded in various states. Every year thousands of people from Odisha migrate to states like New Delhi, Haryana, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala in search of livelihood. While nearly 80,000 Odias have returned so far, many others are stuck in different parts of the country.

The state labour department has also been in touch with 9000 workers from other states stranded in different parts of Odisha. They are being provided with food, shelter and in some cases healthcare services. The respective state governments have been informed about their safekeeping. The labour department has also set up a helpline number (18003456703) to help those stranded in Odisha due to the lockdown.

Zafar Khan, president of SHCA, said “All principals in our group were very clear right from the start that we need to do everything in our power and held poor families. When there is a talk of lockdown, it is obvious that people will be worried about running out of provisions and not having money to buy more. The ones from poor families are the most affected by this crisis.”

Voluntary donations from principals has helped fund the corpus which is being used to procure, pack and distribute the ‘food kit’. This contains 5kg each of rice and wheat, sugar, oil, masur daal, tur daal, basic Indian spices along with onions and potatoes.

Dilip Bose, secretary of SHCA, said “This food kit provides ample material for a small family to be able to sustain themselves through the lockdown period. Most of the daily wagers cannot survive unless they go out and earn. The migrant workers are also badly hit, so we want to play a small role in making their lives a bit easier.”

Retired education officer NA Thamke too took to the streets and distributed food kits in various slum areas. Thamke said, “Even before retirement, I started working for social causes where we work with over 600 families who come from very extremely poor economic strata of society. So, I already had the connect and reach for me to go through with the distribution of food packets to them.”

Thamke also follows social distancing while handing out food packets and advises people to touch the packet after a while. Thame said, “We must follow government guidelines regarding coronavirus as it’s for our benefit. I try to educate the recipients too about this during donation drives.”

Addressing the media, Sawang said 4,005 cases have been booked against lockdown violators and 6,571 vehicles have been seized in the last four days.

When asked about cops lathicharging people for violating lockdown orders, the DGP acknowledged that though there have been such cases, there is a higher number of instances in which people have attacked police. “Being nice in these tough times is a challenge for the police personnel. Police too are human beings and there are instances where they get vexed after people fight with them resulting in few instances,” he said.

Sawang continued, “some of the instances have gone viral and I don’t deny the fact that it is wrong.” The DGP urged the public to cooperate with police to avoid stringent action and warned that violators would be booked under the Disaster Management Act. He added that there have been around 320 calls to ‘dial 100’ from neighbours of foreign returnees claiming that those under quaratntine are flouting guidelines.

382,['29/03/2020'],Ekm sets up online platform to deliver essential items,"KOCHI: In a major relief to the public who is facing hardships in procuring essential goods, district administration, in association with some private firms, is arranging an online platform for delivery of essential commodities like grocery, rice and vegetables. Though three or four firms have already approached the district administration with the proposal to ensure door-to-door supply of essential commodities, the authorities have given approval for only one firm so far.

District collector S Suhas said that others will also be given approval if their proposals seem to be satisfactory. “The role of the district administration is to facilitate the project and act as a platform for offering the services. We expect that the project will help allay the concerns of the public in purchasing essential commodities. The plan is to use the service of autorickshaw drivers for home delivery,” Suhas said.

The firm which has already secured the approval will be supplying the goods at maximum retail price (MRP) and there will be no delivery charges. The private firm is developing a mobile application for facilitating the public to order essential commodities. “The district administration has offered all the support. We have also sought the support from MLAs in each assembly constituencies for making space available in their segments for stocking the products. We have a big godown at Angamaly. Now, we are arranging localized stockyards in each constituency so as to ensure hassle-free and speedy supply. Some of the manufacturers also have offered to provide us goods,” said Sunil Varghese of Daily Farm Fresh, the private firm which has secured nod from the authorities for offering online services.

The private firm has entered into tie up with some bulk suppliers and supermarkets to procure essential goods. “One of the supermarket owners has offered to provide us around 2,000 items. In the wake of difficulties in transporting goods from other states, the stock in the supermarkets and shops can be a relief for us. We will be supplying chicken, eggs, etc. from our farms also,” Varghese said. “The public can place orders online or can call up. If they make a call, we will note down the names of items. Payment can be made either online or in cash at the time of delivery. Once the order is placed, we will ensure supply the next day itself,” he said.

Autorickshaw drivers will be imparted training on sanitization and how to distribute items in a safe manner. “In the corporation limits, we may require at 10 autorickshaw drivers while in panchayat areas we may require at least two autorickshaws. We are trying to minimize the number of drivers being hired. Using the minimal manpower, we will be distributing goods to maximum people,” Varghese said. Another private agency has started supply of goods procured from Supplyco and Consumerfed. “A private firm, AM Needs, has started supply of vegetables. They are buying up to 200 kits every day,” an official with Horticorp said.

388,['29/03/2020'],Probe in 2010 murder case ‘accused-friendly’: High court,"Representative Image

BENGALURU: Shocked over the lethargic investigation in the murder of a 19-year-old youth from Doddaballapura town, the high court has directed the state director general and inspector general of police to initiate disciplinary action against ST Siddalingappa, the investigating officer (IO) in the case.

The shoddy probe resulted in the acquittal of the four accused, who stabbed Mahaveer Jain, son of a local jeweller, over his failure to meet their demand for Rs 1 lakh and gold . Setting aside the acquittal order passed by IV Additional District & Sessions Judge, Doddaballapura, Bengaluru Rural district, the high court directed the DG&IGP to order further investigation and monitor the same.

Mahaveer went missing on August 29, 2010. He was stabbed 28 times below waist by the six-member gang. The miscreants tried to dispose of the body by burning it. Police could recover only one half of the body (mostly skeletal remains) as the other portion was eaten by dogs.

On October 26, 2013, the sessions court acquitted Mahesh Kumar, PR Rakshith, Kiran and Shivananda. Two others in the case were minors at that time and were referred to the Juvenile Justice Board. The state had challenged the acquittal order. This was after a majority of the witnesses turned hostile except Mahaveer’s family members.

The matter has now been remanded back to the trial court for fresh consideration and the presiding officer has to dispose it of in six months, after submission of further investigation report. “In effect, the entire investigation appears to be more accused-friendly than securing relevant records to bring those guilty to book,” a division bench headed by Justice SN Satyanarayana observed in its order.

When extortion attempt ended in murder

Rakshith, the prime accused, resided opposite Mahaveer’s house and the two studied together all through school.

As per prosecution, Rakshith used to extort small amounts of money from Mahaveer right from his childhood days to meet his expenses at eateries and other places.

Subsequently, Rakshith joined some seasoned criminals, particularly accused no.4, Kiran, who was involved in a murder case and was in jail for three years. They tried to extort Rs 1 lakh and gold from Mahaveer as his father was a jeweller. As their demands weren’t met, they murdered him.

Delayed investigation

The division bench which perused the evidence noted that the investigation was started only after 11 days of the case being filed, allowing all the accused, especially prime accused Rakshith, to roam freely.

The bench further noted that despite Mahaveer’s two sisters accusing Rakshith and his friends of demanding Rs 1 lakh from their brother and also identifying Rakshith’s phone call, the investigating officer didn’t bother to secure the call records of Rakshith’s phone till September 11, 2010. It also said the call records submitted to the court were incomplete.

The bench also wanted to know why a dog squad was not pressed into service at the spot where the youth’s body was found and why details of ownership of the car, motorcycle and scooters seized from the accused weren’t ascertained.

389,['29/03/2020'],"Karnataka gets 5,000 new testing kits; need for many more","Firefighters spray a disinfectant on streets in Bengaluru

BENGALURU: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Saturday supplied 5,000 coronavirus testing sets to Karnataka, which plans to significantly scale up examination of samples over the next two weeks.

With the latest additions, the state has nearly 5,500 kits, which include some residual ones at the six labs authorised to conduct Covid-19 tests.

To date, Karnataka has conducted 3,000 tests, the highest in the country. Seventy-four samples turned out to be positive.

Confirming the arrival of new kits, Dr CN Manjunath, the nodal officer for lab testing, Covid-19 Taskforce, said they were conventional sets that would check for the virus based on the polymerise chain reaction process.

“There is a need to enhance the number of tests. It’s only when we do more and more tests that we understand the actual velocity of the Covid-19 spread,” he told STOI.

Karnataka needs more kits as it targets 25,000 random tests to determine if there is a community spread, the so-called ‘Stage III’ of the coronavirus outbreak.

It takes 18-24 hours to process each sample and costs Rs 2,600. For positive cases, two confirmatory tests are conducted, and checks are repeated every three days to ascertain the viral load. Before discharging a patient who has recovered, doctors order two more tests in a gap of 24 hours.

In all, a Covid-19 patient’s samples are examined eight times, and the state government spends nearly Rs 21,000 on tests for each positive case.

The state government has decided to buy 1 lakh rapid testing kits from China, but the order has suffered delays because of flight restrictions. Each cycle of rapid testing costs Rs 600-800 per person and produces the results in less than four hours.

Who can be tested?

*Current ICMR guidelines say symptomatic and asymptomatic persons can seek free tests at designated labs. But there are certain criteria.

Symptomatic persons:

*Those who had direct and high-risk exposure to confirmed cases should be tested once between Day 5 and Day 14 after the exposure. The point of direct and high-risk contact could be someone with history of recent international travel.

*Healthcare workers can also request a test.

*Also eligible: People who have no travel history or exposure to a positive case but are hospitalised with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI), Influenza Like Illness (ILI) or severe pneumonia.

Asymptomatic persons:

*Those who had been living with a confirmed case.

*Healthcare workers who examined a confirmed case without adequate protection as per WHO recommendations.

391,['29/03/2020'],"A week later, Goa government fumbles as hungry Goans demand answers","PANAJI: The complete failure of governance in Goa left people, especially senior citizens, fuming as the promised home-delivery system failed to take off even six days after the lockdown was announced. Across the state, residents, driven by hunger and with stocks at home exhausted, risked their health on Saturday to stand in long queues at markets and shops for food supplies.On Friday, CM Pramod Sawant had assured Goa that grocery stores would be open 24x7, but on Saturday, most stores were either out of stock or chose to keep their shutters down for fear of reprisals.Sawant, who abruptly imposed a three-day statewide lockdown on March 22 after asking people not to go for panic buying, has announced multiple changes each day since. His shifting stances, not only contradicting himself but operating in open defiance of the ministry of home affairs’ guidelines, have left residents in a state of panic and confusion, with many not knowing where their next meal is going to come from.The state’s residents, meanwhile — especially those who didn’t stock up— are left to fend for themselves. After Goans realised the CM had shut down all shops without a proper delivery mechanism in place, public-spirited citizens are running from pillar to post to establish some semblance of normalcy.Days after some lawyers approached the high court of Bombay at Goa, citizens are now calling for governor Satya Pal Malik to take over the reins of the state.“The chief minister of Goa has failed to tackle the situation. I feel the governor should be given power to take over the state and normalise the situation,” said Margao resident Sanjeev Raiturkar.A day earlier, the opposition Congress called for Sawant’s resignation, saying that the CM had proved inept at guiding the state through the lockdown.In Panaji, where one Covid-19 patient was freely roaming till a few days ago, people stood in long queues for grocery supplies. Vegetable vendors complained of shortage of supply as the government has halted trucks carrying essential supplies. “We have started selling vegetables today after getting the permit. There is a shortage of supply. On Sunday, we might face more problems,” said a local vegetable vendor.Senior citizens faced the biggest brunt of the chaos, as they are unable to venture out to procure supplies on their own. With the home delivery system spectacularly failing, many turned to their neighbours for assistance.“The CM has manufactured this situation,” said Tirthprasad Nagvekar. “He should have given an assurance that in two days, he would streamline the delivery service and ensure that adequate supplies would be there. There is nothing in place, and the chief minister is selling panic. My dad is a senior citizen, and he needs fruits and vegetables to remain healthy.”Other senior citizens, stranded without food or medicines , even resorted to contacting their children outside the state, inquiring if they could leave Goa due to the prevailing situation.Even the approval system (for volunteers who seek to assist in the home delivery process) has been mired in bureaucracy. Sawant announced that 2,500 volunteers have been picked to assist in the home delivery process, but there is speculation that the selection of the volunteers was based on favouritism and political affiliation.“I applied on March 26 with the police station and the forms were sent to the collector’s office. All the applications were rejected, and now we have been told that the delivery process has been given to the panchayat member,” said Corlim resident Imran Shaikh.Most online delivery mechanisms — some government initiatives and citizen-fuelled — collapsed under the number of orders and, had to be suspended for hours.“Sorry, but we had to stop the website and booking because of overwhelming number of orders within just 30 minutes of opening the site,” said Sahish Mahambrey on behalf of the CCPGrocery website.In South Goa, police officials reportedly beat up volunteers who were delivering grocery supplies. “In Colva, shops and vendors want to start home delivery, but police are stopping everyone, and in some places, beating up delivery agents,” said Kenton, a local.Many residents who called the home delivery contact numbers circulated by the government got no response or were told that the service for home delivery had yet to be authorised. Others said that there was no stock, and that shelves were empty.Interestingly, in Bicholim taluka, the home delivery system operated smoothly, said officials. The Bicholim Municipal Council constituted 12 teams for home delivery of grocery items.But other areas aren’t so lucky. “There is no trace of a home delivery mechanism in Margao. Please instruct the administration to mention required details so that citizens can benefit from it,” said mechanical engineer Ajay Mishra.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74871496,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-264121,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/a-week-later-state-govt-fumbles-as-hungry-goans-demand-answers/articleshow/74868668.cms
392,['29/03/2020'],Microgreen farming the new fad,"Thiruvananthapuram: Three-week lockdown has come all of a sudden for many who didn’t get time to pick up things or plan activities to bide time. While a section of people are spending time watching movies and web series, some others are turning more productive.

One such activity that caught up with city residents is microgreen farming . Microgreens are vegetable greens that are of one or two inches tall. They are harvested right after the first set of a plant’s true leaves appear. Known for its rich nutrient content , microgreens are used to prepare salads and are added in juices and other food items .

Uma Kalyani, a dietitian, is one among the city residents who began experimenting microgreens at her house after the lockdown. Being a dietitian, Uma is a proponent of healthy eating. It was in a discussion in her social media group that she first learned about the farming technique which can be done using available materials at home. Soon, many in her 200-member group have started farming microgreens.

Uma said the specialty of microgreen farming at the time of lockdown is that it could be done with available items in the kitchen such as mung bean or green gram, methi seeds, sunflower seeds and wheat. “You can do it with or without soil. Microgreens are the next stage of sprouts. It is said to have 10 times more nutrients than a normal plant. It is rich in vitamins, minerals, fibre and antioxidants, which makes it a super food. Since vitamins are water soluble and heat sensitive, it is better to consume microgreens raw as salad or added with drinks such as buttermilk or vegetable juice. It can be included in curries such as dal and even in omelette, which does not demand excessive heating,” she said.

Uma, along with her women friends, are following a lifestyle comprising healthy eating and exercises. She said most of them have turned to the microgreens farming, which require less maintenance.

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had recently requested public to take up farming as an activity during the lockdown. Apart from microgreen farming, some have seriously taken up farming too, which could pass time as well as produce food at the time of crisis.

PR executive Ambu Senan is one such person who began farming in his 10-cent plot at Mannanmoola in the city. Senan said he started planting amaranthus, ladies finger, tomato and brinjal. Senan said he took it as a lockdown challenge.

Though the government had allowed restaurants to function, except one on Bypass road, where many residences are situated in the neighhbourhood, all the others remained closed.

Earlier in the day, people came out to buy groceries from the small shops that had opened. The markets also functioned with social distancing. In Chinna Chokkikulam, people maintained social distancing and were seen standing in long extended queues. Police used drones to monitor the crowds in many places like Chockikulam.

In most places like K K Nagar, DRO Colony, Vilangudi, Thirupalai, Chokkikulam, Surveyor Colony and others, the roads looked deserted from 11am.

In Anna Nagar, almost 99% of the shops remained shut by afternoon. Many shops listed by the Madurai Corporation for door delivery of goods, politely told the customers that they would start servicing them under the new scheme from Monday onwards.

One of the retail departmental stores in Anna Nagar allowed people to go in three at a time and the customers were asked to sanitize their hands and checked for their body temperature before being allowed inside.

Even though the government has permitted the opening of restaurants with take away service, many of them in the city remained closed on Saturday. President of the Madurai Hotel Owners Association K L Kumar said that they were apprehensive of opening the restaurants, as only takeaway was allowed.

“We have already made a resolution not to support online food delivery services like Swiggy and Zomato because of their high service charge, so operating through them is not a possibility,” he said. Kumar added that they also did not want to risk anyone - customers or workers - testing positive for the deadly disease.

The villagers of several panchayats in Aska, Khallikote, Polasara, Bhanjanagar blocks have put up bamboo barricades, while some others have lined up buses at the entrance to stop the outsiders from entering their areas. “This goes to show that even people living in remote villages are aware of the effect of the novel coronavirus,” Ganjam district collector (Ganjam) Vijaya Amruta Kulange said. The district administration has not been instructed to put up barricades, but the villagers have taken this step on their own for self-protection, Kulange added.

A Sania, the sarpanch of Baragaon panchayat in Aska block, said, “We have put up barricades at two places that fall under our panchayat to restrict the entry of outsiders. When some people from other villages were coming to see their relatives here on Saturday morning, we requested them to return as well with folded hands.”

Even large apartment complexes have a tough time managing entry and exit from the buildings.At some places, security personnel find it tough as there are no hotels functioning. In apartment complexes where there is no facility for cooking, there have no option to get food. “Public transport is also not there. Buildings that are managed by a few people suffer the most. If one of the employee is unable to reach, the other person will have to do double shift. But this arrangement cannot continue for long. Often they get a helping hand from caretakers,” said Ratheesh R, a security staff.Apartment owners associations say that they have imposed strict restrictions on the entry of visitors. Even when there is a death, residents avoid bringing the body to their homes.“An elderly Telugu couple lives in our apartment complex. They came from Mumbai about three years ago and started living in their son’s apartment. A couple of days ago, the wife died. She was sick and was hospitalized.

Some of the large buildings provide them acommodation.“There are security guards at the gates. Nobody, including maids, are allowed inside the building. Even relatives are not permitted inside. Residents can go outside for emergency needs. Our association has maintained that if one resident has to go into quarantine, all residents will be forced to go into quarantine. There are 720 flats in our complex,” said a resident of an apartment complex at Kakkanad.Associations have also made arrangements with local shops or retail outlets functioning within their premises to ensure supply of groceries.

Nagpur: The 10th Covid-19 positive patient, who resides in north Nagpur , had been to his workplace in south-west Nagpur for just three hours when he is believed to have contracted the virus from his employer, who had returned from Delhi on March 18 in Telangana Express.

The infection was already passed on from the 43-year-old employer, who runs a footwear business, to his wife, mother, son and manager. This was confirmed on Friday. The 10th patient, in his 30s, was working as a helper in his shop and would travel on a two-wheeler to work. The manager’s daughter too has tested positive, making her cities’ 11th Covid-19 patient.

On Saturday morning, NMC containment team and health department officials rushed to north Nagpur and identified five family members and nine neighbours of the 10th patient. They were taken to Mayo hospital for testing.

The family members include his elderly father, the patient’s wife, and two daughters. The patient’s elder brother, who suffered a paralysis attack two days ago, is admitted at GMCH and his swab would be sent to lab from there.

The elder brother lives on the upper floor of the ground+1 house located in a busy area having a flour mill right opposite their home, a bustling kirana shop next door and general store nearby. The area is socially and commercially active and therefore many people came in contact with the affected family.

A neighbour, who lives at a gap of four houses, told TOI he is scared now. “After the lockdown, we were not mingling but the elder brother suffered a stroke. Since there was no help available , we rushed to his home to help,” he said.

As the helper turned out to be positive for Covid-19, the test on these 14 are keenly followed by the neighbours, who wanted themselves to be tested on Saturday itself.

The neighbour said, “He (the 10th patient) was reluctant to go but his employer insisted he come for just three hours. That brought the virus here.”

After shifting the suspects to Mayo hospital, NMC containment team sealed the lanes on all sides of the 10th patient’s house.

“On Sunday, we will survey all homes in 3km radius. Additional people will be needed. The teams will work in layers of 1km each. In first layer of 1km, our teams each having 2 officials will go. They will check travel history, contact with positive patient, and complaints of fever, cough or cold. If needed, people will be quarantined,” an official said.

Likewise, honouring an appeal from Yakshagana artistes – both Badagathittu and Thenkuthittu —who primarily work in Yakshagana melas of temples under the endowment department sponsored Yakshagana melas in the coastal districts of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Uttara Kannada, will receive their salaries for the lockdown period. The respective temples will bear the salaries from their corpus, and this move will benefit around 2,500-odd artistes, he said.

To mitigate the hardship caused by the lockdown on households, Poojari said the district administration will launch an app soon, using which people can place orders for essential items. Alternatively, one can also call the district Covid-19 helpline, 1077, where they will be given the numbers of grocery stores nearest to them, which in turn will deliver essential items to people’s doorsteps. MLAs D Vedavyas Kamath, Y Bharath Shetty and district secretary V Ponnuraj were present.

A medical camp was held at the shelters and those with pre-existing ailments were treated.

VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh visited the shelters on Saturday and asked the homeless to maintain personal hygiene. “It is our responsibility to provide food and shelter for the homeless during this tough time.

G R Sivakumar, an activist from the city, and his team of 15 volunteers are working tirelessly on streets to save aged people abandoned on the streets with no food or water. They are the most vulnerable for two reasons -they are the most susceptible to the disease and can also become super spreaders.

When he heard about Janata Curfew proposed by the Prime Minister, the first thing came to his mind was the helpless people living on city streets, as they would be the first to be affected. With the help of a small team of volunteers, he started reaching out. The district administration and the corporation was so impressed by his work that they also chipped in.

The Madurai corporation has extended every possible support including arranging a couple of shelters, food and other basic amenities.

Sivakumar has been helping abandoned people by shifting them to homes, providing medical care and food after tying up with various NGOs in the last 10 years. He launched Idhayam trust in 2011 and also launched a helpline. He is supported by a volunteer team including R Kalaivani, S Ayyanar, M Sundar and Sudhagar and Muthaiah.

On Saturday, a day before Janata Curfew, his team rescued around 80 elderly people from various parts of the city. At least half of them left the place after the curfew. They have so far rescued around 200 people and with the situation turning grim, nobody wants to leave now.

“The first thing we do is give a haircut and a bath. They are given new clothes provided by the district administration and obtained through sponsorship. They are provided with tea, snacks and quality food,” Sivakumar said.Sivakumar has hardly any time to visit his house as the responsibility of looking after so many people keeps him on his toes. “It is not easy to manage them,” he says.

“Some will keep complaining, screaming and would require medical emergency, which keep us awake at night too. We have to be with them round the clock to keep them under control and ensure they maintain social distance. When we get time, we reach out to other needy persons in the city to distribute food,” he added.

410,['29/03/2020'],Back to tradition: People turn to neem to fend off the pandemic,"Madurai: As the number of Covid-19 positive cases continues to rise, apprehensive public now turn to traditional method to fight off the deadly epidemic.

Many households in Sellur here have hung bunches of neem leaves at the door, hoping that their healing properties could work wonders for them.

“When there is an illness in the community, we usually use neem leaves for its curative properties. It serves as a warning to others that there is someone in the house with an infectious disease,’’ K Ramasamy of Sellur says.

“Even now, when children catch measles or chickenpox, we use neem leaves to treat them. It has a lot of healing properties,’’ says Sandanam of Sellur.

The public believe in the healing powers of the neem leaves which are often seen outside almost every house in the area. Usually, women walk out to pluck the leaves early in the morning. “We have been doing it over the past few days. Now as most low-hanging branches have shed their leaves, men have to go out to pick them,’’ says A Selvi a resident.

Even inhaling the air from under neem tree has healing powers, Selvi says, adding that some people even started searching for saplings so they can grow them in their homes.

Many neem trees in Madurai are flowering now, and saplings would start arriving only after nearly six months, says Thirupathi a resident.

To ensure community health, youngsters are collecting dry leaves from homes and burning them in the streets in the evening as an additional preventive measure.

Cow dung has also gone up in demand in the region, as people believe that spraying the dung water in front of the house would also work as a disinfectant.

412,['29/03/2020'],"Covid-19: After spike, all suspected cases to be at MLA hostel","Picture used for representational purpose only

NAGPUR: The district administration on Saturday decided to keep all Covid-19 suspect cases compulsorily under 14-day institutional quarantine rather than send them back home with instructions to self-isolate.

The administration has around 4,000 rooms at MLA hostel, Ravi Bhavan, Nag Bhavan, Vanamati and VNIT hostels to be used as quarantine facilities. MLAs hostel’s Building 2 is city’s first institutional quarantine facility hosting 124, mostly flyers, as on date. Building 3 having 60 rooms is yet to be utilized.

City’s Covid-19 tally jumped to 11 after six people were found positive in the last 24 hours and more than 60 people reportedly came in direct contact with them leading to fears of further spread in different parts of city. So far, the cases were restricted to south-west Nagpur but that barrier was broken when first man from north Nagpur tested positive. In all, 42 suspected cases from Friday and Saturday are likely to be put up at MLA hostel now. This means the MLAs hostel Building 3 may also be put into use.

Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar told TOI 14-day institutional quarantine was necessary to prevent further spread of the disease. “They tested negative but we have to now isolate them to prevent further spread. We have all proper facilities for the people who would be kept there,” he said.

Officials said if need be the administration would also start a centre at VNIT hostels that itself has over 4,000 rooms available.

Kumar said food arrangements wouldn’t be an issue at these places. “We had acquired only institutions that traditionally have canteens and mess services,” he said.

Officials said the administration was identifying places having uninterrupted power supply, water and beds. MLAs hostels have three buildinsg but one is under renovation and can’t be used.

The district health office would be providing clinical support through three groups at all these places. Each group will work in 8-hour shift.

In a couple of cases, flyers landing in the city had been found to violate home quarantine guidelines. The administration now doesn’t want to take any chances and therefore it was decided to bring all cases to quarantine centre.

413,['29/03/2020'],A security guard keeps vigil to fight the ‘unknown enemy’,"Bhubaneswar: Amid the ongoing countrywide lockdown, it’s not unusual for people to queue up outside malls, supermarkets and kirana stores to buy groceries and other household stuff. In front of a mall at Patia recently, people had formed a serpentine line to buy essential goods. When an impatient man tried to purchase stuff out of turn, a young security guard deployed by the mall politely requested him to go back and not step out of the circles drawn one metre apart from each other to ensure social distancing. Realizing his mistake, he went back to take his place behind the customer who was standing before him.

The security guard is Rajkishore Mohanty, 23, a native of Begunia in Khurda district. Conspicuous by his grey- colour uniform, Mohanty has been keeping a hawk’s eye on customers to make sure that they adhere to the rules made for their own safety while buying fruits, vegetables and other household goods since the outbreak of coronavirus in the country.

While ensuring that customers maintain discipline was always a part of Mohanty’s job, the pandemic has put the onus on him to make people follow the rules to keep the novel coronavirus at bay.

Mohanty graduated from a degree college near his village in Begunia two years ago. Despite his decent qualification, he took up the job of a security guard to support his family. “I get a salary of Rs 14,000 every month. I am the sole breadwinner of a family of six, which includes my parents. I need to work for them,” he added.

While his family lives in the village, he stays here with his friends. “I have to work here because people need us. They can’t do without vegetables and groceries. I am taking all precautions like wearing good quality masks, gloves and using alcohol-based sanitisers to keep my hands germ-free during duty. When I return home, I wash my hands properly and take a shower. Though my parents worry about me, I have to continue to work for other people’s sake,” he added.

The mall opens at 6am and shuts down at 10pm. He works in different shifts. A shift lasts eight hours. Luckily for him, now more than ever before, customers are paying heed to his requests to keep a distance from each other. “I don’t allow more than 15 people to stand in a queue at a time. A customer can queue up after the one in front of him enters the mall. We are very particular about the health of our customers,” he said while asking visitors to park their vehicle at the designated places.

This apart, he also pitches in to help the store keepers in their work.

He said his reward is the gratitude that people show him for simply doing his duty at a time when most of them are not allowed to step out. “It’s heartening for me to see that people are not complaining as much as they would before. Before the outbreak of coronavirus, I had never seen people standing patiently in a queue under the scorching heat of the sun to enter the mall. They are not getting irritated and ill-treating any of our employees. The difficulty of the situation has made them more grounded. It inspires me to work for them in this hour of crisis,” he added.

The timings of the two iconic serial were scribbled on a sticky note in the house of Ramesh Shirke from Shukrawar Peth area.

He said, “We didn't have a television set back in the 1980s and 90s. We used to watch these serials at our neighbour’s house. Since we now have our own TV set with ample amount of time on our hands, we can watch it without missing episodes.”

Most families planned in advanced to watch the serials, as the announcement of re-telecasting them was made a couple of days ago. Many postponed their plans to buy groceries from local shops and some prepared their meal early so that they don’t miss the serials.

Some doubted whether the younger generation will be able to enjoy these serials. Other channels have started showing popular movies to captivate the audience.

Sanket Kulkarni, a college student, said, “I was not even born when the show was first telecast. I heard a lot about both serials from the elders in our family. We will get to know how the serials attracted such a large number of audience.”

Anand Desai, a resident of Kasba Bawda, said, “Many old serials such as Malgudi Days should be shown by the channels. The re-telecasting of the recent serials especially the one made on Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj will be able to keep people of all age groups engaged. For a brief time, we did not have power supply while watching Ramayana, that should be avoided.""

“Back then when we were small and had no big responsibility, things were so different,” said Vimal Chougule resident of Kasba Bawda.

Another 206 fishermen are also likely to be put under quarantine at Pozhiyur and Kulathur.The administration and health wing are keenly watching the fishermen as part of measures to prevent community spread in the area. The assistance of Coast Guard has been sought in the wake of preventive measure and to properly direct them towards quarantine facilities in the district.A few days ago, the district administration had shifted over 60 persons from Karumkulam panchayat after complaints rose about them breaking quarantine norms. All of them had returned from the Gulf and were found roaming around the village and attending public gatherings when health team was alerted. They were then brought to care homes set up at Palayam and IMG hostels and the corporation was entrusted with the supply of food and basic infrastructure. After their test results were found negative, the persons were sent back and now they are being housed in care homes set up in respective panchayats.The officials with district administration said they are also taking a count of fishermen who are currently away on fishing jobs in the state.

417,['29/03/2020'],Reaching home still a distant dream for MP-bound migrants,"Nagpur: The municipal hospital at Kamptee became the unofficial transit camp for scores of migrant workers reaching the town from places like Nagpur, Kalmeshwar and Butibori on foot. The corona scare and starvation due to no work after the lockdown has made them flee back to their native places in Balaghat, Seoni and Jabalpur districts of Madhya Pradesh, by whatever means they could. The city gets majority of its casual labour force from these districts.

As some continued their journey further on foot, others waited in the hospital premises to board private mini-trucks bound for the Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh border over 80km away. Soon, a truck arrived and each had to pay Rs100 first and get in. The vehicle was jam-packed in minutes with even children and elderly on it. Social distancing remained far cry. Despite the police issuing directives to prevent the workers’ movement as they would be provided rations wherever they are, all this happened right in front of the Kamptee Municipal Council’s office across the road.

The council’s CEO Ramakant Dahake said more than 2,000 may have passed through the town. Earlier the local body was carrying out screening. Now, the private operators have jumped in and are ferrying them till the border without any medical tests. “The locals don’t want them here and the private mini-truck operators are charging them money and dropping them till Khawasa border from where they can go further. We have asked the police to take action against the operators,” said Dahake.

At the entry point of Madhya Pradesh, the workers are being scanned and are told to be home quarantined. “A pamphlet giving directions about dos and don’ts during quarantine period in Hindi is being handed over to each,” said a MP government official.

According to the information gathered from the district collectors in Balaghat, Seoni, and Jabalpur, at least 26,000 migrant workers have reached the three districts post lock down .

The highest numbers of migrants are in Balaghat where district collector Deepak Arya said around 22,000 have entered from different parts of the country post lock down. Though it not specifically mentioned if all where from Nagpur, a majority of the influx is expected from Maharashtra, said the officer. He said in last 2-3 days, 6,000 have reached Balaghat, he told TOI over phone. Praveen Singh, Seoni collector, said 2,000 have reached Khawasa border along Maharashtra and the numbers reduced on Saturday. Divisional Commissioner of Jabalpur, Ravindra Mishra, said, 300 people had entered MP in the area under his division. Out of them, 160 odd were quarantined and some were given safe passage further to Uttar Pradesh, where they belong to.

On Saturday, TOI started off from Indora Square, reaching up to 14km away from Mansar and saw many groups of workers heading towards Madhya Pradesh. These were labourers engaged in sites at Mihan, Gorewada zoo, apart from those taking up odd jobs. For them, all roads led to Madhya Pradesh.

“I was engaged in fitting nuts and bolts in tigers’ cages being made for the Gorewada zoo. There is no work since a week and the contractor has also gone. With no means to survive, we are heading home. It may take a day or two to reach,” a migrant said. All he had was food packets handed by do-gooders on the way and three bottles of water.

Another group, led by Deepak Dhurve, had left from Mihan. He said, “The entire Mihan is now empty. Finally, we started off walking.” There were three women in the group. By bus, it takes 6 hours to reach their place. “We have no idea how long it will take on foot,” he said.

The workers TOI met said they earned between Rs350 to400 a day and no work for a week had pushed them to the brink. A source dealing with contract labourers said the workers are paid on weekly basis. Local traders set up weekly marts near the sites from where they get their supplies. With the markets closed due to lockdown, the workers have a little choice but to move out.

At Kamptee, TOI saw around 300 workers with around 15 children resting within the municipal hospital premises. Many thought that the government had arranged vehicles for them.

Ramji Sharma, a council worker, said, “The vehicle operators are charging migrants Rs100 each. Many of them don’t even have that much.” Sharma came with a group of 16 persons that included a couple of elderly persons, “We did not have Rs100 so the driver asked us to get down,” said Tarabai, a migrant. The vehicles have been deployed by their owners on charitable basis but the drivers are making money by taking advantage of the situation, said a local.

Washim Haider, a mini truck operator, said he operated 15 trucks throughout the day and it was out of charity. The money he charged, he said, was only to recover the fuel expenses.

Nagpur: In an extraordinary effort, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has traced 12 persons from the city and adjacent towns who were in bogies of trains in which Khamla businessman and his manager , both Covid-19 patients, travelled. All the 12 persons will undergo check-up at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) on Sunday. Their swab samples will be sent to Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) for testing.

Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe had directed NMC officials to get list of all the passengers who had travelled in the bogie of the two patients.

As reported by TOI on Friday, Khamla businessman, who has a shop in Khamla, and his manager had gone to Karol Bagh in New Delhi, on March 16. As per details available from the NMC and relatives, the two travelled to New Delhi in Tamil Nadu Superfast Train (12621) in S-8 bogie with berth number 67 and 72.

After placing orders at four shops in Karol Bagh, the businessman and his manager returned on March 18 in Telangana Express (12724) in bogie S4 with berth no. 38 and 40.

NMC additional medical officer health Dr Bhavna Sonkusre told TOI, “There were 13 more passengers in their bogie while travelling to New Delhi. During the return journey, there were 51 more passengers in their bogie. Of the total 64 passengers, 12 are from city and adjacent towns like Kamptee and Narkhed. We have contacted all of them and asked them to come to GMCH on Sunday for check-up,” she said.

As far as the remaining 52 passengers are concerned, the NMC has sent mails to the respective collectors and chief secretaries of the states to get them tested.

The businessman and his manager were tested positive on March 26. The same day, the NMC team engaged in door-to-door containment drive had taken 27 people for testing who were family members and three staffers of the businessman and manager.

On Saturday, the manager’s daughter also tested positive. As a result, the NMC on Saturday took another 15 persons for testing to GMCH.

Three persons are from family which lives opposite to manager’s house while seven are from family residing opposite the businessman’s house.

Three close friends of businessman’s son, who had tested positive, were taken for testing to GMCH.

Two housemaids used to work in businessman’s house. One is from Gautam Nagar, a slum adjacent to Khamla, and another from Jaitala village. The two were also taken to GMCH for testing.

Reports of all are awaited. All eyes are on reports of two housemaids as they are from different localities. Till now, all were from Khamla excluding one staffer of Jaripatka.

Former corporator Prakash Totwani on Saturday sent a dhol team in entire Khamla to spread awareness. “NMC is identifying all close contacts and taking them for testing. Ten persons from Khamla went for testing to GMCH though they are not contacts and have no symptoms. People should inform NMC team in case of any symptoms or if they come in direct contact with the positive persons,” he said.

The NMC had sprayed disinfectant in all the lanes of Khamla and Pande layout on Friday and Saturday.

419,['29/03/2020'],People continue to crowd rythu bazaars,"Visakhapatnam: In a bid to encourage social distancing, the district administration has set up more than 15 additional rythu bazaars in open grounds in the city so that people do not gather in large numbers in a particular area.

The initiative, however, does not seem to be yielding the desired results. At the rythu bazaar set up at the Andhra University grounds, long queues, with hardly any space between the buyers, were witnessed at every stall. While no one was seen providing sanitizers at the entrance, many people did not bother wearing masks and there was no one to check them.

“The behaviour of the crowd in the market leaves much to be desired. While social distancing norms were not followed, there was a lot of inconvenience while buying vegetables. They have not organised the vegetable stalls properly. I stood in the queue for an hour and when my turn came, the vendor had hardly any vegetables left. I again had to stand for an hour in another queue to buy green chillies and curry leaves,” said Meenakshi, a homemaker who visited the market on Saturday.

Another problem people complained of was the protracted process of buying. Given there is only one person per stall and he needs to cater to many people, it is hardly a surprise that each transaction was taking a minimum of 15 minutes.

“Although I have many health issues, I had to visit the market as I was running out of fresh vegetables and fruits. With no tents in the open ground and no precautionary measures being taken in the market, it was very difficult for aged people like us to stand under the scorching sun in long queues to buy vegetables. There were more than 30 people in front of me who were waiting for their turn to buy vegetables,” said M Srinivas, a retired employee.

Speaking to TOI, Vizag joint collector Siva Sankar Lotheti said he will look into the matter and ensure that people do not crowd the rythu bazaars. “We will also encourage people to purchase vegetables and fruits from mobile rythu bazaars. We plan to further increase the number of rythu bazaars in the city so that people do not gather in large numbers,” Lotheti told TOI.

Ranga Reddy, DCP (law and order-I), said special permissions have been granted to e-commerce companies for home delivery of essentials. “We do not want people to come out to buy essential commodities. Every apartment in the city will be provided with the contact numbers of e-commerce portals so that they can sit at home, order online and receive their essential commodities at home. Though the situation is under control in the main areas of the city, people are still coming out in the lanes and by-lanes. We have deployed more staff to restrict the number of people moving outside,” he said.

Undertrials awaiting trial for offences that carry a maximum sentence of seven years can also be included this rule.

Sharad Shelke, the superintendent of Kalamba jail, said: “We have prepared a list of nearly 600 prisoners who have been sentenced for a term of not more than seven years. Around 115 undertrials, whose offences would not fetch them a term of not more than seven years, have also been included in the list. They will be released for up to 45 days with an aim to reduce congestion in the prison.”

“Information that higher authorities required from us was sent on Thursday. We are awaiting their reply,” he said. “According to the rules, these parollees will be asked to remain in contact with jail administration after they are released. A bond of good behaviour will have to be signed before the finalising the parole. They will be asked to visit the nearest police station as per rules, but we will also have to take adequate precautions,” Shelke added.

423,['29/03/2020'],Startups battling lockdown hit by RoC penalty,"KOCHI: Several startups and newly-registered private companies registered with the Ernakulam RoC (Registrar of Companies), battling fund-flow due to lockdown, have been dealt a blow because of penalties imposed on them for delay in declaration of commencement of business.

As per the Section 10A of Companies Amendment Act 2019, all companies registering after November 2, 2018 have to file INC-20A (declaration of commencement of business) form with proof of bringing the paid up capital subscribed by shareholders within 180 days from the date of incorporation.

The ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) portal used to accept the submitted e-forms after making them pay additional fee, proportionate to the company’s share capital, for delay but after December 2019, the companies started receiving show cause notices.

“Even after INC 20A e-form was accepted in the MCA portal after payment of the delay fee, we have been charged a hefty penalty , bigger than their share capital for an offence that is mainly technical in nature. I think around 400 companies have been affected,” said Sebin Joseph , a chartered accountant. The companies which failed to submit the form have been fined Rs 50,000 and Rs 1,000 for each additional day of delay.

All these companies are in a budding stage and facing cash-flow issues. “None of us had such a guidance and it’s only Ernakulam RoC which is doing it. Since we delayed for three days we have been asked to pay Rs 53,000,” Joshy C George of Jungle Cart, a startup which is developing a platform to market tribal produce.

“Several of my clients are facing the issue. Many companies are yet to start operations. Even companies which have not started operations may have to wind up because of this as some have been slapped a penalty of up to Rs 2.5 lakh. Since most of them are facing a shortage of funds and can’t avail loans, promoters are in deep trouble,” said Prince Mathew , a company secretary.

Three companies have petitioned the MCA to take the necessary steps since it has the potential to push them into debt.

Several individuals and groups have come forth to help the police and the district administrations provide safe cooked food to several thousand homeless and destitute, who have been moved to night and makeshift shelters in Kolkata, Salt Lake, the city’s northern fringes and Howrah. The beneficiaries include several hundred migrant workers stuck in various city pockets and outside railway stations, unable to return home due to the lockdown.

DCP Debasmita Das said about 72 people are being sheltered and fed in Gariahat and Karaya. “Besides NGOs, several locals have come forward to help,” she said. “We have shifted 110 people to a shelter for the homeless on Beliaghata Main Road. Several NGOs are helping here. On Muraripukur Road, an NGO is feeding 30 people,” said Ajoy Prasad, DCP (ESD). According to DCP Pradeep Kumar Yadav, three such centres are operational in Jadavpur and Kasba.

In Kolkata, 33 NGOs and private entities have reached out to 900 people at 15 night shelters and makeshift shelters. The biggest facility in the city — a four-storied building on Kalighat Temple Road — is housing nearly 350 people. Behala Gurudwara general secretary Satnam Singh Aluwalia, who is providing for them with his team of 15 volunteers, said the biggest challenge was to arrange cooked food.

Jadavpur University students, researchers and alumni are also extended a helping hand. They collected 200kg rice and 60kg pulses and plan to buy at least 40kg-50 kg pulses more, along with salt and 150kg-200kg potatoes for the destitute. “We will start distributing the food by Monday,” said research scholar Hindol Mazumdar. Rajabazar resident Umar Awaaz and his team are distributing khichdi to 200 pavement dwellers. “With the help of Kolkata Police, we will reach out to the homeless in Narkeldanga, Taltala, Samsul Huda Road.” said Awaaz, a businessman. Zeeshan Majeed, who runs an NGO, is helping slum dwellers and daily wage earners in Ballygunge and Topsia with essentials.

Twenty-five women, under the banner of Anandapur Chakrapani Charitable Trust, along with the Howrah district administration, have also come forward. Howrah DM Mukta Arya said, “We asked them if they could help with the hundreds stranded at the now-closed Howrah and Santragachi railway stations and they readily agreed.”

On Friday, such initiatives started in Salt Lake, too, as cops distributed cooked food to the destitute. At Barasat and Hridaypur railway stations that are now practically shut, a women’s group, Angels for Angels, make khichdi and soyabean and deliver 50 packets.

“Need of the hour is social distancing and making available essential commodities like groceries, meat products and medicines at every household. We have combined both and would deliver essential commodities at homes without any physical contact,” said Dinesh Reddy, the owner of the company.

Under this system a customer has to select products on the app and the executives of the company would first verify the availability of the products from the wholesalers. Once availability of the products is confirmed, the customer needs to pay the products’ price through online payment modes.

Meanwhile, the wholesalers will pack the ordered products, sanitise the packages and keep them at a designated place near their workplace. The delivery executive will pick up the packages and deliver them at the doorstep of the customers. However, instead of ringing the doorbell he will intimate the customer through SMS. The company would pay the bill of the wholesaler online mode only. However, one of the drawback of the system is customers cannot customise the quantity of any product. They can only place order for products mentioned on the app along with specified quantities, which cannot be changed once the order is in place.

This is to compensate cancellation of direct interviews with their kin as part of protocols laid down to avoid spreading Covid-19 infection.At least ten mobile phones have been purchased, of which six have been allotted to Madurai central prison, three to Palayamkottai central prison and one for the special prison for women in Madurai, based on the decision taken by a state level committee on prisons comprising high court judges and the director general of prisons.A senior prison official said that around 100 visitors come to meet convicts during allotted days and around 250 to 450 to meet remand prisoners . “They are allowed to interact with visitors for up to 30 minutes. Now that it is not allowed due to Covid-19, alternative arrangement has been made,” he said.Each prisoner can make a video call to their kin for five minutes (which could be extended up to a minute) from 7am to 5.30pm and talk to their kin on all days of the week. This is to help prisoners know that their kin are fine and vice-versa. The calls can be made only to the three numbers they have given to the prison authorities.“They will be allowed to talk under direct supervision of prison staff who will maintain a distance from where they would be able to monitor the prisoner but not hear what they speak.

He gave the directions during a video conference with the collectors. He said in this hour of crisis, the government has given exemption to the MLAs so that they can spend up to 100% of their MLA funds for social welfare and food arrangements for the poor. They will now be able to recommend up to Rs 5 lakh instead of Rs 1 lakh from the MLA fund for medical equipment.

He said sample collection facility should be available in cities with population up to one lakh to check for corona infection. District collectors can also take the services of retired doctors and nursing workers if needed.

Chief minister said at present, the number of corona-infected patients is under control in the state, but this disease can take a dangerous turn any time. So, lockdown should be strictly enforced across the state as curfew.

Gehlot asked the district collectors to conduct a survey of the helpless and destitute people to ensure that the needy people get help. He instructed to provide ready-to-eat food to the homeless and destitute people and make available packets of ration to the needy people through home delivery. He said that district collectors seek the help of hoteliers in this work. Other facilities including cooks are available with them to make food in the hotels.

The chief minister said that flour mill owners can purchase wheat directly from FCI godowns. District collectors should ensure that the consumers get whole wheat flour at a reasonable rate. There should not be black marketing in it.

Medical and health minister Raghu Sharma said district collectors should prepare lists of doctors and nursing staff working in private hospitals in their districts so that their services could be availed if required. He said that in view of the need of doctors and nursing staff during the epidemic, AYUSH physicians and nursing staff should also be trained for this task.

Chief secretary DB Gupta said that social distancing and health protocols should be taken care of during distribution of food and ration to the needy. He said that during the distribution of food, NGOs and public representatives should take care that there is no crowd gathering there. The chief secretary added that if the electricity bills of the farmers are not deposited then their connection should not be cut due to the situation of lockdown.

While doctors have advised precautions to be followed when playing outside or in groups, parents find it easier to make children stay inside their homes to avoid any risks. This has made children themselves come up with ways to keep themselves engaged.

“We get bored easily because after a point of time, any activity even mobile phone games and drawing becomes mundane. I talk to my cousins and friends over the phone almost every day these days because they are also in a similar situation. We try to come up with fun stuff and games like friendship dares and share with each other through WhatsApp ,” said I G Aathmika, a Class VII student in the city.

So, we made a WhatsApp group with all the parents. As a start, we are conducting drawing and creative writing activities asking them to send their children’s work on paper by clicking pictures,” said Thennavan, headmaster of Kondapethan Government Middle School.

Across the state’s forested areas, it’s wild animals who are feeling a sense of freedom as humans stay behind shut doors.Ramesh Zarmekar, a wildlife enthusiast living in the forested area of Sacorda, Dharbandora, told TOI, “Presently, there are very few vehicles on the road. On Saturday, I saw a jackal tearing into his food. I have also experienced the active movement of a bamboo pit viper. Even the birds are out twittering every morning.”It’s not just the six wildlife sanctuaries and one national park but the settlements in the vicinity that are seeing a natural rejuvenation. The wild animals have fewer things to be intimidated by and are moving freely due to the lockdown. To fight the spread of coronavirus, the government has implemented a 21-day lockdown till April 14.Over the last five years monkeys and langurs have been a thorn in the villagers’ side as they destroy chickoo, papaya and other fruit plantations. Now with human movement restricted, these animals have taken to the cashew plantations to live and hardly come into the villages.Gajanan Shetye, a wildlife enthusiast from Keri-Sattari said, “We have been involved in hinterland eco-tourism ventures. Foreign as well as domestic tourists come with us for birdwatching. But because of the lockdown and reduced footfalls , wild animals are now moving around without interruption.”In many other areas, villagers have sighted gaurs, sambhars, and wild boars closer to their homes. After the recent deaths of four tigers in the forest of Golauli, Sattari, it appeared that there were no more tigers left. However, repeated incidents of buffaloes and cattle going missing tell another story. An incident of a gaur killed in Charavane revealed that the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary may still have the presence of a wild cat.Range forest officer of Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary Vilas Gawas told TOI, “Our staff has been regularly patrolling and taking proper precautions. The sanctuary has a water reservoir of the Anjunem dam which provides ample food and drinking water for wild animals.”",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-humans-in-sight-animals-kings-of-the-jungle-once-more/articleshow/74868696.cms

Dash said the government had already despatched the ration of three months’ midday meal to the blocks so that students continue to get nutritious food till June 15. “We do not want them to face any problem during this difficult situation, so we sent the midday meal ration in advance. Cooked midday meal will be served from June 15,” he added.

Currently, a total of 46,72,500 children studying in classes I to VIII take the meal in 62,889 schools every day. Children are served rice with dalma, soya bean curry and egg curry on alternate days.

The minister also said textbooks for students of classes I to VIII had been sent to the blocks for disbursal. “Students can prepare for the next academic session after getting the books. The lockdown and the upcoming summer vacation must be utilised by them,” he said.

Dash said students of Class IX had yet to sit for the exam of one subject. “We will conduct the examination for the last paper after the situation normalises,” he added.

On Friday, Dash had told media that students from classes I to VIII would be promoted to the next class without having to appear for their annual examinations. Sources said schools in the state would reopen after the summer vacation, by the third week of June.

With ward-level surveillance, procurement of supplies and coordination of volunteers, we hardly find time to eat. When this person threw the lunch packet back, we were crushed. Maybe he would have felt some regret, he came back sometime later and we gave the packet,” she said.The woman official said that such people at least get an item for the day; but in the coming days, nobody knows whether they will even have one chapatti because everyone is going through uncertain times. The corporation, which supplied food to over 10,000 persons in three days since the start of community kitchen, has been forced to initiate double-screening of bookings and incoming calls to filter out the most-deserving recipient.On the opening day itself, corporation received 113 calls and following cross-checks, it came down to 52 bookings as many of them had found it convenient to book dinner from community kitchen despite having enough resources and cooking facilities. The recurrence of such incidents forced mayor K Sreekumar to make an open appeal on Saturday that only the needy may make use of community kitchen.“We have been able to convince many people that community kitchen has a designated purpose and it shall not be misused. There were instances where people made mass bookings on the pretext of a local volunteer group and wanted numerous food packets. They said that they would serve it themselves. When we insisted that corporation team would serve directly, they backed out,” said a corporation official.With food having to be served for undeserving persons, corporation also faces sudden exhaustion of resources. “If we keep going at this rate, we may not be able to go beyond 4-5 days. Even then those who misused this option won’t be hungry. The real sufferers would be the needy who can’t find a way to get food,” said an official. Mayor made a public appeal to people to ensure provisions and vegetables to run community kitchens.Some of the contractors, who had brought hordes of guest labourers, are finding it convenient to divert food from community kitchen and skirt their responsibilities. Corporation traced a few contractors and said that it was their duty to take care of the labour force.The civic body is planning to establish community kitchens in all health circles.

441,['29/03/2020'],Lay-offs due to Covid leave Indian H-1B holders in a fix,"Hyderabad: With several companies in the United States starting to lay off employees, several H-1B visa holders now find themselves in a fix. Especially as new jobs are becoming increasingly tough to come by due to the coronavirus pandemic. One of the biggest drawbacks for H-1B holders is the 60-day grace period to find employment. Regulations stipulate that a H-1B holder without a job must find employment within the two-month period to stay in the US legally or else leave the country.

Indian H-1B holders say that it is close to impossible to find a job within the stipulated period given the current economic situation and have asked the US government for leniency. An online petition launched by Hyderabad-origin Dan Nandan, CEO of Hire IT People, seeks to extend the grace period from 60 to 180 days to give Indian H-1B holders more time to find new jobs. The petition (dated March 19, 2020) already has 17,243 supporters. The move comes with the next round of H-1B renewals starting in April.

Most H-1B holders spoke to STOI on condition of anonymity because they were between jobs or did not want families back home to worry. Their names have been changed. “I lost my job in February after working for a company for six years,” said Ajay, adding that hundreds of others had also been laid off from the same company, which he did not want named. “Even if the hiring situation improves in two months, the validity of my visa would have lapsed by then,” he said.

Ajay says the challenge is that if he does not find a job in time, he and his wife will have to leave the country. “My child is a US citizen and we will have to bring her back with us. This raises several questions: the first, how will we travel back when India has stopped international flights; second, what will happen to my daughter, for whom I have not applied for an OCI card.”

Civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti held meeting with the officials of national urban livelihood mission, who deal with the shelter homes. Kalshetti asked them to open the shelter facilities and make food and sanitation arrangements for them.

Rohit Sonule of NULM said that they have currently accommodated 25 homeless people in the existing shelter homes with social distancing rules in place. “We had found 60 homeless people from the city and 25 travellers, who are stuck due to lack of transport facilities. We are taking them to the abandoned school buildings.”

The people were found at railway station, Shiroli Naka, Shahu Naka and Vyapari Sankul Lakshmipuri. The KMC has asked a voluntary organisation to provide clean food, drinking water and personal hygiene materials to them. The officials claimed that such people are more likely to get coronavirus infection. “They live and roam in public places and can infect more people. The KMC has appealed to the mandals and organisations to refrain from providing food to them as arrangements for same are being made,” said an official.

Out of them are also women travellers and homeless, who have been put in women shelter homes. All of them are first screened at Chhatrapati Pramila Raje Hospital before taking them to shelter facilities.

Meanwhile, all the four Shivbhojan thali centres have opened up on Saturday. Many students, security men were seen lined up outside these centres. The operators are providing them packaged food instead of let them eat the centre, following the protocol of social distancing.

These people, aged 25 to 50 years, have no idea how long it would take them to reach their homes on foot.

Although a few owners have given them their wages, there is no arrangement for food and other essentials. Ahmed Ali, who worked at a garment factory and was returning to his village in Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh said, “I have started walking. If I get a truck , I will board that.

The company hasn’t asked us to go. But, what to do as our children are also worried.”

“We are frustrated. There is no money and food. The contractor hasn’t paid . Now, I am going back to my village in Bihar.,” said Upendra Kumar, who works in Sitapura.

Mohammed Rizwan, who works at a garment export factory near Balaji Market in Sitapura, said he was jobless for the past 7 days. “We have not got our payment.

Since March 25, gas agencies have been witnessing a surge in bookings owing to the fear of a possible shortage of LPG cylinders. Even as the state and Centre have made it clear that cooking LPG cylinders will be available during the lockdown period, panicked residents are making bookings even without having an empty cylinder to return.

A gas agency that usually records around 175 to 225 refill bookings per day has recorded more than 360 bookings per day on the first day of the lockdown. A similar demand was recorded by gas agencies even on Friday. “Without empty cylinders, our customers are making calls to book new LPG cylinders. When our delivery boys reach their home, perplexed customers say that they do not have an empty cylinder to return,” said KA Subramanyam, an LPG cylinder distributor at Cantonment.

The gas agencies told TOI that they cannot give refilled gas cylinders without collecting an empty LPG cylinder in return. Hence, the delivery boys have to return without delivering the refilled cylinders.

“We have adequate stock in our hands but impatient people are doubling our work by making panic bookings. Customers were requested not to book LPG cylinders without having an empty cylinder at home,” said R Sekar, representative of a gas agency in Thillai Nagar. The agencies said that customers should only place a booking at least 2 weeks after they receive a refilled cylinder.

Superintendent of police (SP), anti-narcotic cell, Shobit Saksena told TOI that they have activated a well-manned social media team to respond on social media and act within 30 seconds. Besides this, SP crime branch Pankaj Kumar Singh has started his own twitter account on which he has made available his mobile phone number so as to enable people in distress to reach out to him.

“We are receiving complaint from foreigners that they are not being allowed to move out of hotels to buy milk, bread and fruits for the elderly with them. We have responded to such types of complaints and have allowed them to move out to buy essential commodities,” Saksena said. He, however, said that many foreigners were not listening to police instructions that they cannot move out until and unless it is an emergency. “We try to convince them to stay inside,” Saksena said.

It is in response to social media complaints that police from Goa and Maharashtra helped stranded Russian and Israeli tourists to return to their respective countries.

Singh said that most calls he received were from people who did not have food. “As soon as we receive such information we make sure that essential commodities and food items reach them,” he said.

Around 10,000 police personnel, including Indian Reserve Battalion (IRBn), have been deployed to maintain law and order and ensure social distancing is followed. Saksena said that on Saturday more people stepped out to buy essential commodities. “We have not allowed shops that failed to put a line to maintain social distancing to open,” Saksena said.

Police is also making announcements in Kannada to create awareness about Covid-19 among the demography that only understands the one language.

Saksena said police are working in three shifts of eight hours each and that personnel are being deployed outside shops even before markets open to ensure social distancing is followed. “Once rush at shops reduces, police are moved to junctions for nakabhandi,” he said.

Goa police has provided sanitisers and washable mask to all their personnel, who have been told to disinfect their hands as soon as they come in contact with anyone. Officers are continually moving around to brief ground personnel and motivate them.

453,['29/03/2020'],Temple kitchens serve food to homeless in Srirangam zone,"Trichy: The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department and Trichy City Corporation have joined hands to feed a section of the homeless in the city by distributing food prepared at temple kitchens. On Saturday, food prepared at Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple and Thiruvanaikoil Jambukeswarar temples were distributed by Srirangam zone to at least 150-200 homeless people.

Though the Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam was closed for darshan since March 20, the HR&CE officials said that the kitchen in the temple is used for cooking food for Annadhanam (free food scheme). Around 250 people who depend on the lunch provided at the temple were continued to be fed by the temple management. Food was distributed outside the temple complex by ensuring social distancing. Meanwhile, as the number of homeless people near Amma Mandapam, Mambalasalai Road and Cauvery bridge in Srirangam zone has escalated since the lockdown, the corporation with the help of the HR&CE Srirangam managed to distribute 150 lunch packets from the temple’s kitchen to the homeless in Srirangam. “We will continue to keep the temple kitchen functioning for feeding the homeless. If the civic body is interested, they can take food prepared at the temple and distribute it elsewhere,” P Jayaraman, HR&CE joint-commissioner of the temple, said. Similarly, Thiruvanaikoil Jambukeswarar temple is also feeding around 100 homeless people per day since the lockdown.

Trichy City Corporation on their part has planned to provide breakfast and dinner for the homeless by preparing food at the three Amma canteens in Srirangam zone. “We have managed to find sponsors for preparing dinner for the homeless at the Amma canteens. Around 150-200 people can be given dinner,” a corporation official told TOI. The civic body has also embarked on a survey to identify the homeless for distributing face masks being manufactured by the Trichy-based women Self-Help Group (SHG).

RAJKOT: Four persons were killed after the car they were travelling in rammed into the trunk of a roadside tree near Rajula in Amreli district on early Saturday morning.

Police said the accident reportedly occurred as the driver dozed off and lost control over the steering wheel.

“All the passengers in the car were going to an ashram in Jhandalia Hills near Rajula. Mahant Luvkush Muni, the priest of the ashram on Jhandalia Hills, was driving the car,” said H G Gohel, sub-inspector with Rajula police station.

Apart from Mahant Luvkush Muni (57), the other three deceased were identified as Ruda Bhambhania (55), Kunja Solanki (56) and Unad Bapu (60).

They had returned to Junagadh from Haridwar on Friday night. They changed their car after reaching Junagadh and sat into the car belonging to Mahant Luvkush Muni.

Visakhapatnam: Maharanipeta is also known as the health capital of North-Andhra, south Orissa and Chattisgarh. The large colony has more than 50 hospitals and nursing homes, apart from the King George Hospital. Along with this there is a large support structure, with vendors, small and big, catering to the needs of those accompanying the sick.

The lockdown, however, has turned out to be a major dampener for those who have come to the city for treatment. A majority of the people stranded are from south Orissa, Chattisgarh, chiefly Jagdalpur, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts.

Hundreds of them are stranded in Maharanipeta, staying back in lodges and literally scrounging for their daily needs. In some cases, many have been asked to vacate lodges and are looking for shelter elsewhere.

“The situation is bad. My brother is being treated for kidney disorder. But I am unable to find food and at times even a cup of tea,” Surindro Bhayo from Jeypore, Orissa, told TOI.

In several cases, these people hit the streets early in the morning to get some breakfast and hot beverages. But for most it has become an uphill task to get three square meals a day. Not many hospitals and nursing homes have full-time canteens and the ones with canteens are giving priority to the patients.

Another such person, a native of Vizianagaram district, Veda Narayana Rao said, “ Every day in the morning I have to go to my cousin’s house in Dwarakanagar to get some food. My son, who is undergoing treatment is being taken care of by the hospital, however, in my case I have to travel all the way to Dwarkanagar and at the same time deal with the law enforcement authorities who think I am out on the streets for no reason.”

But a few people have come forward to ease the situation. In a few areas shopkeepers are trying to ensure that they continue to cater to the stranded folks. Some pan shops in the area, instead of selling their usual fare, are focusing on providing biscuits, milk, curd and coconut water.

The officials said that the male sanitary worker had used the mobile phone of the Covid-19 positive patient to record a video reportedly to share in a social media platform. As the incident was disclosed to the management after the patient testing positive for Covid-19, the three sanitary workers were kept under watch in the isolation ward of the Ariyalur GH.

“The three workers will be constantly monitored for the next 14 days.

NEW DELHI: As India remained under lockdown for the fourth consecutive day, the nation’s focus stayed on preventing the spread of Covid-19 infections and helping stranded citizens. Meanwhile, an unprecedented change was in the air, literally. With steep decline in traffic volumes, construction and industrial activity, India on Saturday recorded the best air quality in years, if not decades.The day’s average air quality index was in the top category (“good”) in as many as 35 cities out of 101 monitored by the Central Pollution Control Board on Saturday. Experts are calling this “unprecedented” and “unbelievable”, not seen since the national air quality index was launched in 2014.Delhi recorded its bestever AQI of 45 on Saturday, a day after a spell of rain. This was the first “good air” day in the capital since August 18 last year and only the third in more than three years. This was also the first time that the capital recorded AQI in the “good” range outside the monsoon months.A clear blue sky in the capital, with pollution levels downAn average AQI of 45 has never been achieved in Delhi since the air quality index was launched. March is a month of weather transition. An AQI in the ‘good’ range is unheard of in Delhi during this month,” said Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB’s air lab.Improvement in air quality was seen across Indian cities, a trend clearly linked to the national lockdown. TOI studied AQI data of eight major cities during the past 14 days and found significant reduction in air pollution in all cities in the seven days since Sunday’s janata curfew. Additionally, an overwhelming number of CPCB stations across India, 108 out of 116, reported cleaner air on March 26 — Day 2 of the lockdown — as compared to the same day last year.“It is unbelievable. I would say 35 cities reporting good air quality in a single day has not happened since the AQI regime was started. That this is taking place in March is even more remarkable,” said A B Akolkar, former member secretary, CPCB.While weather too plays a crucial role in regulating air pollution levels, the sharp improvement in air quality across the country is clearly due to reduced vehicular movement and other industrial activities, the experts said. Exactly how much impact the reduction in activities is having on air quality will need to be studied.“This is a great opportunity to study the role of various sources on pollution. Most source apportionment studies in the past have stated that roughly 70% of air pollution over cities such as Delhi is contributed by human activities. That such activities are down to a record low at the moment gives a window to researchers to study their impact,” Saha said.(With inputs from Atul Thakur)",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74868912,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-69308,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-has-best-aqi-ever-good-air-day-in-34-other-cities/articleshow/74868911.cms

It showed more than 640,000 cases and over 29,000 deaths. More than 130,000 people have recovered.While the US now leads the world in reported infections — with more than 104,000 cases — five countries exceed its roughly 1,800 deaths: Italy, Spain, China, Iran and France. “We cannot completely prevent infections at this stage, but we can and must in the immediate future achieve fewer new infections per day, a slower spread,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who is in quarantine at home after her doctor tested positive for the virus, told her compatriots in an audio message. “That will decide whether our health system can stand up to the virus.”The virus already has put health systems in Italy, Spain and France under extreme strain. Lockdowns of varying severity have been introduced across Europe, nearly emptying streets in normally bustling cities, including Paris where drone photos showed the city’s landmarks eerily deserted. Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, said Germany — where authorities closed nonessential shops and banned gatherings of more than two in public — won’t relax its restrictions before April 20.Spain, where stay-at-home restrictions have been in place for nearly two weeks, reported 832 more deaths on Saturday, its highest daily count yet, bringing its total to 5,690. Another 8,000 confirmed infections pushed that count above 72,000. Doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers in its worst-hit regions are working nonstop and falling ill at an alarming rate. More than 9,000 health workers in the country have been infected. “We are completely overwhelmed,” said paramedic Pablo Rojo at Barcelona’s Dos de Maig hospital. “Seven or eight (patients transported today) and all with Covid-19. ... And the average age is decreasing. They’re not 80 years old anymore, they are now 30 and 40 years old.”Italy’s Covid-19 deaths are down slightly from the previous day. Civil Protection officials said there were 889 deaths in a 24-hour period ending Saturday evening in the country. That compares to 969 a day earlier, which was a oneday high in the country which has the world’s highest number of deaths of persons with confirmed cases of the coronavirus. The day-to-day rise in new cases was just under 6,000, about the same as the previous day’s figure. Overall, Italy has at least 92,472 cases of Covid-19. The current national lock-down decree expires on April 3, but health experts have said the need to try to contain contagion in the outbreak will likely last weeks beyond that.In Britain, another member of Boris Johnson ’s cabinet has developed symptoms of Covid-19, as the number of people with the coronovirus to die in the UK passed the 1,000 mark. Scottish secretary Alister Jack said he had symptoms of the disease and was self-isolating a day after the PM and Britain’s health secretary revealed they tested positive for the virus and were experiencing mild symptoms.Countries are scrambling bring home some citizens stranded abroad by border closures and a near-shutdown of flights.

TIRUPATI: In a heartbreaking incident, a father had to carry his dead son in his arms and bury him all alone at Gorantala in Anantapur district amidst a nationwide lockdown.

The father, identified as Manchala Manohar, works at a scrap shop near the RTC Bus Stand at Gorantala town in Anantapur district. Manohar and his wife Ramanamma have three children.

Nearly 10 days ago, Manohar’s youngest son, five-year-old Deva began suffering from a throat infection. He fell ill and had to be admitted to a local hospital in Gorantla. But his illness aggravated. Subsequently, he was shifted to a government hospital in Hindupur.

On Tuesday, after the child’s condition deteriorated further, doctors at the hospital advised Manohar to take his child to a better hospital in Bengaluru or Kurnool. But Manohar neither had cash in his hand nor the wherewithal to travel.

On Wednesday, the five-year-old bled through his nose and mouth and finally succumbed. Manohar spent all the money he had to take his son’s body to Gorantla.

On Friday morning, Manohar carried his beloved son’s corpse in his arms all alone and walked all the way to the shore of the Chitravati River where he buried his son and performed the last rites.

Discoms will also not be charged late payment penalty during this period and will have to open letters of credit (LCs) with banks only for 50% of power they intend to draw from the grid instead of 100%. Simultaneously, gencos and transcos have been barred from pulling the plug on discoms over pending bills, irrespective of the outstanding amount till June 30.The ministry has asked the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission to implement the package for Central utilities. States are being requested to give similar directives to their regulators for discoms, which is likely to result in similar relief for consumers.Without such a package, discoms would have been forced to curtail supply because of their inability to open LCs for 100% of power requirement as the lockdown-induced loss of high-paying industrial/commercial consumers and domestic bill collection have hit revenue. The ministry’s PRAAPTI portal puts total dues of discoms to gencos at Rs 85,527 crore and overdue amount at Rs 75,930 crore till the end of December.Uninterrupted power supply has been a key political plank for the ruling BJP. It has attained added importance in the current work-from-home scenario. But for discoms, domestic supply is a loss-making proposition due to low tariffs and theft, which they balance by charging industrial/commercial consumers more.According to Singh, the whole workforce of the power sector -- generation, transmission, distribution and system operations -- is committed to maintaining 24X7 supply and working round the clock to ensure it. The ministry is also working closely with the ministries of railway and coal, which fuels 70% of generation in the country, for uninterrupted fuel supply to power stations.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/discoms-get-payment-relief-to-keep-supply-on-consumers-next/articleshow/74868947.cms

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu has ramped up plans to contain the Covid-19 pandemic with the government on Saturday declaring that it would demarcate a 5km radius containment zone around homes of people who tested positive and a further 3km radius buffer zone in 10 districts.Health workers would go house to house in the containment zone to check for people with symptoms of the viral infection and create a list of high-risk patients, including the elderly and those with chronic ailments such as heart and renal conditions.These measures were announced as the number of those testing positive rose to 42 with four more cases reported.""We are now seeing transmission at a local level,"" said health secretary Beela Rajesh. More than half of those who tested positive so far are people with travel history; some of their relatives have also tested positive. But in the last couple of days, public health officials are seeing cases where patients do not have a travel or contact history. ""This is the second stage of the disease. We want to stop the spread, and flatten the curve, before we see it in the community, where large number of people can become infected,"" the health secretary said.As a part of the plan, on Sunday district officials will demarcate the containment and buffer zone. District collectors, health officials and doctors were briefed about the protocols and the strategy during a video-conference on Saturday. The plans have been drafted based on the ""Micro Plan for Containing Local Transmission of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)"" guidelines given by the Union Health Ministry and the real time risk assessment prepared by the state public health officials.A team of health workers including doctors and nurses will be involved in the door-to-door screening of patients.The health secretary said, “If health workers find people with symptoms such as cough, fever and shortness of breath, they will be examined by doctors. The medical team will decide if patients can be kept in quarantine or if they require hospitalisation.”Patients showing symptoms and their caregivers will be given personal protection equipment such as masks and counselled about the virus. The team will also make a list of patients above the age of 60, and those with chronic ailments who are at risk for the viral infection, Beela Rajesh said.“People in high risk groups and those vulnerable will have to be in self isolation,” she said.The state will also launch a mental health plan for more than one lakh people who are now in quarantine. “Our counsellors and volunteers will be talking to people who are alone or depressed,” she said.Of the four people who tested positive on Sunday, one was a 42-year-old man who had come from the West Indies and is admitted at the Thanjavur Medical College Hospital. A 49-year-old man who travelled from UK is admitted at CMC, Vellore, and a 25-year-old man who travelled from US is admitted at Global Hospitals.While 318 contacts of the Thanjavur and Vellore patients are being contacted, officials are working on identifying contacts of the Chennai-based man, who had attending functions including weddings.Another patient, a 60-year-old man from Rajapalayam, did not have any travel or contact history. “He told us he met a person who had recently travelled from Dubai.

PUDUCHERRY: A magistrate court in Puducherry on Saturday sent Sathya, 36, of Villianur in the Union territory to judicial custody on the charge of murdering her husband, P Manjunathan, on Thursday.

According to police , Manjunathan, 45, turned violent on Thursday after he was deprived of alcohol due to the lockdown. He began beating up his wife and three children while they were sleeping at their house at Villianur. Unable to bear the torture, the woman tied him up and attacked him with a wooden log. Manjunathan sustained severe bleeding injuries on his head and fell unconscious. His daughter then rushed him to Indira Gandhi GH in Puducherry where doctors declared him brought dead.

Manjunathan, a construction worker from Bengaluru, had settled in Puducherry 20 years ago after marrying Sathya. The couple has two daughters and a son.

According to police, Sathya use to have mystical experiences when she would claim that she had been possessed by a divine force. She believed that her husband was possessed by evil spirits and she had the mystical powers to cure him, police said. ""Whenever her husband loses control, Sathya and her children would take refuge at a neighbour's house or a temple. But on the fateful day, she did not venture out ,"" said Villianur sub-inspector S Nandakumar.

Following that, it was found that their 68-year-old househelp had also tested positive for the virus. Civic officials said the octogenarian was already under home quarantine after her son and the househelp tested positive.

However, she had shifted to her relative’s home in Mulund and was staying with them for the past few days. “Initially when she started feeling unwell, her relatives took her to a local hospital in Mulund East. But when she tested positive for coronavirus she was shifted to Hiranandani hospital in Powai,” said a civic official, adding they had sanitized the area where the woman had been living in Ghatkopar.

The househelp was discharged from a civic hospital on March 24.

473,['29/03/2020'],Six Maharashtra labourers walked 250km before getting help,"The group of road workers is now on its way to Nashik by truck

MIDNAPORE/KOLKATA: Six labourers from Maharashtra, engaged in road-laying in Bu-rdwan before lockdown was imposed, had to walk nearly 250km before help arrived.

The three men and three women, along with their children, had come from Washim district to work at Burdwan’s Kannangara. The road contractor asked them to leave after CM Mamata Banerjee announced the state lockdown from the evening of March 23.

Ramesh Uttam Marwari, Sahed Rao and Asru Kalapat left with their families the ne-xt morning and walked to Bu-rdwan station, 36km away. “The railway authorities did-n’t let us stay there,” said Rao.

With little knowledge of the locality and no money for anything else, the group headed for Howrah station, 98km away, on foot. “People gave us food and drinking water as we trudged towards Howrah. But we couldn’t spend the night at Howrah. The authorities asked us to leave,” Marwari said.

The group then headed for Kharagpur, 114km from Howr-ah. “We had to carry our children. We spent the night at petrol pumps and under street li-ghts till we reached Kharagp-ur on Friday night,” Rao said.

The group took shelter at a gurdwara and from Saturday morning tried to catch any vehicle that could take them ba-ck to their home state. Laxmi Bai, a local, came to their help when she saw the children’s plight. Bai took the labourers to Kharagpur railway employee Navin Mishra, who gave them Rs 1,100 to buy food. The news had by then reached Kharagpur ward 15 councillor Anjana Sakre, who alerted the Kharagpur administration.

Kharagpur SDO Baibhab Chowdhury came to the spot with food and a doctor. “We undertook primary screening of the labourers after giving them food. We then directed a Nashik-bound truck to take them back to their state,” Chowdhury said. The group boarded the truck that left for Nashik, 408km from Washim.

The home ministry urged the state government on Saturday to make arrangements for people from other states stranded in Bengal. This comes days after Banerjee wrote to 18 CMs urging them to provide basic food, shelter and medicine to people from Bengal stranded in other states.

It’s a real problem, but it’s all in their head.The outbreak and the lockdown has affected the city’s mental health, causing fear, hysteria and depression. And mysophobia — the fear of germs or viruses — has become rampant. Psychiatrists have been flooded with frantic calls from people suffering panic attack. And rumours on social networking sites are making things worse, even as the lockdown has accentuated anxiety and caused stress, boredom and loneliness.Even those without any history of mental health issues have started suffering from anxiety, restlessness and sleep disorder. The viral outbreak has also triggered agoraphobia (a form of anxiety disorder), said psychiatrist Ranjan Ghosh.“I have patients suffering from acute respiratory disorder, though their lung functions are perfect,” said psychiatrist Gautam Saha, vice-president, Indian Psychiatric Society. “That is a result of traumatic stress disorder, which is making them experience physical pain. The delusion of being infected is leading to respiratory disorders, which is psychological,” he said. “I have found a high rate of aggravation in patients who were completely cured and have been off medicines for the last 8-10 years,” he added.With a large number switching to work from home since last week, many have been confined to their homes and are afraid to venture out, fearing infection. They are getting over-exposed to truth, half-truths and lies peddled on social media, leaving them mentally drained, experts said. Such over-exposure has created delusions about the virus, according to psychologist Sharmila Bandyopadhyay. “They have also led to sudden stress and insecurity about health, which many are finding difficult to handle.”According to psychiatrist Jai Ranjan Ram, a number of frontline healthcare workers — including doctors and nurses, who are constantly exposed to infection, despite all precautionary measures — are also under tremendous psychological pressure. “Many of them are suffering from acute anxiety, since they realize that they are in the high-risk group. There has been a tremendous aggravation in people with pre-existing anxiety issues. The lockdown itself is a dark phase for many, particularly the elderly, who suddenly find themselves cut off from their community and those around them. People with abusive relations at home are also suffering due to the lockdown. For them, spending long hours at home is often traumatic,” added Ram.Bandyopadhyay said that she found people with no history of mental issues suffering from a deep sense of insecurity. “People are fastening masks so tightly on their faces that it’s leaving scars. Fights are breaking out over maintaining coughing etiquette. There has been a sharp rise in the number of people suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder. These obsessions are unwanted thoughts, known as egodystonicthoughts, which are now being triggered by mysophobia, which worsens with time,” Ghosh said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/viral-fear-corona-takes-a-heavy-toll-on-mental-health/articleshow/74868700.cms

CHENNAI: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Saturday requested PM Narendra Modi to extend a grant of 9,000 crore to the state to fight Covid-19, and recalled his recent letter to Modi seeking a one-time measure of relaxing fiscal deficit limits of 3% of GSDP for fiscal years 2019-20 and 2020-21.

In a letter to PM, a copy of which was released to the media, the CM said the economic impact of the lockdown was likely to be severe and unprecedented. Such difficult times call for unconventional measures to ensure that the economy was revived and reinvigorated. ""Conventional economic doctrines and dogmas will need to be set aside temporarily,"" the CM said, listing out the demands.

In addition to allowing the additional borrowing by the state governments, the Centre should provide an aggregate amount of at least 1 lakh crore as a special grant to state governments, Palaniswami said. ""This must be in addition to other forms of financial transfers to the states under Union budget and can be financed by the Centre from the RBI,"" the CM said, adding that the fund could be distributed in proportion to the size of each state's GSDP to the national GDP.

New demand follows CM’s Rs 4,000 crore request

He recalled his recent letter to Modi, seeking a one-time measure of relaxing the fiscal deficit limits of 3% of GSDP for the years, 2019-20 and 2020-21. Additional borrowing of 33% above the level permitted for 2019-20 may be allowed for 2020-21 to enable the states to meet the additional expenditure requirements.

The new demand comes days after the CM requested Modi to extend special assistance of ₹4,000 crore and financial relief measures expeditiously to the state.

Palaniswami highlighted the substantial expenditure required to strengthen the availability of health infrastructure and medical supplies. “Eventually, measures will also have to be taken to revive economic growth, assist various sectors to return to their growth trajectory and to stimulate consumption and investment demand,” he said. All governments will suffer substantial reductions in tax and revenue receipts. It will not be possible to step up revenue raising for a while. “However, the expenditure needs, and responsibilities will not wait,” the CM said.

MUMBAI: Three men, including two MBA students, were arrested for stocking and black marketing hand sanitisers in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.

Acting on a tip-off, crime branch unit 6 raided a flat opposite Citylight Cinema and arrested Viral Dhariya (20), Jainam Dedhiya (21) and Neeraj Vyas (49). They were booked under the Essential Commoditieis Act and the IPC. More than 5,000 bottles of sanitisers worth Rs 2.5 lakh were seized from them.

Deputy police commissioner (crime) Akbar Pathan said the price of the sanitisers in the wholesale market is around Rs 25-30 per 100ml bottle, and the accused were selling it for Rs 50-60 to medical shops. ""The shopkeepers then sold these bottles for anywhere between Rs 65 and Rs 90, depending on the locality. The maximum retail price cannot exceed Rs 60. We want to send a strong message those indulging in black marketing of essential commodities,"" said Pathan.

An employee of the laboratory that the three procured the sanitisers from, who is distant relative of one of the accused, is believed to have helped them.

In another case in Borivli (west), the owner of a medical store was arrested for selling sanitisers at the MRP, instead of the rates fixed by the government. Santosh Singh (21) approached the MHB Colony police on March 25, after the shop owner sold him a 500ml bottle for Rs 630, instead of prescribed Rs 250. He was booked under section 188 of the IPC and released on bail.

At a nakabandi in Malad (E) on Saturday, a motorist was arrested for carrying 160 5L cans of alleged sanitiser worth Rs 80,000 without a valid licence of manufacturing. Police sent the liquid in the cans for analysis. Neelkumar Shah said he had a sanitiser manufacturing company in Surat, and had come to sell the sanitisers in Lower Parel. Shah was later released on bail.

We wanted something more creative and impactful,"" said the inspector attached to the Villivakkam police.On Thursday night, Rajeesh and his artist friend B Gowtham decided to create a helmet shaped like the image of the novel coronavirus available online.

A few found it funny, others found it scary but all of them cringed after taking a closer look.""We made the helmet look disgusting and creepy because the virus is life-threatening. And people should know that,"" he said.On one occasion, when a motorist didn't seem to take his advice seriously, Rajeesh told him that if he found him on the road again, he would sit in his car next to him wearing the corona headgear.

BMC N ward in Pant Nagar shifted around 240 hawkers, mostly selling vegetables, fruits and other essential commodities, to Arun Kumar Vaidya ground.The ward is the first to organise a hawking zone in the wake of the spread of coronavirus in Mumbai , probably paving the way for others to follow. The hawkers from Guru Dutt Mandir Marg, B G Kulkarni road and Ankush Gawde Marg were shifted.The brain behind the pilot project, NCP corporator Rakhi Jadhav, said, ""The most important step to curb the spread of the virus was social distancing. Recently, as I was moving around, I saw many on the road buying vegetables and fruits. I thought about how we can make life better, and immediately contacted my ward officer, and discussed the issue,'' said Jadhav.Jadhav procured 400 meters of tarpaulin sheets, and with the help of BMC officials and hawkers, spread them on the ground.""After Jadhav discussed the issue, we worked out this, and met the hawkers. They all agreed to move. The playground, which has ample space, was chosen,'' said Ajit Kumar, assistant commissioner (N ward). BMC handed over a letter to Pant Nagar police, informing them that they had moved the hawkers temporarily. Notice boards on the ground state that the arrangements were temporary. Between each hawker, a distance of 20-30 feet has been kept, in a zig-zag manner, added Kumar.Jadhav said there were three roads in her ward where the hawkers would operate from. They were told to maintain a safe distance and wear masks and hand gloves, or action will be taken.Mukesh Waghela, a resident, said, ""It's a major relief, as my wife was scared to go out and buy vegetables and fruits."" Vijay Pandey, a hawker, said, ""It is a win-win situation. Even we were getting scared, but to earn a livelihood, we had no option.""",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74869035,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-476808,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/240-hawkers-shifted-to-playground-with-masks-in-ghatkopar/articleshow/74869017.cms

For a couple of years, he started working with a cab aggregator.

He was shocked to hear that his passenger had tested positive. ""I was very scared when I got that call and told I was his primary contact. I was asked to immediately wash the car. They asked me if I had developed a fever or cold. So far I haven't had any symptoms, but I've been watchful. I was worried about being in Bengaluru and left for my home town with two relatives who are also cab drivers,"" said the driver who stayed near Bhuvaneshwari Nagar.""Given the fear of Covid-19, many cab drivers now wear masks.

HYDERABAD: Twenty-five days after the first positive case in the state, a 74-year-old man became the first Covid-19 fatality in Telangana. Also, eight new positive cases were reported on Saturday, taking the total count to 67 in the state. The only silver lining was that test results of 10 who were earlier Covid-19 positive came negative and they would be discharged soon.Confirming the death, health minister Eatala Rajender on Saturday said, ""The 74-year- old man from Khairatabad had gone to Delhi on March 14 on religious work and returned to the city on March 17. He started developing symptoms, including breathing problems and fever on March 20 and died at a corporate hospital while undergoing treatment. His wife and son have been put under home quarantine.""Sources said the man had come in contact with hundreds and health authorities have started contact tracing.The septuagenarian was first treated at a private hospital at Saifabad and later moved to a corporate hospital in the same area where he was declared dead on Thursday night. On suspicion, his body was shifted to Gandhi Hospital where doctors confirmed that the cause of the death was Covid-19.""So far 67 people have tested positive with eight new cases coming to light on Saturday. Of the total local transmission cases, majority of them were from four families,"" he added.""Among the positive cases were four members of a family from Qutbullapur, six of a family from the Old City and some people with a travel history to Delhi (religious work), doctors and staff working at the airport. In the Qutbullapur case, the person who returned from Delhi had not even informed his own family members about symptoms. As a result, the entire family got infected,"" the minister told the media on Saturday.As of now, 13,000 people were under surveillance and quarantine and the number might drop soon as many of them had completed the mandatory 14-day isolation period, he said.Claiming that there was no dearth of beds or equipment, the minister said 1,400 isolation beds and wards would be ready at the Gachibowli stadium in the next six days. The minister had earlier in the day inspected the stadium along with officials to oversee arrangements for providing temporary toilets and water supply.He urged the people not to panic and inform the government about people who had returned from foreign destination after March 1 and appealed to returnees to not try to escape from home quarantine. “If anybody tries to escape from home quarantine, they would be sent to jail,” he warned.While appealing to the people not to go to religious places, he said three positive cases had history of visiting places of worship in Delhi. “If one person tests positive, there is a chance of the entire family getting infected,” the health minister said.Urging people not to ostracise doctors working at Gandhi Hospitals in their neighbourhoods, he said the health department was considering bringing a shift system. “The government is considering giving them 10-day duty and an equal number of days leave,” the minister added.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74869050,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-774580,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/74-year-old-1st-covid-19-death-in-telangana-total-cases-67-as-8-more-positive/articleshow/74869044.cms

HYDERABAD: Eight migrants were killed after a truck rammed a Bolero goods vehicle in which they were travelling on the Outer Ring Road (ORR) near Pedda Golconda late Friday night. The accident, which happened around 10.50pm, has exposed poor vigil on highways during the lockdown.

The vehicle was carrying 31 migrant workers and their family members from Raichur and Yadgir districts of Karnataka. They were employed in an infrastructure company in Suryapet district and were going back to their native places in Karnataka due to the 21-day nationwide lockdown in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.

Police said five persons died on the spot and three succumbed at Osmania General Hospital (OGH). The deceased have been identified as Rangappa, 27, Sridevi, 8, Sharanappa, 25, Basamma, 25, Amaresh, 18, Hanumantha, 3, Subhash Shetty, 50, and Kollappa, 25. Three others were in a critical state.

The group started their journey between 6pm and 7pm on Friday and travelled nearly 150 kilometres, dodging police in Suryapet and Nalgonda districts and Rachakonda in the city. At Hayathnagar, the vehicle got on to the ORR. As they reached Pedda Golconda, their vehicle was hit from the rear by the DCM truck.

Both vehicles hit median, toppled before halting

In the pick-up vehicle, the driver created two compartments using wooden planks. Children and some women sat on the carrier floor, while the rest were made to sit on a platform attached to the driver’s cabin.

As the vehicles were on a steep stretch of the road, the DCM driver failed to notice the vehicle ahead of him and rammed the Bolero. After the collision, both the vehicles hit the median and toppled over it before halting.

“The DCM, with a Gujarat registration number, was moving from Vijayawada to Gujarat with a mango load. The DCM driver, Dilip, fled from the spot after the accident,’’ in-charge assistant commissioner of police (Shamshabad) Vishwa Prasad told TOI. Shamshabad police have booked a case against the DCM driver under Section 304-A (negligence causing death) of the IPC. It is learnt that the driver was in police custody.

Police found that the Bolero was arranged by a supervisor of the contractor. “The vehicle came from Raichur to pick up the workers. We found footage of the driver picking up the workers at company’s site in Suryapet. We registered a case under Section 304 II of IPC against the supervisor,’’ Suryapet superintendent of police Bhaskaran told TOI.
