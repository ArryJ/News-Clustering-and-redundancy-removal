0,2020/03/23,Candidates Chess Tournament | Ian Nepomniachtchi takes sole lead,"Ian Nepomniachtchi of host Russia became the first player to take the sole lead when he made China's Wang Hao pay the price for a terrible blunder in the fifth round of the Candidates Chess Tournament here on Sunday.

Nepomniachtchi, who had shared the lead overnight with Hao and France's Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, took his tally to 3.5 points.

Second spot

Vachier-Lagrave was in the sole second position with three points. Nine rounds remain.

Hao, who adopted his trusted Petrov's Defence, was comfortably placed until he erred on the 32nd move. He went on to lose a piece, and the game another 11 moves later.

1,2020/03/23,Chess | Koneru Humpy on the difficulties of training in the times of COVID-19 lockdown,"The Candidates tournament notwithstanding, chess too is badly affected as Europe has been the hub of the activity with many Indians featuring in the leagues there, especially in Spain.

Given that chess is an indoor sport, the Candidates tournament is on in Russia even though sporting events around the world have been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. But, contrary to general belief, not all chess players, confined indoors, can continue working on their game on the computer.

Ask World rapid champion Koneru Humpy, for instance. “You cannot afford any sort of distractions when training. And, this is different. A lockdown where everyone is forced to stay at home. Since I have to take care of my 30-month-old Ahana, it is not easy to spare time for chess,” she told The Hindu from Vijayawada. “Our normal daily schedule meant dropping her at my parents’ home and carry on the training. Now, since she cannot go out due to precautionary measures, it is a 24x7 job for Anvesh Dasari [her husband] and me,” she said.

Uncertainty

“Though this is not the first time I have had to take such a long break (the last one being when she was pregnant), this is different. There is uncertainty with what’s is happening around the world and in our country,” the 32-year-old Humpy said.

The Candidates tournament notwithstanding, chess too is badly affected as Europe has been the hub of the activity with many Indians featuring in the leagues there, especially in Spain.

With Italy being the worst-hit, Humpy is not sure if the FIDE Women’s Grand Prix Series scheduled there in May will be held.

“Though there is no official communication, given the grim scenario, it seems unlikely that it will be on,” the World No. 2 said.

The other major events lined up for her are the Olympiad in August in Moscow and the World knock-out championship for women in Belarus in September.

“About these two events we can be optimistic as things might improve by then given the measures being taken by the Governments here and elsewhere.” Humpy appealed to every citizen to be responsible and follow the guidelines of maintaining social distancing.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/160xsg/article31145391.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24HUMPY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/chess-koneru-humpy-on-the-difficulties-of-training-in-the-times-of-covid-19-lockdown/article31145392.ece
2,2020/03/23,To be or not to be?: Four philosophy podcasts you can listen to during Coronavirus lockdown,"Staying indoors for a while? We have you covered. For your weekly list of podcasts, we begin with the ones that cover philosophy. To be or not to be? You might get answers to such questions. Or, perhaps, you will end up with more existential dilemmas (like ‘Did I order an Oreo milkshake at the cafe yesterday out of free will or am I just part of a simulation?’) Nevertheless, we hope the following podcasts make you ponder about topics that aren’t considered quotidian.

Philosophize This!

One of the major criticisms of this podcast is that it doesn’t delve deep enough on philosophical concepts. Fair enough. This podcast won’t suffice if you are looking to get a PhD on the works of Plato. But podcaster Stephen West doesn’t promise that. He aims to introduce listeners to philosophy, usually with examples that are relatable.

You won’t feel like you are in a lecture hall. It is ideal, albeit not necessary, to start listening from the first episode as West covers philosophers through the ages — from the shabbily clothed Socrates, who roamed the streets of ancient Greece to the more fashionable 20th-century American philosopher Robert Nozick and others.

Episode length: 30+ minutes (on average). Available on: philosophizethis.org, Spotify, Apple Podcast and more.

The Partially Examined Life

It is self-described as “A philosophy podcast by some guys who were at one point set on doing philosophy for a living, but then thought better of it.”

Mark Linsenmayer, Seth Paskin and Wes Alwan — classmates at University of Texas, doing a master's degree in Philosophy — along with Dylan Casey run this podcast, which has crossed over 200 episodes.

With more than 27 million downloads since its inception, The Partially Examined Life Philosophy Podcast marked its 10th year anniversary last April with a public discussion of Aldous Huxley's iconic novel Brave New World at Manhattan.

Episodes usually involve the four guys discussing the topic with a special guest (including, at times, Hollywood celebrities) — you are, hence, spared of montone. And, the tone of the discussion itself is casual.

Episode length: 50+ minutes (on average). Available on partiallyexaminedlife.com, YouTube, Spotify and more.

Philosophy Talk

With three Stanford University professors (John Perry, Ken Taylor, and Joshua Landy) co-hosting the show, Philosophy Talk is probably the most academic podcast in this list. It’s a bit formal but never boring. The show is produced by KALW, a San Francisco-based public radio station, on behalf of Stanford University, as part of its Humanities Outreach Initiative.

The usually hour-long show is available in chunks on major podcast-streaming apps. It focuses on a philosophical concept or a philosopher and usually features an expert on the episode’s topic. As its motto suggests -- “the program that questions everything, except your intelligence” -- the topics vary from Descartes to genetic engineering.

Episode length: 10+ minutes (on average). Available on: philosophytalk.org, Google Podcasts, Spotify and more.

The Big Idea

Well, this isn’t strictly philosophy. You probably won’t find discussions and debates on Friedrich Nietzsche on BBC’s The Big Idea. The show, instead, talks about the events and concepts that have shaped and are shaping the world. It picks the best ideas from economics to psychology, neuroscience to philosophy, political science to anthropology, and makes them into nine-minute, easy-to-follow episodes.

It introduces an idea and provokes your thoughts on it. For instance, in the last episode on the podcast (published in September 2018) on afterlife, American philosopher Samuel Scheffler asks, “Suppose you knew that after your natural death the human race would die out – perhaps, for some reason, humans had become infertile. How would that alter how you live your life?”

3,2020/03/23,How the gaming community is benefitting from social distancing,"Video games in the time of Coronavirus: Multi-players, fitness experiences, gamified learning, and more; here’s why the gaming community is benefitting from social distancing.

Movie theatres and sports grounds might be experiencing restrictions but a small number of groups have benefited from the ongoing social distancing, and one of them is gamers. Yes, being stuck at home does have its perks.

Social media allows interaction to a certain point. You can rarely go beyond double-tapping for a like, popping in a comment or dropping a DM, but social gaming offers new types of communication. One is not just playing a game and streaming the progress live; there are active live chats for commentary and multi-player options.

Another bright side: no longer do you have to go out to buy a game disc (a reality which ended almost a decade ago), you can just install the game from the comfort of your couch.

Into the void...

Cosplayer Sameer Bundela is in lockdown in the U.S., having represented India at Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo 2020. Unable to explore the tourist sites, he has been indulging in a fair bit of gaming until the travel bans and social distancing restrictions lift, so that he may return home to Mumbai. “I have been able to discover games, especially on mobile, which I would not have been able to otherwise! Gaming is also a great heart-lightener as I can play with my friends back home. I’ve played multiplayer games like Call Of Duty: Warzone and Teamfight Tactics but I always find my way back to Dota.”

Developed by Electronic Arts, FIFA has seen more gaming sessions across India — given going outside in groups is discouraged. The game franchise is one of the biggest in the industry with annual releases since 1993, selling more than 350 million copies worldwide. FIFA falls into the sports simulation category of gaming, with trademark technologies such as Human Intelligence and True Player Motion. Sri Krishna Charan, a self-proclaimed FIFA addict living in Chennai, has been working from home, too. He says, “Since I live alone, it’s all I’ve been doing to beat the stress. Plus it’s a great way to connect with friends overseas. We’ve all been bingeing on FIFA 20 as well as Call Of Duty mobile battle royales.”

While he is not sure how long this shutdown will last, he still loves a good in-person live game-a-thon. “However, if social distancing is the way to go for a few months, then remotely playing together is the only option.”

Former gaming journalist Gagan Gupta, in Mumbai, has been gaming his whole life and has been working from home for the last year, so he sheds some light on what is trending in this industry. “MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online role playing games) like World Of Warcraft and Final Fantasy are actually on the lower-end in terms of popularity in India, as of the past few years. I’m seeing a lot of MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) games — like League Of Legends and Dota — as well as PUBG trending now,” he points out, “There are other popular games like Overwatch. I obviously play with my friends so I’ve been playing Destiny 2 (a free-to-play online-only multiplayer first-person shooter) and Doom Eternal (a first-person shooter).” Gagan adds that he does not stream his gaming sessions at all.

Love for live

According to Amazon-owned gaming streaming platform Twitch, there are just over 100 active Twitch streamers in the country. In the light of social distancing, the platform has seen a surge in views over the past couple of weeks globally. The idea with Twitch is that people follow their favourite let’s-players live-broadcast their progress in video games. Though the service is free, there are additional features such as subscriptions to each let’s-player costs around ₹375.

A screenshot of Twitch TV, the app for televisions

Data from Twitch Tracker shows that just between March 1 and March 15, there was a boost of 2,18,500 live viewers across channels and 14,500 active live channels, around the world. And, of course, on weekends, there are 16% more viewers than on weekdays; for them there are 17% more streams to choose from on Twitch.

For the younglings Of course, students at home from school will not have access to Twitch but they do have their own gaming experiences, but all to gamify learning and well-being.

STEPapp by Eduisfun Technologies is an educational gaming app launched recently. The company had approached the Tamil Nadu State government to launch this app in government schools so to help children learn maths and sciences concepts faster.

Family favourite Animal Crossing is widely popular among families who want to steer away from the usual tropes of video games. On March 20, Nintendo-exclusive Animal Crossing: New Horizons was released and Delhi-based Leena Gupta says her two children, aged 8 and 11, were long awaiting for the release. “While working from home, I have to understand that video games are not their babysitter but a supplementary recreation to their existing at-home school syllabus while also helping them improve reflexes.”

During the social distancing, Nintendo’s Ring Fit Adventure sold out internationally, too. The exercising action-RPG, popular across all ages, has a fitness-focussed experience in which there are two physical components: the Ring-Con, a flexible, hard-plastic ring held by the player and which one Joy-Con slots into, and a Leg Strap, a piece of fabric affixed to the user's leg that holds the other Joy-Con.

Plus, in the first 20 days of March, Twitch had already observed 671 million hours of livestream gaming while the average hours per month is around 750 million.

Why have let’s players become such a big deal now? A form of passive gaming for viewers who vicariously live through the moves made by the let’s-player, they also become a way to connect with a gamer. Some of the big let’s-players right now, locally and internationally, include TheRadBrad, Ninja, Indian Gamer and, of course, PewDiePie. “Watching someone is a skill-based experience. You watch to pick up on tips and to understand their choices, and it is a great entertainer, just like live sports,” explains Gagan.

Twitch is quite aware of the boost; in a March 17 blog post titled ‘How to use Twitch to support charities responding to COVID-19’, the company has listed out ways for gamers to link up with charities — such as Italian Red Cross, Save The Children, Direct Relief — which are active on the platform. They have also detailed a list of Best Practices for charity streams.

Whatever the (stereotypical) image of a gamer that comes to mind, one cannot refute that they have mastered social distancing long before many of us could. Want to join this gaming revolution? We recommend Minecraft (of course), The Walking Dead, Firewatch, Mario Party, Monument Valley, Pokemon Go and Sayonara: Wild Hearts.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/882f0q/article31143958.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym22game,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/muli-players-fitness-experiences-gamified-learning-and-more-heres-why-the-gaming-community-is-benefitting-from-social-distancing/article31143959.ece
4,2020/03/23,Tech giants partner with U.S. government to provide resources for COVID-19 research,"From volunteering to manufacturing masks and ventilators to ramping up production of essential medical supplies and general items, the country’s private sector have joined America’s war against coronavirus in a big way, President Donald Trump said

U.S.-based global tech giants, including IBM, Amazon, Google and Microsoft, have partnered with the White House to “unleash the power of American supercomputing resources” for combating the novel coronavirus, President Donald Trump has said.

“They’ll be working along with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and all of the people that are working on this (COVID-19 research),” Trump said.

The NIH is the primary agency of the U.S. government responsible for biomedical and public health research.

Trump said U.S.-based multinational conglomerate Honeywell will immediately expand its personal protective equipment manufacturing operations in Rhode Island to produce millions of additional N95 masks for the U.S. government strategic national stockpile. These masks will then be delivered to various States.

“This expansion is already under way and it’s going to provide a lot of jobs for that state (Rhode Island), probably around 500,” Trump said.

The President said the White House has been receiving calls from private sector companies, volunteering to manufacture essential commodities.

“Hanes, who makes things of cotton...They call us and said we’re going to make millions of masks. We got a call today the head of 3M, they’re going to make tremendous products, and they’re more or less in that business,” he said, adding that major auto manufacturers, like the General Motors and the Ford, too have talked to the White House about manufacturing ventilators.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/rknj8p/article31140457.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23NETCORONAVIRUSAMAZON,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/tech-giants-partner-with-us-government-to-provide-resources-for-covid-19-research/article31140458.ece

7,2020/03/23,U.S. couple helps the homeless amid crisis,"Felix Guzman and wife Virna distribute supplies in New York City’s streets

As confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections have risen over 11,000 in New York City and its suburbs, the city that never sleeps has taken on an eerie gloom.

Social distancing and government orders restricting mass gatherings to stem the spread of the aggressive respiratory disease have emptied major tourist attractions and left retail promenades dark, especially punishing retailers and business owners who rely on foot traffic to stay afloat.

Along those lonesome sidewalks homeless New Yorkers remain, unprotected from the elements and a disease that passes swiftly between people often without any sign or symptom.

Vast sea of need

In this vast sea of need, Felix and Virna Guzman insist on doing their part, one bag of hand sanitising wipes and pair of gloves at a time. “I’m working every day in the city because I’m working in the elevator construction,” said Mr. Guzman, 52, a native of Ecuador, on a cold Saturday morning.

“I saw so many homeless. So that’s why I came home to my house and I told my wife, ‘Listen, why don’t we do this? We have a lot of extra paper towels. We have extra gloves. We have extra wipes.” For nearly two weeks, the couple has travelled an hour south from their home in Buchanan, New York, to deliver supplies to those in need. The couple sees the effort as honouring their good fortune in life. “I always think about my kids,” said Virna Munoz-Guzman, 52, originally from Peru, who works in a supermarket. “I think that maybe one day my kids might need something and somebody else will come and give it to them.”

Despite requests that people remain at home, Mr. Guzman insists he and his wife take every precaution against contraction. “Before we come into the house, we leave everything out, all clothes, shoes, and everything,” said Mr. Guzman. “We almost come into the house naked. We go straight into the shower.”

Offering to volunteer

As a shutdown of all non-essential personnel looms over the city, the Guzmans wish to continue helping if the government would offer them a way.

“I’ve never volunteered, just in my church in Buchanan,” Mr. Guzman said. “But before for the government, I don’t do anything before. If they request me, if they want to me help them now, yes, I can do it.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/d4r0pw/article31145873.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24-US-ASSISTANCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-couple-helps-the-homeless-amid-crisis/article31145874.ece
8,2020/03/23,COVID-19 pandemic ‘accelerating’: WHO chief,"“It took 67 days from the first reported case to reach the first 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000 cases and just four days for the third 100,000 cases.”

The new COVID-19 pandemic is clearly “accelerating”, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Monday, but said it was still possible to change its trajectory by going on the attack. The remarks came as the number of deaths soared past 15,000, with more than 3,41,000 people infected worldwide, according to a tally compiled by AFP from official sources.

“The pandemic is accelerating,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual news conference. He said it took 67 days from the beginning of the outbreak in China in December for the virus to infect the first 1,00,000 people worldwide. In comparison, it took 11 days for the second 1,00,000 cases and just four days for the third 1,00,000 cases, he said. The number of officially recorded cases is believed to represent only a fraction of the true number of infections, with many countries only testing the most severe cases in need of hospitalisation. “We are not helpless bystanders. We can change the trajectory of this pandemic,” Mr. Tedros said.

Physical distancing could buy time by slowing down the spread, “but they are defensive measures that will not help us to win,” he warned. “To win, we need to attack the virus with aggressive and targeted tactics,” he said, reiterating a call for “testing every suspected case, isolating and caring for every confirmed case and tracing and quarantining every close contact.”

On lockdown mode

Some 1.7 billion people have been asked to stay home in over 50 countries and territories around the world, according to an AFP tally on Monday. Some countries have imposed mandatory lockdown measures, while others have issued stay-at-home recommendations to stem the spread of the virus.

Lockdowns in parts of India alone have kept some 700 million people hemmed in. At least 34 more countries and territories have also established mandatory lockdown measures ordering people to stay in their homes, accounting for some 659 million people. France, Italy, Argentina, the U.S. State of California, Iraq and Rwanda have also rolled out enforced lockdowns. Greece is the most recent country to impose mandatory confinement measures, which came into effect on Monday morning. Colombia will enforce an obligatory lockdown on Tuesday and New Zealand will follow suit on Wednesday. In most cases, it is still possible for people to go to work, buy essentials or seek medical care.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/yqb56u/article31145239.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TedrosAdhanomGhebreyesus-23mar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-pandemic-accelerating-who-chief/article31145224.ece
9,2020/03/23,Pompeo in Kabul to break deadlock,"Both Ghani and Abdullah claim Afghan presidency

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in the Afghan capital on Monday to help break a poisonous political deadlock that has further riven the country just as the Taliban is increasing attacks and a rise in COVID-19 cases threatens an already-floundering peace process.

Afghanistan has been enmeshed in a political crisis since elections last year left the country in disarray due to numerous fraud claims that ultimately saw two men claiming the presidency and holding separate inaugurations. Mr. Pompeo was to hold both separate and joint meetings with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani — the election’s official winner — along with his arch-rival Abdullah Abdullah, who also claims the presidency.

“We have tried... for the last several weeks to try to find the formula and encourage them to come to an agreement,” a senior State Department official said, according to a pool report.

The visit comes just a day after the Afghan government and Taliban held their first discussion on prisoner exchanges — a key step in a broader push for peace following a withdrawal deal signed between Washington and the militants.The agreement established a framework for bringing to an end America’s longest war.

A hiker descending Mount Washington who fell about 200 feet (60.9 m) and got hurt was rescued with the help of the Cog Railway train that takes visitors up and down the summit during tourism season. New Hampshire Fish and Game conservation officers said the hiker, Ashley Furness, 35, of Bartlett, was with a companion on Sunday afternoon when she slipped and fell, striking several rocks.

She was descending along the railway tracks and was about 2 miles up from the railway station. “It was these rocks that ultimately saved her from plunging into the ravine, a fall that would have likely proved fatal,” Lt. Mark Ober, Jr. said. “Her companion was able to descend to her position, place a call for help and keep her warm with a space blanket until rescuers arrived.”

Rescuers could only get so far using an ATV and snowmobiles. There was no snow. Crews hiked the rest of the way and reached Ms. Furness after several hours, but injuries were severe and she couldn’t walk, said Lt. Ober.

Due to the steep, icy, terrain and remote location, the Cog Railway prepared a train to retrieve Ms. Furness. In the meantime, a rescue belay was set up with ropes and other gear to hoist Ms. Furness up to the tracks. The train reached her and returned to a waiting ambulance at the base around 11 p.m. on Sunday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/98d5z/article31144978.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24-US-HIKERSSURVIVAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-hiker-survives-200-foot-fall/article31144980.ece
11,2020/03/23,Coronavirus | Bangladesh declares 10-day nationwide holiday,"Public transport services would be restricted during the holidays, which begins with March 26, the country’s Independence Day.

Bangladesh on Monday declared a 10-day nationwide holiday from March 26 and called out the Army to enforce social distancing to curb the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) infection that has claimed over 15,000 lives globally. All government- and private offices will be closed from March 26 to April 4.

“The holidays will begin with the March 26 Independence Day holiday in view of the COVID-19 situation, Cabinet Secretary Khondker Anwarul Islam told a media briefing in the capital.

The top bureaucrat of the country added that troops were called out to enforce social distancing as the most crucial means to prevent the spread of the pandemic which has claimed three lives in the country. Bangladesh has reported 33 coronavirus cases so far.

Mr. Islam said the public transport services would be restricted during the holidays when all government- and private offices, except those involved in emergency services including law enforcement and health facilities, would remain shut.

Watch: What will be affected and what will we available during a lockdown?

He said despite repeated calls to the public to stay indoors, some families were found to be holidaying, a situation that he described to justify the military deployment. One coronavirus patient, who died of infection, was feared to have infected some others after going to a mosque despite his illness.

Mr. Islam, accompanied by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s principal secretary and armed forces division officials, said the low-income people could return to their villages where they would be provided with the government aid or they could take refuge in Bhashanchar Island in Bay of Bengal.

Infrastructures were developed in the island under a government plan to relocate over a million of Rohingya refugees who fled a military crackdown in Myanmar’s Rakhine state in August 2017.

The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in its latest briefing on Monday said during the past 24 hours six more people were found to be infected with coronavirus, one of them being a doctor and two other nurses.

The IEDCR said they tested have 56 people in the last 24 hours while a total of 620 people had been tested so far. Reports said lack of required equipment barred health authorities to examine suspected cases.

Several public hospitals across the country set up isolation units for possible coronavirus patients, but a lot of them lack adequate resources and equipment including personal protective equipment (PPE) to provide necessary services.

According to media reports, many doctors, nurses and staff members were finding it difficult to continue work owing to the growing risk of infection.

Health Minister Zahid Maleque, however, said, “We still do not need PPE that desperately” and no one makes PPE pre-emptively as none can prepare everything in advance”.

“We had preparation and that is why we managed to quarantine 20,000 people,” he said.

12,2020/03/23,"COVID-19 | Toll in Iran rises to 1,812 with 127 new deaths","The numbers provided by the Health Ministry in recent days indicated that the spread of the virus had worsened, especially in the northern and central regions of Iran.

Iran on Monday announced 127 new deaths from the novel coronavirus, raising the official toll to 1,812 in one of the worst hit countries along with Italy, Spain and China.

Health ministry spokesman Kianouche Jahanpour said 1,411 new cases had been recorded in Iran over the past 24 hours, bringing the total of those infected to 23,049. Mr. Jahanpour, who was speaking during his daily news conference devoted to the pandemic, said he would no longer give a breakdown of cases by province.

This was necessary, he said, to avoid sparking undue concern among residents of the most stricken areas and ensure that those in less affected zones remained cautious. All of Iran’s 31 provinces have been hit by the novel coronavirus outbreak.

The numbers provided by the Health Ministry in recent days indicated that the spread of the virus had worsened, especially in the northern and central regions of Iran. Mr. Jahanpour renewed a call by authorities for people to stay at home until “the virus is conquered.”

That call has come as the Islamic country is celebrating the Iranian New Year, a time when people usually travel far and wide across the country for holidays and family reunions. Authorities, however, have not imposed any travel ban or lockdown where the Nowruz holiday continues until April 3.

13,2020/03/23,Coronavirus | U.K. plans curfews if social distancing rules ignored,"The warning comes as Parliament is set to speed through emergency legislation that would grant powers aimed at tackling the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic, with 5,683 confirmed cases and 281 deaths in the U.K.

The U.K. government on Monday warned that tougher lock-down measures, including curfews akin to those in place in other European countries such as France and Italy, would have to be enforced to limit the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) “if selfish people continued to put lives in danger by not following social distancing rules.”

The warning comes as Parliament is set to speed through emergency legislation that would grant powers aimed at tackling the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic, with 5,683 confirmed cases and 281 deaths in the U.K.

The Coronavirus Bill will create powers for the police to disperse people or keep them indoors. The proposals, to be time-limited for two years, could also include complete airport shutdowns, fast-tracking funeral arrangements, and allowing more court hearings to take place by phone or video.

“If people go within two metres of others who they don’t live with then they’re helping to spread the virus — and the consequences of that costs lives and it means that, for everyone, this will go on for longer. It’s very selfish,” said the U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock, in reference to images of swathes of people in parks and other open spaces over the weekend.

Asked if the Cabinet would be considering curfews and a firmer lockdown at its regular meeting on Monday, he added: “Nothing is off the table. Of course we are looking at what other European countries are doing.”

With Britain’s outbreak believed to be around two weeks behind Italy’s — the worst-hit country — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is coming under pressure to use the police to enforce official advice urging people to stay at home and avoid social contact.

Of course, I want people to be able to go to the parks and open spaces and to enjoy themselves — it is crucial for health and mental and physical well-being. But please follow the advice and don’t think that fresh air in itself automatically provides some immunity, Mr. Johnson said on Sunday evening during his daily Downing Street briefing.

You have to stay two metres apart; you have to follow the social-distancing advice and as I have said throughout this process we will keep the implementation of these measures under constant review and, yes of course, we will bring forward further measures if we think that is necessary, he said, reminding people that all schools will be shut from Monday except for a minority of children of key workers.

Asked to elaborate on what the tougher measures could look like, he said that curfews and prohibitions on movement have not been ruled out.

Britain remains in near-lockdown, with pubs, bars, cinemas and other social venues shut down since Friday and public transport is being curtailed to essential services as people are told to work from home.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: Unless people stay at home, unless people stop using public transport unless it’s essential, unless people stop interacting with each other, more people will die.

The U.K. government said it is setting up “hubs” around the country to arrange deliveries of groceries and medicines to the nearly 1.5-million most at-risk people, who have been sent letters to stay at home for 12 weeks. Those in the category include people with specific cancers, severe respiratory conditions and people who have received organ transplants.

Councils, pharmacists and members of the U.K.’s Armed Forces will help with distributing essentials to this vulnerable group, with opportunities for members of the public to volunteer.

Pakistan on Monday said the total number of coronavirus cases in the country stood at 799, even as the Army resolved to put together all resources to tackle the infection which has claimed nearly 15,000 lives globally.

At least five people have died, while six have recovered from COVID-19 so far, according to the country’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

Of the total 799 virus cases, Sindh province accounted for with 352 cases, Punjab 225, Balochistan 104, Gilgit-Baltistan 71, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 31, Islamabad 15 and 1 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

However, private media houses said there were at least 803 COVID-19 cases in the country with six deaths.

In a special corps commanders’ conference, chaired by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa, the military leadership resolved to put together all resources to defeat the novel coronavirus.

The COAS reviewed the countrywide spread of COVID-19 and the Army’s readiness to assist the civil administration.

The coronavirus outbreak resulted in the low-key celebrations of the annual Pakistan Day.

Pakistan Day recognises the resolution passed by the then All India Muslim League on March 23, 1940 which demanded a separate country.

The day is traditionally marked by a colourful military and cultural parade in capital Islamabad. However, all planned events were cancelled on Monday.

In separate messages, President Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Imran Khan urged the people to show utmost unity, discipline and passion to fight the coronavirus.

“The Pakistani nation has the capability to face any ordeal and God willing, we will stand victorious in this test,” Prime Minister Khan said.

Mr. Khan on Sunday ruled out a complete nationwide lockdown, saying it will create chaos. However, Sindh and Gilgit-Baltistan provincial governments declared lockdowns on Sunday midnight.

Reports showed the police patrolling major cities of Sindh, including Karachi, and arresting persons seen outside homes.

The United States currently has some 11 million undocumented people, several hundred thousands of whom are from India and South Asia.

The coronavirus outbreak, that first emerged in China’s Wuhan city, has killed 14,641 people with 336,000 cases reported in 173 countries and territories, According to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker.

We will test (illegal) person (for coronavirus) because I think it’s important that we test that person and we don’t want to send that person back into wherever we’re going to be sending, whether it’s another country or some other place..., Trump told reporters at the White House news conference.

Mr. Trump was responding to a question if undocumented persons are welcomed at a coronavirus testing sites.

“Can they show up and be tested without fear of being reported to immigration officials for possible deportation? he was asked.

US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said virus doesn’t judge based on where one is from.

“So it is important that we try to get people tested who have symptoms. But the important thing that we really want people to hear is that patients need to be tested. We need to prioritise our healthcare workers, he said.

Vice President Mike Pence said that the Department of Homeland Security has addressed this issue. Customs and Border Protection actually issued guidance that leaving certain circumstances, customs and border protection does not target emergency rooms or health clinics.

Mr. Trump said that undocumented workers will be tested too.

“Yes, I’ll answer that. And if that’s not the policy, I’ll make it the policy. I was just saying, as Mike (Pence) was saying, the answer is yes, he said.

We will do this test because I think in that case, it’s important, Trump said.

19,2020/03/23,Croatia quake injures 17 amid partial coronavirus lockdown,"Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said the earthquake was the biggest in Zagreb in the last 140 years.

A strong earthquake in Croatia on Sunday caused panic, the evacuation of hospitals and widespread damage including to the capital’s iconic cathedral — all amid a partial coronavirus lockdown.

A 15-year-old was reported to be in critical condition and 16 other people were injured, authorities said.

The European seismological agency, EMSC, said the 5.3 earthquake struck a wide area north of the capital, Zagreb, at 6:23 a.m. (0523 GMT). The epicenter was 7 kilometers (4 miles) north of Zagreb at a depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles).

At least four weaker temblors followed the initial quake.

Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said the earthquake was the biggest in Zagreb in the last 140 years.

Many buildings cracked and walls and rooftops were damaged. Streets were littered with debris. Concrete slabs fell on cars and chimneys landed in front of entrances.

Footage from the scene showed mothers dressed in nightgowns hugging their newborn babies in a parking lot as they evacuated a damaged maternity hospital amid freezing temperatures. The women, newborn babies and incubators were being moved to a new location with the help of the army.

Zagreb’s iconic cathedral was also damaged, with the top of one of its two spires collapsing. The cathedral was rebuilt after it toppled in the 1880 earthquake.

Power was cut as people ran out of their homes. Several fires were also reported. Residents shared photos of belongings falling off shelves, broken bottles and glass inside homes.

Officials first said a 15-year-old was killed, but doctors later said that she was in critical condition and that they were fighting to save her life. They gave no immediate details on the extent of other injuries.

The earthquake struck amid a partial lockdown of the capital because of the spread of the coronavirus. People were told to avoid public areas, such as parks and public squares, but had little choice as they fled their residences.

Up to five people are allowed to be together while keeping a distance.

Health Minister Vili Beros warned people to keep a 2-meter (7-foot) social distance” as requested by decrees passed by the government in an attempt to prevent the spread of COVID-19. There are 235 coronavirus cases confirmed so far in Croatia.

Earthquakes are dangerous, but coronavirus is even more so,” Mr. Beros said, as people rushed out of their homes to congregate in city parks.

Some of Zagreb residents disagreed.

Earthquakes are more important than the coronavirus. If the earthquake hits, and you are under a door, you worry about yourself first and then the mask later, Paul, a man from Peru who lives in Zagreb, told a local TV station. He gave only his first name.

Mr. Plenkovic, the prime minister, urged citizens to remain calm and return to their homes where possible in the central parts of Zagreb, which sustained the most damage.

We have two parallel crisis that contradict each other, Plenkovic said after an emergency meeting of Croatia’s top officials.

Croatian soldiers wearing masks and carrying shovels could be seen helping efforts to clear the damage on the streets of Zagreb. Top officials toured the damaged areas as some citizens criticized city authorities over the poor states of buildings in the old part of the city, some of which date to the 19th century.

“We will try to clear the streets as soon as possible,” the prime minister said. Stay outside your homes and keep distance. Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic said the situation was complicated by the restrictive virus-related measures in place.

We face two simultaneous crises, one is unpredictable and the other is invisible,” Mr. Bozinovic said.

There are rules for when there is an earthquake, but when there is an earthquake at the same time when there is a global pandemic, then it’s a much more complex situation, he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9q14co/article31140193.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CROATIA-QUAKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/croatia-quake-injures-17-amid-partial-coronavirus-lockdown/article31140194.ece

New York tops the list with more than 15,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, with 5,418 new cases added in the 24 hours alone. As many as 114 people in New York have died of which 58 were reported in a day.

Painting a grim picture, Mayor Bill de Blasio said New York is headed towards a major shortage of essential medical supply in next 10 days.

“We’re about 10 days away from seeing widespread shortages. If we don’t get more ventilators people will die,” he said.

In White House, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters that so far, more than 2,50,000 Americans have been tested for coronavirus.

Mr. Trump said that he was rushing all necessary supplies to New York. He has issued Major Disaster Declarations for New York, California and Washington.

“We have large quantities of medical equipment and supplies on the way to those states... Respirators, surgical masks and gowns, face shields, coveralls and gloves in large quantities are already being delivered to Washington and New York,” he said.

Mr. Trump also said that he has directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to supply four large federal medical stations with 1,000 beds for New York, eight large federal medical stations with 2,000 beds for California and three large federal medical stations and four small federal medical stations with 1,000 beds for the State of Washington.

The U.S. President also approved deployment of National Guards in New York.

The supplies en route to California and New York will be delivered within the 48 hours, Trump announced. The president has been holding daily White House news conference for about 10 days now, with each lasting for more than an hour.

Mr. Trump said two naval hospital ships were being deployed in New York and Los Angeles, while thousands of surgical masks have been delivered to all these states.

A process is on to massively increase the availability of testing kits, which are fast and quick, he said.

Terming this a challenging time for all Americans, Mr. Trump said, “We’re enduring a great national trial, and we will prove that we can meet the moment.” Assured the people that he was doing everything possible to confront and ultimately defeat this “horrible invisible enemy“.

“We’re at war. In a true sense, we’re at war and we’re fighting an invisible enemy. For those worried and afraid, please know as long as I am your president, you can feel confident that you have a leader who will always fight for you. I will not stop until we win,” Mr. Trump said.

21,2020/03/23,New Zealand prepares to enter lockdown as coronavirus cases double,"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said these decisions will place the most significant restriction on New Zealanders' movements in modern history, but it was needed to save lives and slow the virus.

New Zealand said on Monday it will move to its highest alert level imposing self-isolation, with all-non-essential services, schools and offices to be shut over the next 48 hours as the number of coronavirus cases more than double.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said these decisions will place the most significant restriction on New Zealanders' movements in modern history, but it was needed to save lives and slow the virus.

“We are all now preparing to go into self isolation as a nation,” Ms. Ardern said in a news conference. She added that without these measures tens of thousands of New Zealanders could die.

The number of coronavirus cases in New Zealand shot up to 102, more than double since Friday, as the country reported 36 new infections. New Zealand has had no deaths.

Ms. Ardern said the cabinet agreed that effective immediately, the country of 5 million people would move into alert level 3 nationwide, and after 48 hours it will be at the highest level 4. New Zealand has already closed its borders to foreigners.

Ardern said all bars, restaurants, cafes, gyms, cinemas, pools, museums, libraries, playgrounds and any other place where the public congregate must close their face-to-face function.

She said supermarkets, doctors, pharmacies, service stations, access to essential banking services will all be available throughout New Zealand at every alert level.

“If you do not have immediate needs, do not go to the supermarket. It will be there for you today, tomorrow, and the day after that,” she added.

The move comes after neighbouring Australia, which has thousands of COVID-19 cases, started lockdown measures on Monday, but has stopped short of self-isolation.

New Zealand's bourse reacted immediately to the announcement plunging 10% to biggest intraday percentage drop ever.

Finance Minister Grant Robertson said all rents will be freezed and the government will announce further support for the economy in the coming days.

“To be absolutely clear we are now asking all New Zealanders who are outside essential services to stay at home, and to stop all interactions with others outside of those in your household,” Ardern said.

Schools will be closed from Tuesday, except for children of essential workers such as our doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers and police. Schools will close entirely from midnight Wednesday.

All indoor and outdoor events will be cancelled. All workplaces were asked to implement alternative ways of working.

Public transport will shut for everyone outside of people working in essential services.

To stop community transmission these measures will need to be in place for 4 weeks, said Ardern.

New Zealand's opposition National Party said it had put on hold its campaign for a general election on Sept 19. Ardern said there was no impact on the election for now.

Of the new cases, two are being treated as related to community transmission, Ministry of Health's Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said in a news conference on Monday.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said for the first time on Monday that the Tokyo Olympic Games may need to be postponed if the event cannot be held in its “complete form” due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Sunday after an emergency meeting that it is stepping up its “scenario planning” for the 2020 Games due to start on July 24, including a possible postponement.

Mr. Abe said that while cancelling the Games was not an option, a delay was now on the cards if that was the only way to hold the event in its complete form.

“If that becomes difficult, we may have no option but to consider postponing the Games,” he told parliament.

He said he had conveyed his views to Tokyo Games chief Yoshiro Mori on Sunday evening, who then discussed the issue with IOC President Thomas Bach.

Under mounting pressure from athletes, federations and national committees to postpone the Games, the IOC did a partial U-turn on Sunday after long insisting, with Tokyo organisers, that the Games would go ahead as planned.

Tokyo 2020 organisers have started drafting alternative dates for the Olympics, sources have told Reuters.

More than 13,000 people have died globally since the coronavirus outbreak began in China late last year, with the epicentre now in Europe.

As of Sunday morning, Japan had 37 deaths and 1,055 coronavirus cases, excluding those from a cruise ship that was quarantined near Tokyo last month and returnees on chartered flights from China, a tally by public broadcaster NHK showed.

Mr. Abe said all travelers from the United States, including Japanese citizens, would be asked to go into quarantine for 14 days after their arrival in Japan.

In the United States nearly one in three residents has been ordered to stay at home to slow the spread of the flu-like virus as cases nationwide topped 32,000, with more than 415 dead, according to a Reuters tally.

23,2020/03/23,Coronavirus | Singapore Airlines grounds most of its fleet as travel bans bite,"The move comes as global travel hub Singapore closed its borders to travellers and transiting passengers in an effort to stem the spread of the virus.

Singapore Airlines Ltd announced on Monday that it would cut capacity by 96% and ground almost all of its fleet in response to coronavirus travel restrictions that the carrier said was “the greatest challenge” it had ever faced.

Shares of the airline were down more than 8% by 0129 GMT, while the broader market was down over 7%.

The move comes as global travel hub Singapore closed its borders to travellers and transiting passengers in an effort to stem the spread of the virus.

Globally, a shattered airline industry is now seeking state bail-outs to absorb the shock from the pandemic, as widespread travel curbs have forced many to ground fleets and place thousands of workers on unpaid leave to stay afloat.

“This will result in the grounding of around 138 SIA and SilkAir aircraft, out of a total fleet of 147, amid the greatest challenge that the SIA Group has faced in its existence,” Singapore Airlines said in a statement announcing the cut in planned capacity scheduled up to end April.

The airline said its low-cost carrier Scoot will also suspend most of its network, resulting in the grounding of 47 of its fleet of 49 aircraft.

“It is unclear when the SIA Group can begin to resume normal services, given the uncertainty as to when the stringent border controls will be lifted,” the airline said.

Singapore Airlines said it was looking to shore up its liquidity and reduce capital expenditure and operating costs while also asking aircraft manufacturers to defer upcoming deliveries and salary cuts for management.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/q9ns1f/article31139888.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINA-HEALTHSINGAPOREAIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-singapore-airlines-grounds-most-of-its-fleet-as-travel-bans-bite/article31139889.ece

The United Arab Emirates announced on March 23 it will temporarily suspend all passenger and transit flights amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.

The Emirati authorities ""have decided to suspend all inbound and outbound passenger flights and the transit of airline passengers in the UAE for two weeks as part of the precautionary measures taken to curb the spread of the COVID-19"", reported the official state news agency, WAM.

It said the decision — which is subject to review in two weeks — will take effect in 48 hours, adding: ""Cargo and emergency evacuation flights would be exempt.""

The UAE, whose international airports in Abu Dhabi and Dubai are major hubs, announced on Friday its first two deaths from the COVID-19 disease, having reported more than 150 cases so far.

Monday's announcement came hours after Dubai carrier Emirates announced it would suspend all passenger flights by March 25. But the aviation giant then reversed its decision, saying it ""received requests from governments and customers to support the repatriation of travellers"" and will continue to operate passenger flights to 13 destinations. Emirates had said it will continue to fly to the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Australia, South Africa, the United States and Canada.

Kentucky Senator Rand Paul says he has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.

The Republican is the first member of the Senate to report testing positive.

He said in a tweet Sunday that he is feeling fine and is in quarantine.

Paul, a doctor, said he has not had symptoms and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. Paul said he was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person.

Greece confirmed 94 new cases on Sunday, its largest single-day jump, taking its total to 624, with 15 deaths, up two.

Citing Italy, which reported almost 800 new deaths on Saturday, Mitsotakis said it was his duty to prevent such a tragedy hitting Greece.

27,2020/03/23,Coronavirus | Germany's Merkel goes into quarantine after contact with infected doctor,"“The great aim is to gain time in the fight against the virus,” she says

German Chancellor Angela Merkel went into quarantine on Sunday after coming into contact with a coronavirus-infected doctor shortly after announcing more curbs on social interaction to slow the spread of the disease.

Ms. Merkel, will continue her work from home and will submit to repeated tests over the next few days, her spokesman said in a statement, adding it was too soon for a conclusive test yet.

Watch | COVID-19: Dos and don'ts from the Health Ministry

The Chancellor had on Friday afternoon received a vaccine shot against pneumococcus, a pneumonia-causing bacteria, from a doctor who later tested positive for coronavirus, according to the statement.

Ms. Merkel earlier on Sunday said in a televised press briefing that Germany would ban public meetings of more than two people, amid a raft of further measures.

“The great aim is to gain time in the fight against the virus,” she said, citing an agreement between the federal government and regional states.

No to social gathering

For at least the next two weeks, people will not be allowed to form groups of three or more in public unless they live together in the same household, or the gathering is work-related, she added.

Restaurants can only serve patrons via takeaway, while hairdressers and beauty, massage and tattoo parlours must close.

Governments in Europe, the epicentre of the global pandemic, have escalated their emergency responses amid a rising death toll.

Italy banned travel within the country after freezing non-essential business activity. Spain wants to extend until April 11 a state of emergency it imposed this month.

Regional states in Germany had previously taken differing approaches in the fight against the virus. Bavaria and smaller Saarland had gone furthest, imposing restrictions to keep people inside their homes save for a number of work-related exceptions.

“We are reducing public life and social interaction further and we are making sure to impose the same rules in principle across Germany,” Ms. Merkel said.

Last year, Ms. Merkel suffered several bouts of shaking at public events, sparking speculation about her health.

“I am aware of the responsibility of my office,” she told reporters last July after the tremor episodes. “I behave appropriately as far as my health is concerned ... I look after my health.”

Ms. Merkel has said she will not seek a fifth term as chancellor in federal elections due by October 2021. She has loomed large on the European stage since 2005, helping guide the EU through the euro zone crisis and opening Germany's doors to migrants fleeing war in the Middle East in 2015, a move that still divides the bloc and her country.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/frrfks/article30300066.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANGELA-MERKEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-germanys-merkel-goes-into-quarantine-after-contact-with-infected-doctor/article31137970.ece

After Netflix and YouTube, Facebook and Instagram have lowered their video quality in Europe as streaming surge.

Facebook and Instagram will “temporarily reduce” video bit rates in Europe to help partners handle Internet “bandwidth constraints” as more people stay at home amid the growing new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, reports Engadget.

“To help alleviate any potential network congestion, we will temporarily reduce bit rates for videos on Facebook and Instagram in Europe,” the social media platform said in a statement.

“We are committed to working with our partners to manage any bandwidth constraints during this period of heavy demand, while also ensuring people are able to remain connected using Facebook apps and services during the COVID-19 pandemic”.

Facebook has over 300 million daily users in Europe.

Amazon as well as Apple have also announced they will reduce streaming quality in Europe in order to lessen the load on broadband network.

In India, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has written to over-the-top (OTT) streaming platforms to ensure smooth video streaming across the country as people are staying indoors and taking to work-from-home amid the coronavirus crisis.

The industry body has also written a letter to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) urging the government to issue advisories to the players concerned on this issue.

The COAI further said there are various measures that the streaming platform companies can undertake in the current situation.

One such measure is temporarily moving to SD (Standard Definition) rather than HD (High Definition) streaming, it said, adding that there may be other such technical measures that may be taken to ease the pressure on infrastructure.

Celebrated opera singer Placido Domingo has tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The 79-year-old Spanish tenor revealed his diagnosis on his Facebook page.

“I feel it is my moral duty to announce to you that I have tested positive for COVID-19. My Family and I are all in self-isolation for as long as it is deemed medically necessary,” he wrote.

Domnigo said he decided to get tested after experiencing “fever and cough symptoms”, but he and his family are in “good health” now.

“I beg everyone to be extremely careful, follow the basic guidelines by washing your hands frequently, keeping at least a six-foot distance from others, doing everything you can to stop the virus from spreading and please, above all, stay home if you can,” he wrote.

“Together we can fight this virus and stop the current worldwide crisis, so we can hopefully return to our normal daily lives very soon. Please follow your local government’s guidelines and regulations for staying safe and protecting not just yourselves, but our entire community,” Domingo added.

Earlier this year, Domingo was in the news for facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment and apologised for ""the hurt"" caused to his accusers, saying he accepted full responsibility for his actions.

Domingo joins a growing list of celebrities that have tested positive for coronavirus, including Idris Elba, Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson, Kevin Durant, former Bond girl Olga Kurylenko, Frozen 2 actor Rachel Matthews, Daniel Dae Kim, Game of Thrones stars Indira Varma and Kristofer Hivju, and celebrated TV host Andy Cohen.

30,2020/03/23,"Harvey Weinstein tests positive for coronavirus in prison, says official","Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison for sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi and raping aspiring actor Jessica Mann

Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who is serving a prison sentence for sexual assault and rape, has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the head of the state corrections officers union.

Weinstein, 68, has been placed in isolation at Wende Correctional Facility, said Michael Powers, president of the New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association.

Powers said he learned that the test came back positive on Sunday morning and is concerned about the corrections officers, who he said lack proper protective equipment. Several staff have been quarantined, Powers said.

Weinstein arrived at Wende Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison east of Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday after being housed at New York City's Rikers Island jail.

He was sentenced to 23 years in prison on March 11 for sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi and raping Jessica Mann, a onetime aspiring actress.

Following the sentencing, Weinstein spent time at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan for heart problems, according to his spokesperson, Juda Engelmayer. He also has other medical issues, including diabetes and high blood pressure.

A lawyer for Weinstein said on Sunday night that his legal team had not been notified of the coronavirus diagnosis. ”Given Mr. Weinstein's state of health, we are of course concerned, if this is the case, and we are vigilantly monitoring the situation,” said lawyer Imran Ansari, who is based in New York.

The Niagara Gazette, a local newspaper in upstate New York, reported that Weinstein had tested positive for the highly contagious virus earlier Sunday, citing anonymous officials.

Two prisoners at the Wende Facility have confirmed cases of COVID-19, a state prison official told Reuters. The official said he could not comment on any individual prisoner's medical record.

The official told Reuters that, with each confirmed case, the Department of Corrections works with the Department of Health to identify potentially exposed people.

Mark David Chapman, who murdered Beatle John Lennon in 1980, served some of his time at Wende Correctional Facility, as did Robert Chambers, dubbed the “Preppie killer,” who strangled 18-year-old Jennifer Levin in New York Citys Central Park in 1986.

Weinstein's conviction was hailed as a victory for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct by powerful men.

More than 100 women, including famous actresses, have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct stretching back decades. He has denied the allegations, saying any sex was consensual.

Weinstein also faces separate sexual assault charges in Los Angeles.

31,2020/03/23,Is Chennai the city of sailors or the turf of surfers?,"The hardy surfers or the dapper sailors... who do you think are more synonymous with this coastal city?

I am red in the face. “There’s nothing to be scared of,” says the ebony-tinted, six-foot-tall surfing coach. I don’t tell him that my ruddy complexion has less to do with fear and more to do with the exertions of holding my tummy in for the better part of the last hour.

I am near Kovalam, Chennai’s surfing haven, surrounded by lithe men and women who look like they have been poured into their body suits. Everyone is here to learn to be riders on the storm — like the thousands before who have been spurred by the city’s enthusiastic surfing community. Led in the initial years by men from the local fishing villages, Kovalam now hosts its own surf festival and is home to many a prize-winning surfer.

Former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes and super model-turned-running evangelist Milind Soman are familiar faces here.

We limber up on the copper sands — stretches, lunges, burpees and the ‘pop-up’ that teaches you how to stand up in water. I am so out of breath that I am tempted to slip away and hide behind the coconut water vendor. Just then, Coach asks each of us to pick a surf board; I come up trumps with the pink one named ‘Padillac’.

“We’ll start with 10 metres in,” says Coach. I paddle in, so ungracefully that I might as well be auditioning for ‘jackass of the day’. Wave after wave peels away and scatters on the beach; I’m still prone on the board, looking nowhere like the man in my earliest surfing memory — the Apollo riding the waves in the Old Spice ad.

Alongside are a man and his dog balancing on the surfboard with a skill that is amazing. The dog probably has its own Instagram page!

A rare barrel wave turns me over and I plough underwater like a bobsled. It’s quiet — there’s sunlight, fish and the calm of eternity — till I cut my elbow on some coral before crash landing on the shore.

— Deepa Alexander loves the coast but doesn’t lounge on the sands, lest she be mistaken for a beached whale.

Miles of heaven above, nearly equal depths of ocean below. In between, little specks of humanity bobbing on our fancy boats pretending we know what we do.

Well, they are — the dapper, savvy, internationally competitive sailors at Royal Madras Yatch Club. I am pretending nothing, but clinging on for life, hoping the dolphins will forgive me if I hurl my stomach’s contents into their living room.

I’m sorry, dolphins. I’m trying, but this vessel is almost perpendicular to the water now, and I see more ocean less boat below my feet. I wonder wildly how deep the water is, how many women like me can be stacked on top of each other from the bed to the suface. A hundred? A thousand? I’m too small for this, too inept. I’m too young to die.

Oh look, the boat is straight again: I can rest my feet, lean against the railing for half a minute. “It’s impressive that you haven’t gotten sea sick yet, being a first-timer,” someone tells me. I beam — of course, I’m a natural. I’m queen of the ocean. Oh no, they’re titling the boat again, everyone is darting to the other edge for balance. Somebody save me.

It is to the sailing team’s credit that no one has laughed at my sheer terror. That they are actually taking the time out to reassure and explain, in the midst of furling and unfurling sails, following commands, calculating wind speed and direction and keeping the slick afloat as it twists and turns impossibly. But then, this community in Chennai is a tight-knit and friendly one; maybe they remember their first time, too (the cool sea spray and leaping dolphins help).

The sailors deal with their tasks and my blunderings for an hour, and then it’s finally time to head back. “Did you have a good time,” they ask? “Oh, yes,” I say. “Would you like to do this again?”

Sure, a good rush of adrenaline never hurt anyone.

— Meghna Majumdar loves the blue, especially her deep blue blanket in which she hibernates all day, far away from Nature.

32,2020/03/23,Bored at home? Follow these artistes for your daily dose of entertainment,"These artistes are spreading positivity on social media through antakshari sessions and online festivals

We can always rely on Art to provide us with a brief escape from the harsh realities of life.

Chennai’s netizens have proved this, by starting multiple viral threads on social media, challenging and entertaining each other as well as all their followers.

Pianist Anil Srinivasan has started a #JanathaCurfewOnlineFestival, inviting every artiste to contribute in spreading cheer online. You could watch Karthik Ramasubramanian sing a moving rendition of ‘Ka Karun Sajani’, Krishnaswamy Swamy play the violin with his children, JA Jayanth with the flute, and Rakesh Raghunathan, along with his amma, share a recipe for rayil kathrikai, among other dance and storytelling performances. These are all up on Anil’s Facebook page.

“We have established, celebrity performers, as well as people I was watching perform for the first time. Other than Art, what endeavour brings together 151 people from 18 countries together in just 36 hours?” he says, adding that the hashtag caught on in the US, Canada, Qatar, France, Germany, Singapore and South Africa, among other places.

Meanwhile, since this weekend, the city’s Carnatic community has been taking to Instagram to play the country’s favourite age-old picnic game: Antakshari, online. Vishwanath Ganesh gave the game a Classical twist, with ‘Diwakara Thanujam’.

He nominated his fellow Carnatic musicians to keep the antakshari going. Soon enough, the trend went viral, with over 100 singers now and still counting, posting snippets of them singing songs with their cats, dogs, children and sundry.

Thereon, the Carnatic #coronAntakshari moved beyond the traditional style — where you sing a song that starts from the syllable the previous person has ended on — to incorporate different challenges.

“We had certain types of ragas, or swaraksharams, where songs whose starting syllable matches the note on which it starts (sa, ri, ga, ma...); the Chittaiswaram challenge; the Pallavi challenge; or singing as many songs in the same ragam as possible, and so on,” says Vikram Raghavan, who also took part in the antakshari early on.

Not just vocalists, but also percussionists such as Chandrasekara Sharma on the ghatam, jumped in with their own challenges of beats and konnakol. “I had no idea it would go this viral in this tumultuous period,” says Vishwanath.

But then, argues Anil, “People staying together even when alone, and bringing positive reinforcement at a time like this is necessary. If I am sitting with my phone anyway, I’d rather listen to someone sing than read fake news on WhatsApp!”

With the overwhelming response his project has received, Anil is considering holding the online festival intermittently as we head into the lockdown.

33,2020/03/23,Chennai-based app Alserv provides doorstep services for the elderly,"Alserv, a Chennai-based startup app, promises to provide essential services, like healthcare and maintenance, to senior citizens at their doorstep

Retirement homes — service apartments that make day-to-day living easier for communities of senior citizens living together — are slowly coming into prominence.

While these living spaces capture the country’s imagination, it made Saravanan Adiseshan and Jagadish Ramamoorthy wonder about its accessibility for everyone. “There is a huge gap in the senior citizen living space today in terms of real estate available and demand,” says Jagadish. The duo claims that its research suggests most retirement homes in gated communities cost above ₹30 lakh, and involves dislocating people from their roots and forcing a major change in their lifestyle. “Most of these homes are situated outside the city. What about those who don’t want to move to a retirement community but still need daily assistance?” he asks.

The comfort of assistance

The duo co-founded Alserv, an app that brings medicare, food and catering, security, home maintenance, and concierge to your doorstep, as an answer. One can choose to employ any of these services depending on the need. “We want to unify senior assistance on a single platform. Through the app, we are connecting people with vendors across the city who provide these services. After subscribing, it is flexible; you can pay as you go according to the service you require,” adds Jagadish.

Alserv also has a dedicated call centre service since not everyone aged 60 and above would be comfortable using an app. “Everyone who uses the app will get their own relationship manager whom they can call whenever they face any issue. If they feel stuck somewhere while navigating the app, they can always call and get help. So comfort factor and rapport is built in,” he says.

A demo login into the app shows five categories of service, each with its own sub categories. The ‘Medical’ category, for example, would take you to nursing, caretaker, check-up, emergency on-call, and a doctor to speak to via call. The services can be one time or hired in packages. A blinking red emergency option leads us to an emergency number (108) or voice support. While the user experience is seamless, some may find the font too small for comfort. The notifications page gives you the status of your bookings. “We give you the details of the person in charge of the booking along with their photo, so that you don’t worry about who will be coming to your house,” says Jagadish.

The company started a couple of months ago in Chennai, and wants to establish in the city before expanding. With the lockdown situation in light of Coronavirus, Jagadish adds that they are entering uncharted territory. “On the one hand, people will use these services only when they need them. And when they do need it, it is better they get it at home than stepping out and facing more risk,” he says, adding that all their helpers have been trained in safety and hygiene. “Initially, the most popular service was healthcare, but now [demand for] deep cleaning services has gone up. Nobody is currently looking for a caretaker to stay in the house, however, physiotherapists are still in demand.”

When things settle down, the app’s primary aim is to provide peace of mind “for senior citizens as well as their children” living away or abroad. “Their children can look at the app, and be in the loop. They no longer have to ask favours from neighbours, and can live their daily life independently,” he adds.

Alserv is available to download on Google Play and App Store.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/7ew5sv/article31143412.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24MPCouple,https://www.thehindu.com/society/chennai-based-app-alserv-provides-doorstep-services-for-the-elderly/article31143415.ece
34,2020/03/23,Social distancing is an idea whose time has finally come,"Columnist Shovon Chowdhury has a satirical take on why social distancing must remain the norm for all time

Since time immemorial, human beings have been trying to come closer. This is a natural consequence of the process by which we are born. We are yanked out of the womb by strangers, naked and quivering, and spend the rest of our lives trying to rediscover the comfort in which we were born.

Since climbing back in is something most mothers would object to, we seek solace in the arms of others. We want to be close to them. We want to feel their flesh against our flesh. We try to fit on the same seat in the bus, and overload auto rickshaws to unprecedented levels.

Worldwide, our leaders have always shown the way, even the most unexpected ones. Napoleon used to kiss his soldiers on both cheeks, lavishly and often. According to contemporary reports, his lips were wet and clammy. It was one of the contributing factors to the rapid collapse of his empire.

You may argue that this was just a personal quirk, and not representative of a wider trend in history, but this is not true. Hitler was extremely affectionate. Nehru used to leap into crowds at the drop of a hat. Even in cold and inhuman regimes such as the former Soviet Union, such methods were in widespread use. Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev would greet all world leaders, without exception, with a kiss on each cheek, followed by a long, lingering smack on the lips. My extensive study of photographs from the time does not indicate any use of tongue.

Many have criticised our PM for hugging world leaders. Before they are dragged off kicking and screaming, for plotting to undermine the Government, they should consider the fact that what used to happen before him was much worse. Brezhnev was particularly fond of East German leader Erich Honecker. If you Google ‘Brezhnev-Honecker kiss’ you will see pictures of the two of them that you will never be able to unsee. YouTube videos of former US President Jimmy Carter trying to avoid the inevitable are also richly entertaining.

Powerful forces like this have conspired over the years to drive us closer together. The problem is particularly acute in India, where population, religion and public transport have led us to the conclusion that personal space is a Western conspiracy. Our need to mingle is deeply ingrained in our psyche. Those who think that now is a good time to criticise religious festivals should consider this before speaking up.

Only a powerful shock to the system can cure us. We have just received that shock. Social distancing is the answer. Let’s hope that the virus goes away soon, with a minimal loss of life. But the habits we acquire should remain. Not just now, but for the foreseeable future, let’s not try to squeeze in between those two little old ladies sitting on the bus. It’s better to keep standing.

36,2020/03/23,IRDAI asks life insurers to enhance grace period for payment of renewal premium,"Insurance regulator IRDAI has asked life insurers to enhance the grace period, for their customers, to pay renewal premiums by an additional 30 days in view of the disruption likely from the COVID-19 necessitated lockdown in many States.

“In case of life insurance policies, there is a grace period for payment of renewal premiums. Insurers have been asked to enhance the grace period by additional 30 days if desired by the policyholders. In case of health insurance policies, the insurers may condone delay in renewal up to 30 days without deeming such condonation as a break in policy,” the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) said.

Insurers, however, are requested to contact policyholders well in advance so as not to have a discontinuance in coverage, the regulator said permitting certain relaxations.

In another relaxation, IRDAI said insurers can hold board meetings, due till June 30, through video-conferencing or other audio-visual means. With regard to submission of monthly returns for March 2020 by insurers and insurance intermediaries, the regulator said an additional time of 15 days will be allowed. Similarly, in case of quarterly returns, an additional period up to one month will be permitted.

Appealing to all insurers, insurance intermediaries and distribution channels to be sensitive to the needs of the policyholders in these trying times, IRDAI said it also appealed to all the policyholders to cooperate. The Authority said all insurers had been asked to maintain continuity of business operations through possible alternate modes, including telephonic and digital contact. They have been asked to display on their websites information on functioning of their offices and the alternate arrangements made for premium payments, renewal, settlement of claims and lodging of other service requests.

Separately, in a circular to the insurers, IRDAI Member (Life) K.Ganesh said the grace period for payment of premiums will be extended by one month in the areas where lockdown has been declared by State government.

On claim payment, the circular said any claim received may be settled expeditiously. Urging life insurers to consider developing quicker claim settlement process, IRDAI said the companies should provide information on their respective websites about admissibility or otherwise of COVID-19 death claims, for all products under the contracts already issued.

Specific information, product wise, related to any health insurance contracts already issued, regarding admissibility or otherwise of COVID-19 claims has to be provided in the website, the circular said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/irdai-asks-life-insurers-to-enhance-grace-period-for-payment-of-renewal-premium/article31145783.ece
37,2020/03/23,Centre amends law to enable excise duty increase on fuel,"Changes made to Finance Bill to raise the levy on petrol, diesel by ₹8 per litre

The government on Monday amended the law to get enabling powers to raise excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹8 per litre each in future.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman moved an amendment to the Finance Bill, 2020, to raise the limit up to which the government can raise special excise duty on petrol and diesel to ₹18 per litre and ₹12, respectively.

The amendment, along with the Finance Bill, was passed without a debate in the Lok Sabha.

The government had on March 14 raised excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹3 per litre each to raise an additional ₹39,000 crore in revenue annually. This duty hike included ₹2 a litre increase in special additional excise duty and ₹1 in road and infrastructure cess.

This hike took the special additional excise duty to maximum permissible in law — ₹10 in case of petrol and ₹4 in case of diesel.

Now, through an amendment of the Eighth Schedule of the Finance Act, this limit has been increased to ₹18 per litre in case of petrol and ₹12 in case of diesel.

No hike planned for now

This is an enabling provision and no change in excise duty is being done as of now, an official said.

The amendment gives powers to the government to raise the duty by up to ₹8 per litre in petrol and diesel at any time it wishes.

Earlier in the day, the Lok Sabha passed the Finance Bill, 2020, without any discussion as the House curtailed its sittings in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.

More than 40 amendments were introduced by the government to the Finance Bill, which was moved for consideration and passing, by the Finance Minister.

The decision to pass the Bill without any discussion was taken at an all-party meeting convened by Speaker Om Birla. Some amendments moved by the Opposition were negated.

IDFC First Bank MD & CEO V Vaidyanthan has sold shares worth ₹58 crore on March 19 and another ₹35 crore worth shares on March 20 to close an ESOP loan

“I would like to inform that I sold 2,75,58,412 shares yesterday to close the ESOP loan availed by me to acquire the shares and I intend to sell about ₹35 crore worth of stocks today (March 20) to entirely repay the residual ESOP loan taken for exercising my ESOP shares and to release the pledged shares. I would like to clarify that I still hold 4,23,47,144 shares (0.88%) after yesterday’s sale,” Mr. Vaidyanathan informed the bank’s compliance officer. The statement was shared by the bank with exchanges on Friday. “The prices of the stock have come down recently due to the COVID-19-related developments in stock markets across all sectors, including all banks which resulted in a margin call, and at this stage, I decided to sell the stock to entirely square off the ESOP loans. With the sale of ₹35 crore expected today, my loans against shares will be NIL,” he said. “I have no other loans other than a home loan,” he said in the communication which was shared with the exchanges on Friday.

He also added that the bank is building a strong trajectory of growth of branches, strong growth in retail loans, sharp improvement in CASA, with low NPA and high capital adequacy.

“All our trajectory is strongly positive across all parameters. Hence, I deeply regret sale of shares at this growth stage of our bank given the wonderful prospects, but I had to do the same to square the ESOP loan.

39,2020/03/23,Coronavirus set to ground all planes,"About 650 aircraft to rest in hangars after restrictions

The unprecedented action taken by the Ministry of Civil Aviation to suspend all domestic flight operations from midnight Tuesday to combat COVID-19 will ground the entire fleet of Indian airlines estimated at 650 aircraft.

While most part of this fleet has already been grounded since Sunday night when all international operations were shut down, the suspension of domestic operations from 23.59 hrs of Tuesday will bring commercial aviation in India to a grinding halt. Foreign airlines have been banned from flying into India since Sunday. Possibly, this is the first time the aircraft will be grounded for several days, possibly weeks.

This has been necessitated in the interest of public health and after repeated appeal from States to prevent the spread of COVID-19 across the country, said experts.

“To my knowledge, this will be the first time that the whole commercial aviation will come to a stand still. Around three decades back, when Indian Airlines pilots went on strike, the entire domestic fleet was grounded because Indian Airlines was the only domestic airline then. However, international airlines were operating,” said Jitender Bhargava, former executive director, Air India. “This is unprecedented but essential,” he said.

Kapil Kaul, CEO and director, CAPA Advisory, said “The government clearly sees heightened risks related to the COVID-19 virus and is determined to take unprecedented action to slow its transmission. This is the right decision in the prevailing circumstances.”

“For airlines, this suspension coincides with what can only be described as a destruction of demand in the last few days. The timing of the resumption of services is entirely in the control of the government, but it will most likely be beyond 31 March,2020,” he said.

He said the severity of disruption which the Indian aviation industry is experiencing will have an impact that will be felt well beyond FY2021, unless the government is able to provide quick and meaningful support.

“Industry stability in the post-COVID period will also depend upon promoters of distressed airlines themselves bringing in significant funds,” he said.

According to Mr. Bhargava, the airlines would emerge stronger if they use this opportunity to think of long-term viability and sustainable operations.

“The government should help airlines to defer the payment to airport operators, oil commpanies to help them to deal with this situation. However, the airlines must pay the TDS of employees and their Provident Fund,” he said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/virus-set-to-ground-all-planes/article31145333.ece

Commercial vehicle manufacturer Ashok Leyland Ltd. (ALL) said it had scaled down the quantum of buy-back of shares of its subsidiary, Hinduja Leyland Finance Ltd. (HLFL), to 6.99% from the earlier 19%, following feedback from minority shareholders.

In absolute terms, it works out to ₹390.49 crore, compared with the earlier proposal of ₹1,200 crore. It represents the stake of investors Everfin Holdings and Hinduja Group (which had purchased the initial tranches of HLFL shares from Everfin).

Earlier, ALL’s board had given its approval to acquire up to 19% of equity shares of HLFL from existing shareholders in tranches over a 12-month period for a total consideration of ₹1,200 crore, subject to necessary approvals. It would have resulted in ALL raising its stake from 61.82% to 80.82%.

Now, it has been revised to buying, both directly and indirectly, the residual 6.99% stake at a price of ₹119 per share.

43,2020/03/23,Stem cells may give a respite to COVID-19 infected,"It's tough to approach ICMR with novel such ideas: research outfit Advancells

While stem cell treatment is not a technique to eradicate or fix coronavirus completely, there is proof to help the idea that infected patients, under the treatment, might be more receptive to survive the disease.

That's because, stem cells oppose viral infection due to the presence of specific qualities known as interferon gamma invigorated qualities (ISGs). These are present in stem cells before their separation process happens. Thus, stem cells can be expected to survive even if they are transferred into a patient with confirmed infection of coronavirus, as per Vipul Jain, CEO, Advancells, a research firm focusing on therapeutic applications of regenerative medicine.

Mr Jain said, “Even medical science has determined how influenza virus A/H5N1, with a history of causing intense lung injury, was destroyed by human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in a mouse. Going back to basics has only expanded the chances of positive outcome.''

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are those stem cells which can separate into an assortment of cell types. There are several other properties of MSCs which make them suitable for clinical trials, such as they have ability to reduce inflammation thus regulating the immune system back to healthy and an extraordinary capacity to find the damaged tissues in human body. They can even speed up the recovery of those damaged tissues.

For instance, to achieve desired outcome, specialists have used enormous quantities of MSCs with one patient in Baoshan (Yunnan) who got 3 implantations of 50 million umbilical blood cord derived MSCs, while every Beijing patients got 1 mixture of 1 million cells for every kilogram of weight.

According to Advancells observations, MSCs can be acquired from fat, which implies that everybody can use his/her cells, abolishing any contamination or fatalities. In any case, extending them to the amount required for implantation, takes 2 to 3 weeks which is why it is valuable to cryo-conserve (process of preserving cells prone to damage) an individual reservoir of MSCs, that would permit to get to an early and progressively beneficial treatment.

It may be noted that, some 14 trials have been conducted using stem cells to treat coronavirus patients in China. They recommended stem cells may be the option to fix the extreme organ damage brought about by the virus.

“MSCs can lessen the overproduction of immunity cells caused as a response to the virus and lower down the levels of inflammatory substances. Thus, bringing the weak framework and the whole body back to its ordinary state,'' Mr. Jain said.

What can be securely said at this stage following this spearheading study, as per Advancells, is that MSCs demonstrate extraordinary potential to turn into an important part of eradicating something so huge coronavirus itself.

Commenting on India scenario, he further said, “Sadly, India is slow in terms of awareness, also it is tough to convince ICMR with innovative ideas. China had used it and all patients who have gone for stem cell therapy were recovered. Israel just announced they would start a stem cell pilot for treating coronavirus.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/stem-cells-may-give-a-respite-to-covid-19-infected/article31145282.ece
44,2020/03/23,Don’t cut down workforce: PM,"CII moots cash transfer via DBT to all citizens

Calling COVID-19 an ‘unforeseen hurdle’ for the Indian economy whose impact will be felt for some time to come, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday urged India Inc. to not cut down jobs despite the negative impact on business.

Mr. Modi on Monday interacted with industry representatives from 18 cities across the country via video conference.

Those in attendance included Toyota Kirloskar vice chairman and president of industry body CII Vikram Kirloskar, Kotak Mahindra Bank MD & CEO Uday Kotak, Tata Sons chairman N. Chandrasekaran, TVS Motor CMD Venu Srinivasan, founder and co-chairman Jubilant Bhartia Group Hari S. Bhartia, Apollo Hospitals Joint MD and FICCI president Sangeeta Reddy, and HUL CMD Sanjiv Mehta.

Mr. Modi added that the challenge posed by the pandemic is graver than even that posed by the World Wars and “we need to be on constant vigil” to prevent its spread. Mr. Kirloskar said CII members would dedicate their plant facilities to help scale up manufacture and availability of essential goods and equipment needed to deal with the medical emergency.

Mr. Kotak said the COVID Rehabilitation Fund would look at the micro and small industry, which would need special handholding and help to rehabilitate their business.

All Indian citizens should be given cash in their accounts through the direct benefit transfer, CII said; while those below 25 years could be given a one-time payment of ₹5,000, senior citizens above 65 can be given ₹10,000, it said.

CII also said there was an immediate need to enable advances for ways and means for industry across sectors and the government could perhaps explore a moratorium on interest and principal for the next three months. “It may also be important to suspend IBC proceedings while redefining norms for NPAs, as several companies will be unable to meet payment obligations.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/dont-cut-down-workforce-pm/article31145266.ece

Anantha Padmanaban, Chairman, GJC, said, “GJC’s members across the country will extend all possible support and cooperation with the Government of India in the ongoing battle against COVID-19 pandemic.”

“Amidst the fear of the virus, the indigenous gem and jewellery sector in the country has come to a standstill with virtually no footfalls in jewellery stores. Many jewellers have to even shut down their shops located in malls and shopping complexes,”’he said.

“However, this being last month of the financial year, there are lot of due dates like advance tax payment, maturity date of gold metal loan, interest payment on gold metal loan,” Mr Padmanaban added.

Considering the crisis situation, the domestic gem and jewellery sector has sought immediate relief measures to enable the trade to function smoothly.

“The Prime Minister had proposed setting up a COVID-19 Emergency India Fund and RBI has taken measures to address liquidity issues. GJC urges government officials and banking sector officials to consider the issues faced by the gems and jewellery sector, which is one of the top three job creators and employers in the country,” he said.

GJC has urged the government to give further extension of at least 180 days for repayment under the Gold Metal Loan (GML) scheme and interest thereon.

Most of the businesses avail CC/OD facilities for their working capital requirements.

“Keeping in mind the current market scenario, we have requested the government to grant us an extension in the payment of interest amount by at least 180 days and also reduce the rate of interest,” Mr. Padmanabhan said.

“March 15 was the due date for payment of the fourth and last instalment of advance tax for the year 2020-21. Considering, the slowdown in the business due to recession and the escalated outbreak of COVID-19, many businesses have failed to make advance tax payment,” he said.

As a one-time relief, GJC has urged the government to extend the due date for the payment of advance tax by at least 180 days.

GJC has also urged the government for deferring the GST return and extending the time limit for filing GST return.

Kerala and Maharashtra, which are facing the brunt of the crisis, with 95 and 97 cases respectively, announced more sweeping measures.

Following 28 new cases on Monday, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said shops, offices and establishments barring essential services will be closed. Camps will be prepared for migrant labourers, who will be provided food and given medical examinations, as economic activities come to a complete halt in the State.

Announcing a State-wide curfew, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said: “People are not listening and they were stepping out as if the virus threat had diminished. However, that is not the case. I am forced to say this because there are still those who have not understood the seriousness of what we face.”

For full coverage on coronavirus

Prime Minister Narendra Modi once again urged people to take the lockdown seriously.

“Please save yourself by doing this, save your family, follow the instructions seriously. I request the State governments to get the rules and laws followed,” Mr. Modi tweeted the morning after his call for a public appreciation of frontline responders to the crisis turned into mob revelry in many places.

As economic anxieties continue to mount alongside the health scare, Mr. Modi held a conference call with industry leaders. The Prime Minister tweeted that the government was “working to ensure economic stability,” in consultation with all the concerned stakeholders. “Unless very very important, please do #StayHome...” the PM said, adding that he called upon industry leaders to continue following work from home as far as possible.

The government and industry were “conscious about informal sector’s well-being,” Mr. Modi tweeted. “We had extensive interactions on sectors like banking, finance, hospitality, tourism and infra. Industry leaders highlighted steps towards maintaining supply lines of essential items and medical equipment.”

""There will be massive economic pain. But it is possible to handle the economic consequences than the loss of numerous lives,” Congress leader and former finance minister P. Chidambaram said. He requested Chief Ministers to go on TV and explain the rationale behind the lockdown.

As West Bengal reported its first COVID-19 death, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee requested State BJP leaders to take up the need for more testing kits in the State with the Centre. She urged political parties to keep aside their differences and join hands in combating the outbreak.

Ms. Banerjee also urged people to follow the guidelines set by the government during the lockdown and not to come out of their homes.

52,2020/03/23,Coronavirus | Lockdown hits NREGA workers hard,"Support becomes critical as thousands of migrant workers return to villages

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme has been officially shut down in at least seven States, while it is effectively closed in many more, as COVID-19 lockdowns come into effect across the country.

Workers’ collectives are demanding relief in the form of wages during the shutdown, payment of pending dues, and extension of the scheme in the next financial year to accommodate more workers and additional days of work. This is especially critical as thousands of migrant workers stream back to their villages, leaving the cities due to the shutdowns.

Letter to PM, FM

Civil society groups have also written to the Prime Minister, Finance Minister and senior State officials, demanding an emergency relief package of ₹7,000 a month for all poor households for April and May, at a total cost to the exchequer of ₹3.75 lakh crore.

“We had already reduced the size of groups at work sites to less than 50, and shifted measurement of work from group attendance to individual attendance. However, in districts where there is curfew, we will pay unemployment allowance for those who have already registered for work as the government is responsible for not providing work,” a senior Rajasthan government official told The Hindu.

At a video conference meeting between the Centre and States last week, it was informed that seven States have already shut down the rural job guarantee scheme, according to people aware of the meeting. However, a number of other States have also closed work sites since then.

“Over the last two days, MGNREGA has completely stopped in Karnataka. We are demanding that unemployment allowance at least must be given to those who have already applied for work under the scheme,” said Abhay Kumar, State coordinator of the Grameen Coolie Karmikara Sangathan, a registered union for rural workers.

He added that it was critical that MGNREGA workers are brought under the ambit of the Building and Other Construction Workers welfare boards. These boards collect a 1% cess from all construction projects in the country, paid by employers for the welfare of workers.

“MGNREGA workers are often employed in construction related projects. As their employer, the government must pay a 1% cess on their behalf, so that they can benefit from the welfare schemes, especially health-related,” Mr. Kumar added.

Siraj Datta, the Jharkhand coordinator for the NREGA Sangharsh Morcha, has spent the last couple of days watching as thousands of workers stream into Ranchi’s railway and bus stations, returning to their villages.

‘Absolute mayhem’

“There is absolute mayhem as the State has huge numbers of migrant workers who have lost their jobs and are leaving the cities. What will they do in their villages now? MGNREGA should be one major way to help them, but the scheme needs to be strengthened for that to happen. The wage rate is ₹104 less than the State’s minimum wage of ₹275 per day,” he said, adding that a basic step would be to pay unemployment allowances. “The government is saying that public and private sector employers must give paid leave at this time. For MGNREGA workers, government itself is the employer. Should they not get paid leave as well?”

All these are included among the demands listed in a letter by civil society representatives, including economists Jayati Ghosh and Jean Dreze, Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav, and activists Kavita Krishnan, Nikhil Dey and Aruna Roy.

The letter, appealing for a ₹3.75 lakh crore emergency package, was sent to State and Central government representatives on Monday. It demands that MGNREGA be expanded beyond 100 days of guaranteed work in 2020-21, with full wages being paid during the shutdown. Pending wage and material payments, amounting to ₹8,396 crore must be paid immediately, it said.

Three months of advance pensions, and the first instalment of the PM-KISAN scheme for 2020-21 must also be paid immediately, said the letter, adding that three months of free ration must be distributed, along with cooking oil, pulses, salt, masala and soap, for all ration card holders.

Welfare fund

Meanwhile, a group of NGOs representing informal sector workers, including the Working People’s Charter, also wrote to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday, seeking a ₹50,000 crore emergency workers’ welfare fund to be set up by the Centre’s Economic Response Task Force.

The groups highlighted the predicament of informal workers who account for 95% of the workforce — that they are unable to work from home or follow the social distancing norm as their economic conditions do not allow it. They demanded that the government provide free ration for one month to all ration card-holders under the National Food Security Act, an immediate cash transfer of ₹10,000 or the minimum wage if higher than ₹10,000, to workers with BPL and APL cards and two months’ pension to all pensioners under the national pension schemes.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aws11l/article31145537.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NEWS2-MGNREGAWORKERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-lockdown-hits-nrega-workers-hard/article31145538.ece
53,2020/03/23,"Coronavirus | Jammu and Kashmir police book 3 for hiding travel history, quarantined","4,329 travellers remain under surveillance for COVID-19 symptoms

As Jammu and Kashmir completed fourth day of lockdown on Monday, three persons were booked for concealing their travel history, and 4,329 travellers remain under surveillance for COVID-19 symptoms.

A police spokesman said they registered two FIRs under Section 188, 270 and 271 of the Indian Penal Code at the Awantipora Police Station. It is the third case in the past 24 hours that travellers have been booked by the police for hiding their travel history to escape necessary screening.

“The booked persons are students and have recently returned to Charsoo village and Goripora village of Awantipora with a travel history of Pakistan and Bangladesh,” the spokesman said.

They were shifted to a quarantine facility set up in Pampore. Public are requested to proactively disclose their travel history, the police said.

In central Kashmir’s Ganderbal, the police booked another person and lodged him in a quarantine facility at Hatbura, Ganderbal.

67 quarantined

Meanwhile, 67 students — 50 from Anantnag and 17 from Kulgam — were quarantined after they arrived from Bangladesh on Monday. “Around 256 samples have been sent for testing, of which 231 tested negative and only four cases have tested positive so far,” a government spokesman said.

Divisional Commissioner, Kashmir, has ordered closure of all establishments and services throughout Kashmir till March 31.

“People should not venture out except for emergency purposes. Only a single person will reach market to buy groceries or the essential commodities and return home quickly,” said the officer.

The administration has decided to make monthly ration available at the doorstep. LPG gas can also be booked on phone for home delivery, an official said.

To seal borders

Deputy Commissioner, Srinagar, Shahid Choudhary, has announced that the administration has decided to seal borders and close air operations.

54,2020/03/23,Coronavirus | India shuts lab for COVID-19 in Tehran,"Six-member team returns; special flights to evacuate hundreds of people

A medical laboratory that was set up in Tehran to test stranded Indians for COVID-19 has been shut down, official sources said on Monday. The facility was instrumental in determining the health status of hundreds of Indians stuck there.

Sources said that the “sampling facility” at the Embassy of India in Tehran is currently not operational as the six-member team that ran it on behalf of the Indian Council of Medical Research, left the country on March 18.

At least 255 Indians from Kashmir, Ladakh and Kargil had tested positive at the centre. Most of them are currently at a wellness centre, run jointly by Iranian authorities and the Embassy officials, in Qom. The medical team had conducted tests on around 1,200 citizens since their landing in the Islamic Republic on March 5.

Several thousand Indians, comprising of tourists, pilgrims, students and resident members of the Indian community, want to return home in view of the worsening situation in Iran.

Earlier, Mahan Air had proposed to bring back all the Indian nationals from Iran without any financial incentive. However, India did not respond to that proposal. On Monday, Officials informed that India will evacuate a few hundred of its stranded citizens by two aircraft of Mahan Air, which will fly back on March 24 and March 25.

55,2020/03/23,Parliament proceedings | Rajya Sabha passes six Bills on last day of session,"House was adjourned sine die ahead of schedule due to the lockdown to contain COVID-19

The Rajya Sabha was adjourned sine die on Monday, ahead of the schedule, owing to the lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19. In the Budget session that began on January 31, the Upper House passed only 12 Bills, six of which were passed on Monday, the last day of the curtailed session.

The six Bills include Finance Bill, 2020 which was passed without any discussion in both Houses of Parliament.

Vacant seats

The last day of the session saw many vacant seats. Members of the Trinamool Congress, NCP, SP, BSP, Shiv Sena among others were absent. Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu read out the leave application of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who was absent due to ill-health.

“The global outbreak of coronavirus with its origins in China is set to play havoc with the global economic outlook with our country being no exception. The challenge before the world is to minimise the damage caused by the corona outbreak both to the health and wealth of the people across the globe,” Mr. Naidu said at the close of the session.

Earlier in the day, he applauded the 14-hour lockdown of Sunday, calling it unprecedented and heart-warming. “The people of our country rose in unison to the call of national duty in this hour of crisis,” Mr. Naidu said.

76% productivity

In his closing remarks, Mr. Naidu also sought to chastise members for disrupting the House. The Rajya Sabha clocked 76% productivity. He said that while members had the right to discuss and debate but did not have the right to disrupt. “Full and proper exercise of the right to discuss and debate would have resulted in 100% productivity as against the 76% that it turned out to be for this important Budget session,” he said.

The session began on a solemn note paying tributes to 17 security personnel who were killed in an encounter with Maoists in Bastar.

The Upper House also commemorated the Martyrdom Day of freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru for their supreme sacrifice for the country on this day in 1931.

The House bid farewell to 57 retiring members, of which many are not returning to the Upper House. In case of the Congress, out of 15 retirees, only one member, Digivijaya Singh, will be returning to the Upper House. The retirees include 91-year-old Moti Lal Vohra, who gave a 14-minute farewell speech peppered with anecdotes and calling for keeping a harmonious relationship between the treasury and opposition benches.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/854vv3/article31145403.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23TH-THGRP-RS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-proceedings-rajya-sabha-passes-six-bills-on-last-day-of-session/article31145404.ece
56,2020/03/23,Coronavirus outbreak: MHA advises against discrimination of northeast people,"Asks States to take action amid several incidents of racial attacks linking them to COVID-19 outbreak in India

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Monday issued an advisory to all States to ensure sensitisation of law enforcement agencies to take action against harassment of people of northeast amid several incidents of racial attacks linking them to COVID-19 outbreak in India.

The advisory comes in the wake of several incidents reported across the country when people from the northeast were subjected to racial discrimination.

“It has come to the notice of the Ministry that people from the northeast have been facing harassment after the occurrence of COVID-19 in the country. There have been cases where people from northeast, including athletes and sportspersons, have been harassed by linking them to COVID-19. This is racially discriminatory, inconvenient and painful to them,” the MHA advisory said.

The advisory addressed to Chief Secretaries and Directors-General of Police of all States and Union Territories added that “all law enforcement agencies in States and Union Territories be sensitised to take appropriate action in cases of harassment when these are reported.”

Rijiju’s appeal

On March 18, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju who represents Arunachal Pradesh in the Lok Sabha had raised the issue with the northeast division in the MHA.

“Some incidents of racial remarks against North-East people have emerged in some parts of India in the wake of #Coronavirus due to cultural ignorance, prejudice mindset & lack of understanding. Matter discussed with NE Division, MHA. Strict advisory is being issued to the States,” Mr. Rijiju had tweeted.

On March 17, Arunachal (East) MP Tapir Gao had also raised the issue in the Lok Sabha. Mr. Gao requested the government to issue an advisory to all States to protect students from the northeast who were “facing discrimination to the extent of vacating them from the rented apartments” after the COVID-19 pandemic.

57,2020/03/23,Ghulam Nabi Azad says J&K in ‘political quarantine’ for seven months now,"The Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha also said that it would have been good if the Jammu and Kashmir Appropriation Bills had been debated and cleared in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly and not in Parliament.

The Rajya Sabha on Monday approved the Bill approving the Budget of ₹1 lakh crore for the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir for 2020-21 and a separate Bill for the Budget for Ladakh.

The Jammu and Kashmir Appropriation Bills were passed by the Lok Sabha on March 19.

Opening the debate, Leader of the Opposition and Congress MP Ghulam Nabi Azad said it would have been good if the Bill had been debated and cleared in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly and not in Parliament.

“The world today is fighting coronavirus and looking for ways to escape it. While the rest of the country is experiencing lockdown currently, Jammu and Kashmir has been in a political quarantine for over seven months now. This political quarantine, unlike the coronavirus, is not a natural one but a manmade one,” Mr. Azad said.

Four demands

Mr. Azad said the Congress had four demands — that statehood should be reestablished; the residents of J&K should have land rights just like those of northeastern States; there should be reservation for the domiciled people in jobs in the State; and all its political leaders be freed.

Ghulam Nabi Azad claimed that J&K economy had suffered huge losses since August last year when it was stripped off special status and statehood.

CPI(M)’s voice

CPI(M) MP K.K. Ragesh said the silence of Jammu & Kashmir residents at gunpoint should not give the wrong impression that things were normal there.

Manoj Jha of the Rashtriya Janata Dal said the government, while bringing in the legislation to remove special status, had promised an economic package but that so far had not happened.

Countering the Opposition allegation, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur who spoke at conclusion of the debate said the difference between pre- and post-August J&K was that it had become corruption-free.

He denied claims that the economy had been hit by the Centre’s move.

The Minister claimed the GST collection from the State had increased by 13%, excise duty was up by 7.5% and stamp duty by 60%.

The apple trade was at the same level as last year’s and the GDP, despite the slowdown world over, hovered at the same figure as last year.

However, Mr. Thakur did not give any figures for the GDP or apple trade.

Budget split-up

Explaining the budget provisions, he said that Budget for agriculture has increased by ₹680 crore, tourism by ₹207 crore and education by ₹1,000 crore. The Budget for Jammu and Kashmir for 2020-21 laid emphasis on the development of the Union Territory which came into existence on October 31, 2019. The total budget estimates for the fiscal is ₹1,01,428 crore, of which development expenditure is of the order of ₹38,764 crore, an increase of 27%.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/67l3k0/article31145335.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THGHULAMNABIAZAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/azad-says-jk-in-political-quarantine-for-seven-months/article31145336.ece

The Supreme Court Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde used its extraordinary powers under Article 142 to lift the limitation period for all cases across tribunals and courts in the country until further notice.

“To obviate difficulties and to ensure that lawyers/litigants do not have to come physically to file proceedings in respective courts/tribunals across the country, including this court, it is hereby ordered that a period of limitation in all proceedings, irrespective of the limitation prescribed under the general law or special laws, whether condonable or not, shall stand extended with effect from March 15 till further orders,” the apex court said after taking suo motu cognisance.

A Bench led by Chief Justice Bobde heard a few cases via videoconferencing on Monday. A giant screen, instead of the usual crowd of lawyers and litigants, greeted Chief Justice Bobde and his fellow judges as they entered the courtroom. The screen, placed in front of the judges’ dais, was connected to the Old Court Masters’ Room at another end of the Supreme Court premises. This room was fitted with microphones and screens for lawyers to present their cases to the CJI Bench via videoconferencing.

60,2020/03/23,Coronavirus | Private firms await clarity on nod for testing kits,"Approval from the National Institute of Virology, Pune, is mandatory

Private diagnostic labs in India say they are awaiting clarity on offering diagnostic tests for COVID-19. Current written guidelines from the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) specify that only test kits approved by the United States' Food and Drugs Administration or the European CE would be eligible for use in India.

All diagnostic kits must also be approved by the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, the nodal organisation for confirming and reporting COVID-19 positive samples.

Domestic units sidelined

Some labs as well as indigenous makers of diagnostic kits fear being discriminated against because they don't have U.S. or European certification. “This is the time to promote Indian industry. We have good organisations that can provide tests at lower costs,” a senior official in a major diagnostic company in New Delhi, told The Hindu.

At a press briefing on Monday, ICMR chief Balram Bhargava said the U.S. and EU certification wasn’t mandatory and an approval by NIV was sufficient. “Already two manufacturers have been approved,” he added.

Bangalore-based diagnostics company, Molbio Diagnostics, which offers a point-of-care diagnostic kit for tuberculosis, is among those that has applied to the NIV for testing for COVID. Their device can be tweaked to detect several pathogens from the H1N1 to SARS COV2, they claim.

Watch: What will be affected and what will we available during a lockdown?

“I expect that we would hear within a week. It’s inevitable that NIV be the final authority on what kits are acceptable,” said Molbio’s Chief Technology Officer Chandrashekhar Nair.

Urgent demand

With over 400 positive cases of novel coronavirus detected in India and estimates suggesting that the country would see a sharp rise in cases because of increased testing, a larger group of players are trying to enter the testing market. The tests, according to the current guidelines, shouldn't exceed ₹4,500 for the end-consumer. Currently the government spends the same amount for testing but tests those suspected for free.

In letters to the secretaries of Central Ministries, State Chief Secretaries and employers’ associations, sent over the last few days and on Monday, the Ministry said employers were asked to “extend their cooperation by not terminating employees” in this “challenging situation”.

The Ministry said if any worker takes leave during this period, they should be “deemed to be on duty without any consequential deduction of wages”. The same should apply to those working in an establishment that is ordered to shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic, the letter said.

“The termination of employee from the job or reduction of wages in this scenario would further deepen the crises and will not only weaken the financial condition of the employee but also hamper their morale to fight the epidemic,” the letter stated.

The aviation safety regulator DGCA on Monday asked airlines to leave the middle seat vacant to ensure social distancing among air travellers.

This is among the many measures it listed in its advisory for airlines and airports.

Airlines have also been asked to ensure adequate spacing between different check-in counters and passengers queuing up to check-in. Airlines must avoid bunching when passengers board. The cabin crew too will have to maintain appropriate distance while serving the passengers.

Airports have been asked to provide hand sanitisers at prominent locations and make announcements to ensure that passengers seated in waiting area maintain distance from each other.

The DGCA has instructed airlines to ensure that crew members who show symptoms of COVID-19 follow isolation protocols. It has also warned them that in case a crew member tests positive, the entire crew on duty with the sick colleague will be de-rostered and will have to go into home quarantine for 14 days.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gudczn/article31143879.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-DGCA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dgca-asks-airlines-to-keep-middle-seat-vacant/article31143842.ece

The Congress on Monday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government over a provision in the Finance Bill and a reported delay in banning exports of medical equipment including masks and ventilators.

Party communications chief Randeep Surjewala accused the government of being “inhumane and heartless” to make profits by raising excise duties on petrol and diesel.

“Dear PM, to take advantage of people’s miseries in this fashion is utterly shameful, inhumane and heartless. People are losing livelihood and jobs and BJP government is profiteering from the crash in crude oil prices by raising excise duties. Don’t push people to the brink,” he tweeted.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman moved an amendment to the Finance Bill, 2020 that empowers the government with enabling provisions to raise the excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹8 per litre each in future. The amendment along with the Finance Bill was passed without a debate in the Lok Sabha.

In a separate tweet, the Congress also accused the government of “criminal conspiracy” for not banning export of critical equipment like ventilators and surgical masks until March 19.

“Respected Prime Minister, why did the Indian government allow the export of all these things till March 19 contrary to WHO’s advice to keep sufficient stock of ventilators and surgical masks. Which forces encouraged these games? Isn’t this a criminal conspiracy,” Mr. Gandhi asked in a tweet in Hindi.

The Congress MP also tagged a news report which claimed that India did not stockpile the virus protective equipment for health workers despite WHO guidelines.

“Should you not sack Union Commerce Minister and Commerce Secretary for permitting exports of ventilators, surgical masks, face masks, raw material for masks/coveralls till March 19. This is criminal as our own doctors, nurses and patients are facing acute scarcity,” said Mr. Surjewala who tagged the March 19 order of the Centre that barred exports of surgical masks among others.

67,2020/03/23,"Coronavirus | No one is asking what is happening in small-town and rural India, says former Health Secretary","Former health secrectary Keshav Desiraju says our most important focus has to be on testing of persons with one or more symptoms, even if there has been no international travel

In all this talk of bed strengths and ventilators, no one is asking what is happening in small-town and rural India, points out former Health Secretary Keshav Desiraju while speaking exclusively with The Hindu’s Bindu Shajan Perappadan.

As insider to the Indian and international health care systems do you think India is doing enough to contain and prepare for COVID-19?

One is never doing enough when faced with an epidemic, but if we had systematically invested in strengthening primary health care, and across States, we would be better equipped today to collect samples, and to deploy health workers. Both the Central and State governments have made some investment, especially after the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and later the National Health Mission (NHM), starting 2005, but investing in public health is not a one-time measure. We should also be doing a great deal more of testing, through the kind of massive drive that was undertaken in 2009 with swine flu.

Can the Indian health system take on the burden of a community outbreak (bed strength/ ventilators support/ manpower/ testing kits)?

I don’t think we have the option; we have to take on the burden.

Urgent expenditures will have to be made. I saw a report which says that Delhi has 1,400 quarantine beds, 2,200 ICU beds and 10,059 beds in tertiary care facilities, and a minimal number of ventilators. Not every city or town will need isolation facilities or beds. The big public hospitals like the six new AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) should turn over their wards. Actually, in all this talk of bed strengths and ventilators, no one is asking what is happening in small-town and rural India. How long will it be before persons exposed to the virus in the cities will return to their village homes? They will do, especially if they are thrown out of work.

What should be our focus right now when the government is asking people to stay indoors and delay community transmission?

Staying indoors is good and essential advice but Indian lifestyles and work habits do not make this easy. We need a strict ban on social gatherings, of the kind that the Food Control orders enforced in the old days, or the blackouts during the 1965 war. But who is to protect street vendors, daily wage workers, construction workers and others whose existence is hand-to-mouth at the best of times? It will be intolerable if they are thrown out of work, at a time when they face increased risk of illness.

Municipalities and Corporations must make arrangements in shelters and the like, while also recognising that people cannot be made to stay in close proximity. Free PDS (Public Distribution System) supplies should be given to some categories of persons, or food packets, as were distributed after the Chennai floods of 2015. But our most important focus has to be on testing of persons with one or more symptoms, even if there has been no international travel.

Is it time for the India government to take extreme steps like nationalising private labs and hospitals for a specific period of time?

I am not sure ‘nationalisation’ is called for. Government can, and has, invoked Section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. This is more than enough to get private labs to test samples, or to take over beds for isolating patients. Of course, government will need to cap the rates charged for testing, and also pay for the private beds. Apparently, the Mumbai Corporation has capped it at ₹4,000 per test.

Where are we as a global community in controlling a) treatment b) vaccine and c) containing the virus?

I cannot answer this, but the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has such fine institutions as the National Institute of Virology, Pune and the National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, and I am sure they are working on containing the virus and developing a vaccine. But all this is for the future.

68,2020/03/23,Coronavirus | Yechury urges PM Modi to institute special package,"He demands a moratorium on bank loans for a year for small scale manufacturers and retail traders.

In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury has urged the government to institute a special package to tackle health and economic challenges that have arisen due to the Coronavirus outbreak.

In the letter, made public by the party, Mr. Yechury argued that it is not the time to be “preoccupied by concerns to maintain fiscal discipline but to use our resources for saving lives”.

He wrote, “Many countries in the world have announced that the government will guarantee the payment of at least 80 per cent of the salaries being drawn by workers who are now unable to attend work. Government of India should do likewise.”

Mr. Yechury demanded a moratorium on bank loans for a year for small scale manufacturers and retail traders.

The ongoing lockdown across the nation to contain the spread of COVID-19 was grievously hurting the daily wagers and their families. “It is necessary that immediately at least Rs. 5,000 should be transferred to the Jan Dhan accounts and BPL beneficiaries,” the letter said.

The Lok Sabha was adjourned sine die on Monday after the passage of the Finance Bill, 2020 without any debate due to the situation arising out of the Coronavirus pandemic. The House was scheduled to adjourn on April 3.

Parliament proceedings, as it happened on March 23, 2020

The decision was taken before the House convened at 2 p.m. (later than the usual time of 11 a.m. due to flight disruptions delaying the arrival of MPs to Delhi) after a meeting was held by Speaker Om Birla with floor leaders of various parties. Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal said it was an extraordinary situation and that the Finance Bill needed to be passed.

As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented amendments to the Bill for passing, Congress legislative party leader Adhir Ranjan Choudhary said the Opposition was ready to pass the Finance Bill but wanted an announcement from Ms Sitharaman of a financial package that would help mitigate the economic hardships engendered by the pandemic. DMK member T.R. Baalu also made the demand.

Ms Sitharaman, however, did not speak on the issue. After the passage of the Bill, two more Bills for a National Security University was introduced by Minister of State for Home G Kishen Reddy.

“We are ready to pass the Finance Bill but we need to hear some announcement of an economic package from the Finance Minister,” said Mr Choudhary.

Towards the end of the sitting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in the Lok Sabha and members gave a standing ovation to the first responders, medical professionals, essential services workers and media for being at the forefront in the fight against COVID-19. The Speaker also mentioned the success of the Janata Curfew. He said that as MPs go back to their constituencies, they would be joining the fight too.

He added that the Budget session, the first part of which began on January 31, saw 109 hours and 23 minutes of works done in 23 sittings. “As we go back to our constituencies, we need to take on the challenge of this pandemic and turn a negative atmosphere into a positive one,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/m16t8v/article31145212.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-sine-die-ls-PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lok-sabha-adjourned-sine-die/article31142563.ece
70,2020/03/23,Coronavirus | SC notice to States on parole to those facing up to 7-year term,"The apex court said prisoners convicted of or charged with offences having prison terms up to seven years can be given parole to decongest the jails.

The Supreme Court on Monday asked the State governments to consider giving parole to those facing up to seven-year jail term in a bid to decongest prisons on account of the COVID-19 outbreak.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde ordered each State and Union Territory (UT) to constitute a high-powered committee of the chairman of State Legal Services Committee, Principal Home Secretary and Director General of Prisons to determine the class of prisoners who can be released on parole or interim bail after considering the nature and severity of offence, the number of years of imprisonment, etc. Similarly, the undertrial review committees should also meet every week.

The court noted that States such as Bihar, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tripura, Jharkhand, Goa, Kerala, Telangana and UTs of Jammu & Kashmir and Chandigarh to allow visitors to interact with prisoners through video or telephone call. They have also adopted COVID-19 screening of prisoners returning from parole.

The Uttar Pradesh government has constituted ‘COVID-19 Special Task Force’ in all 71 prisons to monitor the prevention of transmission. Rajasthan and Jharkhand had taken measures to decongest prisons by transferring prisoners to other facilities. Punjab has asked the authorities to identify temporary places to hold prisoners in case of an outbreak of the virus.

Physical presence of all the undertrial prisoners before courts have been stopped forthwith and recourse to videoconferencing must be taken for all purposes. Routine prisoner transfers have also been stopped.

“An overview of the responses reflects that considerable measures for protection of health and welfare of the prisoners to restrict the transmission of COVID-19 have been taken by the State governments,” the court observed.

On March 16, the court took suo motu cognisance of the risk of COVID-19 infection spreading within and from the overcrowded prisons across the country. The court had lauded Kerala for its initiatives to control the infection spreading from prisons.

The March 16 order observed that social distancing, an effective antidote against the virus spread, was difficult in prisons. There were 1339 prisons with approximately 4,66,084 inmates. The court said the National Crime Records Bureau showed the occupancy rate of Indian prisons at 117.6%.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2at24b/article31121764.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TH-SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-sc-directs-states-uts-to-set-up-panel-to-consider-release-of-prisoners-on-parole/article31142034.ece

“While clapping, banging utensils or ringing bells to express gratitude to those providing essential services, particularly medical professionals, at 5 p.m. on Janata Curfew day is an acknowledgement, the same is not adequate as the government of India has even failed to provide the basic protective gears to the medical professionals despite such request being made over a month ago after outbreak of the Coronavirus. Medical professionals are the first point of contact of the COVID-19, they are vulnerable,” activist and director of the Rights and Risks Analysis Group Suhas Chakma argued in his petition.

It said medical professionals were the frontline fighters against the virus. They should be treated on par with the Army and the Central Armed Police Forces personnel posted in designated areas of Jammu & Kashmir, Northeastern States and the Left Wing Extremist-affected areas.

“Medical and non-medical professionals such as the troops of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police quarantine centre at Chhawla area of south-west Delhi or ward caretakers have been on the frontline to treat COVID-19 patients at great personal risks to themselves and their families. These medical professionals have been working in war-like situations to save the people and guests (foreigners) of this nation,” the petition said.

It said that in February 22 last year, the risks and hardship allowance for the Central Armed Police Forces was hiked from ₹9,700 to ₹17,300 per month for personnel up to the rank of inspector and from ₹16,900 to ₹25,000 for officers. The Ministry of Defence also revised the risk and hardship allowance for the Indian Army in 2019.

Even the judges of the High Court were also provided monthly compensatory allowance for serving outside the parent High court, the petition said.

“While it is the duty of the Indian Army and the Central Armed Police Forces to defend the country, it is also the duty of the medical professionals and non-medical personnel to treat COVID-19 patients in the designated areas. Yet, extraordinary situations require extraordinary measures and therefore, the Union government of India has been providing risks and hardship benefits to the Indian Army and the Central Armed Police Forces deployed in the designated areas.

Former Union Finance Minister P. Chidamabaram on Monday thanked the Chief Ministers of the States that had announced a lockdown and asked them to go on TV explaining why it is necessary to take such a step.

In a series of tweets, Mr. Chidambaram admitted that there would be “massive economic pain” but it could be handled than “numerous deaths” if the Coronavirus outbreak spreads.

He also offered suggestions to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on how the government could go about enforcing the lockdown.

“Grateful that more States are announcing lockdowns. Compliments to the CMs. It is not enough to declare a lockdown. It must be strictly enforced in all large villages, towns and cities with few exceptions for emergency and essential services.’’

“Lockdown is not a holiday. It is to enforce social distancing and self-isolation. CMs must go on TV and explain why strict observance of lockdown is an imperative,” he said.

Though he had been pleading for a lockdown throughout the country for two-four weeks, they were “met with silence and, in some cases, by derisive trolls”, he stated.

Quoting Dr. Devi Shetty’s advice to a newspaper, he said, “Declare lockdown now. Doing it after one month will have serious and unmanageable consequences. There will be massive economic pain. But it is possible to handle the economic consequences than the loss of numerous lives.”

Mr. Chidamabaram, who had offered suggestions to the government in an interview to The Hindu, offered some key suggestions like doubling the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Samman Nidhi, bringing tenant farmers within the scheme and deferring tax payment dates.

He also suggested cutting indirect taxes, especially some GST rates, monthly cash transfers to the poor families, giving 10 kg of rice/wheat absolutely free to every family that wishes to take the food grains and “guarantees and fiscal incentives to employers who will maintain current levels of employment and wages”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cvif5j/article31119030.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHIDAMBARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-chidambaram-urges-cms-to-go-in-for-lockdown/article31141367.ece

78,2020/03/23,Senior citizen denied hospital admission over virus fears in Mumbai,"Spokesperson cites realigning of ICUs and beds as reason

The family of a 70-year-old person from the Kalyan locality of Mumbai, suffering from breathlessness, fever and throat pain, has alleged that he was refused entry by a leading private hospital as his symptoms were akin to that of COVID-19.

The patient’s son alleged that his father was made to sit in their vehicle for nearly an hour and was later taken to a “safe room” near the security guards’ cabin outside the hospital, where he was provided medication through intravenous fluids. A driver of the ambulance that was called by the hospital staff also refused to ferry the senior citizen to a government hospital.

According to the patient’s 26-year-old son, the incident took place on March 17 at the P.D. Hinduja Hospital in Mahim. “My father had nasal congestion and cough. Since he started having difficulty in breathing, we rushed him to a private hospital in Kalyan where the doctors said he could be ailing from COVID-19 and referred us to the Rukminibai Hospital. The doctors at Rukminibai gave him an injection and referred us to Kasturba Hospital for a COVID-19 test,” he said.

The senior citizen had no history of international travel, but he had been to Bengaluru, Mangaluru and Tirupati over the past one month for religious rituals.

“At the Hinduja Hospital, they refused to take us in. I showed them the medical paper from Kasturba Hospital but they insisted that he could be a COVID-19 patient,” he said. The patient was eventually taken to the KEM Hospital, where the doctors diagnosed pneumonia and started treatment.

The contagious novel coronavirus has posed a challenge for all hospitals as any positive patient walking into their premises could be a threat to other patients, who already have compromised immunity. Hinduja Hospital has been extra cautious as it had recently admitted a 64-year-old person with a heart ailment who later tested positive for COVID-19. While the patient succumbed after being shifted to Kasturba Hospital, eight hospital staff members who came in contact with the patient have since been in isolation while many others have been advised home quarantine.

A Hinduja Hospital spokesperson said that after the detection of a COVID-19 case at the hospital on March 12, they had been realigning ICUs and beds for the safety of patients and their treatment of as per guidelines. “The patient arrived with severe respiratory issues and needed ICU care, which was not possible at that time in view of the realignment. Therefore, the patient was attended to, stabilised and then referred to other hospital,” the spokesperson said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2toms7/article31140085.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BMCORONA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/senior-citizen-denied-hospital-admission-over-virus-fears-in-mumbai/article31138455.ece
79,2020/03/23,Full court meeting today to consider pleas to close Supreme Court,"It is not safe to keep the court open, say lawyers’ associations

A full court meeting of all the 33 judges of the Supreme Court is scheduled at 12.30 p.m. on Monday to consider the repeated requests made by lawyers’ associations to close the court till further notice on account of the COVID-19 infection spread.

The meeting comes even as the Supreme Court has decided to hear cases via video-conferencing. This means that judges would sit in the courtroom and lawyers can make their submissions from a designated spot in the court premises. One such courtroom is that of the Chief Justice on Monday.

Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

The decision to hold the full court meeting is the result of resolutions passed separately by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAoRA) that it was not safe to keep the court open and to urgently shut it down.

The SCBA wants the court to close for at least four weeks from March 23.

The SCAoRA has urged the CJI and the judges to keep the general health and well-being of the court staff, lawyers, registry employees and the general public in mind and shut down the court from Monday for two weeks.

The past week had seen at least four to six benches sitting after the court re-opened after the Holi break on March 16. Though cursory measures have been taken like temperature guns, shutting of canteens and distribution of COVID self-declaration forms at entry points, the court premises witnessed crowds outside courtrooms, corridors, mentioning offices, entry points, and lawyers’ chambers etc.

The previous week had seen the court urgently take up the Madhya Pradesh political controversy case on a daily basis. The courtroom which took up the case had been crowded and the judges heard the arguments even after normal hours on Thursday.

“The CJI and the judges should consider the feelings and well-being of all stakeholders and declare vacation in the Supreme Court for four weeks from March 23,” the SCBA statement said.

The SCAoRA had suggested that the court could make up for the days lost by cutting short the summer vacation in May. Besides, Saturdays could also be used to hear cases once the scare was over, it said. The association suggested that interim orders passed so far could continue till further notice.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2at24b/article31121764.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TH-SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/full-court-meeting-today-to-consider-pleas-to-close-supreme-court/article31136642.ece

82,2020/03/23,Jagan asks officials to get cracking,"‘Situation will improve only if home isolation is practised’

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has asked health and police officials to implement the lockdown strictly in the State.

At a review meeting on COVID-19 on Monday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy asserted that people should be allowed only to purchase essentials. Also, only one person should be allowed to move out of their houses up to a distance of 3 km from their houses.

People should remain indoors as a precautionary measure. “Despite the need to stay indoors for controlling the spread of the virus, a few are not following the instructions and taking the risk. Strict action will be taken against those who defy the rule,” he said.

More beds in hospitals

Almost 1,300 beds have been made available for treating the cases in isolation at VIMS Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tirupati and Anantapur. Also, the district hospitals are going to be equipped with 100-150 beds for treating the cases. In all these hospitals, ventilator facilities are equipped and 200 more ventilators would be arranged in the Intensive Care Unit(ICU).

In addition to these, 450 ventilators in private hospitals across the State are going to be utilised, he said.

The Chief Minister also instructed the officials not to permit any transport from other States except those carrying the essential commodities. He further stressed the need for people remaining isolated in their houses as over 80% of the cases get cured through home quarantine and only 13.8% get admitted in hospitals.

83,2020/03/23,Chittoor gears up to quarantine heavy influx of foreign returnees,"They will be directly taken to the special quarantine wards

With the State-wide lockdown in force amid promulgation of Section 144 in several parts of Chittoor district, that is flanked by Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, the district administration is fully geared up to quarantine more than 1,000 foreign returnees, who are expected to arrive in the district from Monday onwards.

Andhra Pradesh Government Doctors’ Association secretary and COVID-19 Task Force Special Officer (Nagari Assembly Constituency) P. Ravi Raju told The Hindu that according to the statistics available with the district administration, 1,170 people would be arriving in the district with travel history in various countries. “Our immediate priority is to do away with the home-quarantine mode, and impose quarantine at government provided zones under strict surveillance of the medical and health officials,” Dr. Raju said.

The Special Officer said the home quarantine system for the foreign returnees would only escalate the risk factor in the spread of COVID-19. “Our inspection teams found out that several foreign returnees, mostly youth, are freely moving outside, besides mingling with the family members. The family members are also misleading the medical and paramedical staff that the quarantined family member is inside the home. This is very dangerous if continued. Today, we warned a youth who returned from Dubai to adhere to home quarantine, or else be ready to be shifted to Tirupati hospital,” Dr. Raju said.

He said that instead of sending the foreign returnees to their homes, steps would be mooted to directly take them to the special quarantine wards at the constituency or mandal level. “This would drastically prevent the family members from contracting the virus. The people who are out of the ambit of the virus would be discharged after 14 days. In case of finding positive symptoms, they would again be shifted to the isolation wards,” he said.

The official said that in view of the acute shortage of masks, the district administration had embarked on a mission to supply 10,000 masks to all medical and paramedical staff. The medical officers drafted for the COVID-19 combat mission would be provided with vehicles.

Apart from the existing 200-bed facility at Padmavathi Nilayam near Tirupati, the services of various educational institutions to create the quarantine facility would be utilised. “Mock drills as to how a COVID -19 suspect or positive case could be tackled were given at several mandal headquarters to sensitise the medical and paramedical teams. Special teams are also on the move to create public awareness on the precautions against the virus, and scrutiny of houses reporting suspect cases or foreign returnees,” Dr Raju added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/chittoor-gears-up-to-quarantine-heavy-influx-of-foreign-returnees/article31145645.ece
84,2020/03/23,Several migrant workers stranded in Vizag,"Arunachal Pradesh-bound group prepares for the long wait

Migrant workers from Arunachal Pradesh, employed in a garment factory at Tirupur in Tamil Nadu, were stranded outside the Visakhapatnam Railway Station since Sunday.

“We reached Chennai by train and came here from there by another train. We did not get any train after the Janata Curfew on Sunday. Today, the railways cancelled all services,” said Sanjay and Ranjan, who are part of a 16-member group from the north eastern State.

While the other members of the group lay on the ground at the bus shelter, the duo sat on a concrete sit-out around the pillar. They covered their nose and mouths with handkerchiefs. Sharing the space with them were some urchins and homeless persons.

The shutdown of factories in view of the COVID-19 threat has seen an exodus of migrant workers. With all trains being cancelled till March 31, they were not allowed into the station premises by Railway Protection Force personnel.

“We thought we could catch a bus but they have also been cancelled. We managed to get four rooms for the 16 of us at a lodge near Chavulamadhum,” said Mr. Sanjay.

Help fails to materialise

Rajesh of Patangi of Bhubaneswar was seen making frantic calls. “I missed the last direct train to Patangi before the start of the Janata Curfew. I was forced to take the train to Visakhapatnam but now I am stranded here with buses also being cancelled. I called my parents and they arranged an acquaintance from Odisha to pick me up in his car but he was stopped at the border,” Mr. Rajesh told The Hindu.

“I am worried about reaching home and cannot think of lunch now,” Mr. Rajesh said when asked whether he had anything to eat. A group of passengers from Srikakulam, who were stranded at the bus stop near the railway station, started walking towards the RTC complex, about 2 km away, though they were told that the services had been cancelled.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/wa56jr/article31145615.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24VJPG4-MIGRANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/several-migrant-workers-stranded-in-vizag/article31145616.ece
85,2020/03/23,People stuck on both sides of border near Kurnool,"Vehicles stopped at Telangana border check-post

As both the Telugu States go into lockdown without prior notice, several people have been stranded on the either side of the border. The police forces of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have been stationed near the Panchalingala check-post on the outskirts of the city on Monday.

Several vehicles going to Telangana were stopped by the Telangana police. A majority of them had Telangana registration, and the people were residents of that State. “We are only letting emergency vehicles and vehicles carrying essential goods into the State,” said M. Venkataramaiah, Circle Inspector of Alampur, Jogulamba Gadwal district, Telangana.

A few residents of Telangana were spotted arguing with the Telangana police. Some of them were carrying infants. However, the police officers did not allow them into the State.

The Andhra Pradesh forces, on the other hand, stopped several autorickshaws which were hauling workers from Telangana to Andhra Pradesh. However, motorcycles were left to pass the check-post freely as most of the motorists were from the villages nearby the check-post.

“We are not stopping people on motorcycles because most of them are coming out to purchase essential goods and take it back home,” said Andhra Pradesh Motor Vehicle inspector, K. Sagar Reddy.

Lorries carrying non-essential goods were stopped on both sides of the check-post. The authorities have been stopping lorries coming into the State and going out of the State from Sunday night. “We even provided dinner to the lorry drivers on Sunday night,” Mr. Reddy added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/c0h5w8/article31145574.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24VJKURNOOLCHECKPOST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/people-stuck-on-both-sides-of-border-near-kurnool/article31145575.ece

The number of COVID-19 positive cases in the State has climbed to seven with Visakhapatnam reporting reporting its third one on Monday.

The patient, a 25-year-old male, landed at the Delhi airport from the U.K. on March 17 and reached the Visakhapatnam airport the same day. He travelled to his house in Thagarapuvalasa in a car along with his father and developed symptoms two days later and was admitted to hospital on March 21, as per the health bulletin.

Patient recovers

Meanwhile, a 24-year-old youth, who contracted COVID-19 after returning to Nellore from Italy nearly two weeks ago, was discharged from the Government General Hospital upon being cured.

The youth, who is the first COVID-19 patient in the State, was admitted to hospital on March 9 and tested negative after 14 days of treatment as per the protocols. His close contacts, including father, mother, driver and friends, also tested negative.

Meanwhile, the government identified more foreign returnees and accordingly, the number has gone up to 14, 038 of which 2,426 have completed the 28-day observation period.

As many as 11, 560 foreign returnees are under home isolation and 52 have been admitted to hospitals.

Test results of eight samples were awaited and 166 samples, including those of close contacts of positive patients, have tested negative till date.

Aggressive strategy

The Health Department has revised the testing strategy following the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research.

As per the revised strategy, all hospitalised patients with severe acute respiratory illness, fever, cough and shortness of breath will be tested for COVID-19 irrespective of their travel history.

Also, asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts close to confirmed patients would be tested once between Day 5 and Day 14 after first contact. Direct and high-risk contacts include healthcare workers.

In addition to that, all symptomatic healthcare workers would also be tested.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/number-of-covid-casesmounts-to-seven-in-ap/article31145542.ece
87,2020/03/23,"128 APSRTC depots closed, 12,000 services cancelled in State","Railway, bus stations deserted on first day of lockdown

With the government declaring lockdown, all the 12,000 buses belonging to the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) were confined to 128 depots in the State from Sunday midnight.

All the suburban and urban services were cancelled and buses of neighbouring States were not allowed into the State. The APSRTC security and the police arranged security at all the bus stations.

“APSRTC is operating 12,000 buses from 128 depots in 3,800 routes. We are carrying about 65 lakh passengers covering 44 lakh kilometres everyday. Following the directions of the government, all the services were cancelled,” said Corporation Executive Director (Operations) K.S. Brahmananda Reddy.

Police and the APSRTC arranged pickets at Pandit Nehru Bus Station (PNBS), Gudivada, Machilipatnam, Hanuman Junction, Tirivuru, Gannavaram, Nandigama and other complexes and closed them by arranging barricades to prevent the movement of public.

Counters closed

“As the public transportation has been suspended, we request the passengers not to come to the bus stations. All the reservation counters, canteens, book stalls, fruit and juice stalls located in the bus stations were closed since last night,” Mr. Reddy told The Hindu on Monday.

APSRTC employees said this was the first time that the management cancelled all the bus services and closed 128 depots in the State. Entry for public into the bus stations was also restricted, said an RTC employee.

“In 2001, the employees participated in strike for 24 days in the united Andhra Pradesh. In 2005, we went on strike for five days and again in 2013, all the employees participated in Sakala Janula Samme during Telangana agitation. But, this is the first time that all the 128 depots were closed after the State was bifurcated,” said an RTC official.

Railway stations deserted

The Vijayawada railway station, one of the biggest station in Indian Railways, wore a deserted look. Only a few freight trains were seen passing through the station on Monday.

The Railway Protection Force (RPF), Government Railway Police (GRP) and the railway officials set up barricades and closed the entry points. Police arranged check posts and were seen guarding the main gates to prevent entry of public into the station.

“We closed all the railway stations including Rajahmundry, Nellore, Eluru, Nidadavole, Tuni, Bhimavaram, Gudivada, Kakinada, Machilipatnam, Palakol, Narsapur and even the small stations. Except one or two, all the establishments in the stations will remain close till March 31,” said Vijayawada Divisional Railway Manager P.

88,2020/03/23,"No darshan in Tirumala till March 31, says Additional EO","Sequel to announcement of lockdown in State and closure of inter-State borders

Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams(TTD) Additional Executive Officer A.V. Dharma Reddy on Monday said that darshan would not be allowed for pilgrims till March 31.

The decision comes in the wake of pronouncement of a lockdown by the State government coupled with the closure of inter-State borders and cancellation of passenger trains by Centre government.

The TTD last Friday had resolved not to allow pilgrims at least for a week and also closed down Alipiri toll gate at Tirupati as well as both the footpath routes leading to the shrine in the aftermath of strict directions from the State as well as Government of India to avoid the remotest chances of a community spread of the COVID-19 at all the places of worship.

Ghat roads closed

Mr. Reddy said the ghat roads would be closed for local denizens between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. from Tuesday till the end of this month.

The process of refunding the amounts to those who had booked their darshan tickets (Arjitha sevas as well as ₹300 darshan) in advance during the closure period would be taken up from March 25.

In the wake of strict guidelines issued by medical and health department to avoid social gathering at one place, the TTD resolved to confine the ‘Koil Alwar Thirumanjanam’ scheduled for Tuesday to the sanctum sanctorum and also restrict the number of employees taking part in the festival.

Likewise, the ‘Ugadi’ asthanam’ on March 25 also would be a low-key affair.

Restrictions imposed

Meanwhile, the police imposed restrictions on the movement of the residents of Balaji Nagar, the area where the displaced families who have lost their properties under the land acquisition are rehabilitated.

In a stern warning, the police urged them to confine themselves to their houses and not to venture out except for medical emergencies. They would not mind supplying groceries at their doorstep should the situation demand, the police said and added that cases would be booked against those found freaking out unnecessarily on the roads.

Youth whisked away

He, however, proved negative to the test.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/no-darshan-in-tirumala-till-march-31-says-additional-eo/article31145472.ece

Police are enforcing the rules and those violating them could be booked under sections 188, 269, 270, 271 of Indian Penal Code.

Vijayawada Municipal Corporation commissioner V. Prasanna Venkatesh has appointed one special officer for every two municipal wards as part of the efforts to contain, control and prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The special officers would monitor the prevention and containment activity and ensure surveillance tracking of foreign returnees, implementation of social distancing measures, availability of essential commodities and services, completion of the door-to-door surveillance and completion of contact tracing as per the protocols set by the government.

91,2020/03/23,Production at KIA Motors India plant comes to a halt after lockdown orders,"Only essential services and procedures that cannot be stopped are being run with skeleton staff

Following lockdown orders issued by the State government in view of the COVID19, production in KIA Motors India cars manufacturing unit came to a standstill on Monday. Only the essential services/procedures that cannot be stopped are being run with skeleton staff.

A ajority of the over 5,000 staff members of the KIA Motors India travel by buses from Anantapur, Dharmavaram, Penuknoda and surrounding villages. Owing to this, they could fall prey to COVID-19 and would violate the lockdown orders of the State. Anantapur district, though, is not in the list of 80 districts in India which have been ordered to be completely shut down.

‘Allowed’ categories to run

106,2020/03/23,Space shrinking fast for women puppeteers,"Last surviving veterans send SOS to the government

The tribe of women leather puppeteers is fast vanishing in East Godavari district. Of the 400 families which settled in Madhavapatnam panchayat of Samalkot mandal in East Godavari district in 1980, barely six women puppeteers are left now.

Prior to that, they were nomads in the district. The leather puppetry families had migrated from Maharashtra more than 100 years ago and they speak Marathi and Telugu.

Anaparthi Janardhanamma, one of the stalwarts in leather puppetry, told The Hindu: “I believe we are the last generation women puppeteers still associated with the art. I do not see anybody from the present generation attempting to master the art.”

Living in an unfinished house, battling hearing impairment owing to her age, she speaks as loud as the characters in the play demand.

Ms. Janardhanamma, Anaparthi Pallalamma, Anaraparthi Tirupatamma, Thota Satyanarayanamma, Thota Kusalamma, and Thota Rajeswari are possibly the last surviving women puppeteers .

Epic performance

Ms. Pallalamma, 65, says: “I play the character of Sitadevi in Ramayana, and that of Draupadi and Sudheshna in Mahabharata.”

The puppets are made of goatskin and thus the play with these puppets earned the name ‘tholubommalata’.

In the tradition of leather puppetry, the complete play consists of a seven-night length of Ramayana (Sundarakanda to Rama-Ravana War) and Mahabharata (Virata Parvam to Padmavyuham) as standardised by the gurus of this art.

Ms. Rajeswari,60, told The Hindu: “I do not advise the new generation to continue in the field as the income is too meagre to support a family. There is no patronage either from society or from the government. We beg the government to come to our rescue. Many families associated with the art are forced to look for alternatives.”

As many as 13 women puppeteers — Thota Venkayamma, Thota Bajjodamma, Thota Ganemma, Thota China Ganemma, Thota Lingamma, Thota Ganemma (Another artist with the similar name), Thota Janakamma, Anaparthi Chandramma, Anaparthi Ammulamma, Anaparthi Saradamma, Anaparthi Chilakamma, Anaparthi Bodemma, and Anaparthi Ademmahave — have passed away since 1980.

Thota Bala Krishna, 58, who recently groomed about 15 girls, said: “Those initiated into the art need to be encouraged by the government by sponsoring their training until they master it.”

In this art, woman cannot be replaced by man to run the play as the characters in the epics demand the voice of the same gender.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/quk7cl/article31137785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23VJPUPPETEERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/space-shrinking-fast-for-women-puppeteers/article31137786.ece

Govinda Rao, Bhaviri Krishnamurthy and others demanded that the government scrap the Citizenship (Amendment) Act-2019, the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). As part of Janata Curfew, they clapped and highlighted the issues. “It is time to unite people. The government should not adopt divide and rule policy to improve its vote bank,” he said.

Meanwhile, all the roads wore a deserted look since morning with people’s participation in Janata Curfew. The wide publicity given for the programme helped people remain indoors.

Janata Curfew on Sunday morning greeted people with severe shortage of milk with a number of regular outlets either closing their shops or running out of stocks within half an hour of opening and rampant hoarding of milk packets was witnessed in the city. The first sign of disobeying the Janata Curfew was large gatherings in front of chicken and red meat shops, as people wanted to enjoy the day at home.

While people ran from one outlet to the other looking for milk to have the morning coffee or tea, many outlets sold milk packets at a higher price. The 160 ml pack that costs ₹10 was sold at ₹15 and full cream 500 ml packs that cost between ₹26 and ₹28 were sold at ₹30. People made an unusual beeline for the roadside tea and coffee stalls in the morning with milk packets vanishing from the shelves.

112,2020/03/23,"We sit apart, but stand united for Amaravati, say protesters","Farmers find new ways to stage protest in the wake of health advisory

Giving up does not seem to be an option for the farmers of the Amaravati region who have been protesting in support of their demand that Amaravati be retained as the capital of the State.

Their protest entered the 96th day on Sunday.

In the wake of the outbreak of the dreaded coronavirus pandemic, and the subsequent guidelines by the governments asking people to extend their cooperation and help contain its spread, the farmers and their representatives found new ways to continue their protest even while adhering to the advisory.

‘Distance’ factor

“Earlier, we had 12 places in the 29 villages that comprise the Capital region, from where the protests were carried out in a big way. Since ‘distance’ is the need of the hour, we have multiplied the number of protest venues with smaller number of people participating,” said Puvvada Sudhakar, convener of the Amaravathi Rajadhani JAC.

In view of Sunday’s ‘Janata Curfew’, a small group of farmers gathered from 6 a.m. to 6.45 a.m. at the protest sites and again assembled at 9 a.m. for 45 minutes.

Sitting in chairs positioned at a 3-metre distance, they held placards and raised slogans such as ‘Jai Amaravati’ and ‘Save Andhra Pradesh’.

“We may sit apart, but united we stand for our cause,” said Mr. Sudhakar.

The remaining farmers are protesting outside their respective houses in view of the ‘social isolation’ call.

This mode of protest will continue at Thullur, Mandadam, Peddaparimi, Krishnayapalem, Yerrabalem, Velagapudi and other villages, the protesters said.

Amaravati Velugu

To keep the flame of Amaravati lighting, the residents of the villages in the Amaravati region observe ‘Amaravati Velugu’ for five minutes at 7.30 p.m. every day.

“All lights are switched off, and people come out of their houses and light candles or lamps, and raise slogans,” he said.

The farmers are gearing up to mark the 100 days of their protest in four days.

“Since the day will be very significant in our movement, we plan to mark it in a big way. But in view of coronavirus, we may ask the farmers across the region to become part of this collective protest to be staged individually from their respective homes,” said Mr. Sudhakar.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/we-sit-apart-but-stand-united-for-amaravati-say-protesters/article31137482.ece

Only a few passengers were seen on the few trains which passed through the Vijayawada station in the morning.

Director-General of Police (DGP) D. Gautam Sawang, Police Commissioner Ch. Dwaraka Tirumala Rao, Additional Commissioner Bathina Srinivasulu, Deputy Commissioners and Additional Deputy Commissioners of Police and officers of other departments came on to the roads and called upon people to maintain self-isolation.

“We appeal to the NRIs who arrive in the State to undergo tests, follow the advice of medical experts and take all measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus,” the DGP said.

“I came from Hyderabad and I have to go to Vinukonda. There are no trains to reach my destination and I am waiting in the hall since morning,” said an Intermediate student Sreshta.

A few stranded passengers were seen sleeping in the waiting halls. Police were seen urging people not to move on roads. Autorickshaws, private travel buses and taxis were off the road. Staff of the Indian Red Cross Society (ICRS) were seen appealing to people to remain indoors.

All the main roads, including Benz Circle, M.G. Road (Bandar Road), Besant Road, and the Chennai and Hyderabad highways were deserted.

114,2020/03/23,Govt. suspends inter-State public transport with immediate effect,"Strict COVID-19 containment measures being put in place, says Chief Minister

While asserting that Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) is in a better position in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic compared with other States, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy said inter-State public transport is being suspended with immediate effect as a major step towards lockdown, which is already in force in 12 States.

He advised that private transport also be discouraged and all non-essential commercial establishments be closed up to March 31, and other offices, factories, etc, function with skeleton staff, like the government was doing on a rotation basis.

SSC exams as per schedule’

SSC examinations would be held as per schedule and the whole situation would be reviewed after March 31 by which time the Central government would issue a fresh health advisory.

Addressing media persons at his camp office on Sunday, Mr. Jagan said A.P. has recorded only six cases and the person in Nellore district who was afflicted with the virus had been cured and discharged from the hospital.

The government had so far identified 11,670 foreign returnees and they were not only being tracked but put under rigorous surveillance with the support of the Police Department to ensure that the disease did not spread. Of them, 10,091 were kept in home isolation and 24 were hospitalised, he said, calling for strict adherence to the social distancing measure.

Instructions were issued to set up 100 beds in each constituency for isolation and quarantine and 200 beds each in all district headquarters for providing high-end treatment to the patients.

Mr. Jagan said the government would sternly deal with those selling essential commodities at prices more than what the Collectors would soon stipulate. The violators would sent to jail depending on the seriousness of violations.

‘Assembly session soon’

To help the poor whose livelihood was being affected, ration would be made available before the month-end (March 29) and also one kg dal distributed free of cost in addition to a financial assistance of ₹1,000 per household that would be delivered at their doorsteps on April 4.

The CM said while the State had to eventually go for a complete lockdown, the government has no other option except to hold the Budget session of the Assembly to make money available for regular development programmes and also to tackle the COVID menace. The Assembly session would, therefore, be held at the earliest.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/2lltt6/article31137373.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23VJPG4-JAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/govt-suspends-inter-state-publictransport-with-immediate-effect/article31137374.ece

117,2020/03/23,COVID-19 outbreak: Tobacco auction suspended,"The Tobacco Board has suspended auction of tobacco across all its 10 platforms in the State in the wake of the lockdown declared by the State government to combat the COVIDd-19 outbreak.

The suspension comes at the fag end of the auction season when barely two million kgs of tobacco is remaining to be auctioned.

The annual auction season of tobacco, which began in the second week of September 2019, was scheduled to end by the end of March. “We would have completed the auction of the entire tobacco by this weekend if it had not been for the lockdown”, said officials of the Tobacco Board.

Out of the 10 platforms, auction has been completed in 6 platforms. Except for the stock coming from the clusters earmarked for the platforms in Periyapatna and Chilkunda, the remaining tobacco has been auctioned.

Against the sanctioned crop size of 100 million kg for the year, a total of 102 million kg had already been purchased, said Tobacco Board officials. About four to five million kg of excess tobacco is attributed to cultivation of the crop by unauthorised growers and authorised farmers cultivating tobacco in excess of the sanctioned quantity.

Also, the suspension of auction comes at a time when the tobacco had just begun commanding a better price in view of non-availability of tobacco grown in China, said President of Federation of VFC Tobacco Growers’ Association of Karnataka Javare Gowda.

In view of the heavy rains last year, the yield of poor grade tobacco went up to a large extent, consequently bringing down its price. However, the farmers, who had refused to sell the tobacco in the earlier days of the auction, had begun realising a better price now. “Unfortunately, the farmers will not be able to delay the auction endlessly as it is a perishable commodity”, said Mr. Gowda.

He urged the Board to ensure that the auction is resumed as soon as the lockdown is lifted so that the farmers do not lose the tobacco.

While the price of bright grade tobacco was fetching ₹180 per kg, the price for poor grade tobacco ranged from ₹50 to ₹85. Though Tobacco Board officials admitted that there had been a marginal increase in the price of tobacco during the last few weeks, they said they were not ready to attribute the same to non-availability of tobacco from China.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-outbreak-tobacco-auction-suspended/article31144072.ece

All entertainment centres and gyms in government buildings should be closed down and offices where public movement is high, should be cleaned and sanitised at regular intervals. All toilets in government offices should have soap and water.

If any employee’s relatives or family members are under quarantine, they should be granted leave. Employees who are aged, pregnant and those with other health issues should take extra care and should be shifted from sections that deal with public, the advisory added.

129,2020/03/23,"Despite pressure, Yediyurappa rules out curtailing legislature session","‘How do we instil confidence among people if legislators themselves fear and go back?’

Amid commercial lockdown announced in nine districts, including Bengaluru, and pressure from many legislators to curtail the legislature session, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Sunday clarified that the session would continue till passing of the Budget.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has clarified that Parliament session will not be curtailed even for a day. We have decided to continue with the session till the Budget is passed on March 27,” the Chief Minister told presspersons here on Sunday evening. “If legislators and parliamentarians fear and go back, how do we instil confidence among the public at this point in time?” he wondered.

Mr. Yediyurappa’s response came in the light of the suggestion made by the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, who on Saturday sought adjournment of the session to maintain social distancing at the time when COVID-19 cases are on the rise. Earlier in the day, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai and Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C. Madhuswamy too said the session would be under way from Monday.

Sources in the Secretariat said that the crucial discussion and voting on the money Bill was yet to be completed in both the Houses, and that without the passage of the Bill before March 31 regular expenditure of the government would come to a standstill. This would be crucial when the State is fighting COVID-19, sources said.

While there are other Bills pending, sources pointed out that in case of adjournment of the session, the government would have to seek a vote on account for three months so that the State would be able to undertake regular expenditure.

A similar situation with respect to the passage of Budget occurred last year when the Janata Dal (Secular)–Congress coalition government was on the brink following which a vote on account was passed.

While several legislators have expressed their anxiety about the spread of COVID-19, many of them also want the session to continue as they feel that the State government will be more responsible during the session. “If the session is adjourned, the government cannot be questioned effectively. During the session, the government will be more responsible and accountable to the Opposition as its actions can be quickly questioned and it can be forced to act responsibly,” a senior Congress leader said, and added that many of them were not keen on the the session’s adjournment nor have they sought it.

130,2020/03/23,Karnataka poultry industry hit hard due to a decline in prices,"From ₹140 per kg, chicken price has fallen to ₹40 per kg

The poultry industry in Karnataka has suffered a huge blow owing to the COVID-19 outbreak with stakeholders reporting a drastic decline in price and sales.

After the outbreak of the virus, there were rumours linking the disease to the consumption of chicken and eggs. Despite efforts by the Animal Husbandry Department at the Centre and the State to convince people that there was no scientific evidence to link the two, the consumption of poultry products has witnessed a decline.

The retail price of dressed chicken, which was ₹140 per kg earlier this year, reached ₹40 per kg in some parts of the State by mid-March.

At the time when the dressed chicken was available at ₹140 per kg, the farm-gate price was around ₹82 per kg of live chicken, barely enough to cover the cost of production estimated to be around ₹ 80 per kg.

Though the State has an estimated 10,000 farms, more than 80% of farmers had tied up with leading poultry integrators.

Even though much of the economic distress will affect the integrators, independent poultry farmers are also at the receiving end. “When the market prices crash, such farmers are unable to bear further losses by spending on feed. Each bird consumes around 200 to 250 grams of feed daily,” said a source in the Karnataka Poultry Farmers and Broilers’ Association (KPFBA).

“An estimated 10,000 broilers farms across Karnataka were producing 10 lakh birds day earlier this year. Now, the production is barely 4 lakh in a day,” said Manjesh Kumar Jadav, chairman of the Broiler Co-ordination Committee of the Karnataka Poultry Farmers and Broilers’ Association (KPFBA).",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/q3741b/article31139958.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGEGGS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/coronavirus-karnataka-poultry-industry-hit-hard-due-to-a-decline-in-prices/article31139959.ece

The call by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to observe Janata Curfew on Sunday evoked good response in Karnataka, with people staying indoors.

Main streets as well as prominent highways across the State were deserted as part of the initiative aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 by maintaining social distancing.

The usually busy Bengaluru–Mysuru highway remained almost empty. Both public and private transport operators had cancelled their services on Sunday responding to the call.

All commercial establishments and even some of the essential services such as petrol stations remained closed in both urban and rural areas. Even railway stations were deserted owing to the lockdown as train services too had been suspended.

The highlight of the Janata Curfew was that people in residential areas too chose to stay indoors.

All the regions of the State and major cities such as Bengaluru, Mysuru, Hubballi, Dharwad, Mangaluru, Kalaburagi, and Belagavi responded alike for the curfew call.

134,2020/03/23,Social distancing a resounding success in Hubballi-Dharwad,"People keep themselves indoors following PM Modi’s call against COVID-19

Janata Curfew, a one day voluntary social distancing exercise, proved to be a resounding success in the twin cities on Sunday.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to observe the social distancing to help check the spread of coronavirus elicited good response from the public. While people kept themselves indoors, business establishments except those dealing with essential commodities and services remained closed for the day. Even vehicular movement on the roads was near nil. The North West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC), a major transport operator in this region, and private bus services suspended operations.

Even autorickshaws and private vehicles too remained off the road.

The city has not witnessed such an unprecedented voluntary shutdown in the recent past.

In Hubballi, the streets were empty and shops and eateries remained shut. The usually bustling areas, including Rani Chennamma Circle, Dajiban Pet, M.G. Market and Koppikar Road, and others besides the bus stations, railway station and airport wore a deserted look. People have cancelled all private programmes and visits to other places and remained indoors. Churches called off their Sunday masses to avoid crowding. Only civic workers were found to be discharging their duties in some areas.

In Dharwad too, life came to virtual standstill as people observed the social distancing exercise in solidarity with Mr. Modi’s call. The otherwise busy Subhas Road, Swami Vivekananda Circle, Jubilee Circle, Court Circle and others wore empty looks.

The Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) and the private bus operators suspended services.

Only a skeleton number of vehicles were seen on the roads. Moreover, following the spread of the news of one person testing positive for COVID-19, people further refrained from coming out of their houses. Even newspaper hawkers and milk suppliers winded up their work before 7 a.m.

Disclosing the travel history of this patient, Ms. Deepa said that he left Perth in Australia on March 11 by EA 421 Emirates Airlines at 22.20 and reached Dubai. From Dubai, he landed at Muscat at 12.35 by Oman Airlines flight.

137,2020/03/23,Birders seek development of Manna Palla Lake as mini-bird sanctuary,"This lake is located in about 100 acres of land in Manipal and about 60 acres are filled with water and the rest has trees and shrubs.

With 118 species of birds being spotted at the picturesque Manna Palla Lake in Manipal over the last 10 years, birders say that it has the potential to be developed as a mini-bird sanctuary.

This lake is located in about 100 acres of land in Manipal and about 60 acres are filled with water and the rest has trees and shrubs. The water of the lake is sourced from natural springs. A small half-acre man-made islet amidst the lake with birds chirping on its trees adds to its beauty. There is a two-km walking track around the lake and there are also plans to construct a bicycle track.

The Manipal Birders organisation has been spotting birds in and around Manipal. It has spotted various birds including Little Grebe, Rock Pigeon, Greater Coucal, Asian Koel, Little Ringed Plover, Common Green Shank, Asian Openbill, Little Cormorant, Black Drongo, Purple Heron, Asian Brown Flycatcher and Barn Owl.

Tejasvi Acharya of Manipal Birders told The Hindu that of the 282 species of birds spotted by the organisation in and around Manipal, 118 were spotted at Mannu Palla lake alone over the last 10 years, making it an ideal site for developing a mini-bird sanctuary.

“We are planning to plant native and fruit bearing trees to attract more birds. There are some patches with acacia trees. These can be cleared and native and fruit bearing trees can be grown in these places. But it would take three years for these trees to grow and it may take five to six years for a sanctuary to come up,” he said.

Arun Kumar, project director of Nirmiti Kendra, which has taken up various projects at the lake, said that there was space for constructing watch towers to watch the birds. “If need be, another small artificial islet can be constructed in the lake for the birds to roost. The lake can be developed as a small bird sanctuary,” he said.

G. Jagadeesha, Deputy Commissioner, said that if the Manipal Birders approached him with a proposal for a mini bird-sanctuary, he would take up the matter with the Department of Forests and decide on the future course of action.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vprp42/article31137677.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGUDUPIISLETT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/birders-seek-development-of-manna-palla-lake-as-mini-bird-sanctuary/article31137678.ece

141,2020/03/23,Space engineer from Yadgir chooses to continue stay in virus-hit Spain,"A space engineer from Yadgir has decided to stay at the COVID-19-affected Spain.

Most of the countries in the world have been struggling against the deadly novel coronavirus, with Spain being one among the worst-hit countries in Europe, with the death toll crossing 1,000 last Friday.

Amid worrying reports on the toll, 27-year-old Basavaraj Sankin, who is a native of Tumakuru village of Wadagera taluk in Yadgir district and works as a space test engineer at Avellan Space Technology and Science (AST & Science) in Barcelona, has decided to uphold his social responsibility to prevent the spread of virus and avoid air travel.

Mr. Sankin told The Hindu from Barcelona over phone on Sunday that the situation was critical in Spain as over 20,000 people have been infected there. The Spanish government had strictly advised citizens to stay indoors and go out only on exceptional grounds such as medical emergency and grocery purchase, he said. “In the present circumstances, I will not come to India by air, where there is every possibility of the virus spreading from one passenger to another. More importantly, to uphold my social responsibility, I have decided to stay here with the necessary health precautions,” he said. He also advised Indians to follow the guidelines issued by the government and maintain social distance.

His worried family members have repeatedly asked him to return to India, but Mr. Sankin has refused, promising them that he would keep himself in good condition by staying indoors. “We initially were worried after hearing news about the deaths in Spain. But we felt relieved after speaking with him often. Now, we can proudly appreciate his decision of not returning home,” said Mallappa Sankin, his brother.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/space-engineer-from-yadgir-chooses-to-continue-stay-in-virus-hit-spain/article31137635.ece

148,2020/03/23,Pulmonologists launch telemedicine helpline,"To provide consultation for those with lung ailments in all districts

Pulmonologists in the State have launched a telemedicine lung health helpline against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic.

P.S. Shajahan, Academy of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (APCCM) president-elect, and Kurian Oommen, vice-president, on Monday said the facility offered tele-medicine consultation for those with lung ailments in all districts.

They told The Hindu that patients could contact doctors designated by the academy in each district online or over the phone for medical advice and prescription round-the-clock.

Dr. Shajahan, Additional Professor of Pulmonary Medicine at Alappuzha Medical College Hospital, said available evidence showed that COVID-19 was more fatal across all age groups than seasonal influenza, with a higher death rate even for those below the age of 50 years.

He said the presumption that coronavirus posed threat only to older people was unfounded.

Dr. Oommen said COVID-19 could be difficult to diagnose as patients initially complained of non-specific fever, often resembling common cold.

He said, as per available documents, COVID-19 had serious implications for people with chronic respiratory illness such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, asthma, allergies, and smoking-related lung problems.

They said patients could contact the APCCM-designated pulmonologists for each district at the following phone numbers.

149,2020/03/23,"Expedite work on Alappuzha NH bypass, says Minister","Delay in construction of approach road and ROBs

Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran has directed authorities to expedite works related to the approach road and development of Kalarcode and Kommady junctions, part of the Alappuzha bypass project.

Mr. Sudhakaran said that the entire bypass project would be completed by April-end. The Minister blamed the contractor and National Highways Authority of India for the delay in completing the construction of approach road and development of two junctions.

The Alappuzha bypass project was first mooted four decades ago. However, it had remained on paper until the work got under way on April 10, 2015.

The bypass project consists of two rail overbridges (RoB) at Malikamukku and Kuthirapanthy. After a delay in getting permission from Railways to place girders above the railway track, the entire project had come to a halt last year. However, after a long wait, Railways gave its nod for installing girders as part of the construction of the RoB at Malikamukku, earlier this year. Subsequently, girders were placed there. Mr. Sudhakaran said that concreting over the girders would start from Monday.

According to officials, the majority of the project has been completed, but the bypass can only be opened to traffic after the completion of two RoBs.

The 6.8-km two-lane bypass road will link Kommady on the north and Kalarcode on the south and pass by the western side of National Highway 66.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/expedite-work-on-alappuzha-nh-bypass-says-minister/article31145862.ece
150,2020/03/23,Homestay sector in troubled waters,"6,700 facilities have closed their doors to visitors in Kottayam

February 29, 2020 now appears a season away for Thomas Philip Palackal, owner of the Vembanad Lake Villa, a heritage homestay on the banks of the mighty Vembanad Lake near Vaikom.

It was close to peak season and he was getting quite a few bookings, mostly from abroad. The looming threat of COVID-19 clearly seemed out of place and business was desperately trying to be as usual.

The developments over the next few hours, however, forced Mr.Palackal to plot a different course for the season. The next day morning, he made the difficult decision to cancel all bookings and shut the website for the time being.

As wrenching as the decision was, the 53-year-old says he had no choice.

“There was not much I could do considering the health risk posed by a possible close interaction between my family members, who are the hosts and the guests, especially foreigners,” he said.

Pioneer

One of the pioneers in the State’s homestay sector, Mr.Palackal hopes the uncertainty around the pandemic will end no sooner than later. He, however, finds it difficult to predict when the homestay business in the backwater destination here will be back on track.

M.P. Sivadattan, Director, Kerala Home-stays and Tourism Society (Kerala HATS) regards the COVID-19 crisis as the last thing the home-stay industry was expecting after the back-to back floods since 2018 and the Nipah scare.

“All the 6,700 homestays, including the 700-odd classified facilities, have closed their doors to visitors. The occupancy is trending towards zero and if something is not done immediately, you are going to see several among us out of business soon,” he warned.

He pegs the combined loss for the sector in the current season to be around 75 percent and expects it to touch cent percent by the next week.

“The crisis in the industry also impacts the livelihood of thousands dependent on the sector including the homestay staff to the tourist guides who double up as cabin drivers,” added Mr.Sivadattan.

Taking a serious note of the situation, the Kerala HATS has now approached the Tourism Authority seeking to offer some solace to the bottom-line operators. The key among the proposals include the provision for an interest free loan of upto ₹50,000 for the next two months. Acknowledging the crisis in the sector which was part of the global trend, an official with the Tourism Department further pointed to the rising anti-foreigner sentiments as yet another setback.

“The homestay sector, a household enterprise, is going through a difficult phase,” said the official.

Campaign mode

Confirming the move, K.Roopesh Kumar, Coordinator, State RT Mission, said the Mission would soon embark on a massive campaign mode focusing on the domestic travel community including Keralites and school groups from other States.

“This will be done by focusing on the various aspects including the local heritage and culture including the ethnic cuisine. Discounted packages based on farm and homestays will be introduced by targeting different age and gender groups,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/homestay-sector-in-troubled-waters/article31145843.ece

157,2020/03/23,Coir workers stare at an uncertain future,"COVID-19 has brought the coir industry to its knees

Mohanan U., 54, a coir worker for the past 22 years is now staring at an uncertain future.

An employee of a small-scale fibre mat production unit at Komalapuram, he used to earn ₹3,000 every week until recently. “We do not get regular work any more. My earnings last week stood at ₹500. This has been the case for the past several weeks. These are unprecedented times and coir workers like me are set to be plunged into poverty and debts,” Mohanan says.

Chandrababu, 53, a worker at a coir matting production factory at Cherthala and sole breadwinner of a family of three has been informed by the owner that the unit is on the verge of closure.

Unorganised sector

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the coir industry, already in the throes of crisis, to its knees.

The pandemic is set to rob the livelihood of thousands of coir workers in the State, especially those in the unorganised, traditional and informal sectors who make modest daily or weekly earnings.

The industry people say coir products have piled up at units due to large scale cancellations of orders and a decline in exports following the outbreak of the disease in countries in North America and Europe, major buyers of Kerala coir products.

Exports

“The coir sector has been going through tough times and COVID-19 has made it worse. With the disruption in exports, societies and factories have stopped buying from us. It is not feasible to run the unit and I have decided to wind up the business,” says, Sunny C., owner of Aleena Coir Works, Komalapuram. His unit employs 16 workers, who will become jobless from Tuesday.

Sajan B. Nair, secretary general, Federation of Indian Coir Exporters Associations (FICEA) says a lack of demand for coir products is expected to last for at least six months.

To tide over the crisis, FICEA has urged the State government to include 14-day quarantine of employees in ESI holidays, bear ESI/PF share of the manufacturers, and give special discounts for purchases from Coir Corporation. It also calls for the extension of credit facilities to regular buyers for purchases made from Coir Corporation.

158,2020/03/23,Quiet flows the Kodoor,"₹40-lakh project to clear weeds and dredge its channel

A year after the Meenanthara river in Kottayam was brought back to life, it’s now the turn of the Kodoor river to flow clean and beautiful.

Starting next month, a team of men and machines will swoop down on this 10-km long water body to clear and stabilize the river bed where trash and weeds hold sway. The project, to be implemented at a cost of ₹40 lakh, aims at cutting down the flood risk faced by the district ahead of the upcoming monsoon.

According to K.Anil Kumar, convener of the Meenachil-Meenanthara and Kodoor River Linking initiative, the project envisages clearing of the weeds and dredging the channel to smoothen the flow of water.

“The first phase of the project, that is from its origin point at Muvattumukku upto Kodimatha is being implemented by the major Irrigation department while the Inland Waterways Authority of India will carry out works in the remaining stretch up to the lighthouse at Pazhukkanila,” he said.

Besides ensuring uninterrupted water flow, the project also aims to reconnect the floodplain to the river channel and improve bank protection and stability.

Additionally, a clean up drive is also taking place in the Meenanthara river between Vadavathoor and its merger point at Meenachil river. The drive is being carried out by utilizing an amount of ₹12.6 lakh sanctioned from the Disaster Management Fund of the Kottayam Collector. To feed it with water from the Meenachil river, a lift irrigation project is being established near Arumanoor. Meanwhile, the authorities are also slated to commence works to revitalize the Pazhukkanila rivermouth where the Kodoor and Meenachil rivers converge with the Vembanad lake.

As part of it, a team of officials from the Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation carried out a preliminary survey of the waterbody two weeks ago.

Sedimentation in the three km long water body has affected its aquatic life, besides raising the risk of flooding in areas surrounding the entire backwater network.

Earlier, Finance Minister T. M. Thomas Isaac had announced the plans to desilt and breathe fresh life into the system by including it under the second Kuttanad package.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/p4rkxs/article31145732.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv24ktmriver,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/quiet-flows-the-kodoor/article31145725.ece

164,2020/03/23,Guidelines for children with disorders,"Children with developmental disorders are prone to infections

The Kozhikode-based Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (IMHANS) has devised guidelines for children with developmental disorders who will have to stay home and miss their regular treatment in view of the social restrictions imposed in the wake of COVID-19. IMHANS Director P. Krishnakumar said that children with developmental disorders were prone to infections as they had impaired immunity. While staying at home, they should avoid close contact with relatives or visitors with fever, common cold, or other infections. Parents should help them wash their hands with soap and water frequently. They need to maintain personal hygiene, keep their nails clean, brush teeth properly, and wash mouth after feeds. These children should be given a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables and fibre-rich food. The parents should make them drink plenty of boiled and cooled water and avoid junk food. Venturing out of homes for play or other activities should be avoided as far as possible.

“When children remain at home there is chance of increasing behaviour problems. Parents’ behaviour greatly influences the child’s behaviour. Try to consciously avoid situations that may provoke behaviour problems in the child. Ignore minor bad behaviours and pay attention to good behaviours. Appreciate and encourage all good behaviours,” Dr. Krishnakumar said. He said parents should spend quality time with the child and help the child engage in quality activities like singing or listening to music or play. “It is helpful if group activities involving all family members are planned. Find time to play with the child and listen to the child,” Dr. Krishnakumar said.

Their screen time should be limited to one hour a day. Good quality programmes should be chosen over those with violent content or programmes causing fear and anxiety.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/guidelines-for-children-with-disorders/article31145674.ece

Luck has run out for K.G. Unni, a lottery ticket vendor at Alinchuvadu Junction, near Vyttila, in Ernakulam.

He had to abandon the kiosk set up six years ago the other day after the State Lotteries Department cancelled the sale of 14 series of tickets and postponed the draw of 10 others in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Over two lakh wayside lottery ticket vendors are in dire straits now with the government move. This include elderly women, young mothers, the physically challenged, and even college and school students.

Till the other day, they were everywhere. On hospital premises, cinema halls, outside liquor outlets and police stations, court complexes, bus terminals, railway stations, and traffic signals.

Suddenly, they are out of sight. “Before the corona outbreak, I used to earn around ₹600 a day. After the outbreak, I lost ₹12,000 by way of cancellation of tickets. No agent will take back the cancelled tickets,” said Unni.

The Lotteries Department suffered a loss of around ₹3 crore on account of the printed tickets, said Amit Meena, Director of the department.

“The tickets were cancelled and draws postponed as part of the social distancing campaign. The cancelled ones could be resold later. Agents and sellers survive on the commission offered on tickets. Wayside vendors, the last point of sales, may get an amount equivalent to 5 to 10% of the ticket price,” he said.

Buoyed by last year’s sale of ₹10,000 crore, the State hoped to rake in ₹12,000 crore this year through ticket sales, said P.R. Jayaprakash, chairman of the Lottery Agents and Sellers Welfare Fund Board.

170,2020/03/23,Anxious calls flood private labs in State,"Panic-stricken people seek COVID-19 testing facilities

Anxious enquiries seeking the COVID-19 testing facilities are flooding the private medical laboratories as the State is heading for a complete lockdown to curb the spread of the disease.

At the same time, there has been a steep decline in the number of footfalls in the leading diagnostic labs, which is attributed to the general fear that has gripped the society.

Travel curbs

The travel restrictions that are in place also deter people from venturing out for routine blood tests, say those at the private laboratories.

“On a daily average, most of the city units of the DDRC-SRL Diagnostic Laboratory Services receive anything between 25 to 30 calls seeking the COVID-19 testing facilities. The scare created by the pandemic must be prompting people with slight fever or cough to make calls to labs,” said K. Unnikrishnan, general manager (operations) of the group, which over 200 labs across the State.

“We pacify the panic-stricken callers and ask them to stay indoors for a couple of days and find out if the symptoms subside in the absence of definitive tests being accessible . We also ask them to approach a doctor rather than rushing to the laboratories. As of now, no private lab in the State has been permitted by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) to conduct the COVID-19 tests,” said Mr. Unnikrishnan.

“The branches of Hi-Tech Diagnostic Centre, Ernakulam too receive up to 60 calls a day seeking the COVID-19 test facilities,” said Suresh Varghese, director of the organisation.

Antibody-based tests

Ajith Joy, managing director, DDRC-SRL, suggested antibody-based tests for COVID-19, which is a faster method that should be used to screen masses. “Currently, ICMR has permitted only RT PCR-based tests,” he said.

At the same time, the major labs have witnessed a steep fall in the number of drop-in patients since the outbreak of the disease.

“Blood Routine tests have dropped by 50% at DDRC-SRL labs. Earlier, we used to do around 200 tests at each unit. It has now dropped below 100. Currently, we are witnessing a drop of around 70% in the number of patients reaching our facilities,” said Mr. Unnikrishnan.

“People are scared,” said Mr. Varghese, “to get out to the streets and get the tests done.”

The number of routine blood tests and the number of walk-in patients have dropped by 50%. Since the outbreak of the disease, a large number of patients must be postponing the regular lab checks as a precautionary measure, he said.

According to Kavitha Ravi, additional professor of the Department of Pathology, Government Medical College (GMC), Kalamassery, patients volunteer for Blood Routine and Platelet Count tests at private labs without consulting a doctor. “The behavioural pattern of the people might have taken a beat under the emerging health scenario,” she said.

“The labs of the GMC too witnessed a fall in the number of patients seeking blood and other diagnostic tests,” said G. Unnikrishnan, assistant professor, Department of Pathology, GMC, Kalamassery.

During the last one week, there was a 50% drop in the numbers, following the COVID-19 scare. Later, the hospital streamlined its facilities and reduced the out-patient consultation timings to two hours in the morning, which too reduced the load.

“After the hospital was dedicated exclusively for corona care, no other cases come to us,” Dr. Unnikrishnan said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/anxious-calls-flood-private-labs-in-state/article31144612.ece
171,2020/03/23,"No shortage of milk, says Milma","Units in North Kerala faces dip in sales

Allaying fears of a milk crisis on Monday, the Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (Milma) made it clear that there was no shortage of either milk or milk products in the State.

Milma, rather, is faced with the problem of unsold milk in large quantities, notably in the North Kerala districts.

One-day holiday

Milma’s Malabar regional milk producers’ union has declared a one-day holiday for milk procurement on Tuesday following the dip in sales triggered by the COVID-19 crisis.

“Dairies in the Malabar region have reported a large quantity of unsold milk. Sales have plummeted on account of the COVID-19 situation in the districts of Kasaragod, Kannur and Kozhikode. Additionally, there were no sales on Sunday on account of the janata curfew,” Milma chairman P.A. Balan said.

As part of addressing the problem, Milma’s Thiruvananthapuram Regional Co-operative Milk Producers’ Union Ltd. (TRCMPU) decided to take back 75,000 litres of the unsold milk. The regional union has despatched five tankers to north Kerala for the purpose.

Milma’s daily milk procurement in the State stands at 12 lakh litres.

Spurt in sales

Meanwhile, in Thiruvananthapuram, Milma reported a spurt in milk sales on Monday following a panic-buying spree triggered by fears of more stringent curbs on public life given the COVID-19 scenario.

“Our normal Monday sales in Thiruvananthapuram district average 2.10 lakh litres. But it had dipped to two lakh litres following the COVID-19 outbreak. On Monday (March 23), however, we recorded sales to the tune of 2.4 lakh litres,” a Milma official said.

“Many of our outlets reported that customers had taken home seven to eight sachets on Monday morning fearing a shortage in the coming days,” a Milma official said.

Some Milma outlets did face a shortage on Monday, forcing regular customers to seek out other outlets.

Meanwhile, Milma also made it clear that it was ensuring stringent adherence to the COVID-19 safety guidelines in the procurement of milk from dairy farmers and its sale to the public.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-shortage-of-milk-says-milma/article31144497.ece
172,2020/03/23,COVID-19 takes its toll on Customs dept.,"Nearly 30 customs officials in home quarantine in State

COVID-19 has taken its toll on the already stretched Customs department with nearly 30 of its officials forced into home quarantine after coming into contact with people either tested positive or suspected of the pandemic.

Though none of them have so far shown any symptoms of the disease they nevertheless continue to serve the 14-day home quarantine.

Among the officials on home quarantine include a batch of 10 officials at the Karipur airport, eight at the headquarters preventive team in Kochi, three at Kannur airport and two at Thiruvananthapuram airport.

No direct entry

“We have, therefore, issued an order banning the direct entry of people into all our offices to avoid any kind of potential contact while restricting appointments to prior approval through mail or phone. However, mandatory number of personnel will be retained at airports, air cargo, preventive commissionerate and divisions. Unaccompanied baggage and cargo already landed at airports, especially from affected countries like Iran and Italy, will be cleared subjected to mandatory quarantine as per the Central guidelines,” said Customs Commissioner Sumit Kumar.

Officers belonging to high risk category, engaged in non-essential staff functions, using public conveyance to reach office or were vulnerable owing to health issues have been allowed to work from home.

Minimum staff

The customs preventive commissionerate will function with minimum staff strength and will be out of bounds for visitors at least till the month-end.

However, the work from home option will not be available to some special wings, including preventive, marine, and rummaging and intelligence.

Mr. Kumar said that further orders would be issued after examining the order of total lockdown by State government.

A batch of 10 officials at Karipur airport had to be sent into home quarantine after it emerged that a resident of Kasaragod, whose antecedents are now being questioned, who came from Dubai on an Air India Express flight on March 11 was tested positive for COVID-19. The same team had dealt with two of his suspected accomplices who were also later sent into home quarantine.

This has left the customs authorities fuming and even questioning the standard operating procedures being followed in screening passengers at airports.

Smugglers

Mr. Kumar said that the smugglers, however, seem to be treating the outbreak of the epidemic as a blessing in disguise and trying to take advantage of the restrictions being in place to rein in the spread of the disease.

“The regular seizures of gold and other contraband proves that the epidemic has hardly served as a deterrent with smugglers obviously showing no regard either for their own health or that of others,” Mr. Kumar said.

For instance, in the last two days alone the Customs Preventive Department and Air Intelligence Unit at Kozhikode seized gold compound weighing around 1,197 gm from a passenger from Muscat; two gold bars from a passenger from Sharjah; gold weighing around 3,788 gm from three different passengers from Abu Dhabi and Dubai; and 1,360 gm of gold from two passengers from Bahrain by flight.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-takes-its-toll-on-customs-dept/article31144119.ece
173,2020/03/23,Coronavirus | Kerala government restricts public life in three more districts,"The districts bought under a partial lockdown are Kannur, Ernakulam and Pathanamthitta

The Kerala government on Monday imposed additional restrictions on daily life in three more districts to impose social distancing more stringently to slow down the spread of COVID-19 infection.

The districts bought under a partial lockdown are Kannur, Ernakulam and Pathanamthitta. The government has limited travel to the localities and also restricted business hours for non-essential services between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m.

It has closed bars and beer and wine parlours. But, Bevco outlets will remain open in the three districts between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. There will be no disruption in essential services. The respective district administrations will ensure the availability of milk, fruits, vegetables, rice, pulses, edible oil, food grains and other essential commodities, including fuel and cooking gas. Travel to the localities will be restricted. But there is no curb on the movement of freight.

The State had on Sunday brought Kasargode under total lockdown given the surge of COVID-19 cases in the region.

On Sunday, it had clamped prohibitory orders in Kozhikode to prevent more than five persons from congregating in public places.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had chaired a cabinet meeting at the Secretariat here in the morning to decide whether the government should suspend non-essential services in more districts to enforce social distancing norms more meticulously.

The conference at the Secretariat happened against the backdrop of the Central government’s advisory to Kerala government on Sunday to allow only essential services in ten districts earmarked for a possible lockdown.

The districts flagged by the Centre as COVID-19 affected localities in Kerala are Ernakulam, Alappuzha, Idukki, Kannur, Kasargode, Kottayam, Malappuram, Pathanamthitta, Thrissur and Thiruvananthapuram.

However, the government appeared to have decided not to clampdown on life in the remaining districts until the epidemic situation warranted so.

Stricter punishments likely

The government will also amend the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, to regulate public life in times of outbreak more stringently. It reportedly felt the punishment of up to six months of imprisonment and a fine of not less than ₹1000 for violating the Act did not offer sufficient deterrence. The State might introduce the law with more stringent provisions urgently as an ordinance to deal with the outbreak situation.

The district administration in Kasargode had invoked the Act on Saturday to seal places of worship for two weeks. Chief Secretary Tom Jose had on Sunday empowered collectors to invoke the Act with prohibitory order under section 144 of the CrPC to enforce social distancing rules in COVID-19 affected localities.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vfvgv3/article31143195.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ernakulam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/coronavirus-kerala-government-restricts-public-life-in-three-more-districts/article31143197.ece

175,2020/03/23,Coronavirus | Kerala government shuts bars and private clubs,"Allows Bevco outlets, except in Kasargode;

The Kerala government on Monday decided to close bars, beer and wine parlours and private member’s clubs having the permit to sell liquor due to the COVID-19 threat in the State.

A Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has, for the time being, allowed State-run retail liquor outlets to operate with severe restrictions on crowding, except in Kasaragod where there is a total ban on the sale of legal alcohol.

The district, which saw a surge of COVID-19 cases, has been on lockdown since Saturday.

The government’s move will bring the shutters down on 600 bars, 358 beer and wine parlours and 43 “liquor permit rooms” in private clubs.

Kerala has, arguably, the highest per capita consumption of alcohol in the country. The sale of legal liquor is also a significant source of State revenue. In 2018-19 fiscal, Bevco raked in ₹14,504.67 from the sale of branded liquor, beer and wine, a raise of ₹1,567.8 crores compared to the previous financial year.

The government appeared to have taken a gamble on allowing the limited sale of liquor through State-run stores to offset the temporary squeeze on the availability of legal alcohol caused by the closure of bars and beer parlours.

The Excise Department had cautioned the government that a total ban on the sale of legal liquor could open the door for the entry of bootleg and illicit spirit of dubious quality and suspicious provenance into Kerala.

Speculation was rife in the State that the government would clamp down on the sale of alcohol since morning. It triggered long queues in front of Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco) run outlets across the State, which the authorities struggled to control.

The government had asked customers to keep a distance of at least 1.5 m from one another. Moreover, it had restricted the number of persons allowed to enter a liquor store at a time to five.

The Bevco also required buyers to wash their hands with soap before entering its outlets. The Corporation has made water and soap available for the public in front of its stores.

The government is yet to decide on the functioning of the 4,800 odd traditional toddy shops in Kerala.

Opposition wants total ban

The Congress-led United Democratic Front Opposition had accused the government of having traded off public interest for the patronage of the liquor lobby by not banning liquor sales during the outbreak.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has demanded a total ban on the sale of liquor till the threat of the pandemic receded and said he was unsatisfied with the closure of bars alone. UDF activists attempted to disrupt the auctioning of toddy shops in Wayanad. They have also promised to lay siege to Bevco outlets if the government did not close them.

The Indian Medical Association had also made a similar appeal to the State government.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wz2wn0/article31142746.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KERALALIQUORFILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/coronavirus-kerala-government-shuts-bars-and-private-clubs/article31142747.ece
176,2020/03/23,Coronavirus | Two booked for circulating fake information through social media,"A former block panchayat member urged people to defy government instructions and another youth spread message about fake ‘aerial vaccine’

Bedakom Police have registered a case against a former block panchayat member for circulating false information and making derogatory remarks against the Prime Minister and Chief Minister.

The police registered a case against O.V. Vijayan, a resident of Malamkund in Bandadka and a former block panchayat member. A case under section IPC 269, 188 and 118(E) Kerala Police Act has been registered against him, based on a complaint filed by E. Madhusudhan Nair.

Bedakom Station House Officer T. Uthamdas said the voice message which went viral on WhatsApp appealed to the people to neglect the government’s instruction to stop the spread of coronavirus and questioned the efforts of the health department to curtail the disease.

“The message urged people to boycott the call for Janata Curfew by the Prime Minister and also misguided them by giving false information against the government instructions to curb the spread of coronavirus,” he said.

Mr. Uthamdas said stringent action would be taken and non-bailable cases would be registered against those who try to spread false information and also refuse to follow orders issued by the government, district administration and police.

In Kannur, police arrested a youth for circulating false information through social media that a vaccine would be sprayed aerially to contain coronavirus outbreak in the district.

The accused, Shani Sharif, from Muzhappilangad, was arrested near Edakkad. He was arrested based on the complaint registered by the District Medical Officer Narayana Nayak to the District Police Chief Yathish Chandra.

In his complaint, the DMO said that a voice message stating that a ‘poisonous methyl-based’ vaccine would be sprayed using helicopter over the district to kill coronavirus was circulating on WhatsApp. He requested to take necessary action against those spreading such false information.

Police said he sent the voice message to several people and later tried to delete the evidence from his mobile phone, and claimed he received the message from elsewhere. Police is trying to find the adminstrator of the WhatsApp group, who circulated the message.

However, a case under Kerala Police Act 118(B), 120(o), and IPC 505 1(B), has been charged against Shani Sharif.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/x5c44e/article31142328.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WHATSAPPFILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/coronavirus-two-booked-for-circulating-fake-information-through-social-media/article31142329.ece

A brother and sister, who were put under home quarantine after returning from the U.K. as per the COVID-19 guidelines, defied quarantine and flew back to the U.K. without informing the health officials of North Paravur in Ernakulam.

The duo had arrived from the U.K. on March 13 and were asked by the health authorities to remain on mandatory quarantine for 14 days at their home at Peruvaram in North Paravur. They had no apparent symptoms but were asked to be in quarantine in keeping with the prevailing protocol of putting everyone coming from abroad on mandatory 14-day quarantine.

“They gave us a landline number and we were in constant contact with them till March 20. However, in between, they could not be contacted for a day and when we asked them where they were when the contact was restored, they claimed that they flew to Mumbai for a day for some emergency requirement. But they didn’t share much details with us. We promptly informed North Paravur police about the violation of the protocol,” said a health inspector attached to Paravur municipality.

However, on Sunday evening health authorities came to know that the duo had left for U.K. on the morning of March 21 with three more days left for the quarantine period to end. “Only, an aged woman, a relative of the duo, lives in the house and she was hardly able to tell much except that they had left,” the health inspector said.

North Paravur police said that they had contacted the duo on March 13 and 17 before the intelligence officials contacted them on March 20 after health authorities alerted them about the violation of the quarantine protocol.

Health officials said that while there were many who were exemplary in their conduct and even volunteered to go on self quarantine, there were a few who simply kept sabotaging the battle to ‘break the chain’ by giving scant regard to the instructions.

North Paravur municipality has 107 people on home quarantine since March 8 and some of them have completed the quarantine period since then.

“People are very aware of their rights but conveniently forget about their responsibilities. Some of them keep questioning the need for quarantine without symptoms and break it. We have to employ even coercive measures of threatening to slap them with cases to make them fall in line besides creating awareness about the need to comply with the protocol for the large good of the society,” said K.S. Jayan, Station House Officer, North Paravur.

On the other hand, police also receive panic-stricken false alerts about people breaking quarantine like a recent one received by Maradu police. “We were alerted that a man put on quarantine was roaming around.

The districts are Ernakulam, Alappuzha, Idukki, Kannur, Kasargode, Kottayam, Malappuram, Pathanamthitta, Thrissur and Thiruvananthapuram.

Kasargode district, which reported five new cases on Sunday, is on lockdown since Saturday.

Kozhikode district, which reported a surge of people under observation for suspected exposure to infected persons, has prohibited congregation of more than five people in public places since Sunday.

However, the district has not restricted non-essential services but limited business timings, including that of liquor outlets, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Officials say the Cabinet is weighing on several options, including ordering restaurants not to seat patrons and to open takeaway counters instead. The government might also restrict the number of passengers on stage carriages, taxis and auto-rickshaws.

Excise Minister T. P. Ramakrishnan had conferred with Commissioner of Excise S. Ananthakrishnan in the morning, triggering speculation that the government might shut down liquor outlets and bars across Kerala.

180,2020/03/23,"COVID-19 | Among the migrants workers in Kerala, the dilemma is to leave or not to leave","Livelihoods in the informal sector have taken a hit with many hotels downing shutters

Quite a few of his friends have gone back home in this past few days, with the COVID-19 scare in the air, but Madhab from Karbi Anglong in Assam has decided to stay back for now. He has been here for only less than a year, taking up odd jobs first and later settling for a job in a hotel. His meagre savings will take a hit if he goes back now.

“Many of them began returning home last week, as there was a lot of fear regarding the spread of the virus. When the city streets became empty last weekend, more people started leaving. Even though a few hotels have shut down now, some are still not sure whether to travel now as travelling such a long distance now is risky too,” he says.

Scaremongering

Most of the migrant workers have received one or the other scaremongering video on their phones, depending upon the WhatsApp group they are part of. Workers from the Northeast have received an old video clip shot elsewhere of police personnel publicly announcing to migrant workers to return to their homes due to the dangerous situation, says Ayaz Sait, who runs three restaurants in the city.

Fake news

Meanwhile, some of the workers from Tamil Nadu last week received messages claiming that all trains and buses to the State are about to be stopped.

Messages like these have led many migrant workers to go back home, crippling the hotel industry in the city. With a major depletion in staff strength, many popular restaurants have shut down in the past few days.

“Soon after the virus outbreak, we implemented all safety measures, including hand sanitising. But, we serve a large clientèle and the restaurant is always crowded during noon, with a lot of foreigners too visiting for the Kerala Sadya. Some of the workers too seemed to be scared in this situation. So, we decided to close down for a few days,” says Sanal.K.S., who runs a restaurant in the city.

B.Vijayakumar, district secretary of the Kerala Hotel and Restaurant Association, says around 30% of the restaurants in the city have closed down over the past few days. “Over the past 10-15 years, migrant workers have become the majority of the workforce in restaurants. So, when they leave en masse, it will be hard to keep the business running. Though they have been told about the safety measures taken, most of them leave when they get frequent calls from their family members back home. The restaurants that are running have cut down their menu by half, as the number of visitors have also dwindled. If this situation continues, the majority of the restaurants will have to be shut down temporarily,” he says.

Calm in construction sector

Considerably less number of migrant workers have left for home from the construction sector, with the work on apartment complexes progressing at almost the usual pace. Restrictions and precautionary measures have been put in place at work sites to reduce contact between workers and ensure sanitation, according to office-bearers of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations.

Though labour and health officials have been carrying out checks in migrant workers’ camps and sites, with awareness campaigns in multiple languages, quite a few still remain out of the radar.

Markets and other public spaces, where migrant workers come together to unwind usually, have all been conspicuous by their absence in the past few days. As much as it is a blow to the industry, the COVID-19 scare has also pushed a large workforce of migrant workers into a period of uncertainty.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/1447l8/article31140545.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22TVMIGRANTLABOURERS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-among-the-migrants-workers-in-kerala-the-dilemma-is-to-leave-or-not-to-leave/article31140546.ece
181,2020/03/23,"Coronavirus | In Kerala, migrants at crossroads over COVID-19 fears","With fears over COVID-19 unabated, the migrant worker community, an integral part of Malayali society, is at a crossroads. With many intending to go back, a campaign is on that all is not lost.

Supriya Debnath is busy these days posting messages in multiple WhatsApp groups.

Only, they are not pointless forwards or memes but informative multimedia and multilingual messages aimed at creating awareness about COVID-19 among the migrant worker community.

Ms. Debnath, a 24-year-old from Kendrapara district in Odisha and proficient in multiple languages, including Malayalam, is one of the 11 migrant link workers trained by the National Health Mission (NHM) to disseminate COVID-19-related information among the migrant community in the State.

“Initially, they didn’t realise the seriousness of the disease and continued to get on with their lives as usual. So I made field visits to educate them with the dos and don’ts with the help of videos. Now, they are aware of the issue and keep asking me through WhatsApp messages about the gravity of the situation every day,” says Ms. Debnath, an education volunteer with the Roshni project for the academic betterment of migrant children.

Information dissemination

Having already arranged for information dissemination on the epidemic through Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Odia, and Assamese, the Athithi Devo Bhava campaign, aimed at the well being of migrants, is now busy preparing the second set of messages for propagation among the migrant community in the event of a surge in the spread of the disease.

“These messages will focus on more stringent precautionary measures to be taken in the event of a spread. Kerala being one of the first States to report the disease, there is an apprehension among the migrant worker community and their first impulse is to return home. There is no point stopping them either,” says Akhil Manuel, district nodal officer, Athithi Devo Bhava campaign.

Mathews Nambelil, district programme manager, National Health Mission, says measures are being taken to instil confidence among migrant workers who opt to stay back in the State.

“We want to assure them that there is nothing to be scared about and all health facilities accessible to local residents will be open to them as well. The message we want to convey to them is that they will be taken care of,” he says.

Benoy Peter, executive director, Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development, says there is likelihood of a reverse exodus of migrant workers in the days to come as witnessed after demonetisation that led to massive job loss in the informal sector four years ago.

“Likewise, the epidemic has begun to take its toll on livelihoods in the informal sector with hotels and restaurants getting closed. Staying back in such circumstances bearing the expenses towards rent and food is not a viable option for many. We have alerted the district administration of Murshidabad district in West Bengal about the large-scale return of migrant workers from Kerala. The potential mass cancellations of trains in the days to come may also trigger panic among those eager to return,” he says.

Mr. Peter says footloose migrant workers, especially the Tamil community with higher average age compared to the rest, are potential carriers of the disease considering that they gather in large numbers in public spaces and move around in the public transport.

The impression that migrant workers are going back in large numbers was reaffirmed by the heavy rush in trains to Guwahati in Assam last week, which Railway Protection Force (RPF) sources at Aluva railway station, a major boarding and alighting point of migrant workers in the State, attributed to job losses and scare over the epidemic.

“During our interaction with migrant workers passing through our station, they told us that they can’t afford to stay back in the face of increasing job loss,” says T.S. Gopakumar, Assistant Security Commissioner, RPF, Ernakulam.

Spectre of job loss

Mujeeb Rahman, president of All Kerala Plywood and Block Board Manufacturers Association, says the epidemic is beginning to take its toll on the business in the wake of lockdowns in Karnataka and Maharashtra and warned of job loss among migrants if the slide continues.

“Migrant workers from Assam, who make up the largest informal workforce in the plywood industry, have not yet started leaving in large numbers. We have restricted them to their lodgings at the work sites while arranging for the delivery of essential goods. Besides, public announcements are being made in their language about the precautions to be taken to fight the disease,” he said.

Notwithstanding the challenging times, not all migrants are thinking of returning home just yet.

There are the likes of Rasid Ahmad, a 23-year-old from Assam employed at a vegetable vending shop at Vellanchira, near Perumbavur. “If you were to get infected you would whether or not you head home. So there is no point going back as long as you have the job. If you lose the job then, of course, there is no point in hanging around here, he says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/payvr7/article31140311.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22TVCORONA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/migrants-in-a-bind/article31140312.ece
182,2020/03/23,Lottery windfall for Bengal labourer,"He returned from COVID19-hit Kerala

A poor labourer from the Murshidabad district was staring at an uncertain future after returning from Kerala, one of the States hard-hit by COVID-19, when he won ₹1 crore in a lottery.

Izarul Seikh, 30, of Mirzapur village under the Beldanga police station area, was working in Kerala and returned home a week back after the number of the pandemic-affected people started soaring, a police officer said on Sunday.

Seikh has a little daughter, wife, rickshaw-puller father and mother at home.

As he went to Beldanga town, about 5 km from his village on Wednesday, he bought a lottery ticket of a State that has prize money of ₹1 crore. He discovered the next day that he won it.

Hopes to start business

Seikh met the officer-in-charge of Beldanga police station and requested him for help, including security, as the news got around and hundreds of people crowded his modest dwelling.

“I want to start a business with a part of that amount and also build a house and ensure my family is not hard-pressed any more,” he said.

The prize money has been deposited at a bank account at the advice of the police officer and his well-wishers, he said.

""I was staring at a bleak future the day I came from Kerala. The rate for a daily labourer is ₹500-600 in Murshidabad, which is half of what we earn in Kerala. Now the Almighty has blessed me,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lottery-windfall-for-bengal-labourer/article31138257.ece

188,2020/03/23,COVID-19: Self-imposed quarantine for a section of healthcare personnel in Tamil Nadu,"This is to prevent increased exposure to COVID-19, and to keep a reserve health workforce

A section of the health workforce -- doctors, nurses and paramedical staff -- in government medical college hospitals and government hospitals involved in the management of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will be put under “self-imposed quarantine” at home in the State. This is to prevent increased exposure to COVID-19, and to keep a reserve health workforce.

The Directorate of Medical Education (DME) is all set to put a third of its workforce on a one-week self-imposed quarantine, while the Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services (DMS) is sending one-fourth of the total human resources on quarantine. In both the directorates, only those hospitals that are involved in COVID-19 management would follow this guideline. This is mainly for those directly involved in treatment and care of patients with symptoms, officials said.

In a circular to all joint directors of health services, the DMS pointed out that the recent closure of Sri Chithirai Thirunal Institute at Trivandrum, the health administrators are of the view that not all healthcare providers should be exposed to the risk at a given point of time. It would be wise to have a reserve health force in case of contingencies. The joint directors were requested to plan suitably.

Accordingly, in facilities with isolation, quarantine/observation services, doctors, nurses and paramedics should be given self-imposed quarantine at home for a period of seven days which may be treated as on duty on a trial basis. One-fourth of the total human resource may be given such seven-day self quarantine with advice to strictly follow norms and avoid mingling with the general population either personally or professionally.

The reserve health force should report back to duty after completion of seven days or immediately on call in the evening of any emergency. The joint directors in consultation with hospital superintendents/chief medical officers may arrive at the list of human resources to be given self-imposed quarantine for the next four weeks.

Officials of the DME said this would apply especially to government medical college hospitals managing COVID-19, including outpatient services and treatment. “This is especially for medical and paramedical staff who are directly in contact with patients suspected to have symptoms of COVID-19 and work in isolation wards. This includes physicians, radiologists, anaethetists, paediatricians and obstetricians who are directly exposed to patients, and are at risk,” an official said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/lsbwfi/article31142713.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23MARTH--CORONA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-self-imposed-quarantine-for-a-section-of-healthcare-personnel-in-tamil-nadu/article31142714.ece

In an all-out effort to battle COVID-19, Tamil Nadu will face a lockdown from 6 p.m. on Tuesday to 6 a.m. on April 1, with prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC in place and all district borders closed. The State invoked provisions of Section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 to impose the restrictions.

The Puducherry Cabinet too recommended a lockdown from 9 p.m. on Monday to March 31.

The lockdown announced by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami in the Assembly was followed by a detailed notification from Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam in the evening. “People are required to stay at home and come out only for accessing basic and essential services, strictly follow social distancing norms and maintain a distance of 1m or 3 feet. Any congregation of more than five persons in public places is prohibited,” he said.

The Chief Minister said all shops and commercial establishments would remain closed except those selling provisions, milk, vegetables, meat and fish. Pharmacies too were exempt. He said that the Centre had sent out an advisory to combat COVID-19 in many districts of the country.

Except essential transport services, public and private transport, omnibuses, autos and taxis would not be allowed to ply. “All transportation, except for essential commute (and transportation of goods), between States and districts has been banned,” he said. There is no bar on the use of personal vehicles.

Mr. Palaniswami said that government offices, other than those dealing with essential services, would not function.

The Chief Minister announced that Amma Unavagams would continue to feed thousands of workers. Only takeaway would be allowed in restaurants but delivery services like Swiggy and Zomato would not operate.

“We hope that this detailed notification will help control the spread of coronavirus. Police has been instructed to ensure that the prohibitive orders are implemented.

The Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) Tamil Nadu branch has come forward to help the State Government for the management of COVID-19.

IMA informed the government that willing member hospitals were ready to keep 50% of their bed strength reserved for the management of COVID-19 in case of any eventuality. If any private hospital was ready to convert its entire facility for COVID-19 management, that was also welcomed by IMA.

The decision was taken in a three-hour-long webinar (web conferencing) held on Sunday in which Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar, Health Secretary Beela Rajesh, and other seniot health officials and senior government officials, as well as the national president of the IMA, State officer-bearers of the IMA and members of the medial body across the State took part.

The government decided that private hospitals empanelled under the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme could be used for COVID-19 management in the first level if required.

IMA Tamil Nadu has 4,500 member hospitals and 36,000 members in 166 branches.

The Health Secretary said the Department has identified laboratories accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories to be roped in for COVID-19 testing if required.

IMA State president C.N. Raja requested the Health Minister to consider insurance for medical professionals, in government and private sectors, as they are first in line to get exposed to the virus while handling patients.

“Insuring medical professionals will encourage them to combat the epidemic. It will boost their morale,” said State secretary A.K. Ravikumar.

Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) MLAs will not attend the ongoing Legislative Assembly session from Monday as they have to be with the people of their constituencies who are in constant fear of the COVID-19, party president and Opposition leader M.K. Stalin said.

The Assembly session will be held till March 31, though the original plan was to conduct it till April 9.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

In a letter to the Tamil Nadu Assembly Speaker P. Dhanapal, Mr. Stalin said the boycott would draw the government’s attention to the need for taking preventive and precautionary measures to tackle the pandemic.

Recalling Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar’s tweet that nine people had been tested positive for the disease 19 in Tamil Nadu since it was first traced in Kancheepuram on March 9, Mr. Stalin said nine people tested positive in 12 days and 8,950 persons had been quarantined. “This has created the doubt whether we were wasting the golden hours to combat the disease,” he said.

The DMK leader pointed out that the Centre had already cancelled examinations in schools and directed only 50% of the B and C category employees to report for work. “It will be in force till April 4. Janata Curfew was observed till Monday morning (in Tamil Nadu),” he said.

Pointing out that three districts — Chennai, Kancheepuram and Erode — had been included in the list of districts to be ‘locked down’ as per the advisory of the Centre, the DMK leader said debating in the Assembly would not be in the interest of the people when the entire world had decided that “distancing” was very important.

“It is said that out government did not learn anything from China and Italy; the two countries failed to act even though they were aware of the disease,” he said.

Mr. Stalin said the government refused to pay heed to his request to adjourn the Assembly and was conducting it against the advise of the Centre.

Toll plazas on Rajiv Gandhi Salai (IT Corridor) and East Coast Road (ECR) up to Puducherry remained open on Sunday during the ‘Janata Curfew’. Over one lakh vehicles usually pass through the plazas on the IT Corridor while around 10,000 take the ECR.

On weekends, around 13,000 vehicles pass through the ECR toll plazas.

While the police across the State have started making santisers for use in stations, the Tiruvallur district police have gone a step further — they will start distributing them to panchayats in their jurisdiction.

Following a shortage of sanitisers, six Armed Reserve constables attached to the Tiruvallur police were trained by the Directorate of Public Health (DPH) in making santisers.

Following this, they started making the disinfectant in the Armed Reserve police barracks. Women’s self-help groups in the district have also been roped in to make santisers and masks.

“As on date, we are making five litres every day and supplying them to 29 police stations, five Deputy Superintendent of Police offices and the office of the Superintendent of Police. From Monday, we will be increasing the production to 20 litres,” said P. Aravindan, Tiruvallur SP.

The santisers are checked for quality by health officials. On Sunday, the policemen approached a few panchayats in Tiruvallur district to explain the features of the santisers. From Monday, they will be provided to them.

SHGs involved

Four SHGs are involved in making sanitisers and masks. While the sanitisers, called Thiruveer, are made by two SHGs under the Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihood Mission, the masks are made by the SHGs from TNSRLM and Tamil Nadu Urban Livlihood Misson.

“They were also trained by the DPH. A minimum of 60 litres and maximum of 120 litres of sanitiser are made every day. It is supplied to the local bodies,” said an official.

200,2020/03/23,Three new cases take total to 9,"Woman who returned from Spain is Coimbatore’s first

The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Tamil Nadu rose to 9 on Sunday.

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar tweeted about the three new patients who had tested positive. In the morning, he said a (25-year-old) woman, who had returned from Spain, had tested positive for COVID-19. Late in the evening, he tweeted that a 64-year-old woman, who had travelled to T.N. from California, was under isolation at the Stanley Medical College, and a 43-year-old man, who had returned from Dubai, was under isolation at the Tirunelveli Medical College. Both had tested positive. All three patients were in a stable condition, he added.

Coimbatore recorded its first COVID-19 case with the 25-year-old woman who had returned from Spain.

The Health Department has quarantined her father and her sister, while efforts are on to trace the driver of the taxi she had hailed to get to her house from the Coimbatore railway station.

Health Department officials said the woman developed symptoms on March 19. Her sample was taken at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, and she was quarantined at the ESI Hospital on the same day.

They added that the Department was making efforts to obtain details of persons who had travelled with the woman on the flight and were in the same coach as her’s in the train.

After arriving in Bengaluru on March 17, she boarded a Kerala-bound train to Coimbatore.

The Health Department officials are yet to come to a conclusion about the source of infection of the two Thailand nationals who tested positive in Erode on Saturday. The duo were part of a seven-member group from Thailand.

A 49-year-old man from the same group was admitted to CMCH on March 15. He tested negative on March 17 but died of complications from diabetic nephropathy and septicemia the next day.

“The two Thailand nationals, who tested positive on Saturday, developed symptoms on their 18th day in India. Symptoms are expected to become evident before a maximum period of 14 days,” an official said.

2,05,396 screened

A medical bulletin said 2,05,396 passengers had been screened at airports in Chennai, Tiruchi, Madurai and Coimbatore till date. As many as 9,424 passengers were under home quarantine for 28 days.

Currently, 198 asymptomatic passengers from highly-affected countries have been quarantined in facilities near airport and 54 persons were under hospital isolation.

The Health department has lifted 443 samples from the passengers and sent them for testing at King Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research, Guindy, Chennai, the National Institute of Virology, Pune, besides the Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratories in Theni, Thiruvarur, Tirunelveli, Coimbatore and Salem and the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital.

A 20-year-old passenger with travel history to Delhi and a 21-year-old passenger with travel history to Ireland, who tested positive for COVID-19, are stable and under observation in RGGGH, Chennai.

201,2020/03/23,Does COVID-19 have a link with the eyes?,"We ophthalmologists are used to the red/pink eye, called Madras Eye, which is a viral conjunctivitis caused by Adenovirus.

This conjunctivitis used to be seasonal until a few years back, but now it is seen right through the year. The symptoms of viral conjunctivitis are red eye, sore throat, fever.

The infection spreads from droplet source (aerosol spread), wherein it can spread from one person to another, in close proximity/contact with the surface that is infected.

The virus is actually very contagious and spreads very easily in closed spaces and air-conditioned rooms. The Adenoviral infection is self-limiting and is generally not vision threatening or life threatening.

COVID-19 also spreads from droplet source (aerosol spread), and has respiratory symptoms such as breathlessness which is not in the case of adenoviral infections.

COVID-19 presents as fever, dry cough, breathlessness and can be fatal. (For comparison, see box)

Those affected experience symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath or conjunctivitis, which can appear between two to 14 days, after being exposed to the virus. In addition to this, according to a paper published in The Lancet, patients can transmit the virus even before experiencing symptoms.

How is the new coronavirus related to your eyes?

Patients who have contracted the new coronavirus may have ocular symptoms. Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the membrane covering the eyeball. It is often referred to as ‘pink eye’. Conjunctivitis often presents as an infected/red, “wet and weepy” eye. Viral conjunctivitis is known to present with upper respiratory infections (colds, flu, etc.) and may be a symptom of the COVID-19.

A recent study of hospitals across China, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found “conjunctival congestion” or red, infected eyes in nine of 1,099 patients (0.8%) with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.

A study in The Journal of Medical Virology showed that of 30 patients hospitalised for COVID-19, only one was diagnosed with conjunctivitis. Based on this information, the occurrence of conjunctivitis is low.

The American Academy of Ophthalmology has released new recommendations regarding urgent and non-urgent patient care on March 18. Patients typically present with respiratory illness, including fever, cough and shortness of breath; conjunctivitis has also been reported.

The only way is to follow regular hygiene practices — frequent handwashing, sneezing or coughing onto a sleeve as recommended by the WHO, and social distancing. Approach a doctor if you notice any of these symptoms.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/iad9ve/article31138372.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THRAJAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/does-covid-19-have-a-link-with-the-eyes/article31138375.ece
202,2020/03/23,"We are not suppressing figures regarding COVID-19, says TN Health Minister","Tamil Nadu is prepared for the worst; a lockdown will be implemented in a phased manner, says Health Minister

Describing as baseless the allegation that the State has been suppressing the figures regarding COVID-19, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar has said a complete lockdown is the best option to control the spread of the disease. In an interview on Sunday, he said the State was prepared for the worst. Excerpts:

Given that seasonal flu can mimic the symptoms of the coronavirus, would you advise anyone with cough, fever and breathlessness to undergo tests?

Yes, there is a seasonal flu that has similar symptoms. Earlier, we were insisting on people getting themselves tested if they had fever, cough and breathlessness. But since Saturday night, breathlessness triggered by acute respiratory syndrome or pneumonia is sufficient to warrant the test.

This way, we can prevent the spread of the virus in the community. There is no dearth of testing kits or beds in isolation wards. We have eight testing centres with adequate testing kits, made available for free by the Centre.

What is the treatment protocol for patients with strong symptoms?

I am getting inputs from experts in India and abroad that this crisis is going to get worse in the next two months or so. I am aware that this is going to be a big challenge. We are getting ready to manage the situation. We have started treating quarantined patients with Chloroquine and Azithromycin drugs, which is yielding good results. Adequate quantities of these medicines, along with anti-viral drugs sufficient to treat 1.5 lakh patients, have been procured. These medicines are in high demand worldwide.

Do we have a contingency plan with adequate quarantine facilities and manpower to deal with such a situation?

There are 1,690 ventilators ready for use. A 1,000 more units are expected next week. We have 40 lakh three-ply masks, two lakh N-95 masks and thousands of units of personal protective equipment. To face any crisis that may arise, the Health Department is planning to have a reserve strength by granting leave on a rotational basis to a sizeable number of medical and para-medical staff. Orders for appointing 500 doctors, 1,000 nurses and 1,500 lab technicians will be issued soon. We have procured 10,000 cots with mattresses. Every new building inaugurated in recent times, ready-to-use buildings, etc. are being converted into isolation wards. The newly-built seven-storied Tower-III in the Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital will be declared an isolation facility. Many existing wards are being converted into isolation wards. A piece of robotic equipment designed and developed by Hindustan University was trialled at RGGH on Sunday, and is working well. Doctors have suggested some more customisation, and the robot will soon serve patients in isolation wards by supplying medicines, food etc.

Are people arriving from abroad cooperating with the Health Department when it comes to screening and quarantine?

I am unhappy [with the current situation]. Many passengers with a travel history to other countries are not cooperating. They are reluctant to get quarantined and don’t follow basic instructions. Now, we have connected the 4,250 people who have been quarantined with a mobile app, and are treating them online. The geo-fence technique is being deployed to make sure they stay indoors. The number of beds in isolation wards has been increased from 1,160 to 5,800, and 32 passengers with symptoms have been admitted there. We have also drawn up a list of those who had arrived here from abroad, and are keeping a close watch on their condition. We have enforced restrictions under the Public Health Act and are stamping their (the passengers’) hands with the ‘Home Quarantined’ mark in indelible ink.

What is the status as regards the participation of private hospitals?

We had a meeting with major private hospitals on Saturday. They have agreed to earmark 100 beds each for the isolation and treatment of patients. The State will bear their treatment expenses.

Is a complete lockdown necessary to deal with the crisis?

We have sealed the inter-State borders. The railways has suspended train operations and inter-State bus services have been withdrawn. A complete lockdown is the best solution to control the spread in the community. But we also have to ensure an uninterrupted supply of essential services. The lockdown will happen in a phased manner. I want to recommend a complete lockdown in the State, and people should cooperate fully by understanding seriousness of the global crisis.

How do you view the role of social media in these troubled times?

I am actively giving updates on Twitter. But many people are posting unconfirmed reports, creating panic. Such people must realise this is a pandemic that has been claiming lives and act responsibly.

Is it true that the source of infection of the patient who came here by train from Delhi is still not known?

Yes. We have identified 193 persons who had come in contact with him days before he tested positive. But this single case is not an indicator to confirm that the infection is spreading in the community.

There is an allegation that you are suppressing the figures…

It is a baseless allegation. We are acting in a transparent manner and publishing all the data in the public domain. If revealing facts is going to create panic among the people, we’re fine with that. We can’t afford to conceal any information regarding COVID-19. We will not hesitate to project the ground reality...only then, there will be better cooperation from people.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/6ti1mf/article31138348.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th23ministerq,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/we-are-not-suppressing-figures-regarding-covid-19-says-tamil-nadu-health-minister/article31138349.ece

Over 8,000 cheque bounce cases have been disposed of in Tamil Nadu in 2019, with settlement totalling ₹208.39 crore, according to data provided in Parliament.

A total of 61,384 cases were taken up, of which 8,287 cases were disposed during January-December 2019 by National Lok Adalats organised by National Legal Services Authority of India, Anurag Singh Thakur, Union Minster of State for Finance, recently told the Rajya Sabha said in a written reply.

Mr. Singh was responding to a question raised by Ram Vichar Netam (BJP) on the cheque bounce cases.

The Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act, 2018, was passed by Parliament and received the President’s assent on August 2, 2018.

Undue delay

The Act addresses the issue of undue delay in final resolution of cheque bounce cases, with an object to provide substantial relief to payees of dishonoured cheques and discourage frivolous and unnecessary litigation with respect to cheque dishonour cases, which would save time and money, the Minister said.

The Act provides for an interim compensation of a sum not exceeding 20% of the amount of the cheque to the payee at the trial stage. The Appellate Court may order the appellant to deposit such sum which shall be a minimum of 20% of the fine or compensation awarded by the trial court, he added.

Reducing pendency

Mr. Thakur pointed out that in order to reduce the pendency of cases in the courts, the legal services institutions under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, organise weekly / monthly and also Mega Lok Adalats.

In addition to this, National Lok Adalats were held from taluk to Supreme Court level to reduce the pendency of cases, he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/over-8000-cheque-bounce-cases-settled/article31138268.ece

206,2020/03/23,Weddings in the time of a virus,"Notwithstanding the ‘Janata Curfew’ , some couples tie the knot

Amidst the ‘Janata Curfew’, some families managed to conduct weddings in the city and elsewhere in the State.

While some cut down on the number of guests, others decided to hold the receptions at a later date.

The wedding of V. Vimalkumar and K. Kamali of Saidapet was held at the house of DMDK founder Vijayakant. “We had planned to conduct it in a temple, but since temples were closed, we had no place to go. When we informed the Captain (Vijayakant) about this, he welcomed us to his house. We will never forget his gesture. The wedding was held with a priest officiating it and 17 members from the families of the bride and the groom taking part,” said P. Venuram, the groom’s father and DMDK’s labour wing deputy secretary. Mr. Venuram, who runs a tiffin centre at Venkatapuram in Little Mount, arranged for breakfast at his house after the wedding. “There was a very different feel to it. We were concerned about whether we would be able to pull off the wedding, since the van driver refused to come,” he said.

L.N. Srinivasan of LVN Catering, Mylapore, said they seated two persons in place of the usual three at each table. “The wedding party ensured that the guests were safe and arranged for hand sanitisers. In place of 800 guests, they had 150,” he said.

In Tiruchi, events held in a couple of prominent wedding halls witnessed a muted attendance of family members. “A majority of our relatives arrived here last night, knowing full well that there will be a lockdown, and stayed put at the wedding hall to participate in the event on Sunday. We went ahead with the wedding as it could not be cancelled, given that all the arrangements had already been made,” said K. Ravi, an uncle of the bridegroom. In some wedding halls in Thanjavur districts, face masks were provided to the participants.

In Madurai, Thoothukudi and Thiruchendur, couples advanced the muhurtham to between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m., before the start of the curfew.

As in other places, weddings in Udhagamandalam and Krishnagiri took place with very small gatherings. In Udhagamandalam M. Jayanandhini and R. Mathan Raj called off their reception on Sunday due to the curfew. The wedding took place in a temple, with just 20 participants.

The wedding plans of Revathi from Krishnagiri and Sharath from Bengaluru got derailed by the virus. The couple wed in the presence of just eight persons. In Dharmapuri, a Muslim couple got married in the presence of a modest gathering.

207,2020/03/23,AIADMK strips Rajenthra Bhalaji of key party post,"Leadership’s move follows a series of controversial statements by the Minister

The AIADMK on Sunday stripped Dairy Development Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji of the key party post of Virudhunagar district unit secretary, following his controversial statements in the recent past, including a tweet he had posted on Sunday.

Though a press release issued by AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam and co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami did not specify any reason for the decision, party sources confirmed that the Minister's tweet, which he had posted without the party leadership's approval, was the last straw.

In a controversial tweet during the ‘Janata Curfew’ called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease, Mr. Bhalaji said that the happenings in the country were a “lesson to those insulting Hindu religious practices and rituals”.

“The happening in the country are a lesson to bogus crusaders who made fun of Hindu religious practices and beliefs. Please Sri Krishna Paramathma save this country and the people of this country,” he tweeted from his official handle. However, the post was deleted later.

However, a party leader said this single act could not have been the reason behind the decision to strip the Minister of his party post. “Usually, our party leadership does not take action against anyone on the basis of just one instance of indiscretion. It takes action only after complaints are continuously made against someone,” he said.

Another party functionary recalled that Mr. Bhalaji had been making public statements that either embarrassed the party leadership or did not have its approval. Following controversial statements by the Minister, the DMK had, last month, in a plea to the Governor, said he should be dropped from the Council of Ministers. The Congress too demanded the same.

Mr. Bhalaji had, in an interview to a TV channel, said “Islamic terrorism” will fuel “Hindu terrorism” and also claimed that the murder of Vijay Raghu, a BJP functionary in Tiruchi, had a religious angle to it, despite the police having rejected the claim.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/to87go/article31138033.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23KARUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-strips-rajenthra-bhalaji-of-key-party-post/article31138034.ece

People from districts bordering Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka welcomed the ‘Janata Curfew’ and wholeheartedly observed it on Sunday.

People from different walks of life showed their solidarity with Prime Minister’s call in fighting against the spread of the deadly virus.

Barring a few paper delivery boys, milk sachet suppliers and tea vendors one could not see any movement on the roads, which otherwise would remain crowded for most part of the day. The paper boys and milk suppliers too wound up their operations before 6 a.m..

The city of Vellore was left only with security personnel at major destinations like Vellore Fort, bus stands and railway stations.

Following Prime Minister's appeal to check the spread of COVID-19 residents remained at home since morning. Arterial roads, inner roads, lanes and by-lanes were free of vehicle movement. No pedestrians were seen. The ever-busy Chennai-Bengaluru National Highway wore a deserted look.

However, small time butcher shops were operating in some areas of Vellore, Ambur and Vaniyambadi. Policemen patrolling these areas requested them to shut down for the sake of others’ health, which the shopkeepers obliged.

In Ranipet district, vegetable markets in Walajah, Sholingur, Arcot, Kaveripakkam and Arakkonam remained closed and already bigger establishments were asked to shut down till March 31 by the District Administration.

212,2020/03/23,"‘Ayyappanum Koshiyum’, ‘The Insult’ and the ideals of masculinity","The recent Malayalam hit starring Prithviraj and Biju Menon resonates with another Lebanese film, both revolving around two characters who suffer from a common disease of male arrogance

Self-isolation is a blessing in disguise. For, it allows you to watch/revisit movies that you otherwise may have missed on the screen — like how I ended up watching Ayyappanum Koshiyum on Amazon Prime recently. What was captivating, for me, was the ostensible commentary on masculinity that runs throughout the movie.

A fascinating stretch in Ayyappanum Koshiyum comes in the form of a verbal confrontation between Koshi (a terrific Prithviraj Sukumaran) and his father Kurien (Ranjith), both of whom are bound by their patriarchal values but are at loggerheads when questions related to manhood arise. It is a critical scene that examines how Koshi is perceived in the eyes of his father: a teenage boy with testosterone issues. You see desperation in Koshi’s eyes in trying to prove that he is no less than a ‘man’, with the underlying emotion driven by hate. In another movie, Koshi would have definitely slapped Kurien in that scene — if you are thinking about Vada Chennai, which had a similar set-up, you are not alone. “This is between Ayyappanum Koshiyum. Don’t involve women and children in this. Otherwise, this will end only with the death of either one of us.” Koshi issues a warning to Kurien, who receives the message with a casual: “That’s how the lives of men are, you spineless fellow.” This entire stretch, if I can say, is the spine of Ayyappanum Koshiyum, resulting in a tug of war on who is the ‘ideal’ man and showing the murky sides of malevolence.

In the same scene, Koshi realises the noticeable absence of women and asks this to his father: “What about the lives of women? If one of us dies, then one would either end up being the wife of a murderer or a widow.” His wife Ruby (Anna Rajan) intervenes at this juncture and admonishes Kurien for triggering Koshi to indulge in a warfare with Ayyappan Nair (Biju Menon, in a phenomenal performance). The scene ends with Ruby getting a tight slap from Koshi for crossing the borderline, when it is a matter concerning men. Koshi, if you think about it, basically counters his own argument on the participation of women in the larger scheme of things. But that is true of a patriarch, right? This entire stretch and the resultant conversations are fascinating. Because Ayyappanum Koshiyum (written and directed by Sachy) makes an interesting analogy on what constitutes a real ‘man’ in the first place and demonstrates the malaise of male pride. The aforementioned sequence, in particular, shows the zenith of manhood, with women being a mere bystander to the proceedings reserved for and by men.

The fault in our stars

By now, you must be aware that masculinity is a social construct and that men would go to the cosmic extent in defending their masculine status, any day. I came across an interesting quote by Thomas Hobbes while watching a video shared by a friend. He wrote, “When men live without fear of a common power, they live in a state of warre. In warre, every man is against every other man.” Hobbes’ quote is a perfect description of the world inhabited by the characters of Ayyappanum Koshiyum, despite having a common power: law and order — unlike say, a Colosseum where gladiators’ valour and strength were put to test. They are a little more than macho men and a little less than beasts. In an article in The Hindu, Rajeev Bhargava presents a superb argument on manhood. He says, “Manhood is not naturally given, but is a goal to be achieved. To be born a boy is a privilege, but one that can be lost if one is not properly initiated into masculine practices. Besides, male adults must maintain this privilege by regular performance.”

The central characters, Ayyappan and Koshi, are in a constant state of fear of being tested for their masculinity, especially when their egos get bruised. As Bhargava argues, they need to maintain the privilege by regular performance. The word ‘performance’ here translates to indulging in mindless acts, in an effort to take superiority over the other. They never cease to exercise their male privilege and arrogance that come with it. To put it lightly, they are masculine beasts that need to be tamed — only by one another. “If this situation persists, they would kill each other,” says a police officer. Ayyappan and Koshi might hide under the blanket of stout-hearted men but deep down, they are very insecure about the pride associated with their gender. This insecurity is what Sachy seemed to have tapped into Ayyappanum Koshiyum.

Koshi Kurien’s ego gets pricked when he is given two slaps by Ayyappan Nair, when he is found to have possessed hard liquor, in an alcohol-free zone. His ego stems from the fact that a) he is an ex-army man and b) he has been hit by a sub-inspector, someone who is in the lower order of power structure. Ayyappan’s ego is pricked because a) he was only following protocols and b) he stands powerless in front of a man of a privileged background. This small incident sets off a bomb of events of mammoth proportions and of cascading effects. What starts as a conflict between two men turns into an ugly fight between the haves and have-nots. Therefore, their personal issue becomes slightly political.

“Ayyappanum Koshiyum is basically an extended ego match built on crude reality, yet very mainstream and compelling,” says The Hindu’s review. The way Sachy has built his script, riding primarily on the ego factor reminded me of another great movie I watched at the Chennai International Film Festival in 2018. It is the Lebanese movie The Insult, also involving two characters who suffer from a common disease of male arrogance. Both Ayyappanum Koshiyum and The Insult follow a similar narrative arc. Two men quarrel on something trivial and something that could have been resolved with a “sorry”, that acts as a point of escalation for the characters. But unlike Ayyappanum Koshiyum, which has sparks flying each time the two men enter the frame, The Insult was a more subtle and deeply political courtroom drama.

Two souls, one heart

The Insult centres on the dispute between Tony Hanna (Adel Karam), a Lebanese Christian and Yasser Abdallah Salameh (Kamel El Basha), a Palestine refugee and a construction worker. Yasser, who works near Tony’s place, notices an illegal construction of a water pipe and offers to fix it. Condescending looks and expletives are exchanged. Yasser is brought to Tony’s garage to apologise for calling him a “f***ing prick”. When the former tries to walk past Tony, he says, “I wish Ariel Sharon had wiped you all out.” Yasser throws a punch in his gut, breaking a rib or two. Tony drags Yasser to the court and soon, the issue snowballs into a greater political war between Lebanese and Palestine.

Towards the end of The Insult, there is a heart-rending moment between the two characters. Yasser visits Tony on the night before the judgement and says, “We all know who you [Lebanese Christians] guys are. You are a bunch of cry babies.” Unable to suppress the anger, Tony lands a punch on Yasser like the way latter did. The camera cuts to a close-up of Tony’s trembling hands. Yasser, on the other hand, gets back on his feet and says, “I am sorry” and walks away. I do not remember how the festival audience reacted to The Insult, but I certainly know that this scene got the loudest cheer.

It is a testament to show the pointlessness of wearing one’s masculinity up his sleeves. We are not sure if Ayyappan and Koshi have changed for the better. But if one were to take a leaf out of The Insult, it is this: the greatest form of resilience is the quality to step back, apologise and move ahead.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/fo15s2/article31142901.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ayyappan-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ayyappanum-koshiyum-the-insult-and-the-ideals-of-masculinity/article31142902.ece
213,2020/03/23,Amitabh Bachchan deletes post on ‘clapping vibrations destroy virus potency’ after being called out,"Recently, Twitter also removed a video uploaded by actor-turned-politician Rajinikanth for spreading misinformation

Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan on Monday was heavily criticised for one of his tweets, which claimed vibrations from clapping, blowing conch shells as part of Sunday’s Janata Curfew would have reduced or destroyed coronavirus potency as it was ‘amavasya’, the darkest day of the month.

Bachchan’s tweet comes in the wake of several similar fake news stories misinterpreting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal of clapping and clanging plates to express gratitude to those providing essential services during this global health crisis.

The 77-year-old actor took to Twitter and, in a tweet that has now been deleted, wrote, “An opinion given: 5 PM, 22nd Mar, ‘amavasya’, darkest day of month; virus, bacteria evil force at max potential & power! Clapping shankh vibrations reduce/ destroy virus potency Moon passing to new ‘nakshatra’ Revati. Cumulative vibration betters blood circulation.”

Bachchan posted the tweet along with his picture, which had three question marks scribbled on it, leading many to wonder if the actor was sharing his opinion or questioning the theory floating on social media.

However, his tweet was met with criticism as netizens slammed him for tweeting something which was not factual.

Lyricist Varun Grover was among the first ones to slam Bachchan, writing that the actor should’ve been more responsible at a time like this. “Shameful superstitions propaganda coming from a person with such huge reach. And we have learned to let go of ‘besharmi’ (shamelessness) of many of our celebs but this is DANGEROUS too. Indian lives are at stake here and you need to be more responsible,” Grover tweeted.

Bachchan is one of the most active and followed celebrities on social media. His followers count on Twitter alone stands at a staggering 40.5 million.

Bachchan’s tweet was also slammed by many journalists, lawyers and activists, who asked people to “mass report the tweet” so that’s it’s taken down by the microblogging site for spreading misinformation.

Recently, Twitter removed a video uploaded by actor-turned-politician Rajinikanth who claimed the 14-hour window of total social distancing as advised by the PM was necessary to curb the spread of virus.

The video was reportedly pulled down as it violated Twitter’s rules on misinformation.

According to the Union Health Ministry, the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country rose to 415 on Monday.

214,2020/03/23,Amy Jackson debuts ‘toilet paper’ workout with son Andreas,"The ‘2.0’ actor isn’t letting social distancing get in the way of working out, and urged her followers to do the same at home

British actor Amy Jackson is giving out fitness goals by showing a toilet paper-inspired workout with son Andreas amid coronavirus lockdown.

Amy didn’t let the coronavirus lockdown get in the way of her fitness routine as she engaged in a toilet paper-inspired workout with her six-month-old son Andreas, reports dailymail.co.uk.

In an Instagram clip, the Theri star, 28, flaunted her slender frame in sportswear as she engaged in a series of jump squats, push ups and planks with the help of toilet paper rolls.

Holding her baby on her lap, the star said: “So for this workout you’re going to need some very special equipment. Get your loo role at the ready! He’s going to keep his eye on my form and we’re going to do some toilet roll circuits!“

Amy showed off her toned abs as she exercised in the comfort of her home while self-isolating.

The Supergirl actor captioned the short video: “If we don’t laugh we’ll cry! Replace the loo roll with a tin of beans if you’re feeling strong.”

“Make sure you’re wearing a cute gym outfit so you don’t look completely ridiculous — @aloyoga ALWAYS #THETOILETROLLCIRCUIT... 12 frog leap & squats 45 seconds loo roll drills 12 push ups 12 side planks (each side) 45 seconds plank X5 #selfisolation #toiletpaper #homeworkout,” she added.

She made her acting debut with the 2010 Tamil movie Madrasapattinam and has featured in several Telugu, Hindi and Kannada films apart from Tamil films. Her last big release was the Rajinikanth-starrer 2.0 in 2018, which released in Tamil, Hindi and Telugu versions.

215,2020/03/23,"Paws, claws and jaws: The best creature features to get you through the coronavirus pandemic","Here are some jolly creatures who will make you feel social distancing isn’t such a bad thing after all

Working from home means shaving off considerable commute time, which means you have more time to read, write letters, do some gardening, yoga or vegetate in front of a screen — had to give the healthy options first. In the digital ocean of content, you could either scare yourself silly watching Steven Soderbergh’s excellent Contagion (2009) — cheap thrills in terms of seeing the inside of Gwyneth Paltrow’s goopy head notwithstanding — the extremely well put together Malayalam film, Virus (2019), Netflix’s hideously prescient documentary series Pandemic, or you could go for some good old fashioned escapism in the form of creature features.

The fun thing about these films is the threat is always nullified at the end of the film. There is a way to counter the threat. No matter how big the snake or how many sharp teeth the shark has, there will always be a Chief Brody to kill it with an oxygen tank. Though strictly speaking, the Alien movies can be classified as creature features in space, Jurassic Park is about, well dinosaurs running amok in a theme park and Godzilla is a giant radioactive lizard, they come under sci-fi, and would be better served in a different list.

Meanwhile, The Ghost and the Darkness (1996) features Michael Douglas going after the man-eaters of Tsavo, lions that killed numerous workers laying the Uganda-Mombasa Railway line in 1898. It doesn’t feature on this list as it is more adventure and the lions were being sensible protecting their habitat. Douglas comes across as rather silly with culturally appropriated dances and what not.

So here goes a list of the happiest clash of paws, claws and jaws.

Jaws (1975)

Okay this is the big daddy of all creature features. The beach party, the girl going skinny dipping, John Williams’ ominous score, the shark-eye cam, the flash of a wicked tail fin, the dead eyes and the cruel teeth all contributed to laying the template for the summer blockbuster. Based on Peter Benchley’s eponymous novel, Jaws starred Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody who with oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) — there will always be an Ahab, go hunting for the man-eating great white. The suggestion of the shark rather than the whole shark, was due to the many mechanical failures of the shark model, but it worked exceedingly well to build the tension. What the mind imagines is usually worse than reality. Oh and incidentally the film was directed by Steven Spielberg.

Anaconda (1997)

Where does one start with this movie directed by Luis Llosa? Is it Jennifer Lopez as serious documentary filmmaker before she became JLo? Or the big, fat anaconda slithering here and there and performing feats of preternatural skill that could drive herpetologists into frothing fits of fury? There is also Jon Voight chewing up the scenery as the Ahab style hunter. He gets his just desserts when the anaconda gobbles him up and then throws up — obviously could not digest his bad acting. The movie spawned a series and crossover, but nothing matches the joy of the first movie.

Lake Placid (1999)

This movie about a giant crocodile terrorising the good people of Black Lake in Maine is a must watch for the dear old lady who feeds the grinning crocodile with sundry cows and her husband. Oliver Platt as mythology professor Hector Cyr is fun while Bridget Fonda shows off her tanned legs as a paleontologist from the American Museum of Natural History. Brendan Gleeson before he was the tenacious Bill Hodges (Mr Mercedes) plays the thankless role of the Sheriff Hank Keough, while Bill Pullman is Fish and Game officer Jack Wells. The scene where the crocodile jumps out of the lake to eat the bear is delicious eye candy.

Deep Blue Sea (1999)

Samuel L Jackson being eaten mid-sentence is the highlight of this film about genetically engineered mako sharks. It seems like something Dr Evil would think up given his fondness for sharks with lasers attached to their heads so they can have a hot meal. Directed by Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger! Die Hard 2!) the film stars Saffron Burrows as the scientist and rapper LL Cool J as the chef with the coolest lines. He also contributed two songs—‘Deepest Bluest (Shark's Fin)’ and ‘Say What’.

Piranha 3D (2010)

This irreverent take on monster movies is as grisly as it is funny. The prehistoric piranha, which swim out of a crevice after an earthquake have big goo-goo eyes and shiny serrated teeth and attack everyone from seismologists to pornographers and wet t-shirt contestants. Directed by Alexandre Aja (The Hills Have Eyes), the film stars the lovely Elisabeth Shue as cop Julie Forester, Ving Rhames as her deputy and Steven R. McQueen (grandson of king of cool, Steve McQueen) as her son, Jake.

Richard Dreyfuss, the shark expert from Jaws is the first victim of the piranha attack even as he sings ‘Show me the way to go home’, which if you remember is what he sang on the way back from killing the shark in Jaws. That is how knowing the film is! Added bonus is Christopher Lloyd (Doc from The Back to the Future movies) as retired marine biologist Carl Goodman who identifies the piranha.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bikvku/article31141783.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/anaconda,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/paws-claws-and-jaws-the-best-creature-features-to-get-you-through-the-coronavirus-pandemic/article31141792.ece
216,2020/03/23,Netflix’s Ted Sarandos: ‘People are watching more content amid coronavirus pandemic’,"Though many productions have halted work, Sarandos said they have all gone digital and started implementing the concept of “virtual reading rooms”

With many cities worldwide under lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus, Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos has said the company has witnessed a surge in online viewership.

Sarandos told Brian Stelter on CNN’s ‘Reliable Sources’ that the novel coronavirus has caused a “massive disruption” in the global entertainment industry.

“It’s been a massive disruption. Every of one of our productions around the world are shut down. It’s unprecedented in history,” the executive said.

When asked about viewing, Sarandos said, “You can imagine, all viewing is up. It’s up on Netflix, on CNN on television in general. The system has been very robust and can help out a lot of people. People certainly are watching a lot more Netflix.”

As for the content, he said the streamer currently has a good library of shows that can easily serve the subscribers for the next few months.

“What’s happening now is we work pretty far ahead with delivering all the episodes of our shows at once so no disruption over the next few months, maybe later in the year as physical production is not operational,” he added.

Though many productions have halted work, Sarandos said they have all gone digital and started implementing the concept of “virtual reading rooms”.

“One of our shows, ‘Big Mouth’, the other day, did their first virtual table read. We had 40 actors and writers with Netflix executives doing a table read of a new episode. So, people are being quite adaptive on getting ready to — on getting geared up for a time when we do get back to work,” he added.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kst957/article31141445.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2020FILMINDEPENDENTSPIRITAWARDS-ARRIVALS,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/netflixs-ted-sarandos-people-are-watching-more-content-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/article31141446.ece
217,2020/03/23,Coronavirus: ‘Game of Thrones’ star Sophie Turner slams Evangeline Lilly over comments,"The ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp’ star had said that she wouldn’t be going into self-quarantine

Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner has taken a swipe at actor Evangeline Lilly who had said that she won’t be going into self-quarantine amid coronavirus outbreak, as she values freedom over everything else.

The Ant-Man and the Wasp star’s comments on social distancing didn’t go down well with Turner, who urged her fans to take precautions against the spread of COVID-19, which has claimed the lives of over 14,000 people worldwide.

“Stay inside, don’t be f**ing stupid. Even if you count your ‘freedom over ... your health’,” Turner, 24, said during an Instagram live.

“I don’t give a F about your freedom. You could be infecting other people, other vulnerable people around you, by doing this. So stay inside, guys. It’s not cool and it’s not big and it’s not clever. And that’s the tea,” she added.

Last Week, Lilly, 40, shared that she dropped her kids off at a gymnastics camp and that “they all washed their hands before going in”.

She accompanied the post with the hashtag “business as usual”, which did not go down well with many social media users.

The actor later wrote in the comments section, “Some people value their lives over freedom, some people value freedom over their lives. We all make our choices. Where we are right now feels a lot too close to Marshall Law for my comfort already, all in the name of a respiratory flu.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/it92yy/article31141385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/sophie,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/coronavirus-game-of-thrones-star-sophie-turner-slams-evangeline-lilly-over-comments/article31141386.ece
218,2020/03/23,Capturing cinematographer Ravi Varman’s journey through a photo series,"Photographer L Ramachandran’s latest series documents Ravi Varman’s rags-to-riches journey in the form of portraiture

“Just you and your Zenith 6. That’s all we require,” declared Chennai-based photographer L Ramachandran.

Those golden words were what convinced sought-after cinematographer Ravi Varman to undertake this assignment. Varman was working on the Kamal Haasan-starrer Indian 2 at that time. He later backed out of the project, but the seed Ramachandran sowed stayed with him for long. The concept was simple: to narrate Ravi Varman’s rags-to-riches story, in the form of portraiture.

A memorable journey

Those unfamiliar with the cinematographer’s life story might not be aware of how he took to the camera. As a young boy, Varman arrived from Thanjavur to Madras in 1987 with a shirt and a lungi, and an out-of-focus photograph of his mother, who had just passed away. He found work as a waiter at the Amaravathi Hotel — his first salary was ₹150. “I remember going to Moore Market to buy a colourful T-shirt and lungi,” recalls Ravi Varman. On the way, he stopped at a camera shop where he ended up spending his entire salary to buy a Zenith 6. Therein began his tryst with the camera — something that would take him from Kollywood (Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu, Anniyan and Dasavathaaram) to Bollywood (Barfi, Tamasha and Sanju).

Cut to February 2020, he fished out his prized possession for the photo series that Ramachandran had elaborately planned. “It’s probably the most valuable thing that I have,” says Varman, as we skim through the black-and-white clicks that feature the cinematographer and his best friend: the camera.

Cinematic lighting

Ramachandran’s love for Varman’s work started from the early stages of the latter’s career. “I loved how he played with colours and his frame sense. I was used to seeing such colours in Hollywood films, but movies like Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela and Barfi had that effect on me.”

Varman’s diary Worked as cinematographer in multiple big-budget Tamil films like Dasavathaaram, Anniyan and Kaatru Veliyidai.

A sought-after cameraman in Bollywood, he is known for his work in Barfi, Sanju and Jagga Jasoos.



But when the two sat down for this shoot, they decided to go with a black and white tone, with props that would bring to life what Varman would have experienced back then. After about 50 clicks, Ramachandran got what he wanted; a series of photographs that had the cinematographer posing like a magician, with a hat, and the Zenith 6 in hand. “We wanted to recreate the setting like how it would have been when he came to Madras.” So, the props they used were suitcases, with ‘cinematic lighting’ filling in the frames. “Usually, such shots have strobe lighting. I avoided that. To shoot a cinematographer in cinematic lighting was a memorable moment.”

SHOOT AT SIGHT Ramachandran’s own journey is a chequered one; a self-taught photographer whose creative contours have reportedly made him the only Indian representative photographer of the Playboy magazine. All his recent photo series’ are accompanied by a documentary — of the making of the pictures and a sneak peek into the subject’s personality.

At the moment, he has a three-minute cut that would be made public soon, to show audiences the challenges behind setting up a photo shoot of this scale. He has done multiple shoots, both nationally and internationally, but Ramachandran is still reticent before every session. “Every photo session scares me. That’s probably because I don’t compromise on my lighting pattern.”

There was one particular shot in the series that was completely unplanned — Ravi Varman flexing his muscles. “It happened when he was changing shirts, and someone commented how it was so unique that a cinematographer had such a well-toned body,” recalls Ramachandran, “And then I thought, why not take a picture? After all, his journey did start with a camera without a shirt, right?”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/yj4izh/article31140994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22MPravivarr1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ravi-varmans-photo-series/article31140996.ece
219,2020/03/23,"Review | ‘Into The Wild With Bear Grylls and Rajinikanth’: More of Rajini the person, less of the adventurer","The 69-year old makes his television debut as he treks, wades and climbs through a jaunty day with survival expert Grylls, and still finds time to subtly push his ideologies

Here we are then with Rajinikanth’s television debut, four decades and 165 films since an unassuming Shivaji Rao Gaekwad was introduced by K Balachander to the world of filmdom.

“All of us have that one person who completely changes your life, when you don’t even realise it. That was KB for me,” says the 69-year-old, paying tribute to his mentor — and with good measure — as the former director’s production house Kavithalayaa was instrumental in making this collaboration with Discovery Channel happen.

Into The Wild with Rajinikanth, the latest installment in the British adventurer’s many range of survival shows, follows heavily in the footsteps of Grylls’ previous Man vs Wild exploits with Narendra Modi in (“His sense of humour surprised me,” Grylls tells Rajinikanth about the Indian Prime Minister), an image-building exercise devised to highlight the Tamil superstar’s political aspirations, while also catering to his bevy of fans who worship the ‘person’ behind the icon.

Rajinikanth gearing up for the day at Bandipur Tiger Reserve

Themed around the idea of water conservation — Rajinikanth has spoken earlier about his erstwhile ‘vision’ to link the rivers across India — the 40-odd minute episode tracks the duo spend a day at the Bandipur Tiger Reserve in Karnataka, navigating through a set of seemingly simple tasks, interspersed with some moments of bromance/ candid conversations between the unlikely pairing.

“I wish I could travel on a bus now, the last time I did so was by putting on a disguise in Bangalore,” laughs Rajinikanth, as he gives Grylls a crash course into his journey towards becoming a celebrated actor. This, and a few more heartfelt revelations keep the episode from becoming too much of an extended fan vehicle: though he does get a proper movie-style intro, complete with pulsating background score and the ‘Super Star Rajni’ animation.

Onto to the actual adventures then: cross a rusty bridge that has a 50-ft drop with just a rope for support and no ‘mattress’ underneath; trek down a ravine to gather water from a stream that will be sent to a lab for pollutant-testing; and finally, retrieve a camera that has been taping animals for three days by wading across a water body that could potentially house a croc (naaah, of course it doesn’t)

Rajinikanth and Grylls’ repartee make for decent camaraderie — even if a lot of the former’s answers are mostly in Tamil to an enthusiastically-nodding Grylls — and even the most begrudging of watchers will find some novelty to watching a man whose larger-than-life on-screen persona always take precedence, delve into his personal life, albeit fleetingly.

“My whole life is a miracle to me,” he says, while Grylls marvels at his energy levels, tempting us to do so as well.

Kamal Haasan, Madhavan and Akshay Kumar make guest appearances to wish their ‘friend’ luck, Rajinikanth changes a flat tyre for the first time in his life, teaches Grylls how to do his signature flick with the sunglasses, and even lets us in on his favourite quote in life: “This too shall pass.”

Rajinikanth and Grylls share a surprisingly effective camaraderie

Towards the end of the episode, the actor-politician says that his hope for the country is to remove poverty and unemployment, and India shouldn’t be just culturally rich, but economically too. “Our greatest virtue is that four religions —Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism and Islam — are all accepted in here and we live as brothers. I’m proudest of that,” he beams to Grylls.

Ultimately, the collaboration does succeed in its intention to present a hitherto unseen side of Rajinikanth, one that he shall seek to endear more to the public, as his political aspirations take centre-stage in the coming months.

Favourite moment: Bear Grylls telling Rajini that he wished he had the latter’s looks, and the Annaatthe star bemusedly responding, “Really, my looks?! You’re better-looking than me, Bear!”

220,2020/03/23,Time to go for aggressive testing for COVID-19,"Need to seek help of other countries for rapid testing kits, says founder of Lok Satta

Though Centre and several States, including Telangana, have been proactive in announcing lockdown till month-end to slow down community transmission, it is time to focus on aggressive testing for coronavirus positive cases, says founder of Lok Satta and Foundation for Democratic Reforms Jayaprakash Narayan.

“It is crucial to identify as many potential COVID-19 cases as possible and isolate them to stop the silent spread in the community,” he said.

Microbiologist who discovered the Ebola virus in 1976 and Director of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Peter Piot has categorically stated last Thursday that screening at the airports and railway stations may not be of much use as 80 % who contract the disease may show no symptoms immediately but they could spread the virus.

‘Supress fever’

Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan said at airports people are screened for fever and many routinely take tablets to suppress fever. Thus the only definite way to identify is testing as the Director General of WHO had underlined. Government should aggressively pursue testing while advocating social distancing, he said.

One of the tests to identify the virus is PCR — Polymerase Chain Reaction. It is a rapid, highly sensitive and specific method used to detect virus in a range of tissues including serum, oral fluids and also in environmental samples.

China has shared with all the countries the genome — genetic sequence — of the novel coronavirus which will be of use in developing specific diagnostic kits.

The founder of Lok Satta, who is a medical doctor, says the government need to share the genome with more private institutions which have the PCR test capability to speed up testing.

Secondly seek the help of countries like South Korea, Taiwan and China which have rapid test kits .

Mathematical models

Explaining the need for aggressive testing he says as per the computer and mathematical models, at least 50 to 70 % of population can be infected and of it 10 to 15 % can be critical and some of them need ICU and ventilator support.

In Britain, health authorities were on record to say that if the reported cases are 1,500, the actual cases could be 10 to 20 times of that, he pointed out.

“This is an issue of science and not bravado. The urgent need is to get as many test kits as possible,” he says.

Another test apart from PCR is to test for antibodies. South Korea and Taiwan have done it and India could ask for technology and India has capability to quickly replicate it.

Even after testing, 80 % of cases can be treated through isolation and only 5 to 10 % of cases would need to go hospitals. This should be extensively conveyed to people so that hospitals and medical personnel would not be overwhelmed, he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/2ncpqs/article31145899.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY24JAYAPRAKASH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/time-to-go-for-aggressive-testing-for-covid-19/article31145900.ece
221,2020/03/23,Collector cracks whip against violators,"Krishna Bhaskar tells police to arrest a local politician in Sircilla

In the wake of people taking the lockdown lightly and roaming on roads in various modes of transport and not remaining indoors, Collector D Krishna Bhaskar has cracked a whip against violators and instructed the police to arrest a violator in Sircilla textile town on Monday.

Following the State government’s announcement of lockdown from Monday to March 31 to check the spread of COVID-19, the Collector had taken to the streets to ensure that the lockdown is enforced in true spirit. After seeing the motorists and cars plying on the roads carelessly, the Collector got irritated and stopped their vehicles and explained them why lockdown was declared and one has to remain indoors.

Warning the motorists and others, he threatened to register criminal cases if they again flout the norms and come on to the roads. He warned that the virus would spread because of the negligence of people who refuse to be self-isolation and maintain social distancing.

At the Gandhi statue area, the Collector counselled the people travelling in cars about the deadly COVID virus and how to prevent its spread by remaining indoors. At this juncture, a politician was passing on the road in his car and the Collector immediately stopped the vehicle.

The leader belonging to the opposition party argued with the Collector stating that he was a politician. The Collector reacted saying leaders should be more responsible and strive to create awareness about the importance of lockdown and spread of the deadly virus. When the leader was debating with the Collector and arguing with the police, the Collector instructed the police to arrest him. The police nabbed the leader belonging to Baddenapalli village of Thangalapalli mandal and shifted him to the police station.

222,2020/03/23,COVID-19: IT company develops app,"Would help monitor the movements coronavirus patients/suspects using geographical coordinates

A Hyderabad-based software development company filed a PIL petition in Telangana High Court on Monday seeking a direction to the State and Central governments to consider availing a mobile application it had developed to track persons showing symptoms of COVID-19 or affected by it.

A bench of Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao and Justice T. Amarnath Goud told the directors of the company to first approach the government and other officials concerned and present their proposal. Citing the rising coronavirus positive cases in different States of the country, the company said the situation was dangerous than perceived and should not be brushed aside.

Since majority of the COVID-19 positive cases were reported among persons who returned from abroad or foreigners landing in the country for different purposes, it was crucial to monitor them. The company claims the mobile application it had developed would help the governments to monitor the movements of persons who contracted coronavirus or are showing its symptoms.

The application can be used by mobile phones having android, or iOS (of apple iPhones). Google and Apple companies, the company maintained, have the details of geographical coordinates and movement history of the mobile phones using the two operating systems.

If these two companies, which were made as respondents in the PIL petition, were directed to provide the details of the respective mobile phone numbers, it would be easier to monitor the movement and location of the users (persons who contracted COVID-19 or showing its symptoms). Using this data and synchronising it with the movement history of the mobile phone users, ‘danger or hot zones’ can be mapped and publicised to ensure coronavirus did not spread further, the company said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/84xh3y/article31145031.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy23TRACKINGcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/covid-19-it-company-develops-app/article31145032.ece
223,2020/03/23,Crackdown on vehicles moving freely will continue: Wanaparthy SP,"Forces in districts bordering Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in South Telangana seize hundreds of vehicles, including auto-rickshaws

Police cracked the whip on violators of lockdown with an iron hand, particularly in districts where it is more challenging than the capital, in a bid to confine people to their homes in the struggle against the spread of COVID-19.

The forces in Wanaparthy, Jogulamba-Gadwal and Narayanpet districts bordering Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in South Telangana seized hundreds of vehicles, including auto-rickshaws and issued tickets for different violations. Moreover, the violators were made to hold placards as a deterrent measure to ensure that they did not take back to the roads.

Speaking to The Hindu, Wanaparthy SP Apoorva Rao said that on Monday alone a total of 240 vehicles moving on the streets without any reason were seized, and 460 vehicle owners were slapped with spot challans. In Gadwal they seized 260 private vehicles, and issued 334 spot tickets for violating different traffic norms.

“People must understand the severity of the situation and stay at home. They should not venture out for no reason for their own safety and the safety of others when the entire State is under lockdown,” she said.

Following the State government’s orders, they have sealed the inter-State borders, and are not letting any vehicle in and out, unless it’s a medical emergency, Ms. Rao said. “If anybody from the neighbouring States wants to get into Telangana limits, we are explaining them about the current lockdown and asking them to go back safely,” she said, adding that the people are restricted to move only within their localities.

She said that citizens must stay indoors and cooperate with the government in fighting the spread of COVID-19. “The crackdown on the violators will continue in the districts,” Ms. Rao added. Meanwhile, Narayanpet SP M Chetana said that they have seized 67 motor vehicles.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/x4mqzc/article31144996.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy23Wanaparthy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/crackdown-on-vehicles-moving-freely-will-continue-wanaparthy-sp/article31144997.ece

225,2020/03/23,Lockdown more like a bandh in Adilabad district,"There was a general increase in the price of all commodities, especially vegetables

The first day of lockdown resembled more like a ‘bandh’ called by some political party or organisation in former composite Adilabad district, what with people moving around as usual but shops and markets being closed. The police in Nirmal, however, seized about 40 autos from the district headquarter as well as surrounding areas to drive home the point that the government was serious about the lockdown.

The day started with people coming out of homes as usual, especially in the district headquarter towns in Adilabad, Kumram Bheem Asifabad, Mancherial and Nirmal. There was rush at the green grocers and grocery stores though the shops remained shut. The tribal area also saw villagers moving in mandal headquarters as usual. In Indervelli many tribals were seen making purchases from makeshift vegetable and other shops in the market as it was a shandy day.

There was a general increase in the price of all commodities, especially vegetables, a phenomenon which is usually witnessed when a bandh is called for more than a day. The prices of vegetables etc came down to normal by afternoon when it dawned that there was no shortage.

Adilabad Collector A. Sridevasena, who went around the town to observe the lockdown effect assured people that there would be no shorrtage of essential commodities. She appealed to the people to stay indoors while one person can come and make necessary purchases every day.

The police refrained from using force as it was the first day of the nine-day lockdown in the State.

226,2020/03/23,‘Ensure no movement of people except for medical emergency’,"Collectors told to strictly implement guidelines on COVID-19 in letter and spirit

Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar has directed the district collectors to strictly enforce the lockdown in the districts following the instructions issued to them in letter and spirit to contain the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19).

The collectors should implement the government’s orders scrupulously and ensure that there was no movement of people except for accessing medical care during the total lockdown period between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. daily. The norm that one person should be allowed on two-wheeler and two on four-wheelers should be strictly adhered to.

The Chief Secretary held a video conference with the district collectors on the measures taken for containment of the COVID-19 in the State on Monday evening. The government had set up control room with two senior IAS officers — Rahul Bojja and Anil Kumar — at the Secretariat for guiding the district administration from time to time. Similar control rooms would be set up at district-level soon while the collectors should make arrangements to set up two quarantine centres in each district.

The collectors should send daily reports on the situation to the control rooms while the government had developed an App for monitoring the quarantine activities in the districts. Steps should be taken to see that area-based teams were formed for taking up surveillance of home quarantined persons.

They had been directed to ensure availability of essential commodities like milk, vegetables, groceries and medicines during the lockdown period. Prices of these commodities should be monitored strictly so as not to give scope for people paying higher prices for procuring them.

The district collectors had been asked to ensure that inter-disciplinary teams visited the families of those who returned from foreign travel and also those who had volunteered for home quarantine as part of measures to encourage the community to follow the containment plan.

He wanted the district collectors to increase the number of paddy procurement centres to a maximum extent to avoid scope for mass gatherings.

227,2020/03/23,Long-distance lorry crew feel the brunt of lockdown,"Complete shutdown of shops and other outlets deprive hundreds of crew members of food and water

For the estimated 400 lorry drivers stranded on the inter-State border between Adilabad and Maharashtra on Penganga river bridge on NH 44, it was like jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. They had assumed that their ordeal was over when they were allowed to proceed towards Telangana State from the outskirts of Pandharkawda town in Yavatmal district the previous night after being stopped for the whole day due to the janata curfew.

“We were racing out of relief to cross the border and enter Telangana after being allowed to go,” observed Ataullah Khan, a lorry driver who started for Guntur from Gurugram on March 19 carrying a load of cars. “Here we are thirsty and hungry having been stopped abruptly by Telangana authorities who say it is a complete lockdown ahead,” he lamented.

This was the first time that there was complete shutdown of shops and other outlets depriving a few thousand lorry crew members of food and water starting March 22. There were about 2,000 lorries stranded on NH 44 near Pipparwada toll plaza in Jainad mandal, about 1,500 at the integrated check-post at Wankidi in Kumram Bheem Asifabad and about 300 at the check-post at Beltharoda in Nirmal district on the day of the janata curfew.

“In the night, we allowed these vehicles to pass the borders of erstwhile united Adilabad district as providing food to the crew members would have become a problem. We are now stopping all incoming vehicles on the other side of Penganga river itself,” revealed Adilabad Deputy Transport Commissioner Puppala Srinivas.

It was Mr. Srinivas who had organised one meal for the marooned lorry people while Pipparwada villagers had organised the second meal on March 22. They were relatively better off than their counterparts who were stuck on the border on Monday, their ordeal set to extend till the end of lockdown period at the end of this month..",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/dpn0vi/article31144825.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY24LORRIYAAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/long-distance-lorry-crew-feel-the-brunt-of-lockdown/article31144826.ece

The State government has constituted an internal monitoring committee of the Horticulture and Marketing department to ensure timely and required transport and supplies of vegetables and fruits in an attempt to prevent traders from jacking up prices by creating artificial scarcity.

According to Secretary (Agriculture) B. Janardhan Reddy, the committee would monitor both arrivals and prices of vegetables and fruits not only in Hyderabad but also in districts.

District Horticulture officers have been told to keep vigorous watch on the production, arrivals and transport of vegetables and fruits and also keep an eye on their prices.

Further, the DHOs have been instructed to motivate farmers to promote the cultivation of vegetables in districts to meet internal consumption first. Movement of vegetables and fruits by traders would be permitted at check-posts, based on needs. A special team has been put in place for GHMC area to monitor arrivals of the perishable food crops.

237,2020/03/23,Govt. empowers officials to take stringent measures,"Telangana Epidemic Diseases (COVID-19) Regulations, 2020 brought into force

The State government has empowered all the officers from the Director of Public Health, Commissioner of Vaidya Vidhana Parishad, district collectors and municipal commissioners to take stringent measures necessary to prevent the outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) or its spread within their respective jurisdictions.

Drawing from The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, the State government has framed ‘The Telangana Epidemic Diseases (COVID-19) Regulations, 2020’ as part of efforts to contain the spread of the virus. The 1897 Act, in the words of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, provides for officials of the government to take all such measures as may be necessary to contain the spread of the virus. “Once the provisions are invoked, they can even stop my car,” the Chief Minister said at a press conference on Sunday.

The regulations will come into force immediately and the government had taken care to ensure that they would remain valid for one year. They mandate that all hospitals, government and private, should provide COVID-19 corners for screening of suspected cases as and when so required by the authorities. In addition to screening the cases, the hospitals should record the history of contacts of the suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.

People with a history of travel in last 14 days to a country or area from where COVID-19 has been reported, must voluntarily report to State Control Room (040-24651119)/ Toll Free number 104 so that necessary measures can be initiated by the designated officials. The officials would be authorized to isolate and/or admit into any identified hospital the person who develops symptoms simulating that of the COVID-19 infection. “The empowered officer may initiate action under the Section 188 of Indian Penal Code (48 of 1860) against the person who refuses to comply with such advice of isolation and/or admission,” the regulations said.

In case of those remaining asymptomatic, people with history of travel to the affected areas in the last 14 days should remain in home quarantine for 14 days from the day of exposure and must abide by the quarantine guidelines issued by the government from time to time. “Persons who do not observe home quarantine shall be quarantined in the facilities set up by the governments,” the regulations said.

People with travel history and symptoms should be isolated in the hospitals as per protocol and tests should be conducted accordingly. Information of all such cases must be immediately sent to the State Integrated Disease Surveillance (IDS) Unit and the district collector/municipal commissioner by the people managing the cases at the hospital.

The regulations caution against use of COVID-19 related information by persons/ institutions/ organisations without ascertaining facts and priori clearance of the designated officials concerned. This was necessary to avoid spread of any unauthenticated information or rumours regarding COVID-19. Violation of the instructions by any person/institution/organization would be treated as punishable offence and steps would be initiated accordingly.

The private healthcare institutions intending to test Covid-19 suspects must notify the State IDS unit about the same and the IDS on its part should arrange for monitoring and testing strictly as per the guidelines issued by the ICMR. The regulations also make mention of restrictions that could be imposed in a specific geographical area for containing the spread of the virus.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/govt-empowers-officials-to-take-stringent-measures/article31143669.ece

239,2020/03/23,Karimnagar declares ‘Red Zones’ where COVID-19 positive Indonesians roamed,"Some localities cordoned off; residents in Red Zones strictly instructed not to come out of their houses and warned of arrest if they disobey orders

In the wake of Karimnagar town reporting its first COVID-19 positive case, the district administration, in association with the police, had declared some of the residential areas where the Indonesians had moved extensively and infected locals as ‘Red Zones’ and cordoned off the localities by deploying police forces.

Residents in the Red Zones were strictly instructed not to come out of their houses and would be arrested if they flouted orders. All the essential commodities such as milk, vegetables, fruits, rice, etc. would be sold at their localities only. They would be allowed to move out only during an emergency that too after prior permission from the police.

A densely populated area

The Mukarampura locality right from the main gate of the Collectorate, Ajmatheya Mosque area, Women’s College, Kashmirgadda, Saikrishna Theatre, area opposite Prathima Multiplex to the Mosque near Indira Chowk has been declared a ‘Red Zone’ and cordoned off with barricades on all sides and deployment of police forces.

Similarly, police were also identifying Kharkhanagadda, Khanpura, Rose Talkies road localities to be cordoned off and deployment of police to avoid movement of people infected by the virus in the town. Further, police are chalking out strategies to shift the identified suspects to quarantines in various private engineering colleges on the outskirts of the town.

Situation is alarming: Collector

In order to educate locals on the importance of self-isolation to check the spread of COVID-19 at Mukarampura locality, Collector K. Shashanka said the COVID-19 situation was alarming in Karimnagar town following the outbreak of virus among the people who moved very closely with the 10 Indonesians, who toured the town recently and tested positive. “Among them, one person tested positive and was shifted to Hyderabad’s Gandhi Hospital,” he said.

Stating that they would send medical teams for personal screening of all the residents in the ‘Red Zones’, he appealed to the residents to co-operate with the medical teams to check the spread of the virus. “We have already identified 80 suspects and shifted them to isolation wards in various hospitals in Karimnagar,” he said. Mr. Shashanka urged people to voluntarily approach a hospital for screening tests to check the spread of virus.

Section 144 in force

Commissioner of Police V.B. Kamalasan Reddy said they had invoked section 144 in the town and warned that they would chase people away if they assemble in groups. “We have banned plying of autorickshaws and other passenger vehicles. They would be seized if they are found moving with passengers,” he said. Municipal Commissioner Valluru Kranthi and others were also present.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/frvupa/article31144664.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY24KNK2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/karimnagar-declares-some-areas-red-zones/article31142752.ece
240,2020/03/23,"In Hyderabad, some passengers who returned from abroad took paracetamol to suppress fever","Hiding COVID-19 symptoms is homicide, say TS police

‘Codes to cheat thermal scanners’— a few passengers who returned from foreign countries were taking a leaf out of this by taking paracetamol to suppress fever so that their body temperature could not be detected during thermal screening at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA), Shamshabad.

Symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, cold, respiratory illness. However, only body temperature is detected using thermal scanners at airports across the world. If anyone is detected with abnormal body temperature, they will be taken to isolation centres at State-run hospitals and their samples will be collected for tests.

When contacted sources in the police department and airport have confirmed that a few air passengers took the medicines so as to normalise the temperature consequently avoiding the detection of temperature by thermal readers.

However, passengers with other symptoms like cold, cough and dizziness cannot run away from the eyes of health officials at the airport.

“People should realise that we are taking measures for the safety of their families and society. Hiding the symptoms of COVID-19 is homicide,” a senior police officer told The Hindu .

High-level meeting

He said that same issue was discussed during an high-level emergency meeting with Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao on Thursday. When asked about the effect of paracetamol and other pain killers, senior consultant physician at KIMS Dr. K. Shivaraju said that the medicines act effectively and bring down body temperature for at least four hours.

“If a person is having 101-degree Celsius body temperature, it can come down to normal and clear the thermal screening. However, people with high running temperatures cannot bring it to normal,” he said.

People should realise that we are taking measures for the safety of their families and society

241,2020/03/23,High alert sounded in Karimnagar after one person tests COVID positive,"The person moved closely with the visiting Indonesian preachers who were tested positive; another 70 persons who too moved closely identified as suspects, say police

The Karimnagar district administration has sounded a high alert after a 39-year-old person who closely moved with the Indonesian preachers during their stay in the town last week was tested COVID-19 positive in Karimnagar town on Monday.

A maths coaching institute owner in Karimnagar town was instrumental in the arrival of 10 Indonesians to Karimnagar town on March 15 and who moved till March 17 before the police could isolate them. The police shifted the visitors to Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad where they were declared COVID positive.

Nabbed by police

Following this, the coaching institute operator was absconding. However, the police nabbed him on Sunday and shifted him to the Isolation Ward at District Headquarters Hospital. Tests have confirmed that he was COVID-19 positive.

Collector K. Shashanka said the person who was declared COVID-19 positive was shifted to Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad. He instructed the people who moved closely with the Indonesian preachers and the coaching institute operator to visit the Government Headquarters Hospital for testing and treatment and avoid spreading the virus.

Collector’s appeal

Appealing to people to be alert, he informed: “Maintain social distance and hygiene by wearing masks and using sanitisers. Also, confine yourselves in your houses to avoid spread of the virus.”

Meanwhile, police in association with medical teams have nabbed three persons suspected to have moved with the coaching institute operator in Karimnagar town on Monday and shifted them to the Isolation Ward. Police sources said they had identified 70 persons who had moved very closely with the Indonesian preachers and are suspected to be infected with the virus.

242,2020/03/23,"TS honours ‘Janata Curfew’ call, applauds COVID-19 heroes","Bustling cities turn ghost towns as vehicles stay off road and shops down shutters

Normal life came to a standstill with people staying indoors in response to the Janata Curfew call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao as part of a strategy to combat coronavirus on Sunday.

All streets in the town wore a total deserted look reminiscent of a normal curfew, and vehicles, including two wheelers, were hardly seen on the roads. Autorickshaws also stayed off the roads as there were no takers. RTC buses too remained in depots with the management suspending all services. Even small eateries were closed. Unlike everyday’s din with moving vehicles blaring horns and construction activities, an eerie silence prevailed everywhere.

With the government’s forewarning, supermarkets were crowded with customers on Saturday evening. Milk vendors dropped by earlier. Bus and railway stations were completely empty. While a few petrol bunks were open, there were no customers. A few medical shops were open, but all private hospitals remained closed.

People who arrived from Mumbai by Devagiri Express to travel to Jagityal were stranded at the railway station as there was no onward transport service. They had booked tickets before the announcement of Janata Curfew and got down here hoping for bus or any other transport.

Beggars and destitute at railway and bus stations suffered as none gave them food or alms.

The borders with neighbouring Maharashtra were sealed and hoardings were kept along the roads announcing the closure.

Extended curfew

People confined themselves to their homes in various parts of Karimnagar district on Sunday while all shops, business establishments, hotels and kirana shops in the town remained closed. Milk vendors did not operate; neither did the vegetable markets. Small-time tea shops and tiffin centres remained shut and pushcart vendors stayed off the roads.

As the government had announced that TSRTC would also participate in the curfew, buses were confined to their respective depots and bus stations wore a deserted look. Most people had purchased all essential commodities on Saturday itself to avoid problems on curfew day.

Police forces were deployed at various locations to dissuade people from coming on to the roads. Even in residential areas, police teams were seen moving around and instructing people to observe the curfew. Only people going to hospitals or medical shops were allowed on the road.

Commissioner of Police V.B. Kamalasan Reddy went around the town on inspection. Talking to newspersons, he congratulated all sections of the society for participating in the Janata Curfew and making it a grand success.

Stating that general public and traders participated in the curfew voluntarily, he said the curfew would last till 6 a.m. on Monday. “Police forces would continue duty at their designated locations throughout the 24 hours,” Mr. Reddy said.

Tri-cities come to a halt

Life virtually came to a standstill here as no one ventured out following the curfew appeal. Unusually, even petty vendors closed their activities for the day. Except for an occasional bike rider, roads were all empty with only the police manning junctions all across the tri-cities of Warangal, Hanamkonda and Kazipet. There was near-total silence, which was unheard of, and unseen in the recent past.

Moreover, bus stands and railways stations were totally deserted and not a single bus or train moved. Vendors at these stations also closed their business of selling water bottles and newspapers. Though the State government had assured small vendors that they could carry on as usual, they too observed the Janata Curfew.

Bandh calls given by organisations including political parties in the past had never witnessed such public participation and consensus.

Goods carriers stopped

The curfew call received an overwhelming response across undivided Nalgonda on Sunday, as all the roads, including the State and one of the busiest national highways, the National Highway 65 (Hyderabad-Vijayawada), bore an empty look.

Superintendent of Police A.V. Ranganath in Nalgonda and his Suryapet counterpart R. Bhaskaran reviewed the situation on an hourly basis. Police force was deployed at various important junctions.

While tens of commercial and goods carriers were stopped from plying on the State Highways – Narketpally-Addanki and Nagarjunsagar-Hyderabad, nearly 400 more were kept in holding points at Ramapuran junction near Kodad on NH-65 in Suryapet.

All toll plazas — Panthangi, Kethepally, Chillakallu and Miryalaguda — were closed. Police said the highway would remain closed, heavily guarded at the entry/exit points on the border with Andhra Pradesh, till further instructions.

Leaders in the district Legislative Council chairman Gutha Sukender Reddy, Energy Minister G. Jagadish Reddy and other MLAs stayed at home. They posted pictures on media WhatsApp groups, encouraging people to wash hands regularly, enjoy family time and to strictly follow government instructions on COVID-19.

243,2020/03/23,"Though difficult, riverine borders sealed too","All the 35 points of crossing on the 25-km stretch of Penganga and Pranahita in Adilabad district remain lifeless on Sunday

For the first time in history, the riverine border that Kumram Bheem Asifabad and Mancherial districts in Telangana share with Chandrapur and Gadchiroli district in Maharashtra was sealed completely, with not a soul crossing the Penganga and Pranahita rivers on either side. All the 35 points of crossing on the 25-km stretch of Penganga river on the north-east and the approximately 110 km of Pranahita on the east of old united Adilabad district, unusually, remained lifeless on Sunday in view of the janata curfew.

Interaction with locals

The importance of some of the crossing points, 12 of the 22 in KB Asifabad being ferry points and the 13 ferry points in Mancherial district, have also been entry points for Maoists from Maharashtra to Telangana. Though police had kept a vigil on these points in the past, the places were never closed to passenger movement. The sealing of the crossing points evidently gave enough time for the police to take a closer look at them and mentally evaluating their importance to the extremists who operate on the other side. Concerned policemen moved in respective shore areas and interacted with locals seizing the opportunity provided by the janata curfew.

People on the Telangana side of the border have strong relationship with their counterparts on the other side. This being the wedding season there is a general increase in the quantum of traffic on the river from both the sides. The janata curfew evoked quite an enthusiastic response in people on two sides of the border which was quite clear as hardly any passenger visited the ferry points. Even the boatmen and fishermen in all villages along the banks of the rivers also avoided going out into the water with their barge poles. Gajam Mamatha of Ballarsha town in Chandrapur district, originally from Gudlabori village in Koutala mandal of KB Asifabad, had to defer visiting her mother’s village for a wedding. “The janata curfew is being implemented strictly,” she opined, wanting to say that all modes of transport are off during the day.

Kagaznagar DSP B.L.N. Swamy, under whose jurisdiction fall the mandals of Sirpur (T), Koutala, Chintalamanepally, Bejjur, Penchikalpet and Dahegaon which have the rivers on their fringes, visited Jakkapur fishing point on Penganga river on Sunday.

244,2020/03/23,Cong. seeks action against paper mill,"Ignored call to participate in curfew

There was overwhelming response to the Janata Curfew in integrated Adilabad district as people mostly stayed indoors. The only aberration, according to Opposition party leaders, was the functioning of Sirpur Paper Mills (SPM) in Kagaznagar town of Kumram Bheem Asifabad district which put the lives of workers on duty at risk.

The in-charge of Congress party affairs in Sirpur constituency, Palvai Harish Babu demanded action against the SPM management for ignoring the call to participate in the curfew. He said about 2,000 workers attended duty as usual.

Border sealed

Old united Adilabad, which shares a very long border with Maharashtra on its north, east and west sides, was completely cut off as the borders were sealed to deny entry to all types of vehicles coming in from the neighbouring State. The sealing of ferry points on Penganga and Pranahita rivers in KB Asifabad and Mancherial districts effectively cut off the water route for people from the neighbouring Gadchiroli district to gain entry into those districts.

About 3-km long queue of lorries was formed on both sides of NH-44 between Penganga river bridge and Mandagada village crossing as authorities allowed only goods vehicles with perishables to enter the district. Lorries and other vehicles will be allowed only after 6 a.m. on Monday.

Meanwhile, villagers of Pipparwada in Jainad mandal, which is located on NH-44, served meals to the stranded lorry drivers and cleaners. They also distributed sachets of water to the hapless people.

District authorities denied entry to a bus full of devotees who were returning to their native places after visiting Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh. The 46-member group belong to Vijayawada, Khammam and Hyderabad who could not return by train owing to cancellations.

Elsewhere, people showed willingness to participate in the curfew.

245,2020/03/23,Meat sellers feel the pinch of curfew,"The loss is put at nearly ₹25 lakh

Non-vegetarians on Sunday were left craving for meat with the Janata Curfew ensuring closure of meat markets and butcher shops. “I should have had mutton yesterday itself,” said Are Ramesh of Teachers Colony.

The butcher community and middlemen in the poultry and meat businesses also suffered losses by remaining out of business for a single day. According to sources, about 500 goats are butchered in Adilabad town alone on Sundays which means loss of a turnover of at ₹25 lakh given the high price of goat meat at ₹560 a kg.

Though chicken is not being preferred by meat lovers owing to COVID-19 rumours associated with it, poultry is still preferred in poor and backward areas thanks to its cheaper price, not exceeding ₹100 per kg. “I had stacked chicken for Sunday market but the curfew forced me to keep my shop shut,” said Abdul Majid, a butcher in Merameri of Kumram Bheem Asifabad district.

Clandestine operations

Some non-vegetarians were lucky to lay their hands on meat as a few goats were slaughtered clandestinely in homes of butchers, said sources.

Vegetarians like local businessman Mukesh Agarwal took solace in the fact that the curfew had added one more day to the life of the poor meat animals.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/96y756/article31137272.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY22-ADILA-CHICK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/meat-sellers-feel-the-pinch-of-curfew/article31137262.ece
246,2020/03/23,Coronavirus | Australia pulls athletes out of 2020 Olympic Games,"Calls for Tokyo Games to be postponed until 2021

The coronavirus pandemic prompted Australia to withdraw its athletes from the 2020 Olympics on Monday while the nation's top rugby league competition was called off and other domestic sports scrambled to stave off financial ruin.

With its athletes unable to train or prepare properly due to 'social distancing' and a clampdown on travel, the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) said it could no longer assemble a team for the July 24-Aug. 9 Games in Tokyo.

“It’s clear the Games can’t be held in July,” Australia Chef de Mission Ian Chesterman said on Monday, three days after telling reporters the team was committed to the schedule.

“Our athletes have been magnificent in their positive attitude to training and preparing, but the stress and uncertainty has been extremely challenging for them.”

Australia had previously been in lock-step with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which until Sunday had insisted the Games would go ahead as scheduled.

After weeks of pressure, the IOC finally said postponement was in its “scenario planning”, with a decision expected in four weeks.

The timeframe was not quick enough for the AOC, however, which announced its decision shortly after Canada became the first country to boycott the Games.

AOC Chief Executive Matt Carroll said he hoped the Games would go ahead in Tokyo, but not until the summer of 2021.

“We've had to make a call now because of the situation here in Australia and other parts of the world,” Carroll told reporters in Sydney on Monday.

Australia's Paralympic committee and sports federations backed the AOC's stance. Swimming Australia (SA) said it was “devastating” for athletes but the correct decision.

“Given the current situation worldwide, it has become evident that it is not safe for the Games to be staged in its current time frame, SA Chief Executive Leigh Russell said.

Australians began living under strict new lockdown rules on Monday as COVID-19 cases topped 1,600.

More than 14,600 people have died globally since the coronavirus outbreak began.

Rugby League suspended

Australia's National Rugby League suspended its season indefinitely after only two rounds of the championship.

“Our pandemic expert and our biosecurity expert said due to the rapid rate of infection that we can no longer guarantee the safety of our players to continue to play,” Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter V'landys told a media conference on Monday at its Sydney headquarters.

Earlier on Monday, a domestic rugby union competition which was to have served as a temporary replacement for Super Rugby was shelved.

Originally slated for an April 3 start, the competition was suspended until at least May 1, Rugby Australia said, placing the game under further financial strain.

RA's announcement came after the Australian Football League, the nation's richest and most popular sporting competition, was suspended before the first round of matches was completed on Sunday.

The top flight Australian Rules football league will be shut down until at least June, triggering warnings of mass redundancies at clubs and at league headquarters.

Australia's A-League, the top flight soccer competition, is expected to be called off on Tuesday, with administrators calling a media conference for a “significant announcement.

In neighbouring New Zealand, the country's rugby federation confirmed it had also torn up a plan for a domestic replacement for Super Rugby and said it had suspended the sport at all levels.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/b5afys/article31141923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUSKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/coronavirus-australia-pulls-athletes-out-of-2020-olympic-games/article31141924.ece
247,2020/03/23,Coronavirus | IOA to ‘wait and watch for a month’ after Canada pulls out of Tokyo Olympics,"Canada’s withdrawal added to the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) woes after a host of top athletes and powerful sports bodies rammed up pressure on the IOC to postpone the quadrennial extravaganza in July-August.

The Indian Olympic Association on Monday said it will “wait and watch” for at least a month before taking any call on Tokyo Olympics participation after Canada created a flutter by becoming the first nation to pull out of the showpiece event due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The north American nation’s withdrawal added to the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) woes after a host of top athletes and powerful sports bodies rammed up pressure on the IOC to postpone the quadrennial extravaganza in July-August.

However, India is ready to wait for a while before arriving at a final decision.

IOA Secretary General Rajeev Mehta, while talking to PTI, said the body is closely monitoring the fast-evolving situation triggered by the pandemic, which has killed more than 14,000 and infected over 300,000.

Also read: Japan says Tokyo Olympics may be postponed due to coronavirus

“We will wait and watch for 4 to 5 weeks and then come to any decision after consultation with the International Olympic Committee and the sports ministry,” Mr. Mehta said.

“The situation is not that bad in our country as compared to other nations,” he added.

The Olympics are looking increasingly uncertain and the IOC has admitted that it would consider all options, including postponement, in four weeks from now.

The deadly virus, which was first discovered in China, has wreaked havoc on Olympic preparations of athletes, including those from India.

Several qualifiers have been suspended and training trips abroad are off the table thanks to the travel restrictions all over the world.

‘Hypothetical’

When contacted and asked if India is also contemplating acting on the lines of Canada, Sports Secretary Radhey Shyam Julaniya said the ministry is not in consultation with anyone at the moment.

“Your question is hypothetical and the govt cannot react to hypothetical questions,” he said.

“We are not in consultation with anyone right now. The ministry can’t keep giving advisories,” Mr. Julaniya added.

Canada became the first country to pull out the Tokyo Games due to coronavirus and Australia told its athletes to prepare for an Olympics next year as Japan and the IOC flagged the prospect of a postponement for the first time.

Mr. Mehta said India’s handling of the crisis has been decent till now.

“We are not thinking about postponement at this moment. We will wait for a month and discuss with IOA President Narinder Batra and the Executive Committee of the IOA.”

Opposition to holding the Games as scheduled has only increased sharply in the last couple of days, with several major stake-holders such as U.S. Track and Field and UK Athletics, along with some national Olympic committees, pushing for a delay because of the pandemic.

Last week, the IOA backed the IOC’s assertion that the upcoming Tokyo Games will weather the crisis and be held on time without a glitch.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/xjdl3i/article29947640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IOA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/coronavirus-ioa-to-wait-and-watch-for-a-month-after-canada-pulls-out-of-tokyo-olympics/article31141228.ece
248,2020/03/23,"Coronavirus | Canada withdraws from 2020 Games as Japan, IOC consider postponement","Under mounting pressure to postpone the Games, the International Olympic Committee and Japanese government had only partially shifted their position that the Games would go ahead as planned.

Canada became the first country to boycott the Tokyo Games due to the coronavirus pandemic and Australia told its athletes to prepare for an Olympics next year as Japan and the IOC flagged the prospect of a postponement for the first time.

Opposition to holding the Games in July rose sharply over the weekend with major stakeholders such as U.S. Track and Field and UK Athletics, along with some national Olympic committees, calling for a delay because of the pandemic.

Canada's Olympic and Paralympic Committees raised the ante considerably, however, when they said they would not be sending athletes to Tokyo if the Games went ahead as scheduled.

Under mounting pressure to postpone the Games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Japanese government had on Sunday and Monday had only partially shifted their position that the Games would go ahead as planned.

Martin Richard, communications chief for the Canadian Paralympic Committee, said the Canadians had been watching for a decision from the IOC on Sunday about postponing the Games and decided to withdraw when none came.

“The world is facing a crisis and this is more important than any other sport event,” Richard told Reuters from Ottawa. “We decided that was the right thing to do.”

Richard said for Paralympic athletes, some of whom had underlying conditions, it would be risky to expose them if the virus was not contained.

“We felt it was unethical to have them be put in that position,” he said, adding that Canada had had not been alone in applying pressure on the IOC to postpone.

More than 14,600 people have died globally since the coronavirus outbreak began.

On Sunday, the IOC said it would hold discussions over the next four weeks that would include an option of putting back the July 24 start date or even moving the Games by a year or more.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told parliament on Monday postponing the Olympics may become an option if holding the Games in its “complete form” became impossible.

“If that becomes difficult, we may have no option but to consider postponing the Games, given the Olympic principle of putting the health of athletes first,” he said.

Abe also said calling off the Games entirely was not an option, echoing the IOC position in its statement that cancellation “was not on the agenda”.

Tokyo 2020 Olympics chief Yoshiro Mori later said organisers would consider postponement as one of many scenarios they aim to have ready in the next four weeks.

There were no plans to change the start of the Olympic torch relay on March 26, organisers said.

Australia aims for 2021

While many Canadian athletes and officials welcomed the COC's move, others were not happy.

“I believe in the safety of our lives but this is premature,” Sage Watson, the reigning Pan American champion in the 400 metres hurdles, tweeted.

Soon after the COC move, the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) released a statement saying it had told its athletes to prepare for a Tokyo Games taking place in 2021.

“The AOC (Executive Board) unanimously agreed that an Australian team could not be assembled in the changing circumstances at home and abroad,” read the statement.

“The AOC believes our athletes now need to prioritise their own health and of those around them, and to be able to return to the families, in discussion with their national federations.”

Alternate scenarios

Canada's boycott will add to growing pressure on the IOC to alter the schedule after criticism from a slew of current and former athletes with health concerns.

“YESSSSSS CANADA!!!!!!! pulls out of OLYMPICS UNLESS IOC POSTPONE!!!,” tweeted U.S. former Olympian Lolo Jones. “OUR HEALTH IS MORE important than sport. Hopefully the UNITED STATES is next.”

The the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) said it would not be commenting on Sunday about Canada's decision.

Earlier, the USOPC had welcomed the IOC's statement but said more clarity was needed for athletes.

“The progress reflected in today's IOC update ... is an important step in providing clarity but our athlete community continues to face enormous ambiguity surrounding the 2020 Games in Tokyo,” USOPC chief executive Sarah Hirshland and athletes advisory council chair Han Xiao said in a statement.

The Olympics have never been postponed or cancelled during peacetime but the IOC's decision to even consider postponement was met with relief from several major stakeholders, including World Athletics, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and major national Olympic committees. The last major boycott of the Olympics was when the Soviet bloc stayed away from the 1984 Los Angeles Games, although North Korea and Cuba skipped the 1988 Seoul Olympics.

“As an Olympian, feeling for Team Canada athletes and coaches who have worked so hard ... I know these decisions will impact many beyond sport,” tweeted Charmaine Crooks, a five-time Canadian Olympic sprinter and former IOC member. “Health first.”",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article14980869.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30-ISBS-OLYMPIC+GNOLEQJJ.3.jpg.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/coronavirus-canada-withdraws-from-2020-games-as-japan-ioc-consider-postponement/article31141152.ece
249,2020/03/23,Sangakkara in self-quarantine after returning from UK,"The authorities are concerned over people returning from the most-affected COVID-19 countries in Europe not registering with the police and practising isolation.

Sri Lankan batting great Kumar Sangakkara has said he is currently in self-quarantine, following his government’s guidelines for those recently returning from Europe, which has now become the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The authorities are concerned over people returning from the most-affected COVID-19 countries in Europe not registering with the police and practising isolation.

“I have no symptoms or anything like that, but I’m following government guidelines,” Sangakkara told News First.

“I arrived from London over a week ago and the first thing was there was a news bulletin saying that anyone who had travelled from within March 1 to 15 should register themselves with the police and undergo self quarantine. I registered myself with the police.”

The former captain said this even as the government confirmed there have been at least three cases of recent returnees attempting to hide the novel coronavirus symptoms from authorities.

Both Sangakkara and his former teammate Mahela Jayawardene have been active on social media, urging Sri Lankans to avoid panic and to exercise proper social distancing, as the country went into curfew on Friday evening.

Sri Lanka has so far reported more than 80 active COVID-19 positive cases in the country.

Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal on Monday announced extension of the lockdown to the remaining 15 districts of the State. The decision came less than 24 hours after seven districts, including Gurugram, were locked down till March 31 allowing only the essential services including grocery, pharmacy, telephone and postal services.

Mr. Lal also announced a slew of relief measures for financial assistance to the Below Poverty Line families, daily-wagers and the construction workers.

However, the essential services will be allowed to operate.

The government has already invoked Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code across the State to prevent mass gatherings.

To mitigate the financial impact of the lockdown on the poor, Mr. Lal announced that free ration would be distributed to the Below Poverty Line families for the month of April as per the entitlement and food grains supplied to the government schools students under mid-day meal scheme.

The number of COVID-19 positive cases in Uttar Pradesh climbed to 33 on Monday with four fresh cases from Ghaziabad, Pilibhit, Jaunpur and Kanpur.

257,2020/03/23,A long dreary march through Ghaziabad on Day One of curbs,"Without transport, hundreds of workers from Delhi walk to their destinations

On the first day of lockdown, hundreds of workers from Delhi could be seen crossing Ghaziabad on foot to the neighbouring towns of western Uttar Pradesh.

Jagdish, a resident of Daurala near Meerut, who works at a ‘Shikanji’ stall near Sarai Kale Khan was walking down the Mohan Nagar flyover on foot, along with his two colleagues. “We started at 4 a.m. from Sarai Kale Khan after the owner told us that he would not be able to provide us any money or food during the lockdown,” he said. Many of them were seen pleading for a lift from the few private vehicles that were on road.

“This is sad. Unfortunately, we could not provide any dedicated vehicle to such people as there was no prior information from the Delhi administration,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, Superintendent of Police (Rural), who saw similar movement in the Masuri area of Ghaziabad. “Once they cross into Hapur, they would get some conveyance. I hope such movement will not be seen tomorrow,” he said.

Meanwhile, 70 people were booked and 20 vehicles were challaned in Ghaziabad for violating prohibitory orders on Monday. “They have been booked under Section 188 of the IPC. We have been lenient and only those who were adamant about moving in or out of the district without any valid reason have been booked,” said Mr. Jadaun.

Perhaps, he said, people were not prepared for a lockdown after the ‘janata curfew’. “Many of them were trying to leave the city to spend some time outside. Some people made all sorts of excuses without any proof to show,” he said. The officer said a factory was also found operating in the Loni area. “Action is being taken against the owner,” he said.

‘Business sense’

There were flashes of hope and ingenuity as well. Firoz, a salesperson of a Unani medicine shop in Meerut, was seen selling three-layered masks at government rate outside the Sahibabad Mandi, which opened on Monday. “It is good for humanity as well as makes business sense,” said Firoz, surrounded by hawkers who sell vegetables in residential colonies. “We better buy one, else we would not be allowed inside,” said one of them in a hushed tone.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wt1w85/article31145736.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE23-GHAZIABAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/a-long-dreary-march-through-ghaziabad-on-day-one-of-curbs/article31145737.ece

Earlier in the day, Mr. Chouhan was elected unopposed as the leader of the BJP Legislature Party paving the way for his appointment as Chief Minister.

Mr. Chouhan told legislators that his priority was to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. “I will go to the Vallabh Bhavan (Secretariat) tonight itself to contain corona. Like a family, we need to fight this disease.”

Work in constituencies

Cautioning party workers against launching into celebration mode, Mr. Chouhan said, “This is not the time to celebrate or come outside houses. We need to start working immediately. We need to carry forward the sentiments expressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.”

He called upon the 107 BJP MLAs to tour their regions to spread awareness on the disease. “We have to fight this epidemic; there is no other priority. With all the strength, we will fight it. I want all your cooperation.”

At the meeting, Gopal Bhargava, former Leader of the Opposition, had proposed Mr. Chouhan’s name, even as party National General Secretary Arun Singh and party State in-charge Vinay Sahasrabuddhe conducted the proceedings through video-conferencing from New Delhi.

“Let’s make a new beginning,” Mr Chouhan said. “For 15 years, I ran an efficient administration, but will make it better this time. We will not repeat any mistakes that may have happened in the past, and make Madhya Pradesh the number one State in the country.”

Reverse Cong. harm

Mr. Chouhan further said he would work towards undoing the destruction wrecked upon the State by the previous Congress regime.

Meanwhile, Kamal Nath, who resigned as the Chief Minister on March 20, met Congress president Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi and briefed her on the political turmoil in the State.

Throughout the three-week upheaval in the State, Mr. Chouhan repeatedly distanced the BJP from the crisis, and termed it an internal matter of the Congress. While in Opposition whenever factional fissures emerged within the Congress, he professed that the government would fall under its own weight.

Mr. Chouhan’s election marks the culmination of a bitter political battle over 22 rebel Congress MLAs, owing allegiance of former Congress MP Jyotiraditya Scindia, whose resignation and move to the BJP pulled the rug from under the 15-month-old Kamal Nath government.

Congratulating him, Mr. Scindia said on Twitter: “I stand by you at all times in the State’s progress and development.

261,2020/03/23,Coronavirus | No vehicles on Pune roads till March 31,"A day after the ‘Janata Curfew’ vehicles were back on the streets and youngsters were playing cricket in open stretches

To discourage heavy vehicular traffic on Pune’s roads in the wake of the COVID-19 contagion, the Pune Police on Monday announced the complete stoppage of all vehicular movement, barring those engaged in dispensing essential services, on city roads till the end of the month.

Issuing an order under Section 144 (1) (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Joint Commissioner of Police Ravindra Shisve said all vehicles — including private ones, all types of rickshaws and app-based cab aggregators like Ola and Uber — would be prohibited from plying on the city’s roads from 6 p.m. on Monday till March 31.

Only those vehicles engaged in dispensing essential services, including those belonging to media personnel or government vehicles, would be excluded from the ambit of the ban.

The police action came after roads witnessed heavy traffic despite appeals to citizens by the authorities to confine themselves indoors.

Earlier in the day, Dr. K. Venkatesham, Commissioner of Police, Pune, had hinted at the vehicular ban on Twitter. “Vehicle movement will be stopped completely in the evening today pl note…rqst [request] to reduce vehicle movement till formal order.

While the Janata Curfew on Sunday had swept off virtually every two- and four- wheeler off the city’s densely crowded streets, scores of private vehicles were seen back on the road on Monday with many citizens behaving as if it were business as usual.

In stark defiance of government exhortations to self-quarantine to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus, teenagers were seen playing cricket on open stretches, while private vehicles were seen moving on thoroughfares.

Earlier, Dr. Venkatesham had said that 136 police teams had been formed to check on people who had been asked to quarantine themselves at home.

He had said there were some cases of missing home quarantine people, who had returned from foreign countries in the past fortnight. Dr. Venkatesham warned that these people would face punitive action if they failed to report to the police.

266,2020/03/23,Number of COVID-19 positive cases in Pune district rises to 28,"The total tally in Maharashtra has shot up to 97 in the past 24 hours, with the results of 23 people testing positive

The first COVID-19 cases were reported from Maharashtra’s ‘sugar heartland’ on Monday with five persons in Satara and Sangli districts testing positive, taking the State’s tally to 97 positive cases.

According to officials, a 45-year woman with a travel history to Dubai and hailing from Khandala in Satara district tested positive.

The other four cases are members of a family — three male and one female — from Islampur Tehsil in Sangli. All four had a history of travel to Saudi Arabia.

Additionally, one person each from Mumbai, Thane and Kalyan Dombivli tested positive as well.

Earlier, another COVID-19 positive case was recorded in Pune in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of patients in the city to 16 and the tally in Pune district, including Pimpri-Chinchwad, to 28.

According to the district authorities, the new case is apparently another close contact of the 41-year-old city-based Aanganwadi worker with no history of foreign travel who had tested positive for the virus last week and is presently on ventilator support at the city’s Bharti hospital.

The total tally in Maharashtra has shot up to 97 in the past 24 hours, with the results of 23 persons testing positive.

On Sunday, the four new cases that tested positive in Pune were close kin of this lady, one of whom is reportedly an IT professional, said the authorities.

The IT professional, in her early 20s, is an employee of an IT major sited in Hinjewadi’s Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park.

IT company’s advisory

On Sunday, an internal communication sent to the company’s employees said the offices would be shut till Tuesday evening as a precautionary measure.

The company’s premises are being comprehensively sanitised and fumigated.

The communication read: “We are writing to let you know that a positive case of COVID-19 was detected among one of our employees in Pune, today. While we are providing all support to the concerned employee, we are also working with the health authorities on contact tracing as well as subsequent actions needed.”

The e-mail further said that to avoid unnecessary panic, only those who had been identified as potential contacts had been communicated with and advised of next steps they need to take (administering self-quarantine for 14 days at home) and other measures communicated by the govt health advisory.

“Also, the entire campus is being comprehensively sanitised and fumigated as a precautionary measure. As you already know, the zoning guidelines would help us in limiting the required actions to the building or zone concerned. We will be closing SDB 1, SDB 4 and FC 1 for necessary fumigation and sanitisation for the next 48 hours (until Tuesday evening). We will share separate and comprehensive communication with the employees working out of these buildings,” reads the mail, urging its employees to remain calm.

Anganwadi worker case

Meanwhile, district health officials have sprung into action to track and quarantine all those who came in contact with the Anganwadi worker during her various trips across the State.

The woman had travelled to Vashi in Navi Mumbai on March 3 to attend a wedding and returned to Pune in the same cab the following day.

Sources said that a few days later, she attended a zilla parishad function at a village in Velhe tehsil, around 50 km from Pune city.

After displaying symptoms like sore throat and dry cough, she visited a general practitioner and despite remaining home for a brief period, ventured out again to Varasgaon, 60 km from Pune.

She was finally admitted to Bharti hospital on March 16 and her samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) to test for the H1N1 virus (swine flu). Instead, she tested positive for COVID-19 on March 20.

Following this, district authorities have been scrambling to trace all her contacts. They have already quarantined several villagers in Velhe, where the woman attended the programme.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nvjei7/article31141896.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PUNECORONAFILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/number-of-covid-19-positive-cases-in-pune-district-rises-to-28/article31141897.ece

272,2020/03/23,"Janata Curfew: Pilibhit officials trigger row after allegedly leading march, flouting social distancing rule","Pilibhit police clarify that the Superintendent of Police and District Magistrate told people who were beating utensils and ringing bells to go and perform the act individually at home

The Pilibhit administration on Sunday triggered a controversy when the district police chief and magistrate allegedly took out a march, blowing conch shells and banging steel plates in response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to express gratitude to those providing essential services during the COVID-19 outbreak.

While Mr. Modi had asked people to step out on their balconies, verandas or doorways and express their appreciation by clapping or beating plates, the Pilibhit officials were criticised on social media for prima facie breaking isolation and social distancing protocols.

A video of their alleged act was widely shared. In the 20-second video clip, the authenticity of which cannot be independently verified, Pilibhit District Magistrate Vaibhav Srivastava and Superintendent of Police Abhishek Dixit are seen leading a group of people, at least two dozen in sight, many of them government staff and policemen, through an unidentified street.

While the District Magistrate is seen beating a flat metal bell, the police officer is blowing the conch, even as the rest in group are beating plates and clapping as they march ahead in tandem. Many are seen without any masks. Even children can be seen hopping into the frame.

Following condemnation on social media, where many users questioned the administration for possibly jeopardising public health, Pilibhit police clarified that the two officials “did not lead any march” and termed such reports as ‘misleading” and one-sided.

Pilibhit police said that on Sunday while inspecting the Janata Curfew in the city, the SP and the DM came across a locality where a group of people had gathered and were beating utensils and ringing bells.

Seeing this, the officials advised them to go and perform the act individually at home, on their balconies or roofs, and not form groups on the streets.

Those gathered on the street were “removed from the place with emotional engagement,” Pilibhit police explained in a statement, adding that use of force to disperse them did not seem “practical” at that moment.

Police post clip

The police also posted a video clip of the DM in which he is seen telling people, through a media byte, to not come out on the streets and to hold the appreciation drills on their roofs, as assembly of people risks spread of the viral disease.

“I appeal to people to do it from home and not to gather at one place,” Mr. Srivastava said.

The Uttar Pradesh government on Sunday announced a “complete lockdown” in 15 districts of the State till at least March 25 in a bid to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. Later in the evening, the government added Pilibhit, which is vulnerable due to its proximity to Nepal, to the list.

The other 15 districts to be placed under lockdown include Lucknow and Agra, which have reported eight positive cases each so far.

In a rare sight after a gap of seven years, mass nesting of olive ridley turtles was witnessed during the daytime along the Rushikulya rookery coast in Odisha’s Ganjam district

According to Berhampur Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), Amlan Nayak, at around 2 a.m., 2,000 mother olive ridleys started coming out of the sea to the beach early on Saturday. The nesting went on till the sunrise. By Sunday evening, around one lakh mother olive ridleys had nested.

Usually, olive ridleys prefer to nest in darkness. “Sometimes due to pressure of delivery time, they may be opting to nest at daytime,” said Bivash Pandav, scientist of Wild Life Institute of India (WII), who has been studying olive ridleys for over two decades now.

Each nest dug up by the turtles, on an average, contains around 100 eggs.

274,2020/03/23,"Wild berry gets a new cousin in Assam, but the ‘Great Hedge of India’ faces threat","Carissa kopilii is threatened by a hydroelectric project and water turned acidic

A multi-utility wild berry, whose thorny plant the British had used to build a barrier through India in the 1870s, has a hitherto unknown wilder cousin in Assam, a new study has revealed.

But unlike the abundant Carissa carandas, better known as karonda in Hindi, kalakkai in Tamil, koromcha in Bengali and karja tenga in Assamese, the Carissa kopilii is threatened by the very river it is named after — Kopili in central Assam. Reasons: a hydroelectric project on the river and water turned acidic because of coal mining in Meghalaya upstream.

It took Jatindra Sarma, Northern Assam Circle’s Conservator of Forests, four years to study the thorny plant whose berries are greenish and sour when raw and blackish and sweet when ripe.

The “sun-loving” plant was distributed sparsely, rooted in rocky crevices along the Kopili riverbed at altitudes ranging from 85-600 metres above sea level.

“The fruits were difficult to find amid a profusion of thorns. The pricks were worth it, as we established it as a new species, a wilder variety of the more familiar karja tenga,” Mr. Sarma, one of the authors of the study, told The Hindu on Saturday.

The study, co-authored by Hussain A. Barbhuiya of Mumbai’s Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and Santanu Dey of Nagaland University’s Department of Botany was published in the latest issue of the Journal of Asia-Pacific Biodiversity.

Karja tenga has been used as a traditional herbal medicine for a number of ailments such as diarrhoea, anaemia, constipation, indigestion, skin infections and urinary disorders. The leaves have been used as fodder for silkworms while a paste of its pounded roots serves as a fly repellent.

The Carissa carandas was also among several thorny plants the British had grown 140 years ago for a 1,100-mile barrier apparently to enforce taxes and stop the smuggling of salt. In his book The Great Hedge of India, Roy Moxham had likened this short-lived barrier to the Great Wall of China.

“Carissa kopilii, yielding white flowers from August-October and fruits from November-January, should have all the medicinal and utilitarian properties of its better-known cousin, but we have to ensure it survives the river that sustains it,” Mr. Sarma said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/f4pf5l/article31136503.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-wild-berry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wild-berry-gets-a-new-cousin-in-assam-but-the-great-hedge-of-india-faces-threat/article31136504.ece
275,2020/03/23,Honey collectors of Sunderbans switch to apiculture to fend off tiger attacks,"The cooperative societies located at Jharkhali, Kultali and Nalgora have been provided financial support in the form of loans.

From time immemorial, people from the villages of Sunderbans have been venturing into the dense mangrove forest inhabited by the Royal Bengal Tiger to collect the sweetest produce of the forest, honey.

Maulis (honey collectors), as they are called in Bengali, often risk their lives in the peak season to collect honey, armed with nothing but a prayer to Bon Bibi ( the Forest Goddess). Going by the official estimates, at least five to six of these honey collectors (official figures) are killed by tigers every year.

In an attempt to ensure that the honey collected from the Sunderbans does not involve such life risk, Directorate of Forest 24 Parganas (South), along with WWF India, has come up with a novel mechanism of community apiculture for collecting the forest produce.

The villagers of the fringe areas of Sunderbans have set up three cooperatives societies, the members of which have been provided with training and equipment, such as honey collection boxes. These boxes are placed inside forest camps and adjoining nylon netted forest areas of the Sunderbans. Though located deep inside the mangrove forest, the camps and the adjoning areas have little risk of tiger attacks and the maulis can go about their activity without any fear

Ecological balance

“The project was inaugurated by State’s Forest Minster Rajib Banerjee earlier this week. As of now, there are 70 members in the three cooperatives, who are involved in the community apilculture initiative. We are very hopeful that the number will increase in times to come,” Santosha G.R. Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), 24 Parganas (South) told The Hindu.

The cooperative societies located at Jharkhali, Kultali and Nalgora have been provided financial support in the form of loans. The State's Panchayat and Rural Development, Department has facilitated the process of securing these loans by these coperative. The initiative is not only aimed at protecting the lives of honey collectors but also aimed at ensuring the ecological balance of the Sunderbans.

Ratul Saha, landscape coordinator, WWF India, said that necessary pilot studies were done over the past few years as to how many boxes can be kept in a particular area. On the basis of the results, the project is being implemented.

Bonphool brand

The peak season for collection of Sunderban honey obtained from the nectar of the mangrove plants is begings in March and ends in the first week of June. Unlike the traditional practice of collecting honey, where those who risk their lives by venturing into the forest do not get much in return, the members of the cooperative are hopeful that they will be able to earn ₹ 20,000 a month.

The Forest Department has created a separate brand for selling this honey named Bonphool (Flower of the Forest). The honey extracted from mangrove forest will be called Bonphool Wild Honey — harvested from traditional honey collectors from mangrove forest of Sunderbans.

After June the boxes will travel to south Bengal forest, where the cooperatives will collect honey from Eucalyptus plantations. There are plans to sell the Bonphool through the Biswa Bangla, the State government's outlets.

14 % of tiger attacks

Human tiger conflict is a major issue in the Sunderbans. In the State of Art Report on the Biodiversity of Sunderbans, released by WWF India in 2017, Chandan Surabhi Das points out that between 1985 to 2009, tigers attacked 789 persons, of which 666 succumbed to their injuries. Nearly 14% of the victims were honey collectors, the document added. While the number of human-tiger conflict have come down over the last few years because of better forest management and nylon fencing, instances of such tiger attacks are still reported.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/d3hv06/article31136443.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-sweet-honey,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/honey-collectors-of-sunderbans-switch-to-apiculture-to-fend-off-tiger-attacks/article31136444.ece
276,2020/03/23,Stranded train passengers and long march in ‘janata curfew’-bound Ghaziabad,"Administration might be thinking of breaking the virus chain but it could end up breaking the food chain, said an annoyed canteen owner Ankit Rathore

From donkeys forming the traffic to people walking for several kilometres to reach their destination, Ghaziabad presented some strange scenes during the ‘janata curfew’ on Sunday.

At the deserted Sahibabad railway station, a family of three were the only passengers present on a platform that remains crowded throughout the week. For their service was Seva Ram, the pointsman, who was doubling as the catering boy for the family. After all, they had a day to spend on the deserted platform.

Ajay Pandey was travelling with his wife and son from Buxar to Mandi Gobind Garh in Fatehpur Sahib district in Punjab. Their train arrived at 10.30 a.m. and their connecting train was scheduled for 9 p.m. “We were told that it (COVID-19) didn’t affect vegetarians,” remarked Mr. Pandey, perhaps, irked by repeated phone calls of relatives and questions of officials. “The trains were running on time yesterday. So we boarded the Garib Rath. But by the time it reached Sahibabad, it was more than 2.30 hours late. We missed the connecting train. Now we are waiting for Chhattisgarh Express to arrive.”

D.S. Rawat, Chief Booking Supervisor of Sahibabad Railway Station, said he hadn’t seen such a scenario in his more than a three-decade-long career. “A virus has stopped the Indian Railways. Only those trains that left their points of origin yesterday would complete their journey,” he said.

At the Mohan Nagar Chowk, Maharoof, with his six colleagues, was on a long march from Dilshad Garden border to Ghaziabad Railway Station, a distance of around 12 kms. They got down at Nizamuddin Railway Station and took a bus first to Anand Vihar and then to Ghaziabad border. “After that, we didn’t find any conveyance. We work near Goa in a cotton factory. The factory has been shut down temporarily. We are going to our village in Amroha. We don’t know how long it will last but we do know that we don’t have enough money to stay home for more than 4-5 days.”

On the other side of the road, Ovais and his two friends were lucky to find Maqbool, a rickshaw-puller at the Vaishali Metro Station. “We are coming from Sholapur. We walked down from Anand Vihar to Vaishali Metro Station. There, we found him,” said Ovais. Maqbool was tired but happy. He had charged them ₹200 for a distance of almost 5 kms, a route he had never covered because it has two flyovers in between. “What to do, I can’t afford to go home without money,” he said.

At the Narendra Mohan Hospital, Mukesh Kumar, a daily wager, was concerned about the survival of his daughter-in-law, admitted to the ICU. “We were forced to come to a private charitable hospital because we were turned back from two government hospital in Delhi because of lack of beds. I don’t know how I would be able to pay for the treatment.”

‘Panic buying’

A few kilometres away, at the Sahibabad Mandi, Ankit Rathore was livid. He runs a small canteen for those who work in the Mandi. “I have to pay the rent and salaries of the workers even if it remains closed. “Even after the appeal of the PM, people from big colonies indulged in panic buying on Friday and Saturday, raising the prices of essential vegetables. The rich could buy potatoes worth ₹1,000, we keep only ₹10 for it,” he rued.

Mr. Rathore said the administration might be thinking of breaking the virus chain but it could end up also breaking the food chain. “There are a number of beggars and garbage collectors in this area. We feed them by giving them one samosa or one chapati. When we would not be able to feed ourselves, how would we share with them.”

The statement further said the duration of this shutdown will depend upon government policy.

Workers demand

The workers employed in the automotive and garments sector of the district, with the majority of the units situated in the Industrial Model Township, Manesar, had been long demanding the shutting down of the factories arguing that they were at a great risk of being infected with the deadly virus because of the crowded premises and use of public transport by them.

On the issue of hygiene, Ms. Roshi said only burqa-clad women were present on the site. “A burqa has four layers, which is better than the three-layered mask recommended by the administration. We are providing sanitisers at the site as well,” she added.

Ms. Roshi said the protest would continue as the government didn’t pass any notification on CAA-NRC -NPR. “It has been 56 days. We are doing what the Prime Minister expects of us but the people in power are not responding to our demands. Merely making statements won’t help, they should give us in writing,” she urged.

The local administration, she alleged, was putting pressure on male members of the families of protesters to put an end to the protest.

Meanwhile, anti-CAA protest continued in Shahjamal area of Aligarh as well. According to local sources around 500 people turned up for the protest on Sunday.

‘Act more dangerous’

“We believe that the ‘black act’ is more dangerous for them than the virus. We are following the ‘janata curfew’ by keeping our business establishments shut but protesting against CAA-NRC-NPR is a separate matter,” said a participant, requesting anonymity.

“We are taking precautions like we are not bringing children to the protest site and are washing hands at regular intervals. Some of us are wearing masks as well,” a protester told reporters. “As Aligarh is yet to see any positive case of COVID-19, the protesters are not taking its threat seriously,” said a local source.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/l3pxzv/article31137513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE22-PROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/anti-caa-stirs-continue-despite-curfew/article31137514.ece

282,2020/03/23,"The Games can wait, says P.T. Usha","‘Human lives are more precious than anything in sport’

She was training in London for the 1986 Commonwealth Games when news broke that India would boycott the event in Edinburgh. Naturally, P.T. Usha was shattered.

“The Games were just a few days away and I was very disappointed, I was in very good form then and expected two golds — in the 400m and 400m hurdles. And, I had trained very hard for months in London,” said Usha in a telephonic chat with The Hindu on Monday.

India had pulled out in protest against Britain's stand on South Africa’s apartheid policy. A month later, at the Seoul Asian Games in September, Usha went on to win four golds and a silver.

“Of course, the current situation is different... one can understand the uncertainty over this year's Tokyo Olympics because of the coronavirus pandemic. Human lives are much more precious than anything in sport,” said Usha, the Golden Girl of Asian athletics in the ’80s.

“The Olympics can wait. When you see the happenings around you, especially the situation in Italy, where thousands of lives have been lost, you feel so emotional.

“We are staying positive, hoping that this will go away soon. We are happy that efforts are being made here to ensure the deadly virus does not reach the third stage,” she said.

With Canada and Australia pulling out of this July's Olympics, it is now almost certain that Tokyo 2020 will have to be postponed. The International Olympic Committee is also thinking of such a step.

Mid-2021 ideal

Usha feels having the Olympics in mid-2021 would be ideal.

“There are some who want the Olympics to be held in that specific four-year cycle, but considering the coronavirus situation, I feel it should be postponed to next year and all countries should be able to send their best athletes,” said Usha.

“The Olympics is not something we should be in a hurry to have, even if there are a couple of positive coronavirus cases in the Games, if they are held this year-end, they will have a huge negative impact.”

Swimming (in Fukuoka, Japan, July 16-Aug. 1) and athletics (Eugene, US, Aug. 6-15) will have their respective World championships next year and Usha feels that this 2021 July-August period could be used to have the Olympics instead.

“If we have the Olympics and the World championships in the same year, it will be very difficult. Suppose we have the Worlds in August and then the Olympics in December, it will be very difficult because the climate will be very different in Japan,” she explained.

“Also, we have the swimming and athletics Worlds every two years while the Olympics are held once every four years. But pushing the Olympics to 2022 (as Carl Lewis has suggested) will not be good. That will be too long a postponement, that is not needed. 2021 will do.”

She also felt the Olympic qualification period should be extended to suit the new dates and those who had made the grade earlier should be accommodated.",athletics,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/2f6318/article31145323.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24USHA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/the-games-can-wait-says-pt-usha/article31145324.ece

With two Thailand nationals testing positive for COVID-19, 130 families in two areas in the city, where the two nationals had stayed earlier, have been home quarantined, and others are not being allowed to enter the streets on Monday.

A group of seven nationals had arrived in the city and had stayed at a masjid in Sultanpet and the masjid near Kalaimadu Street for over a week and were involved in preaching. One person developed fever and was admitted to Coimbatore Medical CollegeHospital and tested negative for COVID-19. However, he died later due to complications of diabetic nephropathy and septicaemia.

287,2020/03/23,Coimbatore closes down for ‘Janata Curfew’,"Food Safety and Standards Authority of India closed four meat stalls in the city

The city shut itself on Sunday, in response to the call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to observe ‘Janata Curfew’ to fight against the spread of Covid-19.

Arterial roads, inner roads, lanes and by-lanes were free of vehicle movement and also pedestrians as everybody stayed indoors. Only the Coimbatore City Police personnel were seen moving around to ensure that none ventured out.

Other than the police personnel, those who had arrived by train in the morning were seen in front of the Coimbatore Railway Junction.

At the Omni Bus Stand, near G.P. Junction, the usual Sunday morning scene was not to be seen. Autorickshaw driver S. Murugan said the commuters, who had arrived around dawn were the only ones who arrived there in the day.

This had affected his business. “I’m here because I thought I’ll make some money to buy food. But given the situation, it appears that I’ll not be able to buy even a glass of tea.”

The Sunday’s Janata Curfew was all the more painful because the closure of schools had affected his monthly income. “I used to transport students to school. This helped me earn ₹5,000 – ₹6,000 a month. This income is cut as schools are shut. And, now the Sunday shut down,” he rued.

The Coimbatore Town Bus Stand in Gandhipuram reflected the picture outside. All the establishments barring the paid toilet were closed. Shopkeeper M. Manikandan said on Sundays he would normally earn at least ₹4,000 in the first few hours. The closure was a loss for him and he hoped to reopen at least after the curfew period, later in the day.

The Prime Minister had appealed for curfew from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. And, following this the State Government had suspended bus services.

C. Ravi of Kottayam, who was stranded in front of the Coimbatore Railway Junction, said he wanted to go home but was unable due to cancellation of trains. “I’m affected but I’m for the curfew. In the interest of larger public good, this is necessary.”

Food Safety and Standards Authority of India closed four meat stalls in the city and directed them to wind up business in the morning to avoid gathering of people.

The CSI Immanuel Church near DSP Junction had its gates closed. The security personnel there said the church management went in for an early mass that ended by 5.30 a.m. On other Sundays, it conducted two mass – 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. The management had also cancelled the Lent prayer meetings it had scheduled on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

A few voluntary organisations distributed breakfast and lunch to people in front of the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital and the Junction.

At 5 p.m. several city residents went to terrace, balcony, common area in case of gated communities and apartments to clap, blow conches, ring bell or make sound using ladles and utensils to thank doctors, health workers and others engaged in delivery of essential services, in response to the call given by Mr. Modi.

Several residents from Ramanathapuram area stood in front of their houses. While the band team of the Armed Reserve of Coimbatore city police performed a band at Gandhipuram, two policemen blew bugle from the terrace of city police commissioner’s office. Other personnel stood in the balconies and ground at the office and gave rhythmic clap. Fire and Rescue Services personnel assembled in front of all the stations in Coimbatore where they rang fire bells and blew fire alarm. Fire brigades clapped.

Coimbatore District Collector K. Rajamani said the ‘curfew’ was peaceful and almost complete in rural parts of the district, too.

Around dusk, however, several residents ventured out of their homes. Many youth were seen on arterial roads and other important city roads. A few also took selfies.

Flyovers and bridges became the sought-after places for people to have an aerial view of the city’s skyscape at dusk and click selfies. Senior citizens with their shoes on used the opportunity presented by the curfew to take a brisk walk, what with they not having to worry about speeding vehicles.

The evening also saw owners of medical shops and milk booths open their premises to cater to customers.

In a memorandum to the Central and State governments, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association R. Ramamurthy has said that industries, especially micro, small and medium enterprises, already face cancellation of orders, under utilisation of capacity, reduced output and revenue, etc. They are also facing working capital constraints.

Now, the units expect that there will be extended lock down period to control spread of the virus, they will have to continue paying wages to the workers and will not receive any dues.

Hence, the Central Government should issue necessary instructions to the Reserve Bank of India, to consider closing down of all banking transactions for the lock down period when industries may be closed. It will be very much supportive to the MSMEs by extending nil interest on all loans and cash credits until the end of the situation. In order to help the MSMEs pay wages to its employees, subsidies should be extended to these MSME units for the lock down period and given exemption on ESI and PF. All statutory payments like GST and Income Tax should be deferred for the next three months after the lock down period.

The State government should announce a stimulus package (funds) to be allotted to the employees for the lock down period, a package to the MSMEs industries for the loss of business during the lock down period, deferring deadlines for payment of mandatory taxes and bills, and rescheduling of loans extended by State financial institutions.

A couple got married at a temple in Udhagamandalam, with just close family in attendance. The couple, M. Jayanandhini and R. Mathan Raj, residents of Udhagamandalam, had planned their wedding in November, but had to cancel their wedding reception due to the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

Around 20 members, including the bride and groom got married in a simple ceremony on Sunday.

To prevent people from venturing outdoors, police personnel were stationed at major intersections in the towns of Udhagamandalam, Coonoor, Kotagiri and Gudalur.

They stopped motorcyclists and other stray road users.

A Tibetan man, who had come to purchase milk from a shop was stopped by the police, who took away the man’s keys and made him wait for over 20 minutes.

But they were not complaining as the shut down was for a good case. They have heard that the virus (Covid-19) spreads fast and people should keep away from one another. So for societal safety, they said they are not complaining.

Daily wage earners and migrant workers are hit by the COVID-19 spread as they are unable to get regular jobs.

On Sunday, Anil Kumar of Motihari, East Champaran, Bihar, said many workers like him had reached Coimbatore without knowing that it was a day of ‘curfew’. Having arrived in the city he was unable to have tea or breakfast.

Dilip Kumar, also of Bihar, said migrant workers like him were at the mercy of a few well-meaning citizens who had given them biscuits, food, etc.

Another migrant worker and his family had come to Coimbatore by train on Sunday from Thrissur. He planned to take a train to Bihar. Unaware that trains were cancelled, he said they will take the train at night and that they were waiting as it was “bandh” on Sunday.

Coimbatore District Collector K. Rajamani said that a couple of organisations voluntarily distributed food to workers, daily wage earners on Sunday. “It was a contingency arrangement,” he said.

About 300 migrant workers were taken to the CSI community hall so that they have a shelter for the night and food. More workers were expected to arrive by trains reaching the city and arrangements had been made to accommodate them for a day or so. The workers have been advised to go back to their workplaces.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/8afqzp/article31137300.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB23-WORKERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/migrant-workers-and-daily-wage-earners-hit/article31137301.ece
294,2020/03/23,Coimbatore closes down for ‘Janata Curfew’,"Food Safety and Standards Authority of India closed four meat stalls in the city

The city shut itself on Sunday, in response to the call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to observe ‘Janata Curfew’ to fight against the spread of Covid-19.

Arterial roads, inner roads, lanes and by-lanes were free of vehicle movement and also pedestrians as everybody stayed indoors. Only the Coimbatore City Police personnel were seen moving around to ensure that none ventured out.

Other than the police personnel, those who had arrived by train in the morning were seen in front of the Coimbatore Railway Junction.

At the Omni Bus Stand, near G.P. Junction, the usual Sunday morning scene was not to be seen. Autorickshaw driver S. Murugan said the commuters, who had arrived around dawn were the only ones who arrived there in the day.

This had affected his business. “I’m here because I thought I’ll make some money to buy food. But given the situation, it appears that I’ll not be able to buy even a glass of tea.”

The Sunday’s Janata Curfew was all the more painful because the closure of schools had affected his monthly income. “I used to transport students to school. This helped me earn ₹5,000 – ₹6,000 a month. This income is cut as schools are shut. And, now the Sunday shut down,” he rued.

The Coimbatore Town Bus Stand in Gandhipuram reflected the picture outside. All the establishments barring the paid toilet were closed. Shopkeeper M. Manikandan said on Sundays he would normally earn at least ₹4,000 in the first few hours. The closure was a loss for him and he hoped to reopen at least after the curfew period, later in the day.

The Prime Minister had appealed for curfew from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. And, following this the State Government had suspended bus services.

C. Ravi of Kottayam, who was stranded in front of the Coimbatore Railway Junction, said he wanted to go home but was unable due to cancellation of trains. “I’m affected but I’m for the curfew. In the interest of larger public good, this is necessary.”

Food Safety and Standards Authority of India closed four meat stalls in the city and directed them to wind up business in the morning to avoid gathering of people.

The CSI Immanuel Church near DSP Junction had its gates closed. The security personnel there said the church management went in for an early mass that ended by 5.30 a.m. On other Sundays, it conducted two mass – 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. The management had also cancelled the Lent prayer meetings it had scheduled on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

A few voluntary organisations distributed breakfast and lunch to people in front of the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital and the Junction.

At 5 p.m. several city residents went to terrace, balcony, common area in case of gated communities and apartments to clap, blow conches, ring bell or make sound using ladles and utensils to thank doctors, health workers and others engaged in delivery of essential services, in response to the call given by Mr. Modi.

Several residents from Ramanathapuram area stood in front of their houses. While the band team of the Armed Reserve of Coimbatore city police performed a band at Gandhipuram, two policemen blew bugle from the terrace of city police commissioner’s office. Other personnel stood in the balconies and ground at the office and gave rhythmic clap. Fire and Rescue Services personnel assembled in front of all the stations in Coimbatore where they rang fire bells and blew fire alarm. Fire brigades clapped.

Coimbatore District Collector K. Rajamani said the ‘curfew’ was peaceful and almost complete in rural parts of the district, too.

Around dusk, however, several residents ventured out of their homes. Many youth were seen on arterial roads and other important city roads. A few also took selfies.

Flyovers and bridges became the sought-after places for people to have an aerial view of the city’s skyscape at dusk and click selfies. Senior citizens with their shoes on used the opportunity presented by the curfew to take a brisk walk, what with they not having to worry about speeding vehicles.

The evening also saw owners of medical shops and milk booths open their premises to cater to customers.

CAB Medical Committee chairman Pradip Dey and member Santanu Mitra had met representatives of SBI General Insurance (SBIGI) to ensure the cover.

In response, SBIGI wrote to CAB president Avishek Dalmiya confirming the policies.

“This is to assure you that all the group policies on behalf of your esteemed organization covering cricketers, umpires, scorers, etc, are being covered for COVID-19 (coronavirus).”

“We have instructed our third party administrators to report cases of COVID-19 and no claims should be rejected.

296,2020/03/23,Dhoni gets the best out of his players: Albie Morkel,"South African says only time will tell if MSD will don the blue jersey again

Albie Morkel’s international career may not throw jaw-dropping numbers but he picked up the right wickets at the right time and finished games when required. Parallel to the international stint, ran the Chennai Super Kings journey under the leadership of M.S. Dhoni.

The brand

Having played five IPL finals under the superstar ‘keeper-batsman, the South African feels ‘Dhoni the brand’ matters and that he is still supremely fit to run the show.

“He plays a big role. We all know how big Dhoni is in India. He is one of the best T20 and white-ball players ever to play the game and if you get him as a leader, it is going to bring success as he knows how to get the best out of his players,” Morkel told Sportstar on the sidelines of the Unacademy Road Safety World Series.

Dhoni has been off the field since the World Cup 2019 semifinal loss to New Zealand. The 2020 edition of the IPL, which is currently in limbo due to the coronavirus outbreak, would have marked his comeback and perhaps set the stage for the expected farewell tournament in October, the ICC World T20.

Morkel threw light on the achievements of CSK to decode the Dhoni factor behind any team’s success. “It all comes from keeping your core group of players together for a long time and have the same captain, Dhoni, for all seasons except for the two years when they weren’t part of the competition.

“Consistency is their secret. Over the last few seasons, they have made the finals eight times out of 10,” he said.

Morkel retired from all forms of the game last year but he misses “the moments of the IPL.” He was part of the South Africa Legends side for the Road Safety Series which was called off mid-way due to the pandemic.

“I have accepted that my time is over. You need to move on. I have spent fantastic years with CSK who are still very successful.”

As for Dhoni, only time will tell if he will return in the blue jersey.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/xw192o/article31145470.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24MSD,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/dhoni-gets-the-best-out-of-his-players-albie-morkel/article31145471.ece
297,2020/03/23,Staging of IPL-13 remains in the realm of uncertainty due to COVID-19 pandemic,"A review meeting scheduled for Tuesday indefinitely deferred

With the COVID-19 pandemic spreading all over the country, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has indefinitely deferred a review meeting to explore the possibility of staging the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).

A day after suspending IPL-2020 till April 15, the BCCI office-bearers had a meeting with franchise owners in Mumbai on March 14, which was followed by the IPL governing council meeting.

BCCI chief Sourav Ganguly, while indicating that “a curtailed IPL” was the only option, had mentioned that the next review meeting would be on March 24.

Brijesh Patel, chairman, IPL governing council, told The Hindu on Monday that “no meeting is scheduled” for Tuesday since there’s “not much to discuss about IPL” at the moment.

A franchise executive admitted that the “IPL is the last thing on everyone’s mind” with the coronavirus crisis getting worsen.

Good as gone?

Despite the BCCI hoping against hope about staging the IPL in some form before the window, that can be stretched to May 31, ends Board and franchise sources indicated that the possibility of the tournament taking off this year was remote.

The decision on calling off the season is unlikely to be taken any time before the second week of April.

At the moment, the States where the franchises are based — Delhi, Punjab, Kolkata, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Tamil Nadu — are under partial or complete lockdown. With the number of cases increasing, the situation appears grim.

Just like China, the authorities are understood to have been exploring the possibility of converting sports stadia into quarantine wards if the number of patients keep escalating.

Plight of overseas players

Even if the pandemic is curbed at its existing Stage-2 level, it would be unlikely that overseas cricketers will participate in the IPL because their countries are also in a crisis because of COVID-19.

It would be extremely difficult for them to get a clearance to travel in the next two months.

In fact, Australia’s Olympic federation has officially announced it would skip the Tokyo Olympics unless it is postponed from July when it is scheduled to start.

It would be surprising if the Australians, the biggest contingent in the IPL after the Indians, are part of this edition.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/i7hiig/article31145613.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IPLTROPHY-NKV-24march,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/covid-19-staging-of-ipl-13-remains-in-the-realm-of-uncertainty/article31145330.ece

The city government told the Delhi High Court on Monday that it has decided to decongest capital’s prisons by providing convicts with the options of special parole and furlough to contain the spread of coronavirus.

A Bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad, taking note of the submission, directed the Delhi government to take the necessary steps during the day to implement the measures.

The Delhi government submitted that it will amend its prison rules to provide the options of special parole and furlough. It said a notification would be issued within a day to amend the prison rules to include the new provisions.

The Delhi government on Sunday announced a lockdown of the Capital from 6 a.m. on Monday till midnight on March 31 to implement social distancing and isolation measures to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Flight operations

Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh will be sealed and all international and domestic flights arriving in the city would be suspended, the government said. The Union Ministry of Civil Aviation and various airlines were taken by surprise at the announcement, and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation later said that flight operations to and from Delhi would continue and the Indira Gandhi International Airport would continue to operate.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal announced the measures at a joint press conference on Sunday evening. “Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.

308,2020/03/23,Formulate SOPs for DNA test of bodies recovered during riots: HC,"‘People are not constrained to rush to courts each time’

The Delhi High Court has asked the AAP government to formulate a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for DNA matching of the unidentified bodies recovered during the recent riots in north-east Delhi so that “individuals are not constrained to rush to courts each time DNA sampling or matching is to be done”.

“This court is of the view that there should be SOPs so that essential matters are dealt with in a timely and even-handed manner without leaving the affected parties to the discretion, whims and fancies of the authorities,” Justice Anup J. Bhambhani remarked on Thursday.

The High Court’s remarks came while ordering the government to complete the DNA matching of an unidentified body of a riot victim before March 30 and to communicate the result to Matlub Alam within 24 hours of being prepared.

Mr. Alam, in his plea, stated that his brother went missing on February 25 during the riots in north-east Delhi. He feared that his brother may have suffered an unfortunate end.

He stated that upon receiving information that certain bodies were lying unclaimed in the mortuary of GTB Hospital, he went there, where he learnt that one of the bodies was found on the night of February 27 from the side of Pushta, near Kali Ghata Cut, in Karawal Nagar. Mr. Alam said this was the area where his brother was last present.

‘No information yet’

On his request, the blood sample of his father was collected at GTB Hospital on February 29 with the purpose of conducting DNA matching to confirm if the body recovered was that of Mr. Alam’s brother. Mr. Alam contended that despite lapse of more than two weeks, there has been no information on the result.

During the hearing, the Delhi government’s standing counsel Naushad Ahmad Khan said the process of DNA matching is already under way, “but according to his instruction, the scientific process of testing itself takes about 15 days”.

Mr. Khan assured that considering the urgent and sensitive nature of the matter, the DNA matching will be expedited and a report will be given as soon as possible.

The court additionally noted that “the same problem with regard to identification of bodies recovered in the recent riots is being faced in several cases”.

Responding to this, Mr. Khan stated that the resources of the Forensic Science Laboratories (FSLs) in Delhi are severely stretched since they receive hundreds of samples. “Samples are received in matters which are pending criminal investigation or trial; and in case of mass casualties such as riots, fires etc.,the FSLs get overwhelmed by the samples received. In such cases they are required to prioritise the testing of the DNA samples and cope with their limited resources,” Mr. Khan explained.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/wwsf3u/article31138194.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL23-RIOT2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/formulate-sops-for-dna-test-of-bodies-recovered-during-riots-hc/article31138195.ece

310,2020/03/23,"Plea seeks directions to provide masks, sanitisers to jail inmates","Petitioner sought setting up of isolation wards on prison premises

A public interest petition moved before the Delhi High Court has sought directions to the Delhi government and the prison authorities to immediately provide masks and hand sanitisers to all the inmates in Tihar Jail and other jails of Delhi.

The petition filed by advocate Vikas Padora has also sought directions to spray disinfectants or quarantine the jail premises. Mr. Padora also sought to set up isolation wards in the jail premises where the infected inmate or inmate having symptoms can be lodged safely.

The petition, which is likely to be heard this week, urged the court to give directions so that the spread of COVID-19 can be contained as much as possible in the jails across India.

‘Beyond capacity’

“As per the data available, Tihar jail has a capacity of 5,200 inmates, but more than 12,100 inmates are currently lodged in the jail, which clearly shows that the prison in Tihar jail is excessively overcrowded and functioning beyond its capacity,” the petition said.

“The same is the situation with most of the jails in India,” Mr. Padora added.

Mr. Padora stated that on March 17, he received a copy of letter sent by one inmate Raminder Singh through one of his visitor friend. “In the same letter, apart from requesting his own interim bail, the inmate informed the petitioner about the conditions inside the jail during this period of spread of COVID-19,” the plea said.

“It is most respectfully submitted that the said letter clearly depicts that the inmates inside jail are living in a constant fear of disease and which is making the life of inmates worse than it already was being inside jail,” the petition stated.

The advocate argued that all the jails in India are required to install isolation wards in their premises and take immediate measures to control the possible outbreak of COVID-19.

He sought “suitable directions” to the Centre to issue appropriate orders to all the jails across India. “Even if one case of COVID-19 goes undetected in any jail, there will not be any stoppage to the same and thereafter the same will not be controlled easily, and which may lead to unprecedented outbreak of virus and unprecedented deaths in the jails,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/yfzshw/article31112721.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COVID-HELPLINE-newcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/plea-seeks-directions-to-provide-masks-sanitisers-to-jail-inmates/article31138155.ece
311,2020/03/23,Roads in Millennium City abandoned,"Most people stay indoors; shops barring pharmacies, grocery stores remain shut

A near-complete shutdown was observed in the Millennium City on Sunday in response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for ‘janata curfew’ to tackle the spread of COVID-19. The roads wore a deserted look with most of the people staying indoors and shops remaining closed, except pharmacies and a few grocery stores.

In contrast to the routine heavy traffic on the Delhi-Gurugram highway, fewer vehicles could be seen plying on the road all through the day. Similarly, usual weekend hustle-bustle of shoppers and vehicles on Mehrauli-Gurugram Road, with over half-a-dozen shopping malls dotting it on both sides and metro stations, was completely missing.

“Only a few vehicles are seen plying. In most of them, families are travelling,” said a Gurugram police constable manning a barricade under the M.G. Road metro station, along with two fellow police officers.

Deepak, who was manning the front desk at Yes Bank near Cyber Hub, said he had to walk around 5 km from near Jawala Mill to reach the office since autorickshaws were not plying. Shubham, standing at IFFCO Chowk with a huge luggage, said that he had come from Anand Vihar in a bus and was now waiting for an autorickshaw for the past 30 minutes.

The shops, except the pharmacy stores, had the shutters pulled down in all major localities. However, the grocery shops were open in the regularised colonies and urbanised villages away from the eyes of the police. Harish Bakery, a prominent confectionery shop on Old Railway Road was also open. Though it was a call for a “voluntary curfew”, the police had put barricades at several points across the city and were inquiring those who had stepped outside. Also, the police, in a few cases, lacked clarity on whether the confectioneries and grocery stores could remain open during the ‘janata curfew’.

Though the petrol pumps were open, they registered little sale. “Only a dozen cars and around 40 motorcycles have come since morning. The traffic is usually huge on Sundays, but we are playing games on mobile phones to kill time today [on Sunday],” said an attendant at Indian Oil petrol pump opposite the office of Gurugram Police Commissioner.

The railway station was also empty with all trains having been cancelled. Brijender, a railway platform employee, said around 40 trains halted on the station everyday with hundreds of passengers thronging it on Sundays, but only goods trains were allowed on Sunday in view of the ‘Janata Curfew’.

Responding to the Prime Minister’s appeal, people also came to the balconies or stepped out of their homes in large numbers at 5 p.m. to beat thalis, blow conch shells and applaud to appreciate the efforts of those offering services to the masses in the fight against COVID-19.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/roads-in-millennium-city-abandoned/article31138119.ece

With the Delhi government marking homes of people who have been advised home quarantine, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal took to Twitter to ask people not to stigmatise such people.

“Delhi government is marking all homes with persons advised to home quarantine. I appeal to all not to stigmatise such families. Please be empathetic and supportive towards them. The marking is aimed only at cautioning others for their own safety. #DelhiFightsCorona [sic.],” Mr. Kejriwal tweeted.

The CM announced that the government was providing 72 lakh people free ration and was doubling pensions. He urged all employers to provide employees, including domestic helps, paid leave. “Not only is this a compassionate gesture, it is essential for our economy to survive,” the CM said.

He also added that it was the people of Delhi who could fight COVID-19 on their own.

“I said this yesterday in my address, and it cannot be stressed enough - Only we can protect ourselves Each of us must realise the gravity of the threat, stay indoors & wash our hands regularly By protecting yourself, you also protect those around you, [sic],” he said.

Mr. Kejriwal also welcomed people to visit night shelters across the city to avail the free meal service of the Delhi government. “We do not want anybody to suffer due to hunger,” he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/6j3537/article31125343.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Jatin---KejriwaGPD7958JK3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cm-appeals-to-people-not-to-stigmatise-ones-advised-quarantine/article31138110.ece

314,2020/03/23,Traders’ body welcomes curfew,"Traders’ union, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), welcomed the Delhi government’s decision on Sunday to impose a shutdown in the wake of the outbreak of COVID-19.

In accordance, the union said it issued an advisory to all trade associations of Delhi to inform every trader in the city to keep their shop closed till the end of the month. On Sunday alone, following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a ‘janata curfew’, CAIT said, up to 7 crore traders in 60,000 markets, with nearly 40 crore employees have observed the curfew.

Joining hands with CAIT, about 1 crore transporters, 4 crore hawkers and about 2 crore small-scale industries also refrained from any kind of business activities, it said. The one-day shutdown caused a loss of business to the tune of nearly ₹15,000 crore to the domestic trade, the union estimated.

Along with CAIT, other national organisations of retail sector, including All India Motor Transport Welfare Association, National Hawkers Federation, Laghu Udyog Bharti, MSME Development Forum, All India Ladies Entrepreneurs Association, All India Motor Transport Congress, Bharatiya Kisan Manch, participated in the ‘Janata Curfew’.

Highlighting the impact of the pandemic on trade, particularly near the end of the financial year, CAIT also urged the Prime Minister to make various interventions, such as postponing filing of income tax and GST returns, extension on bank loans and EMIs without interest or penalty, institution of a cash loan at concessional rates of interest to ensure a smooth supply chain and provision of subsidy to traders to award wages to employees during the shutdown.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/traders-body-welcomes-curfew/article31138100.ece
315,2020/03/23,DMRC to suspend services till March 31,"Move is aimed at controlling spread of COVID-19 epidemic

The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Sunday announced that metro services will be suspended till March 31 to contain the spread of COVID-19.

In a statement, the DMRC said: “... it has been decided that metro services will remain completely closed till March 31.”

“The move is aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19 by ensuring social distancing and encouraging people to stay at home for the time being,” the statement read.

The Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) also announced that bus and metro services on the Aqua Line, connecting Noida and Greater Noida, will remain suspended till March 31.

Earlier, on Saturday, both DMRC and NMRC had announced that metro services on Monday will be truncated in an attempt to promote social distancing.

Apart from issuing advisories, the DMRC had said that a staggered operation of metro services would be followed where only commuters belonging to the “essential services” category would be allowed to enter the metro premises between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m., while the general public could travel between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.

It was said that services would remain suspended between 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and the last trains would depart from originating stations at 8 p.m.

Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal to observe a ‘janata curfew,’ metro services were closed on Sunday.

316,2020/03/23,Capital responds to Modi’s call for ‘people’s curfew’,"People clapped, beat vessels to thank those involved in essential services at 5 p.m.

The Capital was in a near-total shutdown on Sunday for 14 hours with Delhiites largely adhering to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to observe ‘janata curfew’. The silence during the day was punctuated briefly at 5 p.m. with people coming out of their homes clapping and beating vessels as a gesture to thank those who were providing essential services at a time when social distancing was the need of the hour.

The main city roads were empty and inner colony roads had only a few people walking between their home more out of curiosity than necessity. With the metro services shut, no private taxis available and only 50% of the DTCs bus fleet plying on the roads, several passengers were seen stranded at the Delhi airport, New Delhi railway station and ISBT, Kashmere Gate. A family that arrived at New Delhi railway station and wanted to travel to Rishikesh was left looking for ways to find accommodation in Delhi and head to Rishikesh on a later date.

At busy junctions like ITO, Connaught Place and Mandi House, Delhi police personnel were seen handing over roses to motorists, who had ventured out, asking them to go back home. In some parts of Delhi, policemen also handed out masks and sanitisers to spread awareness about COVID-19.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) Sanjay Bhatia said largely, people were adhering to the ‘janata curfew’. “We noticed that since 7 a.m., people had not come out of their houses unless it was really necessary. We have selected 15 points in central Delhi, which are usually crowded and frequented by people. In these areas, policemen wearing masks were offering flowers to people and urging them to stay at home,” he said.

Several grocery stores and pharmacies remained open during the curfew, with people in the city coming out in small numbers for supplies. Others were also seen taking joyrides on two-wheelers.

Commenting on the curfew, Twisha, a resident of Kalkaji said: “I think the curfew was a good idea, given that it is followed with national shutdowns.”

A lot of Delhiites were surprised that the city was able to discipline itself. “This is a measure we are taking because of an extremely dangerous situation but it has given us time to pause and reflect on the smaller things in life. It is good that Delhiites are able to discipline themselves when needed,” said Uttara Seth a resident of Jangpura.

Architect Sandal Kapoor, who resides at Sidharth Extension in Delhi, said he came out to his balcony after staying indoors all day, at 5 p.m., to blew a conch shell to thank the health workers who have been working to contain the COVID-19. “Me and my wife did not step out of the house the whole day. We hope that with collective efforts of the government and the public, we can avoid further spreading of COVID-19,” Mr. Kapoor said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/6g4wj1/article31140237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Janata-Curfew,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/capital-responds-to-modis-call-for-peoples-curfew/article31138094.ece
317,2020/03/23,Hope floats for COVID-19 patients,"More testing to be taken up at five designated labs, says CCMB director

There is some hope on the horizon for COVID-19 patients. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is likely to allow hydroxychloroquine drug on high-risk patients for now following good results in United States.

“It is showing promising results and could be used for both treatment and prevention, but to begin with, the government may allow it for only treatment purposes,” said CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecule Biology (CCMB) director Rakesh Mishra on Monday.

Dr. Mishra, who has been supervising training programme for the scientific lab personnel to take up the proposed mass testing of those affected with coronavirus, took time off to explain that at least 25 of them will be ready for conducting the testing at the five designated labs in a couple of days. The batch of dozen candidates having undergone training at the facility here in Habsiguda have been sent to the respective test centres.

The labs where the COVID-19 testing will be done include NIMS, Gandhi Hospital, Osmania General Hospital, Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Tropical & Communicable Diseases or the Fever Hospital and the Warangal Hospital. The Centre for DNA Finger Printing and Diagnostics (CDFD) is also likely to be added to this group, he said.

“With this combined strength, we can test up to 1,500 samples a day and it has become necessary to check whether we have been able to control the pandemic in the past one week. The compulsory clampdown of the cities has become necessary, otherwise it would have been increasingly difficult to control the spread of the contagian. We will know in another week to 10 days if we have been really able to arrest the spread or if it has spread even further,” he added.

He pointed out that the ICMR has also revised the guidelines and directed the State governments to take up mass testing, including those not showing any symptoms of the virus but were known to have been in contact with the COVID-19 patients.

Mapping the spread

“We need to go for testing because we can then easily map in which way the virus has been spreading, where the infected people are and whether our efforts in the past few days have borne fruit or not. At the moment, we do not have any clue so far in these aspects. We will also know in the next few days if we have been quick enough with our preventive steps,” explained Dr. Mishra.

The CCMB director said a lot of scientific research activity is currently under way in both public and private sector with multiple institutions getting involved in “doing something effective before the virus spreads further”.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hope-floats-for-covid-19-patients/article31145635.ece

Violating the restrictions, autorickshaws moved everywhere, workers came back to malls and supermarkets and other business establishments. All kinds of business outlets, restaurants, shops, banks and departmental stores were kept open. Police who strictly monitored the Janata Curfew seemed to be taking rest and not responding to the calls of conscious citizens who lodged complaints.

‘Codes to cheat thermal scanners’— a few passengers who were returning from foreign countries were taking a leaf out of this by taking paracetamol to suppress fever so that their body temperature could not be detected during thermal screening at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA), Shamshabad.

Symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, cold, respiratory illness. However, only body temperature is detected using thermal scanners at airports across the world. If anyone is detected with abnormal body temperature, they will be taken to isolation centres at State-run hospitals and their samples will be collected for tests.

When contacted sources in the police department and airport have confirmed that a few air passengers took the medicines so as to normalise the temperature consequently avoiding the detection of temperature by thermal readers.

However, passengers with other symptoms like cold, cough and dizziness cannot run away from the eyes of health officials at the airport. “People should realise that we are taking measures for the safety of their family and society. Hiding the symptoms of COVID-19 is homicide,” a senior police officer told The Hindu.

He said that same issue was discussed during an high-level emergency meeting with Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao on Thursday. When asked about the effect of paracetamol and other pain killers, senior consultant physician at KIMS Dr. K. Shivaraju said that the medicines act effectively and bring down body temperature for at least four hours.

320,2020/03/23,Telangana Govt. invokes provisions empowering officials to take stringent measures,"Brings into force Telangana Epidemic Diseases (Covid-19) Regulations, 2020

The Government of Telangana has empowered all the officers from the Director of Public Health, Commissioner of Vaidya Vidhana Parishad, district collectors and municipal commissioners to take stringent measures necessary to prevent the outbreak of Coronavirus (Covid-19) or its spread within their respective jurisdictions.

Drawing inspiration from The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, the government has framed “The Telangana Epidemic Diseases (Covid-19) Regulations, 2020” as part of its efforts to contain the spread of the virus. The 1897 Act, in the words of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, provides government officials to take all such measures as may be necessary to contain the spread of the virus. “Once the provisions are invoked, they can even stop my car,” the Chief Minister said at a press conference on Sunday.

In force immediately

The regulations will come into force immediately and would remain valid for one year. They mandate all hospitals, government and private provide Covid-19 corners for screening of suspected cases as and when so required by the authorities. In addition to screening the cases, the hospitals should record the history of contacts of the suspected or confirmed case of Covid-19.

People with a history of travel in the last 14 days to a country or area from where COVID-19 has been reported must voluntarily report to State Control Room (040-24651119)/ Toll Free number 104 so that necessary measures can be initiated by the designated officials. The officials would be authorized to isolate and/or admit into any identified hospital the person who develops symptoms simulating the Covid-19 infection. “The empowered officer may initiate action under the section 188 of Indian Penal Code (48 of 1860) against the person who refuses to comply with such advice of isolation and/or admission,” the regulations said.

14-day home quarantine

People with a travel history to the affected areas in the last 14 days but are asymptomatic should remain in home quarantine for 14 days from the day of exposure and must abide by the quarantine guidelines issued by the government from time to time. “Persons who do not observe home quarantine shall be quarantined in the facilities set up by the government,” the regulations said.

People with a travel history and symptoms should be isolated in the hospitals as per protocol and tests should be conducted accordingly. Information of all such cases must be immediately sent to the State Integrated Disease Surveillance Unit and the District Collector/Municipal Commissioner by those managing the cases at the hospital.

Punishment for spreading rumours

The regulations caution against use of Covid-19 related information by persons/institutions /organisations without ascertaining facts and prior clearance of the designated officials concerned. This was necessary to avoid spread of any unauthenticated information or rumours regarding Covid-19. Violation of the instructions by any person/institution/organization would be treated as a punishable offence and steps would be initiated accordingly.

Further, private healthcare institutions intending to test Covid-19 suspects must notify the State IDSP unit about the same and the IDSP on its part should arrange for monitoring and testing strictly as per the guidelines issued by the ICMR. The regulations also make mention of restrictions that could be imposed in a specific geographical area for containing the spread of the virus.

Measures for Covid-19 containment

* Barring entry and exit of population from the containment area.

* Closure of schools, offices, cinema halls, swimming pools, gyms, other public places, etc. and banning mass congregations and functions as may be deemed necessary.

* Initiating active and passive surveillance of COVI D- 19 cases.

* Hospital isolation of all suspected cases and their contacts.

* Designating any Government or private building as a quarantine facility.

Vehicles violating the rules would be seized and released after the completion of the lockdown period. Two-wheelers with single driver, and four-wheelers with two persons would be allowed, and steps are being taken to ensure there are no gatherings of more than five people.

“The lockdown has been imposed in the interest of public safety and public health, and the government is committed to enforce it strictly,” Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar and DGP M. Mahender Reddy said.

PM’s dissatisfaction

Incidentally, the tightening of rules comes in the light of a tweet by Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing his dissatisfaction over people taking the lockdown ""lightly"".

The Chief Secretary and the DGP recalled that the government had invoked the provisions under The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, which gave several powers to the government for taking decisions that were in the interests of the people. The government had already imposed several restrictions including sealing of borders, and preventing movement of public and private transport vehicles as well as private vehicles to avoid scope for the spread of the virus.

No complacency

They said the government had given instructions to officials concerned as well as the people against being complacent as it could lead to the spread of the virus. “Movement of autorickshaws and some private transport vehicles has been observed this morning. But steps will be taken to curb such incidents,” the Chief Secretary averred.

The government, however, has decided to allow agriculture operations as well as NREGS works in the villages, provided people maintained social distancing. It was also decided to intensify watch on foreign returnees and take stringent action against those who did not volunteer to report to concerned officials .",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ms6vjx/article31125565.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/coronavirusjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/telangana-tighens-lockdown-rules-announces-night-curfew/article31141437.ece
323,2020/03/23,"Social distancing: some comply, others throw caution to winds","As coronavirus takes 14 days to incubate, symptoms may not be visible

Even as the enormity of COVID-19 is slowly sinking in, there are some who have returned from overseas but not following the mandatory self-isolation/quarantine norms. But, there are others who have been extremely cautious and following the government guidelines.

As coronavirus takes 14 days to incubate, symptoms may not be visible but people who come in contact with those exposed to COVID-positive patients can spread the virus within the community.

A senior executive working in an MNC did not want to take any chances. He gave paid leave to his maid, cook and even delivery boys supplying milk and newspaper at his doorstep.

“My son and I started working from home. My daughter-in-law and younger son are in different colleges and they are closed due to the government’s directive. All of us share household work now that we have sanctioned paid leave to the domestic help. I stocked up milk and for the time being, following news online,” he said. The only way to contain the transmission of coronavirus is to maintain social distancing and keep oneself confined to home, he added.

Retired public sector official M.V. Nagavender Rao says it is responsibility of every citizen to make ‘Janata Curfew’ on Sunday a success.

Referring to messages forwarded through social media like WhatsApp that nothing would happen to a particular country or religious community, he said, “Coronavirus has no nationality, religion, creed or caste. It does not have national borders and it is impartial. Innocent people often become the victims. One should be pragmatic without undue fear to control COVID-19,” he said.

The head of an MNC, which asked a bulk of its employees to work from home, would go to work just to ensure that employees do not come to office.

“Sometimes, employees prefer the comfort of office and travel all the way. In the process, they not only expose themselves to possible infection but also put their family members at risk. I strictly ask such employees to go back home,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/social-distancing-some-comply-others-throw-caution-to-winds/article31138223.ece
324,2020/03/23,Medical professionals keep safe distance,"Doctors, nurses and sanitation staff at isolation wards stay away from their families to keep them safe

A warm hug or a few words of comfort with aged parents and other family members with health issues such as hypertension or diabetes, may have helped in these times of COVID-19 crisis.

But, healthcare professionals, who have been in the front line to treat COVID-19 positive patients and suspects in Telangana, are keeping themselves away from their families, only to keep them safe. Especially, it gets tougher for such professionals whose family members are terminally ill.

The Hindu spoke to doctors, nurses, medical students, Grade IV employees and others at State government hospitals, on condition of anonymity, who have been attending to COVID-19 patients, on how they are dealing with their personal lives.

Though they take all precautions like wearing the Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and are not COVID-19 suspects, they keep safe distance from their family members to avoid taking any chances, a doctor said.

This measure of caution is maintained with their colleagues too, to ensure healthcare professionals do not land up in isolation wards at times when they are needed the most.

Their daily ritual includes taking bath multiple times immediately after getting home from hospitals.

In most cases, family members urged them to skip work at isolation wards.

“It’s been over 15 days since I went home and yes I miss my parents, my brother and my grandparents. But, this is not an emotional decision, it is a rational one. We know how vulnerable old people are. My grandfather is 80 years old and has Type-2 diabetes with frail immunity. Yes, I have to be there for my patients at the hospital, but I also cannot put my loved ones at risk,” said a junior doctor.

A senior doctor said though he takes 100% precautions, he is extremely cautious about coming in contact with his family members and colleagues. “We cannot afford to have an entire medical department in isolation ward. So, I maintain safe distance from everyone,” he said, adding that his mother, a senior citizen, checks on him every day. “I would do that too if my son were to serve in coronavirus isolation wards. It’s a basic human emotion. My mother is both proud and worried,” said the doctor.

Another senior doctor said they have to lead by example. “If we seniors are not at the forefront, won’t the assistant professors and junior doctors hesitate? It is part of our duty and we take all precautions. Doctors from all departments, staff nurses, sweepers, ward boys and others are working as a team,” he said.

Nurses at the front line, despite their courageous and relentless services, are made to feel like pariahs in their neighbourhoods. “The behaviour of neighbours towards us has changed. They look at us as if we are patients ourselves. They should know we take enough precautions,” averred a nurse.

Sanitation workers said they cannot take leave despite multiple requests from family members for the fear of losing their job.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/j23iki/article31138189.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-DOC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/medical-professionals-keep-safe-distance/article31138185.ece

Speaking to The Hindu, Maulana Ahsan Hamoomi, khateeb of the mosque, said the decision was taken in view of the novel coronavirus cases in the country and is in line with a larger consensus of faith leaders.

Meanwhile, the Jamiat-e-Ulama-Telangana and Andhra Pradesh issued a revised set of guidelines for mosques in the State in view of the lockdown. Maulana Hafiz Peer Shabbir, president of the organisation, said that directions have been issued to managing committees to give the call for prayer five to seven minutes before the congregation, perform obligatory prayers and close the mosque immediately after. No sermons or meetings in mosques will be entertained, he said.

Further, a couple of mosques, including one in Malakpet area, were either closed completely for the shutdown or severely restricted the congregation.

Temples closed

All temples across the State will remain closed for devotees till March 31 as part of the efforts to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.

However, daily rituals of deities will continue with a limited number of priests. “For the past few days, we were allowing a few devotees in the evening.

The Telangana government is now mulling taking over private properties to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the State. This includes using private properties to set up quarantine centres.

As was reported in these columns, the Ranga Reddy district administration on March 19, sent a letter to MANUU directing it to hand over the premises to the DME. The stipulation invoked was Section 30 of the Disaster Management Act 2005. This gives power to the district administration to take up a slew of measures, including identifying buildings that could be used as relief centres and camps.

Sources said that district officials have been directed to identify private properties so that they too could be taken over for the purpose.

“Officials were sent to inspect premises, both government and private. The government is primarily looking at larger buildings and open space,” said a source.

Another source said that the government has not yet sent letters to private property owners. However, officials have spoken to them to make them aware of the gravity of the situation.

Sundays spell family time for most city residents, who either stay together at home or make a quick outing. But the Janata Curfew ensured that everyone, even the busiest of busybees, did not step out.

For the ever-busy Minister K.T. Rama Rao, the day came as a blessing as he could spend time with his children and joined them in watching their favourite TV shows. A doting father, he was seen affectionately kissing his daughter after clapping in support of medical professionals.

Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy had to stay back in Delhi although it was his 25th wedding anniversary. He did a bit of gardening and caught up on reading. He picked up ‘The Ocean of Churn: How the Indian Ocean shaped human history’ by Sanjeev Sanyal. He tweeted saying he was participating in the #ReadABookChallenge and later nominated badminton star P.V.Sindhu, cricketer M.S. Dhoni and Union Ministers Smriti Irani and Anurag Thakur to do the same during the Janata Curfew. Later, he did yoga and watched a Tamil film, Vikram Vedha.

TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy said he got a “day off” after long and immersed himself in Jeffery Archer’s ‘Tell Tale’, a collection of short stories. He also walked on the treadmill for two hours on Sunday, in comparison to his usual one-hour exercise regimen.

Mr. Reddy’s wife and former MLA, Uttam Padmavathi was busy with work. A well-known architect, Ms. Padmavathi spent the day drawing and tuning in to the developments of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Firebrand Congress leader and Malkajgiri MP A. Revanth Reddy posted a picture of himself reading Kaloji Narayana Rao’s ‘Naa Godava’, a collection of poems on social issues and Telangana’s aspiration for a separate state. Mr. Reddy said he also went through several documents on environmental issues related to Telangana. It was also family time as he along with his wife, daughter and son-in-law watched Telugu film KGF.

For most other Congress leaders, it was a day well spent with their respective families.

332,2020/03/23,Churches go online to beam word of God,"Reach out to congregation through YouTube, Facebook

In a departure from centuries-old tradition, pastors and evangelists of several churches across the twin cities took to social media to deliver the word of God as part of Sunday mass what with all services being suspended till March 31 in wake of COVID-19 pandemic.

With people confined to their homes in view of the Janata Curfew, churches chose to reach out to the congregation through social media platforms like YouTube and Facebook.

In a statement, president of All India Catholic Union-Telangana Roydin Roach said: “As we received the directives from the Archbishop, all Catholics were instructed to stay at home and pray, even though it is Sunday, a day of obligation to attend Holy Mass.”

Churches have put up notice about the cancellation of masses on the church premises and the doors are kept closed. Even the compound gates are shut. “We are live streaming the mass on YouTube channel Sangamam Plus TV. Catholic Hub TV live streaming is available on the Catholic Hub app,” he added.

CSI All Saints Church at Trimulgherry adopted a unique strategy of pre-recording the mass minus the congregation. Fredrick R.Michael, former SCR PRO and presently steward of the church, told The Hindu that they enacted the Sunday mass by holding the service on Saturday itself. Before that, the entire church was washed and sanitised, he said, adding that the pre-recorded video service was uploaded on Facebook and YouTube on Sunday for the benefit of the members. “Due to the lockdown, we will continue with the same practice for next couple of weeks,” he said.

At the CSI St. Thomas SPG Church, Telugu Pastorate Presbyter-in-charge Rev. P. Solomon Raj shared the word of God online through Facebook. CSI Garrison Wesley Church, Lal Bazar, too went live.

333,2020/03/23,More on the mysterious aura that surrounds Metcalfe House,"Tall tales can be stranger than fiction and give us a break of the monotony of daily life

If reports are to be believed, a club near Birla Mandir in Connaught Place has been declared unsafe. It was once patronized by South Indians, but now lies deserted. Those living nearby say it is haunted. The notice printed on the front wall declaring it out of bounds though, could mean that the building has become unsafe because of age or structural defects. Be that as it may, such places do acquire their own attraction.

Now take Metcalfe House. It too is long supposed to be haunted though DRDO has its offices there with a large number of scientists working on its premises. It was built by Sir Thomas Metcalfe, British Resident in Delhi from 1835. Another such building, the Metcalfe Testimonial, built by his brother, Sir Charles Metcalfe, in Agra, was destroyed in a mysterious fire in 1895. In the heart of the capital, the Khooni Darwaza has its own spooky tales associated with the beheading of Dara Shikoh by his brother Aurangzeb. Earlier the murder of the sons of Abdul Rahim Khan-e-Khanan, the poet in Akbar’s court, on the orders of Jahangir, took place there.

Later, two sons and a grandson of Bahadur Shah Zafar were shot there by Lt. William Hudson in 1857. Some freedom fighters were also hanged in its vicinity when the Delhi Jail was situated at the site now occupied by Maulana Azad Medical College. On Hailey Road, the Agrasen ki Baoli is also believed to be haunted by those who were drowned in it.

From the dungeons in Metcalfe House, they say the sound of clanking chains is heard sometimes. In the ruins of the Metcalfe Testimonial at Agra, the sound of spoons striking empty plates was heard up to the time it made way for a housing colony. It was a reminder of a macabre Christmas Eve party: the host was murdered by unseen hands in 1898.

In the Khooni Darwaza blood stains appear sometimes, especially during the monsoon. They say that the sound of music emanates at night suddenly, in a flashback to the days when acabaret was held there. What does one make of all this? The best explanation is that such scary tales add some spice to a sedentary existence. So don’t be startled if you hear that Ghalib’s apparition is seen at his haveli on moonlit nights and at the Kala Mahal where he was born, some 3 km from the Taj.

The spectre of the poet’s patron, Bahadur Shah Zafar, is believed by some to haunt the Red Fort on Thursdays, something unimaginable as the king died in distant Rangoon. Apparently, ghosts can travel long distances!

The ghost of his court poet, Zauq, they say, is seen over the old Yamuna Bridge, running away with books, tightly clutched in his hands, to escape the British soldiers pursuing him in 1857. But this is definitely a fib because Sheikh Ibrahim Zauq died three years before the Uprising.

335,2020/03/23,Chennai band Big Sam’s EP ‘Stay’ is finally here,"From euphoria to heartbreak, ‘Stay’ hits all the highs and lows of love

This extended play (EP) has been in the making even before the band was. The first lyrics of Big Sam’s Stay were written in 2016. The first song of Stay, called ‘Phenomenal Woman’, was released in June 2019 with a slick, somewhat racy video, ensuring for the debutantes plenty of space in the spotlight. After that, however, came another arduous wait for Big Sam fans, with a song here and a video there being released between months-long gaps.

But as of last Friday, Stay is officially out and ready to be binged on, and the wait seems to have been worth it. “We started recording it in the beginning of 2018. Harshil Radhakrishnan of The F16s helped us put these tracks together; he has produced track number two, three, four and five,” says Samuel Vijayan, lead vocalist, lyricist and founder of the five-member band that also includes drummer Goutham ‘Healer’ Balasubramaniam, keyboardist Chintan Trivedi, bassist Adithya Gopi and guitarist Akshay Yesodharan.

The seven-song concept EP, which starts out happily lovestruck, but then takes listeners through all the stages of longing and heartbreak, has an overall mellow vibe to it, but manages to swing between high-tempo excitement (‘Phenomenal Woman’) and slowly mournful reverie (‘Dangerous’). The lyrics are just heartfelt enough to make you dwell, and throughout, it retains something of a nostalgic, softly retro pop, with ‘Here’ breaking the norm with some beautiful acoustics.

For Samuel, the track holds a special place in the softly intense ‘Stay’, the declaration of longing with slight hints of techno and an intimate vibe. “It isn’t the first song I wrote, but it is the song that the entire EP stems from,” he explains. None of them, however, manage to live up to the emotive and craftily put together ‘Phenomenal Woman’, which had given rise to an entirely different level of expectations that had only been heightened by the months of teasing, through video releases and animated promos on Instagram.

“I can’t draw, sketch or create anything from scratch. This was more of photo manipulating from existing templates,” says Samuel. He clearly has a set vision for each song, and manages to convey it with a playfully aesthetic quirk. The teaser promo for the disillusioned and disgruntled ‘All along’, for instance, features a foreground of a tropical (as the summery-pink sky suggests) apartment building with palm trees and a basketball hoop. Seemingly urbane additions add the quirk: balloons rise up from behind the building, dragging up lyrics with them. So do aeroplane banners. Another aeroplane takes flight vertically from the ground, pulling up with it what first looks like a dark mountain, but eventually turns out to be a rip in the pink sky that reveals the starry universe beyond. Intriguing and engaging, almost more than the song itself.

Stay by BIGSAM is available on Spotify, Apple Music, Play Store, Saavn and other music streaming apps.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ieb40w/article31143702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/StayOriginal,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/chennai-indie-band-big-sam-ep-stay-is-full-of-love-songs/article31143703.ece

The people, who were reported to have tested positive for the COVID-19 on Sunday, had already placed themselves under quarantine after they reached Kochi from U.K. and Dubai.

While the 21-year-old woman had reached Kochi from U.K. via Dubai and Chennai on March 18 in the 6E 298 flight, the 61-year-old man had reached Kochi on March 16 in the Dubai-Kochi flight AI 934.

Both had been at home without being in contact with other family members, according to the details gathered from the family. They had been wearing masks while communicating with the patients. However, the health team is trying to get more details about their contact with other family members.

As a preventive strategy, all the family members of the patients have been asked to remain quarantined.

In the meanwhile, the Health Department had traced all the passengers of the flight EK 532 that had arrived on March 18 and 20 and the EK 530 flight on March 20 as they had travelled with the COVID-19 positive patients, who are Kannur and Kasaragod residents, under treatment at the MCH, Ernakulam.

They have been asked to remain under quarantine and the information was passed on to the respective district authorities.

The district control room for COVID-19 on Sunday night received 248 calls, of which 144 were from the general public.

337,2020/03/23,Kochi comes to a standstill as people choose to stay home,"Deserted roads, empty markets, railway and bus stations mark Janata Curfew

Railway and bus stations, markets, shops and business establishments, churches, and other places of worship in the city remained shut on Sunday during a nation-wide Janata Curfew to fight the spread of COVID-19.

Churches were prominently empty as priests celebrated Mass without the usual Sunday gathering. Cardinal George Alencherry, head of the Syro-Malabar Church, celebrated Mass at Mount St. Thomas, while the two basilicas — St. Mary’s and St. Francis Assisi — remained shut to the faithful as Mass was celebrated.

In the early hours of Sunday, the Ernakulam South railway station was deserted but for the presence of police personnel, all of them in masks.

Only a couple of passengers were seen alighting from a train that arrived from the pilgrim town of Velankanni in Tamil Nadu. There were no modes of public transport in view.

Kakkanad, a busy suburb of Kochi, usually humming with activities even on Sundays and where the administrative headquarters is situated, was almost deserted. Vehicles stayed off the road.

However, a press release from the Public Relations Department said the COVID-19 control room operating out of the district collectorate worked as usual, with the staff being safely transported to the facility.

The usual Sunday market for organic vegetables, a notable affair in Kakkanad, remained shut, so did the market that opens on Sundays for affordable cloths and footwear. Fuel pumps remained open across the district. Indian Oil Corporation had informed that all the three public sector oil marketing companies would keep their outlets open but had advised customers to engage in regular filling of fuels.

All other services, including emergency services, will be shifted to other government hospitals in the district. Similarly, all inpatients at the medical college will be shifted to the District General Hospital, Aluva District Hospital, and Indira Gandhi Co-operative Hospital, Kadavanthra.

340,2020/03/23,Health team prepared to meet any eventuality,"More positive cases likely on Wednesday and Friday: official

Health officials in the district are geared up to handle any eventuality caused by COVID-19 spread.

While the officials believe it is good news that there were no native cases till Saturday, they are anxious about the coming week. Though the two positive cases reported on Sunday were the first native ones, they were confirmed during home quarantine.

Meanwhile, a senior official overseeing hospital-based activities said more COVID-19 positive cases were likely to come up on Wednesday and Friday.

The Health authorities have readied over 1,800 isolation beds in public and private healthcare facilities as well as college hostels anticipating a spurt in cases.

Surveillance has been strengthened at the grassroots level. A list of those who have returned from abroad have been prepared at the ward level, a senior district official said, adding that it would help the authorities foresee the possibility of a community spread. So far, there has been no indication of community spread as only direct and indirect contacts of COVID-19 positive cases have been found.

However, the coming week will be crucial, the official added.

On the flip side, the surveillance team, which monitors passengers at the airport, has had its slips too. There were chinks in the system, and people could have exploited them too, a health worker said, adding that only those who had been tested positive for the disease had been identified so far. There could be others with mild symptoms who do not take home quarantine seriously, he said.

According to him, those with mild symptoms could be carriers of the infection, and they could have infected more people, and such cases may come up later.

The latest instance of exploiting loopholes in the system was when two persons who were stamped on their hands for quarantine used public transport from the airport.

“We instruct low-risk people who are sent for home quarantine to hire either a private vehicle or a pre-paid cab from the airport along with precautions like using face masks. If people do not take adequate precautions, they are openly inviting the infection and triggering its spread,” a senior Health official said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kwhjw8/article31138240.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23-KI-RAILWAY-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/health-team-prepared-to-meet-any-eventuality/article31138241.ece
341,2020/03/23,Metro services suspended till March 31,"Kochi metro services will remain suspended till March 31 as part of measures to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) decided to suspend services pursuant to directives from both the State and Central governments, said KMRL managing director Alkesh Kumar Sharma.

The move is aimed at arresting the spread of COVID-19 by ensuring social distancing and encouraging people to stay home for the time being, he added.

The decision to halt services till March 31 is seen as one that will be in sync with the Indian Railways halting all passenger train services till the end of the month.

On Saturday, the metro agency had decided to temporarily reduce the frequency of train services in an attempt to discourage non-essential travel during COVID-19 crisis. Thus, metro trains were to run every 20 minutes (as compared to one every six minutes) from Monday (March 23) to Saturday (March 28) during morning and evening.

The headway was to be reduced to one train every hour from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. KMRL had urged commuters to use the Kochi metro only if it is essential and further exhorted them to maintain safe distance while travelling and to avoid standing in trains while travelling.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/7dkks4/article31138213.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23-KI-KOCHIMETRO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/metro-services-suspended-till-march-31/article31138214.ece
342,2020/03/23,Workers on the field left to fend for themselves,"Despite pandemic fears, food delivery boys, sanitation workers still remain on the job

Even as sections of the city’s workforce have decided to work from home or take a few days off over fears of a COVID-19 spread, food delivery service executives and sanitation workers, among several others, remain on the job.

The city’s sanitation workers are anxious but cannot abandon the job. “It would be best if we got a few days off, but that would leave residents wondering what to do with the waste. I have been getting calls from other workers in the area telling me that they are scared for themselves and their families,” said Saradha Mani, who collects waste from the Edappally area.

“People in shops and hotels have also been treating us differently and are asking us to stay away when they know we collect waste,” she said. The workers who collect waste from houses, shops, and other establishments at Edappally have not received any protective gear, but some residents have helped out with sanitisers and masks, she added.

“It gets particularly difficult when some households don’t segregate waste, and we are required to sift through it,” said Rajamma, who collects waste from Division 52 of the corporation. The workers have received gloves, and they cover nose and mouth with towels, she added.

Joshi P.G., who works on a truck that collects wet waste from Vyttila and surrounding areas, is worried if a single cake of soap and a towel the workers received a few days ago would protect them from infection.

“The corporation is still in the process of distributing towels, soaps, and gloves to workers,” said V.P. Chandran, member of the health standing committee.

Meanwhile, food delivery service partners are still on the job. “Though we were expecting a rise in the number of orders with people spending time at home, demand has dipped,” said a part-time Swiggy delivery partner, who did not want to be named. He had taken up the job to deal with a difficult financial situation. “Most of us are very conscious that it is a service that will be difficult to stop. I have personally tried to reduce the number of orders I accept per day to avoid contact,” he said. Their office has provided delivery partners with masks.

Both Swiggy and Zomato offer an option wherein customers can ask delivery partners to leave the order outside the door to eliminate contact. A statement on Swiggy’s website says that masks were being distributed to delivery partners, besides reminding them about washing hands and identifying symptoms of the infection. Free on call medical consultation will be provided, and all medical expenses will be covered by medical insurance. The company will also support partners financially if they are required to self-quarantine on noticing any symptoms.

“Business is slow, particularly after the bird flu scare. But most of us continue to take up orders we get,” said another delivery partner who worked for a brief period on Sunday before delivery services were halted to observe the Janata Curfew.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/lermbf/article31138174.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23-KI-FOOD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/workers-on-the-field-left-to-fend-for-themselves/article31138175.ece

The Health Department team screened 148 passengers and 101 crew members of three ships that reached the port here on Saturday. No one was found to have any flu symptoms.

Six members of the crew, including a person from Kerala, were taken to the Karuvelipady taluk hospital, from where their swabs were taken. They were placed in quarantine at the Government Ayurveda Hospital, Thripunithura, where isolation beds have been arranged as part of COVID-19 preparedness. They will be under observation for 14 days. Two others had already been admitted to the Ayurveda Hospital, which has been turned into a COVID-19 care centre.

Airport

At the airport, 2,043 passengers from 13 international flights that arrived between Saturday night and Sunday morning were screened. Of them, 46 were sent to the Government Medical College Hospital, Ernakulam, for better examination.

As many as 2,623 passengers from 23 domestic flights were also screened. Of them, 229 were instructed to be in home quarantine.

There were 216 people who returned from high-risk countries. All of them were made to sign an affidavit that they would remain in quarantine. Seventeen passengers were shifted to the medical college hospital for further examination.

There are 46 squads for screening passengers at the airport. The arrival section of the international terminal has 29 squads.There are also seven squads at railway stations in the district.

As part of the ‘Janata Curfew’ on Sunday, healthcare workers and voluntary health activists did not undertake home visits in 1,833 wards in the district.

The district has 72 COVID-19 care centres, including hospitals, students' hostels and hotel rooms. As many as 1,801 rooms are available for isolating suspected patients.

344,2020/03/23,Lawyers to abstain from courts,"It is in view of health risks posed by COVID-19

The nearly 4,000 lawyers of the Ernakulam Bar Association have decided to abstain from courts from Tuesday considering the health risks posed by COVID-19.

The decision was taken by the Ernakulam Bar Association on Sunday. The office of the association and the canteen will also remain closed from Tuesday. The association has also requested its members to close down their offices to prevent the public from coming into contact with them.

Though the health risks involved in courts functioning and lawyers appearing were highlighted, the State government or the Bar Council of Kerala did not pay attention to them. The decision to abstain from court is also an act of protest against the attitude of the authorities, said P.T. Jose, president of the association.

On the possibility of courts passing ex-parte orders in the absence of lawyers, Mr. Jose hoped that the judiciary would adopt a lenient view towards lawyers and litigants considering the extraordinary situation prevailing in the State.

Both were under home quarantine. Their body fluid samples were sent for testing three days ago after they started showing symptoms. Both have been shifted to the isolation ward at the Government Medical College.

Since the two were under home quarantine, their contacts were limited. The Health team will speak to the patients’ relatives to find out if they had a history of contact with others while in quarantine. Their co-passengers will also be tracked, especially those who had occupied seats near them.

347,2020/03/23,When Kozhikode went into lockdown mode,"All modes of public transport suspended; Mass in churches cancelled

The fear was palpable in the air and there was silence all around. This was the picture of Kozhikode city on Sunday, the day of the ‘Janata Curfew’ called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Kozhikode shut down in a manner that would put to shame all the hartals that have ever been observed here. Even Nainamvalappu, a small fishing village in the city known for its football frenzy and more for its resistance to hartals for decades, shut down completely on Sunday.

With newspaper and milk distribution completed by 7 a.m., not many people ventured out of their homes. Except for a handful of two-wheeler riders and police patrol vehicles, the roads were rather empty throughout the day. The police were seen interrupting riders to ensure that their reasons to be outside their homes were valid enough. Besides health workers and mediapersons on duty, security personnel guarding shops, ATM counters and malls were the only ones out in the open.

Sunday masses in all churches, including the Mother of God Church, St.Joseph’s Church, Infant Jesus Church, CSI Cathedral and Holy Redeemer Church, were cancelled and services were carried out by a lone priest in the absence of believers.

Shops and establishments remained closed as merchant bodies took the decision to do so. There were no voices of dissent, unlike on hartal days.

With buses and all other modes of public transport suspended, some people were stranded at the railway station. Most of them were migrant labourers who had returned to the city after their Holi break.

The public who responded well to appeals to remain at home, however, came out of their houses at 5 p.m. to applaud the selfless service of healthcare professionals. While some just clapped their hands, many were seen clanging plates or ringing metal bells at a mark of appreciation.

Risky behaviour

A disturbing picture during Sunday's Janata Curfew was that of people defying the safety measures advised by the Department of Health, for securing drinking water and food, as they were distributed by voluntary organisations at Palayam junction and Railway station respectively. With all the shops closed, street dwellers were left in the lurch. Even at mid-day when the heat was unbearable, they had no access to drinking water. Besides, patients and their bystanders were also left to fight their hunger as the canteens in government hospitals closed down.

They crowded around the vehicles carrying food and water, which was quite risky at a time when the norm is to keep a distance of 1 metre from the next person, to ward off the spread of the virus.

Also seen were bikers carrying pillion riders, another unhealthy practice.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/5r9egm/article31140845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22KI-CURFEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/when-kozhikode-went-into-lockdown-mode/article31140853.ece
348,2020/03/23,"COVID-19 | In Kerala, livelihood at stake for many migrants","A period of uncertainty for the migrant workforce

Uper wale par bharosa hai, Anas, a native of Uttar Pradesh’s Sarangpur village, sums up his feeling of uncertainty. He is one among hundreds of migrant workers who are concerned about their livelihood following the COVID-19 outbreak.

Going home too is a concern for them as many in their villages are apprehensive about their return from a State affected by the pandemic.

Following the State government’s social-distancing instructions to contain the spread of coronavirus infection is a tough task for them as most migrant workers stay in congested rooms or crowded labour camps. Beaches and other public places frequented by migrant labourers to unwind are now shut. Many find solace in watching movies in their mobile phones.

Challenging situation

“Many of our friends in the construction sector are now staying indoors. Several trains have already been cancelled following COVID-19 alert making the return journey a challenge,” says Anas, who has been here for more than four years. He feels that many under-educated migrant workers have not realised the gravity of the situation and adopted appropriate precautionary measures.

The closure of many large-scale construction projects subsequent to the precautions against COVID-19 in Kozhikode district has dragged several migrant labourers into an unexpected financial crisis. Only those working in hotels and salons have managed to retain their jobs.

Migrant labourers in city salons say the COVID-19 scare and hoax messages associated with the contagion are forcing many customers to keep away. Though the number of customers is on the decline, the owners are yet to think of a total closure as it may prompt us to go home, they say.

“For migrant labourers in Kozhikode, COVID-19 comes as the second biggest challenge after Nipah. Many of those who went back during the Nipah outbreak are yet to be back ,” says Muraleedharan Chaliyil, a contractor in the construction sector. He fears that the latest situation is likely to create labour shortage and stall the construction sector in the days to come.

Awareness campaign

Meanwhile, Labour Department officials say they are busy sensitising migrant labourers to the latest health challenges and the precautionary measures to be taken for their safety. “We have constituted district-level teams comprising Hindi teachers to visit the labour camps and help them manage the situation,” says District Labour Officer (Enforcement) K.

RAMANATHAPURAMAfter a suspected fatal road accident case was altered as a murder case, the relatives of the deceased person agreed to take the body from the government hospital here on Monday.

Police said that on Saturday, a 22-year-old youth identified as Aravindan, son of Vairavakesu of North Street in Devipattinam in the district, was declared as dead in a road accident, the police registered a case under the relevant sections.

Preliminary inquiries revealed that Aravindan had been to Ramanathapuram with his friend identified as Kalyankumar, 23. On return, a speeding car collided with the two-wheeler in which Aravindan suffered head injury and subsequently died at the Government Hospital.

When the family members suspected the hand of a gang behind the incident, they made a representation to the Superintendent of Police Varun Kumar. The Pudiya Tamilagam and CPI functionaries also appealed to the police to probe.

Based on a complaint, when police probed, it indicated that a sand mining gang had allegedly been behind the death of Aravindan, son of a building contractor. It is said that a gang, which had been arrested recently, was under the impression that Aravindan had informed the police after which they were arrested.

To take revenge, the gang had closely followed him on Saturday and while he was on the two-wheeler, the gang hit him to death thus settling scores.

Sources in the railways said three of the 32 north Indian workers engaged in the project at Kadambur were screened by health officials on Monday. They were taken to TVMCH for preliminary screening. While three, who were suffering from fever, were admitted to Level 1 ward, others were allowed to go.

“However, all 29 persons who were allowed to return to the workplace have been quarantined in their makeshift stay shed near Kadambur railway station. They are being monitored,” the sources said.

Similarly, 82 north Indian workers based at Vaanchi Maniyaachi junction were screened and found to be healthy.

However, railway officials felt that the Station Master of Kadambur and signal, telecommunication, traction distribution and engineering staff, who worked in close proximity with the workers, should also be screened.

“Though our personnel do not have any health issues as of now, they should have been screened for possible infection since the labourers are working in their midst,” the officials felt.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/3-north-indian-workers-admitted-to-tvmch/article31144591.ece
359,2020/03/23,"287 quarantined in Tirunelveli, Tenkasi","Foreign returnees should report immediately to officials, says Collector

Foreign returnees numbering 158 in Tirunelveli district and 129 in Tenkasi district have been house quarantined and they are being monitored by doctors attached to the Department of Public Health.

Meanwhile, Collectors of the two districts have urged returnees within the last 30 days to report to block development officers or primary health centres (PHCs) for medical assistance for ailment, if any, to check possible community transmission of COVID-19.

Speaking to reporters here on Monday, Tirunelveli Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish said a returnee, who arrived from Abu Dhabi via Dubai and tested positive for COVID-19, was undergoing treatment in Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital (TVMCH), where a three-tier arrangement had been created.

Three-tier testing

Persons with fever, cold and cough would be examined in the first step. Those manifesting symptoms would be taken along with persons who were in touch with them to the next level of treatment — monitoring with medication. On confirmation of COVID-19, the ‘positive’ cases would be shifted to treatment ward, where all facilities, including ventilators, had been put in place.

Although 12 persons tested negative, a youth from Samooharengapuram in Tirunelveli district, who returned from Abu Dhabi via Dubai, tested positive for the virus. He was undergoing treatment and was “stable”, she said.

“Hence, my appeal to those who have returned to the district from foreign countries is that they should inform either the officials of local administration or the nearest primary health centre about their presence here so that it will be easy for the administration to screen them medically and provide them with appropriate line of treatment if required,” the Collector said. “As of now, 158 persons in Tirunelveli district and 129 in Tenkasi district have been quarantined in their houses on returning from foreign destinations.”

Disinfectant was being sprayed in TVMCH, PHCs and in places frequented by the public everyday. While a 400-bed separate block in TVMCH was ready, private hospitals in Valliyoor, Ambasamudram and Cheranmahadevi areas had been asked to ready 25% of their beds in a separate block with exclusive entry and exits.

Meanwhile, new restrictions were imposed in TVMCH and its multi-specialty block opposite the TVMC men’s hostel for entry of patients. After patients with fever were checked with thermal scanners, they and an attendant were allowed inside after their hands were sanitised in the presence of policemen.

Though the Janata curfew ended at 5 a.m. on Monday, Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai sported a deserted look.

361,2020/03/23,"Doctors complain of lack of masks, sanitiser","Medical officers, paramedical staff run high risk of COVID-19 infection

Virudhunagar

Doctors from Virudhunagar and Madurai districts have raised concern over non-availability of masks, gloves and sanitisers at government hospitals.

Stating that the doctors have been treating patients with fever and cold ever since the fear of COVID-19 broke out two weeks back, the doctors say the minimum protection for any doctor or paramedical staff is mask and sanitiser.

“But, in most of the hospitals, especially in Primary Health Centres, the masks are not available,” said a doctor from a PHC.

The Government has been advocating the people not to touch surfaces and identified touch points as the Corona virus could spread through the droplets from infected patients when they sneeze or cough.

“In that case, when doctors and paramedical staff need to go closer to the patients and touch them, we need to have masks and gloves,” the doctor said.

Recalling that over 50 doctors and paramedical staff were involved in two days of intensive screening of international passengers who flew down to Madurai airport before they were taken to quarantine, he said the doctors were provided only surgical mask.

“Only the Collector was given a N95 mask since it is not available,” he said.

In Virudhunagar district, a doctor said that despite the issue having been raised, the masks were not made available to the government hospitals and PHCs.

“If the doctors are going to fall sick, the entire effort of preventing spreading of COVID-19 will fail,” the medical officer said.

Doctors said that surgical masks can last only for two to six hours. “If it gets wet, it could become useless. During examination of patients, we need to talk to them and the masks get wet,” he complained.

Besides, the doctors claimed that sanitisers were not made available in the hospitals.

Collector R. Kannan said that masks were already distributed to the hospitals and PHCs. “We have got triple-layered masks stitched at local units in Chatrapatti. A total of 3,000 masks have already arrived and another 10,000 should reach us in two days,” he said.

A doctor said that personal protection equipment (PPE) was indispensable when isolation wards are activated with COVID-19 positive cases.

“We need to have double protection all over the body. Hands should have double gloves and eyes with googles. “A protective shield is a must to cover the portion between neck and shoulder which is available with PPE. We need at least five PPEs a day at every isolation ward,” he said.

The Collector said that 100 PPEs were available with the district administration. “We are told that more supply is on the way,” he added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/doctors-complain-of-lack-of-masks-sanitiser/article31144153.ece

363,2020/03/23,Steady crowd at Madurai’s Amma Unavagams amidst the Janata curfew,"Amma Unavagams come to the rescue of the hungry

On Sunday morning, M. Maimoon from Kovilpatti was wandering around Madurai railway junction with her luggage in search of food as restaurants were closed on account of Janata curfew. However, her disappointment was short-lived. She reached Amma Unavagam near Periyar Bus Stand where hot food was being served.

“Since trains were cancelled as a precautionary measure against the spread of COVID-19, I had no place to stay or have food. A plate of lemon rice served at Amma Unavagam for ₹5 helped to satiate my hunger,” she said.

With the closure of restaurants across the city in view of the curfew announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amma Unavagams came to the rescue to feed the daily wage earners and migrants who did not have access to home-cooked food.

M. Ramalakshmi, a member of Meenakshi self-help group, said ven pongal costing ₹5 a plate was served for 200 people and by 9.15 a.m. it was sold out. “Usually, we make around 1,200 idlis for breakfast. But we did not expect such a big crowd on a Sunday morning. So we prepared lemon rice for an additional 100 people,” she said. Similar scenarios were witnessed at Arapalayam and K. Pudur.

S. Govindammal, a member of Om Sakthi self-help group working at the K. Pudur centre, said there were a large number of new customers on Sunday. “Since there was confusion regarding the functioning of the centres, we had told our regular customers that we will not function on Sunday. But after it was announced that we will function, many new customers also walked in,” she said.

M. Kathiravan from Theni, who works as a cashier in a shop near Periyar Bus Stand, said it was a stroke of luck for migrant workers like me to see the Amma Unavagam open for business on a curfew day. “It was quite a relief as the place where I used to have food was closed. Barring this one time when I came out for having food, I avoided coming out as I also want to contribute from stop spreading COVID-19,” he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/rmyv3y/article31141050.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23MACITY-AMMAUNAVAGAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/a-place-to-have-ones-fill-on-an-empty-city/article31141051.ece
364,2020/03/23,"Madurai ready to face emergency situation, say officials","Bus stands and railway stations are being fumigated twice a day

There has been a rise in COVID-19 positive cases across the country and in Tamil Nadu too. Though no COVID-19 positive case has been recorded in Madurai so far, are we ready to handle an emergency? Officials say yes, but there are few areas of concern.

There is a lack of testing facility in Madurai. The nearby centre is Government Medical College and Hospital in Theni, 70 km away. But Government Rajaji Hospital Dean J. Sangumani says the hospital is equipped to handle an emergency. There are 18 beds in isolation wards in the new and old blocks. There is screening facility too.

The newly constructed hostel on Madurai Medical College premises can be converted to accommodate more isolation wards with 140 beds. The Government Hospitals in Austinpatti and Thoppur are also being prepared - all in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines. An action plan has been drawn with health officials, he says.

Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan says steps have been taken to create awareness among the public. One round of meeting with Hotel Owners’ Association, trade associations and resident welfare associations were held. More have been planned, he says.

‘Postpone functions’

Collector T.G. Vinay says people are being urged to postpone social functions to avoid mass gathering. Local bodies, right from panchayat level, are being prepared to handle the situation. With concerns being raised over the homeless, they are being identified and shifted to old age homes.

Recently over 200 passengers arrived by air from Dubai. They were screened and those without symptoms and able were allowed to quarantine themselves at home for 24 days.

They were stamped with indelible ink on forearm to identify them as travellers from abroad.

177 ventilators in GRH

Hospitals in the city were inspected and they are equipped to handle the situation. There are 177 ventilators in GRH. However, with Madurai being the gateway to the South, a request has been placed for a testing facility here, the Collector adds.

Assistant City Health Officer S. Vinothraja says important public places like bus stands and railway stations are being fumigated twice a day. Conservancy workers use protective gear while cleaning. “We have adopted the Information, Education and Communication (IEC) model to create awareness among the public and workers. Pamphlets on dos and dont’s are being distributed to households, and banners displaying the message have been placed in prominent locations, he says.

High Court Bench, government offices, airport, railway stations, bus stands and bus stops and other offices are being fumigated regularly.

A common advice given to people is to remain indoors and not gather en masse. The people have been advised to wash their hands regularly, maintain hygiene and keep social distancing. To avoid mass gathering, tourist spots, shopping malls, religious places and other key establishments have been closed.

Onus is on people

People on their part also have taken an initiative to follow the instructions. K.P. Samuel, a retired teacher, says the instructions must be taken seriously.“It is safe to remain indoors and not venture out unless it is important. My family has stocked groceries, medicines and other essentials for the next couple of weeks. We usually gather for Sunday prayers. Now we pray at home,” he says.

C. Udaya of Manthikulam says the onus is on the public to take care of themselves. It is better not to travel out of the city in these times. People must follow the guidelines properly and change their carefree attitude, she says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/h5hx8f/article31141017.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23MACITY-RAILWAYSTATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/madurai-is-ready-to-face-an-emergency-situation-say-officials/article31141018.ece
365,2020/03/23,Silent Sunday marks total compliance of Janata Curfew,"All the 19 check posts in the city closely monitored traffic movement

All the streets and major public spots in Madurai wore a deserted look on Sunday as the residents stayed indoors, in response to the call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to observe Janata Curfew to curb the spread of COVID-19.

Some of the passengers, who arrived in MGR Bus Stand and Omni Bus Stand in the morning, were stranded as no public transport was available. Some of them were seen negotiating with autorickshaw drivers for distant places such as Sivakasi.

All major bus stands in the city – Mattuthavani, Arapalayam and Periyar Bus Stand – remained empty throughout the day. All arterial roads and crowded places like Vilakkuthoon, Teppakulam, Kalavasal junction and Goripalayam junction were free of vehicular and pedestrian movement.

Only traffic police constables were seen at many places. A police officer said all the 19 check posts in the city closely monitored traffic movement and people were discouraged from coming in or going out. “We advised them not to take up long distance travel as they would not get food or any usual help on the way,” the officer said.

Collector T.G. Vinay commended the residents for cooperating and staying indoors. “It is laudable that almost all the business establishments remained closed throughout the day. This curfew was important to curtail the community spread of COVID- 19 and will help to ‘flatten the curve’ in terms of the number of new COVID-19 positive cases. The social distancing is important to prevent the spread of infection from a primary source to other people,” he said.

Though around 80 homeless were rescued and rehabilitated by the district administration officials on Saturday, a large number of homeless people were still found across the city on Sunday. A few volunteers were also seen distributing food packets to them.

At 5 p.m. many residents clapped their hands to appreciate the selfless work of medical professionals and officials in other government bodies who are working selflessly in this fight against COVID-19. Police vehicles parked at different spots sounded their sirens at 5 p.m. as a mark of gratitude to the working medical professionals.

The total compliance to the curfew indicates that people are understanding the gravity of the situation, said V.P. Manikandan of Ellis Nagar. “If the government announces shutdown of services in Madurai in future, the residents will understand and oblige,” he said.

He also added that there was no hindrance in availing essential services as all hospitals, pharmacies and other essential facilities remained open throughout the day.

The Virudhunagar district administration plans to shore up its anti-COVID-19 measures by converting the hostels of 28 educational institutions into isolation ward facility.

Although isolation wards have been kept ready in all 11 government hospitals, the hostel rooms, where beds are already available, are being considered as a precautionary measure. Cleaning and fumigation work will start on Monday, Collector R. Kannan said on Sunday.

“We have not come across any positive case in the district. This is only a precautionary measure. Even if the hostels are not going to be used for admitting any suspected cases, it will be good for students when they return to colleges,” the Collector pointed out.

With medical officers working day and night, the district administration has now realised the importance of giving them good rest. “We also want to keep in reserve a good number of doctors, who could be useful in most needy hours. Hence, 25% of the 200 doctors will be given a week off,” he added.

Similarly, the students of four nursing colleges will be given basic training to attend emergency situation. They will also be trained to take all precautionary measures to deal with suspected COVID-19 cases. Around 480 students could be used for emergency situations.

The district administration has placed orders for 500 sprayers that will be distributed in rural areas for fumigation.

377,2020/03/23,HDFC Bank’s Aditya Puri calls for rate cut,"The MD also seeks relaxation in asset classification in view of COVID-19

Aditya Puri, the managing director of HDFC Bank, has called for interest rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of India, apart from a relaxation in asset classification for bad loan recognition, to fight the economic losses caused due to the spread of COVID-19.

In a teleconference with the media, the chief of the largest private sector lender also allayed concerns over asset quality, particularly of the unsecured portfolio, raised by some analysts, saying most of the lending was to highly-rated entities.

“Asset classification, in my view they [RBI] don’t have a choice. Again on fiscal stimulus, they don’t have a choice,” Mr. Puri said.

Banks have to classify a loan as sub-standard if repayment is due for more than 90 days and there is a demand from the industry to extend the default date to 180 days.

“Total unsecured portfolio is 16%, 6% is cards and 10% is personal loan. 75% of personal loan is to top-tier clients. So, there is no reason to be worried,” Mr. Puri said.

On the small and medium enterprises portfolio, he said 80% of the bank’s exposure was covered by additional securities.

‘Granular portfolio’

“NPA here is in the 2% range, maximum. It is a granular portfolio where we have 85% self-funding, which means 85% of the people we have lent to are self-funded. It comes across reasonably tough credit standards,” he said.

He said the bank had recently tightened internal norms for credit appraisal.

“You have to look at the cash flow, you have to see if certain people have the ability to bear the strain. That we have [done] a month-and-a-half ago. Our existing portfolio is showing no strain. Rejections rates are higher [after norms were tightened],” he said.

He also said the bank had an excess liquidity of $5 billion which was benefiting the bank as it was deployed in government securities where yields were softening.

He also said about 40% of the bank staff were isolated due to the spread of COVID-19, including the senior management.

With Mr. Puri retiring from the bank in October this year, the bank has started to look for his successor and has appointed a search committee.

The rupee opened weaker at 75.69 against the dollar, compared with its previous close of 75.20. The rupee hit the day’s low of 76.33 before closing the day at 76.20 a dollar, down 100 paisa, or 1.33%, from its previous close.

383,2020/03/23,How to handle a pandemic,"The Kerala government has been successful in putting the public health sector back on the rails

Every year after the Union Budget, newspapers carry articles critiquing the abysmal allocation for the health sector. As the COVID-19 threat looms, doctors, healthcare professionals and state institutions have been regularly issuing guidelines on the precautions to be taken. However, the ubiquitous fault lines of India’s public healthcare infrastructure are being laid bare as we combat our latest adversary. In his book, Everybody Loves a Good Drought, veteran journalist P. Sainath poignantly details what it looks like to be a poor family that relies on government hospitals. He remarks how the 1994 plague in India got unprecedented media attention because unlike several other diseases, it couldn’t be restricted to rural areas and urban slums. The disease-causing bacteria had the audacity to enter elite spaces; in Sainath’s words, “Worse still, they (the bacteria) can board aircraft and fly club class to New York. Too many of the beautiful people felt threatened.” COVID-19, although a lot less dangerous than the plague, was brought to India by infected passengers flying in from affected nations. This argument is not to suggest that either of these diseases are to be taken lightly, but rather to shed light on how India responds differently to health requirements based on the social and class locations of those affected.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

The advent of COVID-19 has led to a peculiar scenario wherein those who can otherwise afford private healthcare are now relying on government facilities to be quarantined and tested. It took a pandemic like COVID-19 for some to realise what most of India has been dealing with for decades. A case in point is the Agra woman who was falsely reported to have fled quarantine. In reality, she reportedly resisted the option of being isolated at a public health facility because “the sight of the unhygienic toilets made her retch”. This is an apt representation of the consequences of meagre health spending and lack of motivation from state institutions to strengthen public healthcare infrastructure. With a system that cannot even ensure fully functional toilets in public health centres, the COVID-19 challenge towers over our health administration.

Preparing for an outbreak

Given India’s record on public health, Kerala has been receiving praise for the way it is tackling the emergency. Be it the presence of health infrastructure prerequisites or its experience in handling the Nipah virus, the Kerala government’s preparedness for COVID-19 was relatively stronger than other States. Discussions on how to address it started as early as mid-January. When various countries started confirming cases, Kerala was the first State to draft measures for its containment. The measures became more stringent when the State reported its first case on January 30. Since then, the government has become more vigilant and taken proactive measures to trace people who have had primary and secondary contact with those who tested positive.

The situation became grave after a family that flew down from Italy tested positive for the virus. After vigorous tracing, we found that 719 people had come in contact with the first case. The government then tightened the norms for people returning from other countries. It started taking strict action against all those who were not revealing their travel history. All those who were in primary and secondary contact were tested and kept in isolation or home quarantined. The next step was to cancel big religious ceremonies. The government then gave a list of people under observation. More recently, the government started checking people at different entry points to the State. Healthcare workers are stationed at all check posts on roads to check travellers for the virus before they enter the city. A similar exercise is conducted for those taking trains.

Coronavirus | 80 districts in lockdown to contain virus spread

If we are to learn from China and South Korea, the most efficient way to tackle the situation is to aggressively trace and test potential cases of COVID-19. Experts have said that the only reason South Korea was able to handle the crisis without imposing any lockdown was because of rampant testing. However, in order to follow these best practices, even Kerala, with superior mechanisms for healthcare, faces the challenge of limited resources and labs for testing. In such a situation, it is important to judiciously use available facilities and localise efforts. All of this can be achieved only through clear political will, strong public healthcare services and commitment on the part of people. It is important for citizens to closely follow measures prescribed by the government. An important step towards this is to ensure that people don’t go for testing without solid grounds. If they do, the public health facilities will be overwhelmed.

To ensure that people have access to the dos and don’ts for self-isolation, monitoring symptoms and reporting to health facilities at the right time, the Kerala government has launched a mobile application called GoK Direct. The Disha helpline has also been used for awareness generation. The ‘Break the Chain’ campaign advocates ideas of basic cleanliness and hygiene. This attempt to bring about a behavioural change is gaining traction across the State and is also being picked up by the national media. Such precautionary measures and social distancing by citizens will buy some time and lighten the burden on government functionaries. This buffer period should be leveraged by the State government to strengthen testing facilities so that we reach a point where a maximum number of symptomatic individuals can be tested. In this context, based on the State government’s request, the Indian Council of Medical Research has sanctioned 10 testing centres in Kerala. The government is also planning to facilitate the setting up of more testing centres with the help of the private sector for meeting the required capacity.

Lessons from and for Kerala

That Kerala came up with a set of guidelines before the COVID-19 outbreak was possible because of its history of unswerving governmental support for public health. The administration has been serving as a catalyst for the development of health services. This is reflected in the expansion of health infrastructure — for example, setting up the National Institute of Virology’s unit in Alappuzha soon after the Nipah incident.

Janata Curfew | Narendra Modi thanks people for staying indoors, says battle not over

The epidemiological status of the State is currently characterised by the burden of both non-communicable diseases and increased incidence of communicable diseases in recent times. The monitoring system created by the government in public health infrastructure has been highly successful. It has helped healthcare officials to detect and combat diseases quickly. The healthcare system in Kerala is decentralised to achieve the potential gains of improvement in service delivery and access. Consequently, in the context of COVID-19, the State has been successful in tracing individual cases and implementing measures like the ‘Break the Chain’ campaign successfully.

Efforts are being made to provide infrastructure and quality services through the ‘Aardram Mission’, which focuses on developing primary health centres into family health centres. The government has been successful in putting the public health sector back on the rails.

384,2020/03/23,Not an unfettered right,"Sovereignty is subject to constraints

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet,filed an application seeking to intervene as amicus curiae in the pending litigation in the Supreme Court against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. That the case has attracted the attention of the international human rights agency is a matter of concern for the Indian government. On the other hand, the intervention may enable the Supreme Court to read in public international law principles in determining the constitutionality of CAA. Ultimately, this would assist in laying down the law on concepts of sovereignty in addition to determining the obligations of a nation-state to the international community at large.

A precedent?

The application is based on the belief that the High Commissioner’s intervention will provide the Court “with an overview of the international human rights norms and standards with respect to the state’s obligations to provide international protection to persons at risk of persecution in their countries of origin”. This application stands out for a number of reasons. First, this is a voluntary application rather than at the invitation of the Supreme Court. Second, she accepts that India is a state party and signatory to various international conventions including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Culture Rights which contain important non-discrimination clauses, including on the ground of religion. India is obliged, under international law, to ensure that migrants in its territory or under its jurisdiction receive equal and non-discriminatory treatment regardless of their legal status or the documentations they possess.

In response, the External Affairs Ministry argued that “no foreign party has any locus standi on issues pertaining to India’s sovereignty”. The High Commissioner has filed similar amicus curiae briefs on issues of pubic importance before a range of international and national judicial fora. However, this intervention, if permitted, would serve as a precedent for a number of future applications. It would also provide an opportunity for the Supreme Court to lay down the law on whether such applications interfere with national sovereignty.

Sovereignty as responsibility

International Court of Justice judge James Crawford defines sovereignty as, among other things, the “capacity to exercise, to the exclusion of other states, state functions on or related to that territory, and includes the capacity to make binding commitments under international law” and states that “such sovereignty is exercisable by the governmental institutions established within the state”. The Preamble to the Constitution lays out the position, wherein the people of India have resolved to constitute Indian Republic into a sovereign and not just any one authority. As such, the courts (judiciary), the government (executive) and elected legislatures (legislature) are equally sovereign authorities. No one can claim exclusivity over sovereignty. Furthermore, Article 51 (c) of the Constitution directs the state to “foster respect for international law”.

According to the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, “national political authorities are responsible to the citizens internally and to the international community through the UN”. Therefore, it is trite to say that an authority’s right to sovereignty is not unfettered. It is subject to constraints including the responsibility to protect its citizenry and the larger international community. Furthermore, Article 14 extends the right to equality to all persons, which is wider than the definition of citizens. Even illegal immigrants shall, consequently, be treated by the government in a manner that ensures equal protection of Indian laws. It is hoped that the Supreme Court will conclude that the intervention is necessary as the Court would benefit from the High Commissioner’s expertise in public international law principles.

385,2020/03/23,Picking up the quantum technology baton,"With the Budget announcement providing direction, the stakeholders need to roll-out the national mission quickly

In the Budget 2020 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman made a welcome announcement for Indian science — over the next five years she proposed spending ₹8,000 crore (~ $1.2 billion) on a National Mission on Quantum Technologies and Applications. This promises to catapult India into the midst of the second quantum revolution, a major scientific effort that is being pursued by the United States, Europe, China and others. In this article we describe the scientific seeds of this mission, the promise of quantum technology and some critical constraints on its success that can be lifted with some imagination on the part of Indian scientific institutions and, crucially, some strategic support from Indian industry and philanthropy.

A timeline

Quantum mechanics was developed in the early 20th century to describe nature in the small — at the scale of atoms and elementary particles. For over a century it has provided the foundations of our understanding of the physical world, including the interaction of light and matter, and led to ubiquitous inventions such as lasers and semiconductor transistors. Despite a century of research, the quantum world still remains mysterious and far removed from our experiences based on everyday life. A second revolution is currently under way with the goal of putting our growing understanding of these mysteries to use by actually controlling nature and harnessing the benefits of the weird and wondrous properties of quantum mechanics. One of the most striking of these is the tremendous computing power of quantum computers, whose actual experimental realisation is one of the great challenges of our times. The announcement by Google, in October 2019, where they claimed to have demonstrated the so-called “quantum supremacy”, is one of the first steps towards this goal.

Promising future

Besides computing, exploring the quantum world promises other dramatic applications including the creation of novel materials, enhanced metrology, secure communication, to name just a few. Some of these are already around the corner. For example, China recently demonstrated secure quantum communication links between terrestrial stations and satellites. And computer scientists are working towards deploying schemes for post-quantum cryptography — clever schemes by which existing computers can keep communication secure even against quantum computers of the future. Beyond these applications, some of the deepest foundational questions in physics and computer science are being driven by quantum information science. This includes subjects such as quantum gravity and black holes.

Pursuing these challenges will require an unprecedented collaboration between physicists (both experimentalists and theorists), computer scientists, material scientists and engineers. On the experimental front, the challenge lies in harnessing the weird and wonderful properties of quantum superposition and entanglement in a highly controlled manner by building a system composed of carefully designed building blocks called quantum bits or qubits. These qubits tend to be very fragile and lose their “quantumness” if not controlled properly, and a careful choice of materials, design and engineering is required to get them to work. On the theoretical front lies the challenge of creating the algorithms and applications for quantum computers. These projects will also place new demands on classical control hardware as well as software platforms.

Where India stands

Globally, research in this area is about two decades old, but in India, serious experimental work has been under way for only about five years, and in a handful of locations. What are the constraints on Indian progress in this field? So far we have been plagued by a lack of sufficient resources, high quality manpower, timeliness and flexibility. The new announcement in the Budget would greatly help fix the resource problem but high quality manpower is in global demand. In a fast moving field like this, timeliness is everything — delayed funding by even one year is an enormous hit.

A previous programme called Quantum Enabled Science and Technology has just been fully rolled out, more than two years after the call for proposals. Nevertheless, one has to laud the government’s announcement of this new mission on a massive scale and on a par with similar programmes announced recently by the United States and Europe. This is indeed unprecedented, and for the most part it is now up to the government, its partner institutions and the scientific community to work out details of the mission and roll it out quickly.

But there are some limits that come from how the government must do business with public funds. Here, private funding, both via industry and philanthropy, can play an outsized role even with much smaller amounts. For example, unrestricted funds that can be used to attract and retain high quality manpower and to build international networks — all at short notice — can and will make an enormous difference to the success of this enterprise. This is the most effective way (as China and Singapore discovered) to catch up scientifically with the international community, while quickly creating a vibrant intellectual environment to help attract top researchers.

Further, connections with Indian industry from the start would also help quantum technologies become commercialised successfully, allowing Indian industry to benefit from the quantum revolution. We must encourage industrial houses and strategic philanthropists to take an interest and reach out to Indian institutions with an existing presence in this emerging field. As two of us can personally attest, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), home to India’s first superconducting quantum computing lab, would be delighted to engage.

386,2020/03/23,Stealing a mandate: On Madhya Pradesh crisis,"BJP played by the book, but a new govt. will lack moral legitimacy without winning bypolls

The impending change of guard in Madhya Pradesh is on the back of a disgraceful betrayal of the popular mandate of 2018 when the Congress defeated the BJP that was in power for three consecutive terms. Jyotiraditya Scindia’s vault from the Congress to its antithesis, the BJP, set the ball rolling for the unravelling of Chief Minister Kamal Nath’s government earlier in March. With the resignation of 22 of its MLAs from the Assembly, the Congress was reduced to a minority, with 92 members. The resignations brought down the halfway mark to 104 and now, the BJP, with 106, can claim a majority as it is doing right now. The BJP legislature party is expected to elect former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan as its leader who is likely to form the new government this week. Mr. Nath tried to salvage his government by buying time to woo back the defectors but the Supreme Court ordered that a floor test be held on Friday. His decision to submit the resignation before forcing a vote in the Assembly was appropriate. Luring back the defectors by dubious means would have been no less dishonourable than the defections. The total strength of the MP Assembly is 230 in which 24 seats are now vacant. Although the BJP is within its rights to stake claim, in the interest of moral and political legitimacy, it could have waited until after by-elections are held to these seats and either of the parties establishes a clear majority.

But a disturbing new mechanism of usurping power that is not won through an election, perfected by the BJP in recent years, has no such restraint. The party engineered the resignations of Congress and JD(S) MLAs and returned to power in Karnataka last year. The BJP took power on the claim of majority in a truncated legislature, and had the advantage of being the ruling party when the by-elections were held. It had used the same strategy earlier and there are indications that it might be tried in some other States too in the coming weeks. This route by-passes the Anti-Defection law but the financial and moral corruption involved in this is only far too evident. While the top court did the right thing by asking for an early floor test in M.P., the larger question the power tussle in the State has thrown up, which is the claim of majority in a legislature that has a considerably large number of seats vacant, remains unresolved. The recurrence of this model across States makes this an unhealthy pattern and a fresh challenge to clean politics. The legal and moral implications of mass resignations of MLAs to upend an electoral verdict need to be examined at the political and judicial levels.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/stealing-a-mandate-the-hindu-editorial-on-madhya-pradesh-political-crisis/article31136885.ece
387,2020/03/23,Prohibitory orders till March 31,"The Bengaluru city police enforced prohibitory orders from Tuesday to March 31 to enforce a strict lockdown. Barring essential services, businesses, private transport and commercial establishments should remain closed, Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao said. Police will take strict action if people step out unnecessarily, he added.

Mr. Rao held a meeting with senior police officers directing them to enforce the lockdown strictly.

Barring grocery shops and hotel kitchens, all business establishments are restricted. The service in hotels is barred while parcel and food home delivery is allowed.

The decision was taken after Sunday evening situation where large number of people were found moving around on the streets.

Essentials services such as shops selling vegetables/fruits, milk, and groceries, and pharmacies will be open. No other shop should be open till further orders, he said.

“We are going to enforce strict action against people who come out on streets unnecessarily. We have a provision under IPC section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and also KP Act 30 (L) to initiate action against them. I hope people understand the situation and cooperate and stay at home”, Mr. Rao said.

Since Sunday as many as 5,000 home quarantine stamping was carried out by special teams to ensure they remain home in public interest. “I have received calls that some of those stamped are moving in BMTC buses and sitting in restaurants. Please call Namma 100 (control room). These people will be picked up, arrested and sent to government quarantine,” he said.

Some hotels were open for delivery on food delivery apps. That apart, some e-commerce delivery personnel were seen making their deliveries.

According to a delivery personnel, it was just another working day for them. “Many apartments have restrictions. We have been instructed to leave packages at the reception. They also ask us to use sanitizers before we touch the packages,” the delivery personnel said.

Online food ordering from the few open restaurants seemed brisk through the day, what with limited options available.

Jagadish, a food delivery personnel working with an aggregator, said, “After getting an alert on the order, we go to hotels and restaurants from where the customer has ordered food. If it is functioning, we collect the order. Else, we send the photo of closed hotel with a selfie. If a hotel is closed, a nominal amount gets credited in our account.”

Packaged food

Several hotels and restaurants were closed on Sunday, as were neighbourhood shops and supermarkets. In anticipation of such a situation, many people seemed to have stocked up on ready-to-eat and packaged food.

“When the curfew was announced, I knew that the cook would not be able to come. I decided to buy some noodles for Sunday,” said a 24-year-old employee of a private company, who has been working from home for the past one week.

389,2020/03/23,COVID-19: Chennai Corporation to embark on a mass disinfection drive from tomorrow,"In addition to the disinfection, the civic body, along with NGOs will supply essential commodities to low income neighbourhoods

Starting Tuesday, Chennai Corporation will carry out disinfection of all streets in the city, to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Chennai Corporation Commissioner G.Prakash held a meeting with private tanker operators to deploy 500 tanker lorries to disinfect all the 33,000 streets and 471 bus route roads.

“We are also monitoring 3,000 houses where persons have been on home quarantine. Officials will identify the houses using coloured stickers. It is not to stigmatise or to discriminate against such residents. It is to help them,” he said.

On the mass disinfection drive, Mr. Prakash said, “The officials will start on Tuesday, covering all streets in the city. This will be the largest drive to disinfect the entire city.” On Tuesday, 500 vehicles will start from all the 15 zonal offices in the city, cleaning footpaths, bus shelters, railings, bollards and street furniture along the roads.

Some of the private tanker lorry owners have been reluctant to send vehicles, owing to the delayed payment of bills during earlier occasions. Corporation officials have assured them that the payment will be made promptly as the government order to use such services has been issued. The civic body is expected to spend ₹150 crore for the prevention measures.

Civic officials have been instructed to mix 300 kg of bleaching powder with 10,000 litres of water in each tanker lorry to carry out disinfection operations across the city.

Low income groups to get essential commodities

The Corporation Commissioner also met with NGOs who will start supply of essential commodities to city residents who are in low income neighbourhoods and slums.

“Over 35% of the city residents are in low income neighbourhoods. They will get essential commodities including rice, dal, cooking oil and soap for 15 days with support from NGOs. The NGOs who want to supply the material have been asked to contact the officials at the control room in Ripon Buildings,” said Mr.Prakash.

Many NGOs were found visiting Ripon Buildings on Monday to support the civic body with materials and volunteers. The Corporation has already started distributing food in relief centres in areas such as Chintadripet.

Directive to hospitals

“All private hospitals, biggest to the smallest, who fail to disinfect their premises will be severely dealt with. The joint commissioners, deputy commissioners, chief engineers and zonal officers will visit the hospitals. Hospitals could become potential centres of spread of COVID-19. Medical professionals have to understand and cooperate,” the Commissioner said.

The Commissioner will inspect all major government hospitals and private hospitals. Chennai Corporation has also asked residents not to visit corporation offices for civic services or to register complaints. “Residents are requested to call 1913,” said an official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/u3u7is/article31143139.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23MARTH--DISINFECT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-chennai-corporation-to-embark-on-a-mass-disinfection-drive-from-tomorrow/article31143140.ece
390,2020/03/23,COVID-19: Chennai government hospitals ramp up isolation facilities,"Over the last few days, work to increase the beds in isolation wards has been on in full swing

Newly-constructed buildings and unused spaces are now being turned into isolation facilities for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the city. The three major government medical college hospitals in Chennai are ramping up isolation facilities in all possible ways they can, including vacating an entire block for the purpose.

As of Suday, the State has a total of 2,069 isolation beds in medical college hospitals, government hospitals and private hospitals. In the last few days, work to increase the beds in isolation wards is on in full swing at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Government Stanley Medical College Hospital and Government Kilpauk Medical College (KMC) Hospital.

At Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, officials said certain unused buildings and wards are being utilised for expanding the isolation facility for COVID-19. As of now, the hospital has 31 beds in the isolation ward, and the aim was to gradually increase it to 250 to 300 beds, a hospital authority said. “We are getting new beds and cots for the purpose. The government has sanctioned funds and resources, and we have enough space to increase the number of beds,” he said.

A multi-storey building that is yet to become functional on the premises of Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) is now being readied for COVID-19 isolation facility. The building, meant to house the Institute of Rheumatology, will have at least 150 to 200 beds. “This will be a new facility. Meanwhile, the newly constructed Tower 3 building for outpatient departments is now serving as an outpatient facility for persons with symptoms of COVID-19, an official said.

At KMC, the Guruswamy block is being vacated to house the isolation facility. Officials said the medical wards and gynaecology wards in the building were being shifted, and the block would be only for COVID-19. Right now, the hospital has 20 isolation beds, and would increase it to 100 within a week. “We are increasing the number of beds in a phased manner. In the next few weeks, we will have 250 to 300 beds. We are working out measures to house a maximum of 400 beds,” an official said.

The official said that Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation was purchasing beds as per the requirements of the hospital. “Triaging has been planned. One floor will be for stable patients, one floor for intensive care patients and another floor for outpatients where investigations will be done and patients will be sent after examination,” the official said. If needed, a newly -constructed quarters could also be utilised for COVID-19 isolation facility, the official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fn25e9/article31141949.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23MARTH-Isolationjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-chennai-government-hospitals-ramp-up-isolation-facilities/article31141950.ece
391,2020/03/23,NGT asks TNPCB to inspect stone crusher units,"BSF shouldn’t have constructed a building in vicinity: Bench

The Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal has directed the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to make periodical inspections of stone crusher units to ascertain whether they are following norms to prevent pollution affecting the air quality and the health of the neighbouring residents and jawans of the Border Security Force (BSF), in Keerapakkam village.

The BSF’s State Deputy Inspector General filed the application that said they had been allotted 28 acres of land at the site in 2015 and had constructed temporary/tubular structures to accomodate around 200 BSF jawans and other officials and that an amount of ₹32 crore had been sanctioned to construct a building which was under progress.

The BSF submitted that there were a number of stone crushing units functioning around the complex causing noise and air pollution that were affecting the soldiers with diseases.

It claimed in its application that no proper control mechanism had been provided by the stone crushing units to arrest the pollution.

After complaints were raised with the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and the District Collector, an inspection was carried out and found that out of 17 units, only eight were functioning and closure notice was issued against these units for not following pollution norms.

The units approached the Appellate Authority against the closure order and were ordered to rectify certain deficiencies.

Once these were rectified , the Appellate Authority set aside the closure order and permitted them to operate.

During the pendency of the case with the NGT, the TNPCB was asked to carry out inspections on the units and submit a status report.

Bench’s verdict

After being satisfied with the reports that the units had rectified the issues pointed out , the NGT noted that the stone crusher units were functioning in that location since 1999 and at that time when they were established had complied with the siting criteria.

However, the bench comprising Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member Saibal Dasgupta, noted that the BSF unit was given the land only in 2015 and they had started construction very near to the boundary of the stone crusher units.

“As per the existing rules, no permission should be given to construct any building within a distance of 300 meters from an existing quarry and if a quarry is claimed as abandoned then a certificate from the local body or the licensing authority concerned to that effect shall be produced when necessary,” the bench said.

The bench said the BSF should not have constructed the building within 50 meters of the stone crushing units.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ngt-asks-tnpcb-to-inspect-stone-crusher-units/article31138320.ece
392,2020/03/23,Keeping adults and children engaged,"Janata Curfew Online Festival keeps people entertained

Thousands confined to their homes logged on to Facebook to listen to different kinds of music, from Poove Sempoove to Maitreem Bhajata, by musicians from 14 countries.

It wasn’t limited to music — from clips of their dances to storytelling sessions, the Janata Curfew Online Festival on Facebook saw several artistes coming forward to keep both adults and children engaged, through the day.

Musician Anil Srinivasan, who organised the festival, said that a few days ago, when the idea was mooted, several artistes were enthused about participating. “We had an overwhelming response to the festival. Instead of looking at memes or fake news on WhatsApp, people were listening to artistes and we were thrilled to see how much they loved it. Art does wonders. The event is proof enough that nothing can bind a community together more than art and creativity,” he said.

Musician Vedanth Bharadwaj spoke about how art plays a huge role in times of crisis and has a calming effect on people. “And the advantage is that people need not be logged in at all times, they can always pause and come back to listen to a session. In such challenging times, art shows how it can bring people together,” he added.

Stories for children

Besides, actor and storyteller Janaki Sabesh said that they would have an online storytelling session, every day, till March 31, at 5 p.m., on Instagram. “I never imagined online storytelling would be received so well by children. We got an overwhelming response. The important aspect of our storytelling is that we also give children activities like drawing and painting.

394,2020/03/23,"Over 2,000 people housed in Corporation’s shelters","50 volunteers and 5 vehicles ferry the stranded and homeless to 47 facilities

Over 2,000 homeless persons and people stranded in the city were on Sunday moved from different parts of the city by the Greater Chennai Corporation and housed in 47 of its shelters.

The Shelter for Urban Homeless team, under the Greater Chennai Corporation, used five vehicles and close to 50 volunteers and staff to rescue the homeless and those stranded in the city. There are a total of 51 shelters, including 13 special shelters in hospitals for attendees of patients.

The staff advertised the GCC helpline number 1913 and shelter helpline numbers 25303849 and 9445190472 to help the homeless during the ‘Janata Curfew’ and to provide them a roof on other days.

“Apart from the homeless, we received calls from the Koyambedu bus stand and other areas. We have people from Karnataka, Salem, Arakonnam and other districts and States. Some called our helplines, took the address and went there directly,” said Asha Parek Nandini, city-level coordinator, Shelter for Urban Homeless.

While women were accomodated on the ground floor, the men were asked to stay on the first floor. The main challege was the homeless families. The husband and the wife were asked to stay in different shelters. The inmates were tested before being taken in.

Besides, all shelters are being disinfected regularly. “In Mandaveli, we had to take some of the homeless to the community hall, as shelters were full. Since a large number of people were not allowed to stay inside the shelters at the RGGGH and the Stanley Government Hospital, as a precaution, we housed them in community halls,” said a GCC official. Food was provided by some NGOs. “It would be helpful if people donate groceries during such emergencies,” added the official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/55orvn/article31138306.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THSHELTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/over-2000-people-housed-in-corporations-shelters/article31138307.ece
395,2020/03/23,Thousands stranded at Central station,"Chennai Corporation provides food to 4,500, shelter to over 1,100

On Sunday, when the city stayed indoors due to the ‘Janata Curfew’, tense moments prevailed at the Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. MGR Chennai Central railway station, as thousands of migrant labourers, waiting to get to their home towns, were caught unawares after the trains stood cancelled.

The Southern Railway had cancelled all train services on Sunday as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19. According to the police, most passengers had come from Kerala on Saturday night, hoping to go to their home towns — mostly in Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal — on Sunday.

After arriving in Chennai, the Southern Railway, with the help of the Tamil Nadu Disaster Response Force (TNDRF), screened many of them for COVID-19 symptoms. The police then made them leave the station.

“Thousands of labourers arrived at the station, hoping to catch the evening train. When they came to know that long-distance and inter-city express trains were cancelled till March 31, they squatted outside the railway station in protest,” said a police officer. A large posse of policemen were deployed to prevent a law and order situation.

The Southern Railway requested the Greater Chennai Corporation to make arrangements for the labourers. By 5 p.m., police personnel dispersed the crowd of stranded passengers from the Central station. Some of them were requesting auto drivers to take them to government relief centres or night shelters, but auto drivers were not aware of the location of these shelters.

Food supplied

Later, many of the stranded passengers gathered at the Central Square near the railway station. But the police asked them to leave the area. By 5.30 p.m., many passengers in the crowd walked towards the Park railway station and many headed towards the Egmore railway station. “We did not have lunch today. We do not have money,” said Nitin, a passenger from Gujarat.

Corporation Deputy Commissioner (Health) Madhusudan Reddy, who visited in the evening, said the civic body supplied food for 4,500 stranded passengers at noon. “The passengers do not know the local language. So Corporation officials have been asked to take them to relief centres. Corporation will give accommodation for the stranded passengers in 25 shelters, for 10 days. We have made arrangements for toilet facilities, food and water,” said Mr. Reddy.

Later in the evening, the Corporation accommodated 1,145 passengers, who were stranded at the Central railway station, in Corporation community halls in Tiruvottiyur, Madhavaram, Royapuram, Thiru-Vi-Ka Nagar, Anna Nagar, Teynampet and Kodambakkam.

398,2020/03/23,"For city residents, it was a stay-at-home Sunday","With public transport off the roads, traffic was down to a bare minimum; in the evening, many came out to applaud health workers

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a ‘Janata Curfew’ on Sunday to encourage social distancing among the public, to contain the spread of COVID-19, received an overwhelming response in Chennai and the rest of Tamil Nadu, with the entire State observing a near-complete shutdown.

With the State government fully backing the initiative by suspending public transport and later extending the curfew till 5 a.m. on Monday, all roads and public places wore a deserted look. Heeding the government’s call, the public largely remained indoors. A negligible number of vehicles were seen plying major roads and highways.

In Chennai, all the arterial roads, including Anna Salai, looked deserted. Many government-run Amma Unavagam outlets providing food at subsidised prices, which were kept open, reported a considerable turnout of people from marginalised sections of society.

While fuel stations were open with a minimal number of staff, they hardly had any customers. “I have never seen such a complete shutdown. We have not had a single motorist coming in for fuel till the afternoon,” said A. Kathirvel, who works at a fuel station on Cathedral Road. In a few places, however, the curfew was not complied with. For instance, in some areas in and around Royapettah in Chennai, small groups of children and youngsters took to the roads to play cricket. On the Beach Road, a few youngsters who came in bikes clicked pictures of themselves sitting on the vacant road.

In South Boag Road and Wallajah Road, where small groups of people assembled late in the evening, the police made announcements asking them to disperse.

The Prime Minister’s appeal to the public to come to their balconies and windows to give a round of applause for the health workers and other professionals who are on the front line in the fight against COVID-19 also received a resounding response. In most places, particularly apartment complexes, people came out with their families to clap and clang on plates as a gesture of appreciation. Social media was flooded with such images and videos.

Though the Centre and the State governments had said that shops selling essential commodities can remain open, such establishments remained closed.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/3pdslv/article31138167.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23CityShutdown-piccol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/for-city-residents-it-was-a-stay-at-home-sunday/article31138168.ece

400,2020/03/23,The perils of an all-out lockdown,"If the poor must stay at home, they need income support and essential services

As the novel coronavirus spreads, a double crisis looms over India: a health crisis and an economic crisis. In terms of casualties, the health crisis is still very confined (seven deaths in a country where eight million people die every year), but the numbers are growing fast. Meanwhile, the economic crisis is hitting with full force, throwing millions out of work by the day. Unlike the health crisis, it is not class-neutral, but hurts poor people the most.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

India slows down

Migrant workers, street vendors, contract workers, almost everyone in the informal sector — the bulk of the workforce — is being hit by this economic tsunami. In Maharashtra, mass lay-offs have forced migrant workers to rush home, some without being paid. Many of them are now stranded between Maharashtra and their homes as trains have been cancelled. The economic standstill in Maharashtra is spreading fast to other States as factories, shops, offices and worksites close with little hope of an early return to normalcy. With transport routes dislocated, even the coming wheat harvest, a critical source of survival for millions of labouring families in north India, may not bring much relief. And all this is just a trailer.

Coronavirus | 80 districts in lockdown to contain virus spread

This economic crisis calls for urgent, massive relief measures. Lockdowns may be needed to slow down the epidemic, but poor people cannot afford to stay idle at home. If they are asked to stay home, they will need help. There is a critical difference, in this respect, between India and affluent countries with a good social security system. The average household in, say, Canada or Italy can take a lockdown in its stride (for some time at least), but the staying power of the Indian poor is virtually nil.

Tap social schemes

Since time is of the essence, the first step is to make good use of existing social-security schemes to support poor people — pensions, the Public Distribution System (PDS), midday meals, and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), among others. Initial measures could include advance payment of pensions, enhanced PDS rations, immediate payment of MGNREGA wage arrears, and expanded distribution of take-home rations at schools and anganwadis. Some States have already taken useful steps of this sort, but the scale of relief measures needs radical expansion. That, in turn, requires big money from the Central government. It also requires the government to avoid squandering its resources on corporate bailouts: most crisis-affected sectors of the economy will soon be lobbying for rescue packages.

Coronavirus | Congress seeks cash transfers

Meanwhile, there is a danger of people’s hardships being aggravated by a tendency to shut down essential services. Public transport, administrative offices, court hearings, MGNREGA projects and even immunisation drives have already been suspended to varying degrees in many States. Some of these interruptions are certainly justified, but others are likely to be counter-productive. Remember, we are dealing not only with a health crisis but also with an economic crisis. Even if discontinuing public services helps to contain the health crisis, the economic consequences need to be considered.

To assess the case for various precautionary measures, we must bear in mind the dual motive for taking precautions. When you decide to stay at home, there are two possible motives for it: a self-protection motive and a public-purpose motive. In the first case, you act out of fear of being infected. In the second, you participate in collective efforts to stop the spread of the virus.

Some people think about precautions as a matter of self-protection. What they may not realise is that the individual risk of getting infected is still tiny — so small that it is hardly worth any self-protection efforts (except for special groups such as health workers and the elderly). Four hundred thousand people die of tuberculosis in India every year, yet we take no special precautions against it. So why do we take precautions when seven people have died of COVID-19? The enlightened reason is not to protect ourselves, but to contribute to collective efforts to halt the epidemic.

Manmohan Singh: ‘India has slid to being a majoritarian state in economic despair’

Display creativity

A similar reasoning applies to the case for shutting down public services as a precautionary measure. Self-protection of public employees is not a major issue (for the time being), the main consideration is public purpose. Further, public purpose must include the possible economic consequences of a shutdown. If a service creates a major health hazard, public purpose may certainly call for it to be discontinued (this is the reason for closing schools and colleges). On the other hand, services that help poor people in their hour of need without creating a major health hazard should continue to function as far as possible. That would apply not only to health services or the Public Distribution System, but also to many other public services including administrative offices at the district and local levels. Poor people depend on these services in multiple ways, closing them across the board at this time would worsen the economic crisis without doing much to stem the health crisis.

Keeping public services going in this situation is likely to require some initiative and creativity. An explicit list of essential services (already available in some States) and official guidelines on coronavirus readiness at the workplace would be a good start. Many public premises are crying for better distancing arrangements. Some services can even be reinvented for now. For instance, anganwadis could play a vital role of public-health outreach at this time, even if children have to be kept away. Many public spaces could also be used, with due safeguards, to disseminate information or to impart good habits such as distancing and washing hands.

Also read | Blunting the economic impact of a pandemic

The urgent need for effective social security measures makes it all the more important to avoid a loss of nerve. The way things are going today, it will soon be very difficult for some State governments to run the Public Distribution System or take good care of drinking water. That would push even more people to the wall, worsening not only the economic crisis but possibly the health crisis as well. This is not the time to let India’s frail safety net unravel.

Despite assurances, I have never experienced so much fear and anxiety in my life as I feel now about the COVID-19 pandemic (Page 1, “No community transmission of coronavirus, says Centre”, March 22). I am 84, and have seen disasters like the tsunami, floods after tanks have breached, and epidemics such as cholera. But COVID-19 has made them all insignificant. It is unsettling that cases are galloping. With no vaccine in sight in the foreseeable future, people have to be very conscious not to create problems as far as the infection transmission cycle is concerned. There was curfew during the world wars to safeguard ourselves from enemy’s attack. Now, a 14-hour lockdown has to be thought of to try and help safeguard ourselves from a pandemic.

At 5 p.m. yesterday, the sound of vessels being sounded and bells ringing rent the air in almost every locality, society, apartment block, house and building. The Prime Minister must be complimented for his efforts in bringing people together in the war against a virus. We also owe much gratitude to those in service of the country.

Kirti Wadhawan,

Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh

The curfew has without doubt been successful. People kept indoors as an inherent part of social distancing, which is sure to have helped in the fight against COVID-19. The shutdown shows the support for a genuine and valid emergent cause.

B. Veerakumaran Thampi,

Thiruvananthapuram

Now that India has proved that it can stay indoors, it is imperative to keep the momentum going rather than bask in the glory of a day’s success of the government having made the country listen to it. There should be more intense measures in the crucial third week if India is to avoid an Italy-like situation. The difference in the ground situation between two major European countries, Italy and Germany, in tackling the virus is a lesson not to be overlooked. India has very few testing centres in proportion to its population size. And the most important point is to take care of the needs of daily wage earners.

G.B. Sivanandam,

Coimbatore

The Janata curfew has been successful, but the real success comes when people are out of danger. The pressing concern is that the number of cases being tested and found positive could be a tip of the iceberg. It is quite possible that in a country like ours with a huge population and inadequate health-care services, the number of confirmed cases being put out by the agencies could be off count. The situation could turn bad if there are community transmissions. While social distancing can reduce the possibility of the spread of infection, hygiene measures must be pursued without a break.

N. Sadhasiva Reddy,

It is not for nothing that money is called filthy lucre. In spite of the fact that currency notes change hands frequently, most people do not consider it necessary to wash their hands after touching them. In the process of changing hands, notes may turn out to be a health hazard, all the more so when the coronavirus is in the air. Shouldn’t the health advisories

also include advice asking people to wash their hands thoroughly every time they touch a bank note?

M. Jameel Ahmed,

Mysuru

It is a fact that the pandemic has wreaked havoc all over the world. In addition to this, many of us have had to contend with a rise in the prices of essential items. Using the excuse of a shortage of essential commodities, there are instances of prices being raised even though there is no shortage of goods in reality. It has been made worse by all sorts of forwards on social media. One is unable to understand why people are hoarding items. The government must make it clear that there are no shortages and that shopkeepers who are selling goods at a higher price will be prosecuted.

Crime and punishment

It is deplorable that the electronic media went overboard on the day of the hangings of the Nirbhaya convicts. While the collective conscience of the nation has been disturbed by the dastardly act — they did deserve severe punishment — the point to note is this. People have already despatched these criminals a million times as it were, but are also hanging their heads, in shame for not being able to protect the life of a young girl. We also had a criminal justice system that took over the case and the executions were the last part of the procedure. Certain sections of the media played up minutiae such as the nooses and the hangman’s compensation. That we still need capital punishment as a deterrent reflects poorly on our societal development. The criminals could have been awarded the death penalty by lethal injection instead of the barbaric system of hanging.

403,2020/03/23,Mumbai’s local trains to remain shut till March 31,"State transport, BEST buses to ferry people providing essential services at three key changeover points

Mumbai’s local trains, for the first time in their history, will be shut down for nine days. The decision to close the entire suburban network of the Central Railway (CR) and the Western Railway (WR) was taken as part of a larger decision of the Ministry of Railways to shut all passenger trains across the country until March 31 in a bid to arrest the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

The decision came barely 12 hours after the State announced to restrict access to local trains, the lifeline of the city, by deploying teams at every station to check and permit access only to people who were part of essential services such as the police, or had an emergency. On Sunday, with ‘Janata Curfew’ in place, trains ran empty, and were operating at approximately 60% capacity. The Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) also ran only 1,253 buses of a fleet of over 4,000.

According to a notification released by the Railway Board, all suburban trains across the country and the services of Kolkata Metro shall be cancelled from midnight of March 22 to midnight of March 31. All long-distance trains on both the CR and the WR will also be shut. Mumbai Metro has also decided to stop its operations during this period.

Mumbai’s local trains on an average ferry over 80 lakh people daily, of which thousands work in providing essential services. After the Railway Board’s announcement, the State government has put in place a joint ‘hub and spoke’ action plan with the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) and BEST. The two services will jointly provide transport to people providing essential services like banks, police, and hospital staff, who live in distant suburbs.

MSRTC will arrange for buses at five-minute intervals from key stations in the outer suburbs to three key changeover points — Borivali station (East), Khopat in Thane, and Vashi station, on the Western Line, Central Line, and Harbour Line, respectively. BEST will operate buses from these changeover points to various locations in the city. The entire operations will only be available for persons engaged in providing essential services.

MSRTC has suspended all of its services across the State but will be running buses in the above arrangement from Panvel, Palghar, Virar, Nalasopara and Vasai on the Western Line, Asangaon, Badlapur, Ambernath, Kalyan and Dombivali on the Central Line, and Panvel on the Harbour Line to the respective changeover points. BEST will be running buses on 16 long-distance corridor routes across the city.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has listed all police and BMC officials, staff associated with hospitals and pharmacy stores as well as staff of telephone and internet providers and electricity distribution companies — BEST, Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML), and Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited — as essential services. AEML said it will continue to attend emergency and regular request on supply of electricity restoration and safety complaints maximum through their digital and online customer services at large.

404,2020/03/23,Mumbai records second COVID-19 death,"State tally of patients now stands at 74

A 63-year-old diamond merchant from Walkeshwar became the second casualty of COVID-19 in Mumbai. The senior citizen had no international travel history, but had been to Surat a fortnight ago.

His wife (64) has also tested positive and is admitted to HN Reliance Foundation Hospital. His last rites were carried out early on Sunday at the Chandanwadi electric crematorium as per infection control protocol.

Civic health officials said that he had diabetes, hypertension and heart disease as well. He had undergone angioplasty 12 years ago.

Officials said the man went to HN Reliance Hospital after he developed breathing problems on March 19. He was immediately put on ventilator support. Doctors suspected COVID-19 and sent his throat swab for testing at Kasturba Hospital and it came back positive on Saturday.

A civic official said the man’s daughter, granddaughter and domestic help are among the close contacts who are being tested. “The patient worked in Bandra Kurla Complex. We have intimated ward officials there. However, because of the lockdown, the offices have been empty and he may have had limited contacts there,” the official said.

He said at least eight staff members of the HN Reliance Hospital are also under watch.

The hospital, in a statement, said the patient was moved to the negative pressure isolation ICU the moment he was suspected to have COVID- 19. “All our healthcare staff were tested and taken care of by the hospital providing them immediate quarantine. All of them have tested negative as of now,” it said.

On Sunday, the State recorded 10 new positive cases, taking the total count to 74. Five are from Mumbai, one from Navi Mumbai and four from Pune. Of the five Mumbai patients, two have a travel history to the U.S., one to Scotland and one to Saudi Arabia.

The Navi Mumbai patient is a 35-year-old man from Airoli with a travel history to Istanbul. “He had been under home quarantine for the last 12 days. On Saturday, he started feeling unwell and was taken to Vashi NMMC hospital, from where he was taken to Kasturba Hospital, where he tested positive. His parents have also been admitted to Kasturba and are under observation, though they don’t have any symptoms. His brother is home quarantined,” NMMC chief medical officer Balasaheb Sonawane said.

With the Centre announcing suspension of suburban trains and Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) Undertaking buses shutting down, several municipal employees were in a fix about how they would get to work on Monday.

The civic body provides essential services such as water supply, sewage disposal, solid waste management, municipal hospitals, pest control officers and the fire brigade to citizens. Municipal unions said most employees come from far away suburbs such as Panvel, Ulwe, Badlapur and Virar. They said Saturday’s decision to allow trains to run with only these employees on board was better than a complete ban.

Milind Ranade, secretary of Kachra Vahtuk Shramik Sangh said, “Most conservancy workers live in the farthest corners of the city and have to report at their motor loading chowkies. We have no idea how they will get to work.”

However, their worries were put to rest by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporations’s announcement that BEST and State transport buses will now be used to ferry these municipal employees.

A joint action plan has been created to ferry municipal employees, police personnel and bank employees. As per this plan, Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses will ferry those living outside municipal limits up to a certain point within municipal limit. For example, employees living in Asangaon, Badlapur, Kalyan will be dropped at Thane station. From this point, the employees can take a BEST bus, which will drop them at their workplace. The MSRTC has set aside 540 buses for this.

While jokes about the country being perfectly safe from the novel coronavirus once the Janata Curfew ended at 9 p.m. circulated on social media all through Sunday, the Mumbai Police took no chances, effectively putting the city into partial lockdown till March 31.

They initially imposed prohibitory orders in the city from Sunday night to Monday morning, restricting anyone from stepping out into the public. Later in the evening, after the Chief Minister announced Section 144 in urban areas across the State, the police issued a fresh order saying that assembly of five or more people would be prohibited from 5.01 a.m. on Monday to midnight on March 31.

The Thane Police, too, issued prohibitory orders from Sunday night to Monday morning.

Emergency services, essential services like food and milk supplies, hospital, medical and pharma-related supplies, telephone and internet services, electricity, petroleum and oil, drinking water and trucks carrying goods and manpower related to such services, will be exempt from the orders, the police said.

The first circular, issued on Sunday afternoon by DCP (Operations) and Mumbai Police spokesperson Pranaya Ashok, said that “prohibitory orders restricting any presence or movement of one or more persons in public places and also any vehicles carrying such persons to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus” had been put into effect from 9.01 p.m. on Sunday to 5 a.m. on Monday.

Mr. Ashok said the orders were issued under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which empowers the police force concerned to take any steps deemed necessary to ensure the safety of citizens in its jurisdiction.

407,2020/03/23,BMC to take testing facilities to homes,"Corporation aims to ease load on Kasturba Hospital, prevent further infections

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will be giving at-home COVID-19 testing services so as to ease the load on Kasturba Hospital, where people with flu-like symptoms are queuing up by the dozen.

If a doctor has advised a patient to undergo testing, the BMC or affiliated private hospitals will collect the sample from the patient’s home.

Kasturba Hospital is the city’s only infectious diseases public hospital. As on Friday, it had received 3,682 people in the COVID-19 outpatient department. Private practitioners refer 60% of the patients to the hospital without taking their travel history. Often, the patients come to get themselves tested. Doctors on the front line say such referrals put people at unnecessary risk.

Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said the BMC will soon start an at-home testing facility.

“All private laboratories or those belonging to hospitals that have been registered with NIV, Pune, will set up a van. We are setting up a dedicated helpline,” he said. If a person feels he or she has COVID-19 symptoms, they need to talk to the team of doctors on the helpline and if the doctors feel their case is justified, a team of municipal doctors or those who have extended support to the BMC will collect a swab, he said. “If the sample tests positive, the patient will be moved to an isolation centre.”

The BMC will enlist the help of the 40 doctors released from airport duty, now that no international flights are landing in the city.

“As of today, 800 people are queuing up outside Kasturba Hospital while they have 100 COVID-19 patients to look after,’ Mr. Pardeshi said. In Italy, he said, the doctors were also infected and their hospital system collapsed. “When patients come to a hospital, everyone is exposed. Instead, a person wearing protective equipment will collect the sample from their homes.”

This, he said, will reduce the load on Kasturba and prevent people from commuting to the hospital. The facility will also be used for collecting swab samples of those in home quarantine or those who are in close contact with them.

Within this week a majority of them will get the approval and will start testing,” she said.

Dr. Baweja said all laboratories will use their own kits. The ICMR has said the price of the test cannot exceed ₹4,500 and urged private players to offer free or subsidised testing.

Earlier, the State government had on Saturday issued an advisory to private hospitals asking them to postpone non-emergency services and prepare isolation wards in view of the outbreak of the virus.

Close to two months after it began, the Mumbai Bagh protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register was temporarily suspended on Sunday in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.

On Sunday, shortly after the Mumbai Police issued orders declaring a lockdown in the city, senior police officers held a meeting with the organisers of the protest on its 56th day.

It was decided that the structure set up at the protest venue as well as the chairs placed for the convenience of the women would be allowed to stand. Also, the police would not summon for inquiries or bother any of the women till the crisis had passed. The protesters, too, agreed that nothing was to be gained by putting each other at risk in the light of the growing number of cases.

“We may have differences with the government on the CAA, NRC and NPR, but we are with them in the fight against COVID-19. All the protesters at Mumbai Bagh are withdrawing due to the coronavirus pandemic and the imposition of Section 144 in the State. A symbolic protest will continue online and the physical protest will resume after the crisis is behind us,” said Rubaid Ali Bhojani, who has been part of the protest since the beginning.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/p6ypkx/article31138496.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BMMUMBAIBAGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-bagh-protests-suspended/article31138497.ece
410,2020/03/23,A whole new world,"Bhendi Bazaar’s redevelopment is bringing better houses, bigger shops and international brands to the vicinity while retaining its charm

A bevy of customers line up outside Moayyad Mithaiwala’s new outlet in Bhendi Bazaar, which is incidentally just across his old shop that was recently demolished as part of the redevelopment project. “Our business has not been hit due to the move, since most of us have customers that live in the vicinity. If a sweet seller moves out to some other area, the customer is less likely to come there,” Mr. Mithaiwala, a third-generation sweet seller in the area, said. His is among 200 shops in the vicinity that have moved into a new three-storey transit for commercial tenants, which resolved most issues raised by them. ​

A key issue voiced by several shop owners, many of whom have been in Bhendi Bazaar for decades, was the loss of business during the transition period. “The idea of an on-site commercial transit facility ensures minimum displacement of businesses during the construction phase in other sectors while helping the diverse mix of businesses adapt to the traditional street shopping environment that has been proposed,” Mustafa Hassonjee, the master planner and architect, said. ​

Mr. Hassonjee said the idea was to recreate the bazaar and this transit facility would be a sort of replica of what is being planned at a larger scale. “The whole idea is to get back the feel of Bhendi Bazaar, to let the shop owners experience the advantages of covered streets that are planned to be built as part of the design,” he said. The transit facility has a capacity to house around 350 shops and around 200 shops have moved in over the last few months.​

​Trial and error​

Prior to this, The Saifee Burhani Upliftment Project (SBUT) in 2013 had built Mufaddal Shopping Arcade close to the project site to temporarily house shops. However, many commercial tenants said the idea never took off as it wasn’t inside Bhendi Bazaar, which hit their businesses. Shopkeepers said their clients would not come to Mufaddal and they had to move to other locations. ​

Mr. Mithaiwala said the new concept was the correct one, as it resolved several issues “Most of us did not want to move to Muffaddal and people in the vicinity knew this. As a consequence many started asking for rents that were 1.5 to 2 times higher than the market rate, knowing that sooner or later our shops would be demolished,” he said. According to Mr. Mithaiwala, while the space in the transit was significantly less, it was a worthy trade off to ensure that they kept their clientèle. The construction of the transit also helped curtail the rent costs that were spiralling out of control in the region, he said.​

“When we were asked to move out, I was given the option of an alternative site or getting rent. I chose to go to Muffaddal, but it was a disaster as there were no customers,” Devendra Jain, a clothes shop owner, said. He sentiments were echoed Farzin Jetpurwala, whose is a fourth-generation resident of Bhendi Bazaar. “We were in Mufaddal for only about six to eight months and it was a disaster. We essentially shut our shop for three years and conducted over phone,” he said. Mr. Jain said Mufaddal was okay for people who were into wholesale business. “For those of us who have retail shops and depend on customers coming in, it was not feasible. Many have been here for decades; our customers were not coming there. I eventually gave up that place and took up a new place in Cooper street, but my business was not doing too well there either,” he said.​

The right way forward​

Mr. Hassonjee said SBUT had mandated the design team to come up with creative ways to temporarily house commercial tenants on the project site itself and had built an on-site commercial transit in Sector 1-A of the project, which he stated had been very successful. “This we believe is the right way forward,” he said, adding that earlier the transit shops were scattered across the area. “By doing this we were also able to give people a glimpse how they’ll benefit in the new master plan,” he said. The temporary three-storey structure, where the transit is housed, was completed around November, 2019.​

From the entire project’s perspective, the new on-site commercial transit will increase the overall speed of work. Mr. Hassonjee said by bringing all the commercial tenants under one roof, they would now be able to swiftly start construction of all sectors of the project and complete the entire redevelopment at a go. The project’s first set of residential tenants moved back to Bhendi Bazaar earlier this year into the Al Sa’adah Complex, the first two high-rise towers of SBUT to have been constructed from the ground up as part of the project. The towers have 610 residential and 128 commercial spaces.​

Mr. Jain and Mr. Jetpurwala were among the first commercial tenants to move into the Al Sa’adah last year, which currently has over 100 shop owners. The return of residential tenants has given hope to shop owners in the building as well as in the newly built commercial transit of better business in the coming months. At present around 400 residential tenants have already moved in.​

Welcome changes​

Mr. Jetpurwala, who runs a mattresses business, said that walk-ins have improved over the past few months. He is also the owner of the space where Bhendi Bazaar’s first McDonald’s is housed, which started operations around four months ago.​

“This area has all the amenities and eateries but it didn’t have any global brands. The entry of brands like McDonald’s and Belgian Waffle is changing that,” Ali Merchant, a 17-year-old who lives in the vicinity, said. The recently opened brands stick out in the old neighbourhood and are symbolic to the changing face of Bhendi Bazaar, as commercial tenants move back into the recently completed Al Sa’adah.​

Mr. Jetpurwala said large brands would often eschew areas like Bhendi Bazaar as there was a dearth of quality real estate and also due to the tenancy laws. “We had our establishment in a 100-year-old building. The leakage and seepage in the older establishment was a huge issue and due to the age of the building there was only so much you could do by way of repairs. The new building has resolved many of those issues,” he said.​

Mr. Merchant said the new building has attracted global brands that were completely absent in the area earlier. “Residents would either need to go south towards Fort or to Byculla to have access to big global brands. Maybe more will come soon with the new development, which will also cater to the neighbouring regions,” he said.​

For Mr. Jain, the biggest takeaway is that he left Bhendi Bazaar as a tenant and returned as an owner. “I have had a shop here since 1992 and in 2000, I took up another shop. I will benefit from the first set of residential tenants as well,” he said.​

Mr. Mithaiwala felt that families moving into to the two new buildings will also give the business of in the commercial transit a boost. “There are a few issues of parking and dust but soon these issues would soon be resolved. Our business would not be affected, which was a key concern for us,” he said adding that while there will be more competition, they also stood a chance to get new customers here, which was good for all businesses.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/dthplc/article31138450.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0d52fed8-cor,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a-whole-new-world/article31138451.ece

412,2020/03/23,The language of grief,"The sports pages are a metaphor for these times

COVID-19 has affected every sphere. At the Readers’ Editor Office, we had to stop readers from attending our editorial meetings and also cancel the Open House that we had planned to celebrate 50 years of this newspaper in Bengaluru. Apart from a perceptible decline in letters and calls, there is also pronounced anxiety everywhere. People are fervently hoping that this pandemic will end soon. This hour of crisis may also be used as an hour of reflection.

Physicist Freeman Dyson, who died early this year, was fond of reminding everyone about two different kinds of scientists: birds and frogs. Some scientists are birds who fly high to survey the broad vistas and establish unexpected links between different bits of the landscape. Others are frogs who prefer to be close to the ground, focussing on minute details. These two are not opposing trajectories; they are complementary paths.

If applied to journalism, Dyson’s classification may put most Editors in the bird category, but the Readers’ Editor in the frog category. An internal news ombudsman views and evaluates the world mainly through the pages of the newspaper. COVID-19 is hurting us on all fronts. From crippling our economy to immobilising us, the ramifications of the pandemic are beyond our comprehension. It may take a month or two to quantify the loss. In this hour of unknown hardship, the sports pages seem to be a metaphor for our times.

No sports events

There is a moratorium on sporting events. Some observers say that the 2020 Olympics to be held in Tokyo in July may be postponed. Sports writers usually compete with each other to grab the precious space for their reportage. When politics polarises people, it is sports that helps to break the silos, despite attempts by hyper-nationalists to inject jingoism in sports too.

I asked the Sports Editor, K.C. Vijaya Kumar, about how his team is managing when there is no sporting event to report. “Sports pages ideally thrive on kinetic energy through live reportage of matches supplemented with action-photographs. The other added elements are a sprinkling of analysis, a few features, and the odd pinch of nostalgia as and when a significant event’s anniversary comes to the fore. But largely the sports pages are of the here and now, of who won a match, of who scored the winning goal or the championship-winning forehand or the game-changing blistering hundred. But when sport ceases as it has in these grave times of the coronavirus pandemic, the sports pages are plunged into a vacuum,” he said.

With sports having hit the pause button globally, there is a dearth of live-action content. Understandably the sports pages had to be scaled down from three to two and the Sudoku grid was moved from the world page to the sports pages. “Even the feature-driven Weekend Sport page that appears on Saturdays, with its look-ahead perspective, well-curated by Senior Deputy Editor S. Ram Mahesh and embellished by Deputy National Design Editor S. Kannan, had to be suspended for now. Besides the periscope-gaze, reporters are also looking back with awe as anniversaries are culled out and written about, while the sports desk, headed by R. Narayanan, provides support through archival images and graphics,” said Mr. Vijaya Kumar.

Creating hope where there is despair

From George Orwell’s pithy article, “The sporting spirit” to Jorge Luis Borges biting one-liner — “Soccer is popular because stupidity is popular” — we have had criticisms of sport over the last century. What these thinkers did not bargain for was the possibility of suspension of sporting activity itself. In this bleak time, it is important to recall Nelson Mandela’s observation about sports. He said: “Sport has the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire, it has the power to unite people in a way that little else does. Sport can create hope, where once there was only despair.”

Sports journalism informs us that bleak realities do not mean despair alone. They suggest possibilities and potentials, alternatives and optimism. The absence of sporting events has forced the sports team to remember and reflect on multiple aspects of sport — from aesthetics to skills — that make the world of games an integral part of our life. In a sense, it is a language of grief that generates space for empathy, social action and shared values, which in turn create space for hope and transformation.

414,2020/03/23,COVID-19: Vehicular traffic suspended at inter-state border in Puducherry,"Vehicles from Cuddalore and Villupuram districts in Tamil Nadu have been curtailed

Vehicular traffic from neighbouring Cuddalore and Villupuram districts in Tamil Nadu into Puducherry was curtailed on Monday with the district administration imposing restrictions on the entry of vehicles along the inter-state borders in the wake of an increase in COVID-19 cases.

The government on Sunday imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) across the Union Territory to prohibit large gatherings to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The restrictions were imposed as part of the preventive measures against COVID-19 and will remain in force till March 31.

According to a senior official, all vehicles including government and private buses and light motor vehicles except essential services will not be permitted into the Union Territory round the clock.

The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) buses that were refused entry into Puducherry dropped off their passengers near the Pattanur toll plaza.

However, two-wheelers would be exempted after the riders are thoroughly screened at the check posts. Intra-State bus services from Puducherry to Bahour, Nettapakkam, Thirukkanur, Madagadipet and Kalapet would function as usual, he said.

418,2020/03/23,Revised Motor Vehicles Act yet to be enforced,"Gazette notification can be issued only after the draft is approved by both the Cabinet and the L-G, say officials

The revised Motor Vehicles Act notified by the Centre proposing stiff penalties for various road traffic violations are yet to see the light of the day in Puducherry.

A senior official of the Transport Department, on condition of anonymity, said the amended Act was under government scrutiny and a decision had not been taken to implement it.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways sent a letter last month directing the department to implement the Act and send them a copy of the notification issued in the gazette.

Official sources said the Transport Department had studied the provisions of the Act and sent it to the government. It had to be approved by the Cabinet and sent to the Lieutenant Governor for approval.

The new law had laid down strict norms and fines and could serve as a deterrent for law breakers.

The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act 2019 was notified by the Centre in August 2019.

Compoundable offences

The changes made under the Act included higher fines for traffic violations and strict penalties in the cases of offences by juveniles. Thirty offences, including over-speeding, not wearing helmets and seat belts were compoundable.

“Many States, including Tamil Nadu, are yet to implement the Act. Puducherry shares border with Tamil Nadu and the government is reluctant to implement the Act because of lack of synergy with the neighbouring State on the issue. Until the revised rules are implemented, traffic violations would continue,” an official said.

Despite the presence of traffic policemen, jumping of the signal and rash driving were on the rise in the city. Most violations were reported on the 45 Feet Road signal, East Coast Road near Latha Steels, Kokku Park junction, Anna Square and Venkatta Subba Reddiar Square, officials said.

According to P. Devanathan, president of People’s Pulse, a non-governmental organisation, “the revised MV rules could serve as a deterrent for law breakers and they need to be approved and implemented at the earliest. The Transport Department has put in place a standard operating procedure for traffic management at signals but it is seldom followed. The traffic police are not allowed to exercise their powers and record violations.”

Motorists at the 45 Feet Road junction jump signal frequently causing traffic snarls and accidents.

Priorities for traffic wing

A police officer said preventing traffic violations had been one of the priorities and the traffic wing had been taking steps, including noting down the registration number of vehicles and creating traffic awareness.

According to T.S. Saradha, a resident of Kurunji Nagar, “Puducherry is a Union Territory and it has no option to differ or deviate from the rules that the central government frames. The rules relating to the Motor Vehicles Act are automatically applicable for Puducherry and hence there should be strict enforcement of rules.”

Any slack approach would only give rise to compromising on road safety. A joint panel of the State and the Centre could be formed to oversee whether the Motor Vehicles Act was enforced in Puducherry, she said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/mvwzi0/article31138237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THPONDYUT01,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/revised-motor-vehicles-act-yet-to-be-enforced/article31138239.ece

Prohibitory orders under Section 144 will be in force in Puducherry till March 31.

“Section 144 is imposed only as a safety measure against the spread of COVID-19. All essential government services will continue and shops selling essential items such as milk, food, medicines and so on will remain open,” Mr. Narayanasamy said.

While thanking people for their cooperation, Mr. Narayanasamy urged them to follow only official instructions.

Engaging the community

“The objective of all measures that we have undertaken, including restrictions on movement and curbs on inter-State travel, is to get the community to engage in self distancing,” Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar said.

The Chief Secretary reviewed the situation at a meeting with Director-General of Police Balaji Srivastava.

While the situation was under control, all efforts were on to thwart the pandemic spread. “Self distancing, which hinges on people’s participation, is key to checking transmission of a highly contagious disease. We have tried to balance inconveniences to public from the curbs placed on regular life against ensuring access to the flow of essential services and commodities,” he added.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/fubugx/article31138205.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THPONDYSOCIALDISTANCING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/cm-reiterates-importance-of-social-distancing-to-check-covid-19-spread/article31138206.ece

Activities halted

KWA has halted a number of activities as part of the measures to prevent the community spread of the infection. Its cash counters to pay the utility bills will remain closed till March 31.

The KWA activities halted include construction of supply projects, including the 120-mld initiative at Neyyar and the 75-mld water treatment plant at Aruvikkara. It is as yet unclear when the work can be restarted. The utility has also stopped the reading of meters for the time being. Earlier, KWA had announced a one-month relaxation, starting March 20, for bill water bill payment.

KWA officials report a 10 to 20% rise in water consumption, which they attribute to the spurt in summer demand and sanitation-related activities undertaken as part of tackling COVID-19. Nonetheless, the storage dams have adequate supply to last the summer, a KWA official said.

With the government stepping up the COVID-19 alert level, the KWA on Sunday issued orders forming special cells at its head office in Thiruvananthapuram and district offices. Sreekumar M., Chief Engineer (Human Resources Development and General), has been appointed State Nodal Officer for the water utility.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/kwa-to-ensure-state-gets-uninterrupted-water-supply/article31137825.ece
424,2020/03/23,Thiruvananthapuram-based start-up makes automatic hand sanitiser dispensers,"Handwashing has become sort of a mantra for people in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, a bunch of engineers in the city have come up with low-cost automatic hand sanitiser dispensers that make sanitising easy and convenient.

Alphavogue, a start-up by a graduate of Government Engineering College, Barton Hill, has embarked on production of the automatic sanitiser dispensers that can be wall mounted or placed on a table, thus doing away with the need to dispense them to each person, especially in places such as hospitals and offices.

Alphavogue team leader K.M. Abhijith says the college had bought an automatic hand sanitiser as part of the ‘Break the Chain’ initiative. However, not only was it expensive, the capacity too was inadequate, making refilling very difficult. Even dispensers available online were not any better.

It was then that the college Principal K. Suresh discussed the idea of developing a higher capacity dispenser at a low budget with the Alphavogue team, which comprises two other undergraduates Wazeer and Manu and 15 part-time interns, including Abhishek.

Within three days, the team fabricated a dispenser with a capacity of 2.5 litres at a cost of ₹3,500.

Made from an aryclic sheet that is 3 mm thick and is bent using heat, the dispenser made by Alphavogue was handed over to the college.

Refilling

Abhijith says a dispenser with a 2.5-litre capacity will not need frequent refilling. Moreover, unlike the commercially available dispensers that are mostly opaque, the dispenser manufactured by them is transparent, making it easy to keep track of the sanitiser levels.

The dispenser works on electricity. The micro-controller placed at the core of the dispenser controls the working with the aid of a motor, pump, and infra red sensor. Upon sensing the hand movement, the pump springs into action to automatically dispense the sanitiser.

Abhijith says a dispenser with five-litre capacity can be developed by them at a slightly higher cost, but will be made available at the same price as the 2.5-litre dispensers in the wake of the COVID-19 threat.

“We just want to recover the cost of the sensors and the labour. We are forgoing the rest.”

Manufacture of a battery-run version of the dispenser will be kicked off in the coming days.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/m3ey25/article31137801.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WhatsAppImage2020-03-21at1807301,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/an-easy-way-to-wash-hands/article31137802.ece

The decision would be applicable to all staff and contract employees except personnel attached to essential services within the organisation such as medical units, an official of the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) said.

The decision would also be applicable to the staff of the other two ISRO units in Thiruvananthapuram — the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre and the ISRO Inertial Systems Unit, officials said.

All three units combined have approximately 10,000 personnel including staff, contract employees, trainees and the CISF security personnel.

The Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Government of India, had issued an office memorandum on Sunday asking heads of departments to draw up a roster of staff — including officers and employees, consultants/contract and outsourced employees — who are essential to render essential services within each department.

426,2020/03/23,Janata curfew total inThiruvananthapuram,"City wears a deserted look, vehicles remain off road

The nationwide ‘janata curfew’ was total in the State capital that came to a standstill and largely wore a deserted look on Sunday.

The lockdown was in response to the Prime Minister’s nationwide call to remain indoors to fight community transmission of the coronavirus.

Despite being no stranger to hartals, Thiruvananthapuram witnessed scenes not much seen in recent times. Both the Thiruvanathapuram Central and the KSRTC Central bus station at Thampanoor, a major transit hub in the State, remained virtually closed.

The area would be buzzing with activity even on hartal days with private vehicles and auto-rickshaws passing by the area largely unobstructed. Besides, the police would also conduct shuttle bus services to transport commuters to the Government Medical College Hospital, Regional Cancer Centre, and the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology. However, none of these could be seen here on Sunday. Only a handful of commuters, who were far outnumbered by mediapersons and police personnel, were seen roaming around.

Public transport was severely hit with KSRTC and private bus owners deciding against conducting services. While a few passenger trains reached the railway station during the early hours, none plied after that. Commercial establishments, including those in the Chala Bazaar and the Connemara Market at Palayam, also remained shut throughout the day with traders’ organisation pledging support to the curfew.

In adherence to the existing restrictions, Christian denominations had exhorted its devotees to refrain from attending the Holy Mass. Only the Bishops, vicars, deacons and others involved in the conduct of prayers could be seen in attendance. Most denominations webcast the Holy Mass. It could perhaps be for the first time that the churches in the district, including the 147-year-old St. Joseph’s Metropolitan Cathedral at Palayam, conducted their prayer services without the laity.

Many State Ministers, political leaders and residents associations were engaged in clean-up efforts in their residences. Officials of the Kerala Fire and Rescue Services sanitised the East Fort and Thampanoor bus stations using disinfectants.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/7tvqil/article31137694.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23TVTVCITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/janata-curfew-total-inthiruvananthapuram/article31137699.ece

429,2020/03/23,Postponement of SSLC exam evokes mixed reaction from teachers,"Teachers handling SSLC classes have a mixed opinion of the government's decision to postpone the public exam in view of the COVID-19 scare.

While acknowledging that postponement of the public exam was inevitable, they are apprehensive and are uncertain whether the students will make the best use of the holidays in between to prepare well for the exams. Not all teachers believe that the duration of holidays would be put to best use by the students.

“Unlike students in private institutions who can be pushed into making the preparations, in government or government-aided schools, the lack of seriousness of the students, in general, towards academic matters will only make matters worse,” a teacher said.

Sources in the School Education Department say that the government was keen about increasing the pass percentage in the public examinations.

Pass percentage

Last year, the overall pass percentage of the Tamil Nadu board Xth Standard exam was 95.2.

The overall performance of boys was 93.3 % and that of girls 97 %.

This time around, the School Education Department is understood to have issued instructions to the district level officials that the overall pass percentage must be higher by one or two percentage points.

“This implies that the valuation will have to be more liberal. But then, it would mean defying the very purpose of upgrading the syllabi on par with CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) contents,” another teacher pointed out.

As such, the school heads prefer to be in the safe zone by prevailing upon teachers undertaking valuation duty to award marks liberally to the students.

“In case of failures, we would be penalised otherwise,” a headmaster of a government school said.

The fear of the teachers is that after the rigorous phase of preparation towards the end of the academic year, the lengthy stretch of holidays would infuse a sense of lethargy in the minds of students.

“We have no way to wean them away from the mindset of procrastination. Perhaps, the parents must step in and help out the teachers who find themselves in dire straits,” another headmaster said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/postponement-of-sslc-exam-evokes-mixed-reaction-from-teachers/article31144923.ece
430,2020/03/23,Stickers to be pasted on quarantined persons houses,"Houses of persons who are advised to be in home quarantine would henceforth be pasted with stickers providing details of the individuals and warning people not to enter the houses.

According to official sources, a total of 516 persons who have arrived from foreign countries are under the surveillance of the Health Department in Thanjavur district. They have been stamped on their left hand and they will come under the surveillance of the team comprising of health, revenue, and police departments for the next 28 days from the date of stamping.

Such persons have been directed not to mingle or take part in social events and remain in house quarantine for the specified period.

The purpose of affixing the stickers was to advise the neighbours not to come into contact with the persons under surveillance or any other person residing in that residence in order to avoid contracting the suspected infection. The main objective of pasting the stickers was to check the possible spreading of the virus infection, if any, from the suspected persons to the society.

The relatives of house quarantined persons would also be brought under surveillance and healthcare by the department. As on March 22, a total of 622 persons have arrived from foreign countries and among them 106 have completed the quarantine surveillance period of 28 days though they had been screened for the COVID-19 virus infection at the airports itself.

Apart from this, 47 persons who arrived from other districts or States and suspected to be suffering from the COVID-19 symptoms have also been brought under the surveillance of the Health Department, sources added.

Pudukottai

The Pudukottai district administration has commenced the exercise of pasting stickers at the residences of about 600 persons who had been advised home quarantine on return to the district from abroad.

The exercise has been put in place to segregate them from others. District Collector P. Uma Maheswari in a press release said 788 persons had returned to Pudukottai district from abroad. Of them 188 were healthy after the expiry of the 28-day quarantine period.

The remaining 600 persons were being monitored by health department officials. The Collector appealed to those who had returned from abroad and under quarantine to desist from venturing out from their respective home. Action as per law would be initiated against them if they violated the government's instruction. Stamping had been done on the hands of those who returned from abroad and were under quarantine to identify them easily and to keep a distance from them, the release added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/7qlt7w/article31144336.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY24STICKERTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/stickers-to-be-pasted-on-quarantined-persons-houses/article31144338.ece

436,2020/03/23,Food delivery boys at their wits’ end,"Orders booked could not be fulfilled because of ‘Janata Curfew’

A few delivery boys of Swiggy, an online food ordering and delivery platform, assembled outside Srinivasa Biryani on the Pantakaluva Road at noon on Sunday only to be chased away by the police.

The ‘Janata Curfew’ observed on the day brought misery to them in more ways than one.

Firstly, they had to travel all the way from their residences to the restaurants and hotels only to find them closed. Secondly, they stand to lose heavily on the wages front.

“We have decided to work as the company pays us an incentive ₹800 on Sundays,” they said.

“A similar incentive is paid to those working in other companies like Zomato,” they said.

The delivery boys were at their wits’ end as neither the restaurants and hotels nor the company informed the customers that they would not be taking orders on the day.

The online food ordering and delivery platforms did not show the list of restaurants that were closed as part of the Janata Curfew.

Since the food delivery app was working as usual, customers placed orders for food.

“A dozen orders have been cancelled since morning. In fact, we had to call the customers and explain the ground situation. We have requested them to cancel the orders,” said a delivery boy on condition of anonymity.

“If an order is cancelled, the delivery boy is paid ₹10. If the amount spent on petrol and the number of orders cancelled is counted, there will be nothing left for us,” said another delivery boy.

“On Sundays, each of us attends to 25 to 30 orders. On working days, it will be around 20 orders,” they said.

Even as they were pouring out their woes, a police vehicle stopped by them and the policemen asked them to disperse immediately.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/6m9cb8/article31137540.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23VJFOODDELIVERYPERSONS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/food-delivery-boys-at-their-wits-end/article31137541.ece

Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao said that the district was gearing up to handle a stage-III outbreak of COVID-19.

As of now we are still in the Stage-II, where the infected are mostly foreign returned. But to handle further eventualities, we are getting ready at least 1,200 beds for quarantine, he said.

According to him, Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) has about 400 beds and another 800 have been identified at GITAM Institute of Medical Sciences and Research and Gayatri Vidya Parishad Medical College.

This apart, for isolation we have around 100 beds in Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Disease and KGH and another 20-bed facility is being created at VIMS, he said. About 20 ventilators have been kept ready.

Talking about the present status, he said that 31 people are in quarantine in VIMS and the daughter of the positive person has developed systems. “We are monitoring her, as both her mother and father have tested positive and are recovering,” he said. He also informed that all the 31 at VIMS are foreign returnees, including one from China.

One more foreign-returned case from Bheemunipatnam with symptoms have been admitted into the isolation ward, said Mr. Srinivasa Rao.

“We are also approaching a few private hospitals for setting up quarantine and isolation wards,” he said.

Social responsibility

The Minister appealed to the people to remain calm and be more responsible.

“This cannot be tackled merely by enforcement. People have to cooperate with the government machinery. When it is told to maintain social isolation, it should be adhered to, as this is the only way to beat the crisis,” he said.

He also appealed to people who have come from abroad in the recent times and those who have come into contact with them, to go into voluntary quarantine or disclose their health status to the MRO or approach the hospital or officials concerned.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/nukqvk/article31144735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24-VZ-MINISTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/officials-gearing-up-to-face-stage-iii-outbreak-of-covid-19-says-minister/article31143530.ece
442,2020/03/23,"City faces scarcity of sanitisers, masks and thermal guns","We hope to get 18,000 masks in the next two days, says official

The scarcity of sanitisers, masks and even thermal guns continued, even as the authorities concerned are making efforts to procure stocks in Visakhapatnam on Sunday.

While some of the drug stores also remained closed in view of the Janata curfew, many of those which remained open did not even have ordinary masks, leave alone expensive N 95 and N 99 masks. Thermal guns were also not available at the surgical stores.

Some of the medical stores, which had ordinary masks, were selling at high prices. These masks, which cost around ₹8, are being sold at ₹30 or more in view of the scarcity. While everyone doesn’t need a mask, doctors, health workers, family members and relatives of patients require N 95 and N 99 masks to protect themselves from getting infected by COVID-19 coronavirus.

All offices, shops and establishments, irrespective of their size, should preferably use thermal guns to test their employees and clients. They cost upwards from ₹1,500 but they are now being sold at 10 times their prices. They are not available at the most of the surgical shops even at a premium.

“The government should supply masks, sanitisers and thermal guns to the people through various departments to bring the prices under control. This will prevent fleecing of buyers,” says Praja Arogya Vedika (PAV) general secretary T. Kameswara Rao.

“Sanitisers are also out of stock at many medical stores. Some unscrupulous traders are procuring sanitisers, being manufactured locally, with less alcohol content and selling them at a premium,” according to a consumer, who did not want to be identified.

“We have been conducting raids on medical shops to ensure that they sell at the MRP. There is a scarcity of sanitisers, masks and thermal guns as stocks are not coming from the suppliers in view of the sudden spurt in demand. Our Director General has spoken to the manufacturers for supply of masks and we hope to get 18,000 masks for Visakhapatnam district in the next two days.

District administration is gearing up for the city lockdown amid COVID-19 scare. After its official announcement, Chief Minister Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy conducted a video conference and interacted with the officials from district administration. He asked the officials to make sure public do not face any scarcity for essential commodities. The district administration was also ordered to take strict action against shopkeepers who charge extra for the commodities.

According to official from district administration, public need not panic as all the essential commodities will be available. Only the non-essential stores like garment shops, jewellery marts. mobile shops, furniture stores and others will be closed down. It was also learnt that all important government bodies including police, hospitals, many wings of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) like sanitary, water supply, public health, emergency courts, electricity department and others will function for the convenience of public.

“As per the instructions, all essential commodities including grocery stores, fish, meat shops, medical stores, are permitted to run. Hotels will be also allowed to run, but only to give take away facility or food delivery services for its customers,” said a official from district administration.

Already, malls, multiplexes, educational institutions, swimming pools, gyms and other places have been closed. It would continue till the lockdown period, he added.

445,2020/03/23,Are citizens doing their part to fight COVID-19?,"People need to follow guidelines on personal hygiene and social interaction strictly to keep themselves safe and check spread of the virus, say experts

The confirmation of a COVID-19 positive case, the first in the port city, late on Thursday night has sent a wave of fear among the citizens. The travel itinerary of the patient, the places visited and the route taken by him were circulated on different Whatsapp groups by Friday morning.

The timings of his visit to different areas were mentioned in the Whatsapp messages, and members of the groups were asked to check if they or their acquaintances were present in those areas at that time. Such persons were advised to get themselves tested. The tech-savvy generation circulating correct information on social media has been termed as ‘appreciable’ as it can be helpful for others to take added precautions.

However, fake Whatsapp messages started doing the rounds by Friday afternoon that the man had died, though he was very much alive. Following this, people were urged not to circulate false information as it can cause unnecessary scare and irreversible damage.

On the other hand, the authorities stress the need to follow the guidelines being issued by the government and the medical fraternity from time to time for people to remain safe and prevent the spread of coronavirus.

""The central and State governments are making all possible efforts for preventing the spread of the disease but what are we as citizens doing to fight the disease?"" ask some concerned citizens. ""Wuhan, the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak, has not reported any new cases. The credit should go not just to the Chinese government but also to the citizens, who locked themselves in their homes till such time the government had declared that it was safe for them to come out,"" they say.

Belgian’s case

In a recent case, a Belgian national was suspected of showing COVID-19 symptoms. He was employed in a private company at Atchutapuram, about 45 km from the city, and staying at an apartment complex in that area. He reportedly went to Belgium a month ago and returned to the city. During his visit to Belgium, he was said to have met a COVID-19 patient. He was admitted to the Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases (GHCCD) in the city on March 16.

Dr. P.V. Sudhakar, principal of the Andhra Medical College (AMC), tells The Hindu that the patient had threatened to leave the hospital as he wanted better facilities. ""I told him when you are in India, you have to follow the rules here failing which you can be arrested under the Epidemics Act and jailed for six months. He tested COVID-19 negative and was discharged from the hospital on March 19 night and advised to remain in home quarantine for sometime,"" Dr. Sudhakar says.

Reluctant officials

The other day at a central government office in the city, a senior official was reluctant to stand in queue for the mandatory washing of hands with sanitiser and thermal testing, put up at the entrance to the office complex.

He tried to reason with the staff members that he was coming straight from his home and there was no need for him to wash his hands again. He relented after he was told that even his senior colleagues had come in the queue. ""Officials, people’s representatives, and celebrities are supposed to set an example to others but here we find those in power trying to defeat the purpose of the whole exercise,"" said an official, who was witness to the incident.

‘More labs needed’

""Awareness and self-quarantine are the key to preventing a catastrophe. Our density of population is much higher than that of China and a vast majority of them are poor. More testing labs are needed for quick detection and treatment,"" says Praja Arogya Vedika general secretary T. Kameswara Rao.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/are-citizens-doing-their-part-to-fight-covid-19/article31138030.ece
446,2020/03/23,How Kerala Police is making waves on social media,"While the hand-washing dance video posted by the Media Centre on March 17 has been watched by over 31 lakh people with nearly 40,000 shares, the ‘Break the Chain’ video posted by the Social Media Cell released on March 20 has got close to 3 million views

The spread of COVID-19 has put the Kerala Police on high alert. Two wings under the department — Kerala Police Social Media Cell and State Police Media Centre — are working non-stop to create awareness about the virus, precautions to be taken and social distancing through videos, posts, memes and trolls on social media.

While the hand-washing dance video posted by the Media Centre on March 17 has been watched by over 31 lakh people with nearly 40,000 shares, the ‘Break the Chain’ video posted by the Social Media Cell released on March 20 has got close to 3 million views.

“We didn’t expect such a reach for the videos. Whenever there is a disaster, the police department is physically present to handle the situation. But in this case, social distancing is the need of the hour. So we have to stay away from people but have to be with them as well. That’s where digital means come into the picture,” says Manoj Abraham, ADGP, Headquarters, and nodal officer of the Social Media Cell.

He adds that the department wanted to do something different from the posts and videos that had flooded the social media. “It had to be reassuring, should leave an impression on the conscience of the people and, at the same time, be light-hearted because we didn’t want to instil fear in the society. The reach of the videos prove that people have connected with the content. It is important to note that we have only policemen working in front of and behind the camera in these videos,” he says.

The dance video has six policemen in the uniform showing the right way to wash the hands to the tune of the song, ‘Kalakkatha’ from the movie Ayyappanum Koshiyum. “It was an amateurish attempt and so the overwhelming response for the video has surprised us. The shoot was done in our office itself with our own staff members shooting it and handling the camera and editing. We decided to stick to the uniform so that people would notice it. The policemen had rehearsed just for an hour. Easy steps were chosen because none of them are dancers,” says VP Pramod Kumar, deputy director, Social Media Centre, which has nine policemen as staff members. The video went on to be appreciated by international media, including networks such as BBC, Reuters, AFP, ANI and BBC, besides channels in the US, Russia, the UK, China, Italy and the Netherlands. “The US Embassy in Delhi also shared it on their page. I also got a photograph from London where they showed it on the LED Wall at one of the tube stations,” adds Pramod.

The ‘Break the Chain’ video by Social Media Cell is dedicated to the “officials and staff members of health department, volunteers, police personnel and journalists who stand bold and fearless in the face of the disease.” Directed by Arun BT, a member of the Media Cell, it is inspired by a scene from Lucifer in which Mohanlal’s character, Stephen Nedumbally, is bashing up a gang of goondas. The ‘virus’— created using VFX — is chasing our hero, a common man clad in a lungi and T-shirt. Then comes the saviours – a doctor, a policeman, a mask and hand sanitiser. He challenges the ‘virus’ for a dual, with ‘Kadavule Pole’, all to the track from Lucifer playing in the background. He folds and tucks his dhoti and twirls his moustache,a la Mohanlal’s character in the movie, and challenges his opponents with his dialogue, ‘Vaada’. And the virus runs for its life!

The video, shot on the premises of Tagore Theatre in the capital city, has six members of the Media Cell and policemen from other offices of the Department working on it. “This include 3D Animation & VFX as well, which is done by Bimal VS, a member of the Media Cell,” Arun says.

https://www.facebook.com/keralapolice/videos/206425590451348/?v=206425590451348

Launched in April 2018, the Media Cell became the talk of the town after its Facebook page with trolls and memes went viral. It now has 13 lakh followers and is listed among the best Facebook pages of police departments across the world. “Interested police personnel were asked to appear for a written test. Those who cleared it had a practical exam, which tested our computer knowledge, command over Photoshop and video editing and skill in making trolls,” explains Arun.

Both Media Cell and Media Centre, also started in 2018, have been uploading videos based on scenes from Malayalam movies relating them to steps to be taken to stay safe. “In one video we had mimicry artist Sudheesh Thiruvambady dubbing in the voice of Suraj Venjaramoodu. He is a follower of our page. The second video has the voice of Prem Nazir, dubbed by Santhosh Saraswathi, a member of the Cell,” says Arun. Fahadh Faasil was roped in for another awareness video, relating it to his character of Harikrishan from North 24 Kaatham who has OCD.

447,2020/03/23,Coronavirus | Study warned of epidemic in February,"Focus must have been on finding transmission in community.

Scientists and mathematical modellers — including prominent scientists at the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) — concluded in February that a coronavirus (COVID-19) “epidemic” in India is inevitable and the most aggressive airport screening would have delayed India’s first 1,000 cases by at most 45 days. India’s health system should have focussed early on finding transmission in the community and quarantining, instead of border control, independent experts who have analysed the paper told The Hindu.

There is no projection of the number of expected cases, or mortality from the epidemic, but the paper notes that five per cent of the infected patients will require intensive care and half of those admitted in the intensive care will require mechanical ventilation, says the research paper published online as part of a special issue on COVID-19 in the Indian Journal of Medical Research. The researchers include scientists from multiple ICMR institutes — many of whom are at the forefront of India’s defence against COVID-19 — as well as mathematical modelling experts from School of Public Health, Imperial College and St. Mary’s Hospital, London, U.K.

“Our results suggest that in order to have an appreciable effect on delaying the establishment of transmission of COVID-19 in India, airport arrival screening will need to have near-complete capture of incoming COVID-19 cases, including asymptomatic cases. Our analysis shows that even if symptomatic cases are comprehensively identified and quarantined, the delay in epidemic timing within India would be in days, and not weeks,” the study notes.

Importantly, these projections only considered traffic from China and did not account for incoming infected Indians from Italy, the United States and Europe. While air traffic into India has entirely ceased from Monday night, there’s no evidence to conclusively tell how many Sars cov2 symptomatic passengers were apprehended early on. Yet a projection cited in the study suggest that this has been nowhere near ideal.

The modellers said that data shared by the Delhi Health Department, till February 13, 2020, found that 17 of 5700 passengers, or 0.3% of passengers who had arrived from China and other COVID-19-affected countries prior to the beginning of airport screening from January 15, 2020, were found to be symptomatic and hospitalised, while the rest were advised home isolation. “Our results suggest that it may be possible to interrupt the transmission of COVID-19 in India, but only in the most optimistic scenarios... symptomatic quarantine can still achieve meaningful reductions in peak prevalence... However, such measures would have very little effect on the overall epidemic size. The actual numerical impact will be highly sensitive to the natural history of COVID-19, the parameters for which are very uncertain at present,” the authors noted.

The study also did not say how many beds or ventilators were necessary for COVID-19 cases in February.

Experts not connected to the study said that the modelling study ought to have made more detailed projections, such as whether there would have been gains from aggressively increasing testing to look at all suspected patients who showed symptoms of COVID-19 as opposed to the government’s focus on maintaining that there was no evidence of “community transmission” and focussing on imported infections. “Containment here refers to the strategy of screening incoming international passengers from COVID-affected countries at the port of entry and testing them and their contacts across the period of their quarantine. The basic message of the paper is that we should abandon containment and not spend resources on that and focus instead on mitigation,” said Gautam Menon, a mathematical modeller and professor at the Ashoka University, Sonepat. Containment refers to screening at airport and mitigation means focussing on symptomatic surveillance and quarantining those showing symptoms. The ICMR-recommended and government strategy has largely focussed on monitoring those coming from abroad and their contacts. Only last week, it expanded surveillance to health care workers treating COVID infected patients and patients with severe respiratory illnesses.

ICMR officials have maintained that there were no instances of community transmission, premised largely on randomly collected 1000-odd samples from 70 collection centres of instances of severe respiratory illnesses. “The paper also doesn’t account for the impact of social distancing, seasonal impact and the ongoing lockdown. I would have also expected an increased analysis of the impact on the healthcare system as a consequence of the epidemic,” Mr. Menon told The Hindu.

Another senior scientist familiar with infectious disease patterns but who didn’t want to be identified said the model did not really capture what was happening in India. It rather relied on the experience from elsewhere. “We did very limited actual testing. This paper is saying, “Our strategy is wrong because we are missing a lot. We accept that we have missed a lot, and there is no way we could have prevented it from it getting into the community.”

“It would be surprising if India didn't follow the trajectory as in the rest of the world,” said Mr. Menon.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/aytm9s/article31145399.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23IN-VIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/study-warned-of-epidemic-in-february/article31145400.ece
448,2020/03/23,TB and Coronavirus: A curable and incurable crisis,"A lack of availability of drugs for a disease like TB — that affects 30 lakh Indians each year — is a blunder.

As India reels under the growing crisis of COVID-19, an unrelenting virus that threatens to destroy lives, it may be time to remember a long-standing and devastating foe — Tuberculosis or TB. Ironically, though the two diseases have numerous similarities, the one striking difference is that TB is curable but COVID-19’s cure is uncertain.

The media is filled with headlines about COVID-19 and the impending crisis. Lost somewhere in this fear are stories of thousands of TB patients who die each year. TB kills more than 1,400 Indians every day — a scary number even for the coronavirus. What’s more, TB doesn’t just destroy lives, it pushes millions into poverty and debt even when its more dangerous forms such as drug resistant (DR) TB remain curable.

So, why does this curable disease kill so many? A key reason is that lakhs of Indians even today lack awareness and access to accurate diagnosis, and the drugs required for fighting TB, much like the coronavirus.

Overburdened system

This is most evident in the case of DR TB where patients often fail to access testing and medication. DR TB affects close to 2 lakh Indians annually. Some cannot afford tests and treatment while others are caught somewhere between an overburdened government system and a profit-driven private sector to access tests and treatment. Each year, this figure rises and mortality for DR TB grows. In short, we have de-prioritised public health so much that we are guilty of feeding this crisis by neglect and apathy.

Let's look at the facts. Even today, drug susceptibility remains inaccessible and unaffordable for most Indians. Despite government efforts, long waiting times in the public sector and exorbitant private sector pricing makes wide-scale testing impossible. As a result, numerous cases remain undetected and transmission is unabated. Considering India’s TB burden, these tests should be accessible and affordable if not widely available free of cost. Are they?

The challenges around treatment are severe. Currently, there is a stock out of Clofamzamine — an essential drug for treating DR TB — in India’s private sector, where millions seek care. Its unavailability complicates matters for thousands. The alternative to this drug is Linezolid — a drug with serious side-effects. In many cases, due to such side effects, patients give up on treatment.

Difficult to access

Another case is the access to new anti-TB drugs Bedaquiline and Delamanid. While India has expanded access to Bedaquiline, it still remains available to only a fraction of those that need it. Despite the best intentions, World Health Organization recommendations, and growing evidence of effectiveness, insufficient procurement, delays coupled with a reluctance to share it with patients in the private sector have made this drug difficult to access.

As per recent reports, a similar problem exists in the form of depleting stocks of another new anti-TB drug, Delamanid. This is dangerous but particularly disturbing for the paediatric DR TB population, as Bedaquiline has not been approved for pediatric use and this is the only other new drug available to them.

The inability to resolve the access to diagnosis and drugs is possibly both a moral, and public health failure. We don’t have a cure for the coronavirus but we do have the ability to treat TB easily and still thousands die daily. Is this neglect, or apathy, or both?

As a nation, we should ask ourselves, where should the powerless and poor patient go whether affected by TB or coronavirus? The public sector is paternalistic to its own patients and often lukewarm to those seeking care in the private sector. The private sector, profit driven, has no inclination or power to solve these problems for patients. They only prescribe treatment — availability is not their concern. With insufficient access to and the resulting increased transmission of disease, who is responsible for India’s growing DR TB crisis?

Act immediately

We need to act immediately to resolve this situation. The government needs an independent body tasked with forecasting and procuring these tests and other essential TB drugs, and make them available to all patients in the public and private sector. A lack of availability of drugs for a disease like TB — that affects 30 lakh Indians each year — is not a lapse, it is a blunder.

We need political but also financial commitment to ensure availability and easy accessibility of these tests and drugs to all TB patients. We also need to hold the private sector accountable for producing essential tests and drugs in supply, and available at affordable prices. To do this, we must work more effectively with the private sector and create a relationship of mutual trust. The government should create, in each city, centres of excellence within the private sector which can responsibly administer these newer regimens and drugs. This is critical as the public sector is already overburdened and often short on human resources.

Wake-up call

We cannot forget that at the heart of this crisis are patients who are vulnerable, often poor, with little agency. They are struggling to defeat TB and these tests and drugs are their legal right, but instead we reduce them to supplicating for access.

COVID-19 is a wake-up call to the entire health system and how it disregards the needs of those fighting diseases like TB. If we ignore even one patient, not only do we risk their lives, we risk the spread of TB and Corona. It’s time to fight COVID-19 and TB, just as it is time to invest in public health.

India has reported 471 cases with 441 active cases and nine fatalities, the Union Health Ministry said on Monday.

The use of hydroxyl chloroquine as prophylaxis for high risk population faced with the SARS-CoV-2 infection was recommended by the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) national task force on Monday.

ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava told a press briefing: “Only asymptomatic health care workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 and asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases should be allowed to use this. The protocol recommended by the National Task force has been approved by the Drug Controller General of India for restricted use in emergency situations.”

He added that placing of healthcare workers under chemoprophylaxis should not instil a sense of false security.

“They should follow all prescribed public health measures such as frequent washing of hands, respiratory etiquettes, keeping a minimum distance and use of personal protective equipment (wherever applicable),” Prof. Bhargava said.

Also a day after the Council allowed private labs to test for COVID-19, Prof. Bhargava said the ICMR has now expedited approvals for manufacturing of domestic commercial testing kits.

“We are fast tracking approval for kit manufacturers. We want to clarify that those kits need not have USFDA or European CE approval but will need an ICMR-National Institute of Virology approval. Two such manufactures have already been approved,” he said.

“For private labs, we have issued detailed guidelines and 12 lab chains have been registered and they have begun work. They have 15,000 collection centres across India and these labs will increase as and when they register,” Prof. Bhargava said. Under ICMR's network, 111 labs are functional and government's testing capacity is over 10,000 samples per day, ICMR has said.

Meanwhile, clearing rumors about the mode of transmission of the virus Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia said: “Airborne spread has not been reported for COVID-19. Based on the information received so far and on our experience with other coronaviruses, COVID-19 appears to spread mostly through respiratory droplets (for instance produced when a sick person coughs) and close contact. This is why WHO recommends maintaining hand and respiratory hygiene.”

She added that the Chinese authorities reported that there could be a possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment with prolonged exposure to high concentrations of aerosols, like in ICUs and CCUs in hospitals, but more investigations and analysis of epidemiological data is needed to understand this mode of transmission of the virus.”

Speaking on the shortage of personal protection equipment, the Union Health Ministry said the government is augmenting supplies of body coveralls, N-95 Masks, and 2-ply/3-ply surgical masks for healthcare professionals dealing COVID-19 cases.

“Since Body Coveralls (PPE) is a specialised protective suit meant for high level of protection to the health professionals, it has stringent technical requirements. Over the last 45 days, the Health and Textiles Ministry is attempting to locate adequate number of sources who can produce and supply the requirement of body coveralls for the government,’’ said a senior health official.

He added that during the last week of January 2020, the technical standard for the coveralls was prescribed as per WHO class-3 exposure pressure in accordance with ISO 16003 or its equivalent. Such materials are manufactured by a few international companies, who expressed their inability to supply on account of massive demand and ban on exports by the source countries.

“Only a limited quantity was offered and procured. So far, proto type garments of six Indian manufacturers have passed the prescribed tests and now we are continuously working to streamline the supply chain, remove bottlenecks and maintain a steady supply of all materials required for the healthcare professionals,” he added.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/r8mgt1/article31145557.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23IN-COFFIN,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-icmr-prescribes-anti-malarial-drug-for-high-risk-covid-19-cases/article31142391.ece
450,2020/03/23,"Coronavirus | Supreme Court places plea for more testing labs, isolation centres before government","Representation also demands immediate steps to facilitate thermal screening at public places.

The Supreme Court on Monday converted a petition seeking a direction to increase the Coronavirus testing laboratories and quarantine/isolation centres across the country, especially in the rural parts, into a representation to be placed before the government for immediate action.

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde remarked orally that the government was working hard to contain the virus and agreed with petitioners’ advocate Fuzail Ahmad Ayyubi, appearing for journalist Prashant Tandon and activist Kunjana Singh, that “time is of essence”.

“The petition was filed eight days ago when the court reopened after the Holi break. Merely issuing notice now and waiting for a reply from the government would take time. What we need now is immediate steps. So, though the court initially thought of issuing notice, it later felt it would be better if the petition was directly placed before the government for immediate steps,"" Mr. Ayyubi explained to The Hindu.

The petition said an “exponential increase in the number of authorised laboratories for testing Coronavirus (COVID-19) was necessary to ensure widespread accessibility of the testing centres given the huge population of our country”.

The plea said the government should make available temporary hospital beds and other facilities for rural patients to be combat-ready for any exigency in case of a possible outbreak in the rural areas.

Also, immediate steps should be taken to facilitate thermal screening at public places as a precautionary measure to contain the outbreak.

“Moreover, facilities should be built from primary health centre level at the block to the district level, so that each district is turned into a self-sustaining unit, including laboratories to test, quarantine centres to inhabit infected individuals and to have temporary hospitals, fully-equipped to respond in the eventuality of an outbreak,” the petition said.

451,2020/03/23,Fish fossil show how fins evolved into human hands,"Their evolution into four-legged vertebrates was one of the most significant events, says study

Researchers have revealed new insights into how the human hand evolved from fish fins based on their analysis of an ancient fossil found in Miguasha, Canada.

Palaeontologists, including those from Flinders University in Australia, said the fish specimen has yielded the missing evolutionary link in the transition from fish to four legged animals.

They said this happened during the Late Devonian period, millions of years ago, as fish began to foray in habitats such as shallow water and land.

The study, published in the journal Nature, noted that the 1.57 m long fossil shows the complete arm — pectoral fin — skeleton for the first time in any elpistostegalian fish.

Using high energy X-Ray CT-scans, the scientists assessed the skeleton of the pectoral fin, revealing the presence of a humerus (arm), radius and ulna (forearm), rows of carpus (wrist) and phalanges organized in digits (fingers).

“This is the first time that we have unequivocally discovered fingers locked in a fin with fin-rays in any known fish,” said John Long, study co-author from Flinders University professor. “The articulating digits in the fin are like the finger bones found in the hands of most animals,” Mr. Long said.

The finding, according to the researchers, pushes back the origin of fingers in vertebrates to the fish level. They said it also reveals that the patterning for the vertebrate hand was first developed deep in evolution, just before fishes left the water.

The evolution of fishes into four-legged vertebrates was one of the most significant events in the history of life, the study noted.

With this adaptation, the scientists said, vertebrates, or back-boned animals, were then able to leave the water and conquer land.

To complete this transition, they said, one of the most significant changes was the evolution of hands and feet. “The origin of digits relates to developing the capability for the fish to support its weight in shallow water or for short trips out on land. The increased number of small bones in the fin allows more planes of flexibility to spread out its weight through the fin,” said study co-author Richard Cloutier from the Universite du Quebec in Canada.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/kd5dpr/article31139804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Elpistostege-watsoni,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/fish-fossil-show-how-fins-evolved-into-human-hands/article31139805.ece
