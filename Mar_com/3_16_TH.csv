1,2020/03/16,A shot in the arm,"Former skipper Shantha Rangaswamy talks about what worked and what did not at the Women’s T20 World Cup

It was with bated breath that the Indian cricket fans awaited for a triumphant end to the Indian women’s team campaign in the T20 World Cup as India took on Australia on International Women’s Day. They played before a jam-packed MCG grounds in Melbourne. Expectations rose after India stormed into the finals, winning four straight league matches in Group A. The semi-finals against England, was a wash out and catapulted India into the finals. However, a billion hearts broke as India succumbed to a 85-run defeat in a one-sided encounter.

Yes, it was an anti climax for India, but there were plenty of positive takeaways for the team, feels former Indian skipper and Bengaluru’s Shantha Rangaswamy, also a former National selector for the women’s cricket.

The veteran cricketer, stresses the need to take an overall view of the Indian performance and not judge by the final game alone. “Our girls could not carry the momentum into the final after such a brilliant display in the league. But, let us give them credit for their overall performance in the tournament. They beat Australia in the opening tie in the league. They could not repeat it in the final, but that is cricket. The Indian performance is sure to make a huge impact on youngsters and I am sure many more girls will now take up the sport in the country,” believes Shantha.

Referring to the final match, she states, “Winning of the toss would have made a difference and there would have been less pressure on our team. By allowing Australia to run up a total of 184, we faced a daunting task of scoring nine runs per over, which in women’s T20 game is a huge task. The team caved in when the top and middle order batting collapsed under pressure.”

Shantha, however, praised the Indian bowlers who were able to restrict rivals and bowl them out while defending a modest total in the league ties. “Our batswomen did not play to their potential, barring Shafali Verma,” feels Shantha.

The 16-year-old teenage sensation from Haryana, Shafali, was the find of the tournament. She scored 163 runs in five innings with an average of 32. 60. The opener’s explosive start gave India the edge in the league. Praising Shafali for her stunning performance, Shantha said, “She was brilliant and played with maturity beyond her age.”

Shantha expressed concern about the form of current Indian captain, Harmanpreet Kaur. “I feel Harman’s poor run with the bat has something to do with the pressure of captaincy. She is a free flowing bats-woman and I am surprised she failed to perform. I wish she focuses on her batting and Smriti Mandhana can take care of the captaincy.”

Shantha was elated with the wide media coverage for the women’s T20 event, especially the electronic media which gave them a prime time coverage. “A massive turnout of 85,000 for the final as reported in the media, is indeed an index of the growing popularity of the women’s game,” observes Shantha.

Painting a bright future for the game, Shantha is confident that there will be an IPL version for the women’s team too.

Shantha advocates a good feeder system for the women’s game. “BCCI is rolling out tournaments for Under-16 players and feels more youngsters could take up the game early. “It will create a large number of players and provide a wider base for the sport.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/xicokv/article31082176.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGMSHANTA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/former-skipper-shantha-rangaswamy-on-what-worked-and-what-did-not-at-the-womens-t20-world-cup/article31082179.ece
2,2020/03/16,‘Nioh perfect’: Sequel game 'Nioh 2' offers great character builds and fast combat mechanics,"Leave it to Team Ninja to up the ante with Nioh 2, which brings an elevated Souls game experience

From Software’s Dark Souls and its successors, have carved a bloody little niche for themselves called masocore: games that pride themselves over their brutal difficulty and sell like hot cakes. They also end up taking awards home, like with Sekiro. Showing that people just love punishment. Though, before From Software, Team Ninja was the reigning tough game champ, and with 2017’s Nioh, they proved they still got it and more. Now they are ready to make our fingers ache with Nioh 2.

Screenshot from Nioh 2

Nioh is an action adventure set in an alternate history Japan of 1555, overrun by supernatural monsters known as Yokai. Where the first game had a Geralt of Rivia-like protagonist, you now play a mysterious half-human, half-Yokai warrior.

Truth be told, while Nioh 2 does spin quite a good tale, I frequently found myself lost in feudal lord names. Somehow it still has not quite reached the passive storytelling chops of Dark Souls but does a decent job.

Nioh 2 Developer: Team Ninja

Publisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment

Price: ₹3999 for PS4

Detailed builds

The character creator is mind blowing and gender fluid, with a lot of intricacy packed into creating the character that best represents you. Rather than locking the races down to oriental, you can set your skin colour and race appropriately.

Nioh’s fighting system is weapons-based, all with own movesets. Your selected weapons, along with magic and your selected yokai spirit, define your character letting you tune and tweak your build as you get more powerful, the more familiar you are with your steel.

The swordplay is fast and furious with a definitive rhythm and flow; there are three stances across two switchable melee and ranged weapons. Managing your Ki is, well, key; this is the stamina drain from combat that can be recouped by pulsing it at the right time. The Yokai throw up constant negative fields, which can only be dispelled with a pulse. It all may seem overwhelming, but there is a beautiful depth.

Screenshot from Nioh 2

As with all Souls games, Nioh 2 is tough. Grunts and giant Yokais have brutal one-hit kill moves for insta-kills. You will die a lot, but take dying, not as a sign of failure but as a gameplay mechanic. The new Burst Counter is a great addition to combat, which triggers a Yokai killer move. The timing is critical, you are open to a killer blow if you miss. Yokai attacks are varied, but if you die, you have to run all the way back to reclaim the power from the spot at which you died.

Rewards, galore

Much like Diablo III, the game throws loot at you, all segregated with appropriate rarity colours. While this may seem like a good thing, most of the drops are non-consequential rolls, making most of your precious gaming time spent at the menu screens, breaking down weapons for materials or selling them. Inventory management is crucial in any game, but Nioh can go overboard sometimes. Though, if you are diligent, you can convert several mediocre weapons into some really good ones.

Screenshot from Nioh 2

The levels are mostly picturesque yet deadly. While the levels are not as drab as the first game, they can get quite twisted and labyrinthine. In fact, stopping to admire the beautiful scenery can be fatal. No one in the industry does beauty better than Team Ninja and it reflects in the character models, which almost border on K-pop singer-like aesthetics. Making tweaking your period fashion a lot more fun than your average Souls game.

Nioh 2 feels like what Nioh should have been; it is just more of the same for the fans that love the game, which is not a bad thing. The combat mechanics are fast, and once you master it, they look incredible. The game, highly recommended, is the right amount of challenging, but expect to die a lot.

3,2020/03/16,Data artists and app developers offer new ways of tracking the path of the Coronavirus,"Visualisation also makes it easier to detect patterns, trends, and outliers in groups of data, while apps aim to make understanding on-the-go

As more people across the country are encouraged to work from home, televised news, social media and online forums combined can either be an enlightening or fear-mongering source of information.

And with social distancing now a thing, one can only look at their phone or laptop so many times a day for accurate updates about the spread of COVID-19. Fortunately, a few tech companies are looking to make a contribution to eradicate the fake news floating around, using apps backed by data from official health organisations and medical institutes.

Mobile conundrums An app, by definition, has to make mobile life easier so it is understandable that an app will not be a go-to for medical data. In fact, do a simple search of COVID-19 on any app store and you may not see promising results. A number of questionable apps flooded into app stores across compatibilities since Coronavirus started making headlines, and many of these apps have been flagged for phishing and other malicious activity.

Apple’s App Store and Google Play store moderators are rejecting these apps after doing intense background checks with alerts from suspicious customers. There are, however, developers who want to create helpful apps but they have been rejected as they are not from recognised institutions like governments or hospitals. This is where developers have decided to collaborate with these verified institutions, but need more diversity in providing accurate by-region data internationally.

First, the world saw an app launched on February 8 by NHC, General Office of the State Council and China Electronics Technology Group Corporations (CETC) with support from other government agencies.

This app’s goal is to help people find their risk of contracting coronavirus referred to as ‘close contact detector’. Users must provide their phone number, name and ID number to check if they were in close contact — being in close distance, without any effective protection, with confirmed, suspected or mild cases when the person was ill or asymptomatic — with an infected patient.

A February 11 article by MIT Technology Review critiques the app, explaining, “Such an app would not be possible without the Chinese government’s pervasive, high-tech surveillance of its citizens. A national video camera network, facial recognition software, and Artificial Intelligence combine to ensure that anonymity is almost impossible, although it is not clear which elements are being used to power the app. In any case, it is unlikely to be controversial in China, where attitudes to privacy and freedom differ to the West’s.”

However, there is no concrete information on the accessibility of this app to those outside of China.

A map for mankind

Shriphani Palakodety, a data scientist and artist based in Palo Alto, California, points out that the data visualisations bred from different corners of the Internet are inspiring, even if the subject matter is harrowing.

“This time around, a lot of dashboards went up very quickly showing deaths by location, and other instances. Almost all of them use the dataset compiled by Johns Hopkins which they update everyday. Some of the more interesting stuff came after the last Ebola outbreak, especially from the New England Complex Systems Institute. This for instance is where the value of intervention becomes clear — that is for Ebola but you can switch the parameters and it’ll work fine for COVID-19 on a possibly accelerated timeline.”

A screenshot of the social distancing simulation by The Washington Post published with the story ‘Why outbreaks like coronavirus spread exponentially and how to ‘flatten the curve’’ by Harry Stevens

Shriphani adds that some of the interesting visualisation-animations have come from The Washington Post on March 14 which speaks about social distancing. The simulation sees dots in three colours interacting with each other in certain spaces, charting the changes from good health to infection to treatment, or healthy to sick to recovered. Some simulations, like this one, do not track the progress but do provide perspective on the ripple effect of not socially distancing oneself.

A highly-recommended interactive visual map is that by the folks at HERE Technologies, who have created a detailed and interactive map of the progressing situation, including the total number of confirmed cases, as well as deaths and recoveries.

As Shriphani suggested, Johns Hopkins University’s dataset on GitHub was the chosen source. The details are also minute in that you can explore these numbers by country, and in the case of China, by province.

There is also an app version, according to a blog post dated February 26, which details the development journey of the creation of the interactive map. “Working with live data from different data sources during an evolving virus outbreak meant that we had to adapt and be flexible regarding data collection and processing,” writes Richard Zimmerman.

He adds, “For the [design of] the map itself we opted for Leaflet and Tangram, powered by the HERE Data Hub and HERE Vector Tile API. To allow users to search for specific places, we used the HERE Geolocation Autocomplete API.” This map features a time slider which helps those who want to know the full path of the virus since day one.

“To provide more frequent data updates for the situation in China, we decided to source data directly from the DXY website every 60 minutes. This process is automated, and the data is merged with what is published by JHU about once a day, and all of this is pushed to the HERE Data Hub to be consumed by our app.”

The visualisation, though, is what makes the data accessible, when there are so many numbers floating around the public sphere.

The data imagery make big and small data easier for the human brain to understand, and visualisation also makes it easier to detect patterns, trends, and outliers in groups of data.

“Our map displays data as scaled bubbles, indicating confirmed cases as absolute numbers, rather than normalised values in relation to the population of the place. With absolute counts, choropleth maps are generally not a good option [as it] would have also made it difficult to display data from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, requiring a custom solution for that data point. We opted for a linear scale to show an accurate relationship of the absolute numbers on a global scale.”

Unfortunately, the HERE Technologies visualisation is lacking a few more datasets from international medical institutes which could provide case population data for India by state and city.

Another potential data visualisation is by the Prague-based Windy App. Probably the more interesting infographic is the line graph, where three sets of data are shown in three distinctly-coloured lines: Total, Recovered and Deaths, as per OpenStreetMap networks’ datasets.

Some may glance at the line graph and point out a somewhat positive correlation which is indicated as more resources are pumped into the medical industry for treatment and isolation.

4,2020/03/16,Honor to start selling android smartphone without Google suite from this month,"The smartphone will be the first device from Honor’s stable in India that will come with Huawei Mobile Service suite, which the Chinese major is developing with an investment of USD 1 billion to create an alternate of Google apps, Charles Peng, President, Huawei & Honor India Consumer Business Group said.

With uncertainty over supply ban imposed by the US, smartphone maker Honor plans to start selling Android-based mobile phone, Honor 9X Pro, without Google mobile services suite from last week of March in India.

The smartphone will be the first device from Honor’s stable in India that will come with Huawei Mobile Service suite, which the Chinese major is developing with an investment of USD 1 billion to create an alternate of Google apps, Charles Peng, President, Huawei & Honor India Consumer Business Group told PTI.

“Honor 9X Pro is the first Honor smartphone that will be independent of Google Play store and will feature Huawei AppGallery, one of the world’s top three app stores.We launched the smartphone at a global livestream event last month and are all set to bring the device to India in the month end,” Mr. Peng said.

The company claims to have attracted 1 million app developers for Huawei AppGallery.

Honor will continue using Android operating system as it is an open source platform and free for any company to use it and develop their operating system by using it as a base.

The United States government barred its companies from supplying software and hardware to Huawei in May last year. However, it has been extending temporary licence for supplying restricted products and services to the Chinese telecom gear major.

Huawei, along with Honor, commands second position on global level in terms of market share and is next to South Korean technology giant Samsung.

Mr. Peng said that Huawei is in talks with Indian companies as well to bring them on AppGallery and many of the frequently used apps have already come on board.

When asked about Honor’s plan to attract users of leading social media apps specially US-based Facebook and Whatsapp, Mr. Peng said most of the third party apps provide an open source for downloading the mobile version and is already available for quick download.

Peng said that Honor will prefer to work with Google, however, the company will continue to expand Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) as an alternate option.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/j8xc3b/article31050313.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Smartphones,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/honor-to-start-selling-android-smartphone-without-google-suite-from-this-month/article31080683.ece

9,2020/03/16,Japan knife attacker gets death sentence for killing 19 people,"Satoshi Uematsu admitted to stabbing to death or injuring victims at a care centre in Sagamihara, southwest of Tokyo, where he was a former employee.

A Japanese man was sentenced to death on Monday for killing 19 disabled people in a knife-wielding rampage in 2016 that was one of post-war Japan’s worst mass killings.

Satoshi Uematsu, 30, had admitted to stabbing to death or injuring the victims at a care centre for people with mental disabilities where he had once worked in Sagamihara, southwest of Tokyo. Twenty-six others were wounded. Many of the victims were stabbed as they slept.

The carnage sent a shockwave through the nation, where violent crime is rare due to strict gun control. Uematsu told a court session last month that those incapable of communicating with others are a burden to society and killing them would be good for society, according to domestic media.

‘Extreme maliciousness’

Sentencing Uematsu to death by hanging, presiding judge Kiyoshi Aonuma cited the violence of the crime. ”This crime was pre-meditated and there was strong evidence of the desire to kill,” Aonuma told a courtroom filled with family members of the victims. “The maliciousness of this was extreme.”

Uematsu, dressed in a black suit and with his long hair tied back in a ponytail, sat looking calmly at the judge during the court session. He said during a trial session last month that he had no intention of appealing, no matter what the verdict, domestic media reported.

His defence argued at the start of the trial in January that Uematsu was mentally incompetent or had diminished capacity at the time of the incident due to marijuana use. But prosecutors said he could be held fully responsible for his act, a view the judge upheld.

People with disabilities, especially mental disabilities, can still suffer stigma and shame in Japan, and the names of most of the victims were not made public according to the wishes of their families.

10,2020/03/16,Coronavirus | China tightens measures for international passengers,"New arrivals are now being transferred to an exhibition centre near Beijing’s main international airport for screening before heading to quarantine facilities.

China tightened quarantine measures for international arrivals on Monday as the country worries about a rise in imported cases of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and anger raged online at how Europe and the U.S. are handling the pandemic.

After declaring they had “basically curbed” the spread of the disease within China, where the virus first emerged, authorities have now ordered international arrivals to Beijing to go into centralised quarantine for 14 days. About 20,000 people — one-tenth of them foreigners — have entered China by plane daily since the World Health Organization declared a pandemic on March 11, according to an immigration official.

New arrivals are now being transferred to an exhibition centre near Beijing’s main international airport for screening before heading to quarantine facilities. Officials in protective suits and police officers guarded the centre on Monday, while ambulances waited outside on standby. Jacob Gunter, who arrived from the US on Monday morning, described his journey as “a bit of an Odyssey”.

It took more than six hours for the American expatriate to get from his plane to being transferred to a hotel where he must complete his quarantine. Travellers were previously allowed to undergo mandatory isolation at home. Authorities have given few details but at least three hotels said they were designated to receive quarantined passengers. Staff wearing medical suits waited at hotel entrances.

Minors, pregnant women, the elderly and people living alone — or those with underlying medical conditions — can still quarantine at home, Beijing city officials said. Outside the transfer centre, some passengers from Germany and the Democratic Republic of the Congo told AFP they were exempt from the centralised quarantine because they were diplomats.

At least two other regions in China have also imposed a 14-day centralised quarantine on foreign arrivals, State media reported Sunday, while Shanghai previously imposed isolation period at home or in centres for those arriving from virus-hit countries. A total of 123 cases from abroad have now been reported in China after 12 more were discovered Monday.

Surge in imported cases

Imported cases have now outnumbered domestic infections for three straight days. Chinese social media users on Monday criticised Europe and the U.S. over how they are handling the pandemic.

One coronavirus-themed hashtag was viewed 60 million times on China’s Twitter-like Weibo site, with many users saying they wished US President Donald Trump was infected, and others calling for “strict” controls to prevent imported cases.

“Can't let our previous efforts go to waste!” one said. The country has touted the effectiveness of quarantining the central city of Wuhan — where the virus first emerged — and surrounding Hubei province since late January, along with restrictions on large gatherings and travel.

In a sign of the slow return to normality, four cities in Hubei have chartered vehicles to now allow more than 1,600 migrant workers to return to factories outside the province. The government’s leading group on the epidemic said Monday that there should be a staggered return of people stranded in Hubei, as well as of reinforcement medical teams in the province.

China’s death toll from the virus now stands at 3,213, while fewer than 10,000 people are currently still infected -- down from tens of thousands in recent weeks. The progress contrasts with the growing crisis abroad, with the worldwide toll surpassing 6,500.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/atubaz/article31084899.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16thmarchinadomesticjpg-12,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-china-tightens-measures-for-international-passengers/article31084879.ece
11,2020/03/16,"Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders hit out at Donald Trump over his response to pandemic","While Mr. Sanders accused the President of fomenting confusion and eroding public trust in a time of crisis, Mr. Biden asserted that Mr. Trump was an “existential threat to the United States of America.”

White House hopefuls Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders launched a joint attack on President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as they faced off in a high-stakes debate on Sunday, accusing the President of undermining his own scientists with misinformation.

Also read: All about COVID-19

The two rivals also sparred about their record, taking advantage of the first one-on-one format of the marathon campaign to engage in extended — though civil — policy clashes on everything from universal healthcare and climate change to deportations and foreign policy. But with Mr. Biden appearing to have a good night, riding high as the frontrunner following three weeks of strong performances in multiple primaries, he made a splash by saying he will “commit” to picking a woman running mate if he is the Democratic nominee.

Mr. Sanders said he would “in all likelihood” do the same, following the most diverse nomination contest in U.S. history that saw no fewer than six women in the running to take on Mr. Trump in November. Going head to head days before four large states hold Democratic primaries, the two main candidates left in the race stood six feet (1.8 meters) apart and elbow bumped one another at the start of a televised debate held with no live audience as a virus precaution.

Mr. Sanders took a stinging shot at the President, accusing him of fomenting confusion and eroding public trust in a time of crisis. “We have to shut this President up right now because he’s undermining the doctors and the scientists who are trying to help the American people,” he said, referring to multiple statements of Mr. Trump which were at odds with expert views. “It is unacceptable for him to be blabbering unfactual information that is harming the American public,” he added.

Mr. Biden essentially agreed, saying: “the existential threat to the United States of America is Donald Trump.”

With the debate overshadowed by the fast-moving health crisis, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders spent the first half-hour on how to address the pandemic which has already caused almost 70 deaths and more than 3,600 COVID-19 cases nationwide.

“We’re at war with the virus,” said the former Vice-President.

“I would call out the military. Now,” he added, warning that the Pentagon and the Federal Emergency Management Agency must step in immediately to dramatically expand the number of intensive care beds. “The present system can not handle the surge that is likely to come,” he said.

Working-class safety net

Mr. Sanders called for “aggressively” ramping up testing but also for expanding the safety net to make sure Americans are not pushed deeper into economic crisis.

“What happens if I’m sick? It’s going to cost thousands of dollars for treatment. Who is going to feed my kids?” Mr. Sanders said, putting himself in the shoes of a working-class parent.

This 11th Democratic debate has placed the most intense spotlight yet on the duel between the former Vice-President and the leftist U.S. Senator from Vermont.

Of the four States voting Tuesday, Florida, Illinois and Ohio have among the largest troves of Democratic delegates at stake. Both candidates have cancelled planned rallies, and on Sunday they acknowledged shifting from live gatherings to televised or online events — and that they are each taking precautions like routine hand-washing to avoid getting infected.

Scrapping live events could pose a particular handicap to Mr. Sanders, who has consistently mobilized large and enthusiastic crowds. He may find one advantage. The pandemic “exposes the incredible weakness and dysfunction of our current healthcare system,” said Mr. Sanders, who advocates a government-run system that expands coverage to all Americans.

Biden’s second wind

Mr. Biden, after a near-calamitous start to the primary season, has staged a spectacular comeback. The States voting Tuesday, which all show Biden with double-digit leads in polling, should help him consolidate his lead, particularly in Florida where he holds a 40-point advantage. Mr. Sanders was the campaign’s putative leader just weeks ago, but he is the clear underdog now.

“If I lose this thing, Joe, I will be there for you,” Mr. Sanders said, in a revealing moment. But he expressed worry that his rival would not be able to rally young and Latino voters, two crucial constituencies.

“I have my doubts that Biden’s campaign can generate that energy and excitement and voter turnout,” Mr. Sanders said. For some, Mr. Sanders’ continued campaign was a way to gain a last bit of leverage before finally dropping out — to help advance elements of his “political revolution” and bring some of his progressive ideas more firmly into the mainstream.

But as Mr. Sanders repeatedly promoted his Medicare for All plan, Mr. Biden pushed back saying it was unlikely to pass Congress. “We have problems we have to solve now,” he said, adding “What’s the revolution going to do? Disrupt everything in the meantime?”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dsa72a/article31084777.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17-US-PRESIDENTIALDEBATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-hit-out-at-donald-trump-over-his-response-to-pandemic/article31084778.ece
12,2020/03/16,Benny Gantz chosen to form Israel government,"Former army chief won recommendations from 61 MPs, a razor thin majority in the 120-member Knesset.

Israel’s ex-military chief Benny Gantz was nominated on Monday to try to form a government but further talks were expected with his bitter rival, Premier Benjamin Netanyahu, on an emergency alliance to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mr. Gantz, who heads the centrist Blue and White party, called for “unity” and urged Prime Minister Netanyahu to join him as Israel seeks to end a crippling political stalemate after three inconclusive elections in less than a year.

Also read: All about COVID-19

“We must not have a fourth election,” Mr. Gantz said, after he was formally nominated to attempt to form an administration by President Reuven Rivlin. “I’ll do everything to form in as few days as possible a national, patriotic and broad government.”

Call for unity

Mr. Gantz, 60, won recommendations on Sunday from 61 lawmakers, a razor thin majority in the 120-member Knesset, or Parliament. His backers did not include Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud, but Mr. Rivlin has urged the two men to work together in an emergency unity government, in order to avoid a national policy vacuum in response to the pandemic.

“It is possible that forming a government quickly will require interim arrangements for the coming months”, Mr. Rivlin said on Monday.

Mr. Gantz’s path to a longer-term stable coalition is difficult given the deep divisions within the factions that backed him, which include the mainly Arab Joint List and the nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu.

Mr. Rivlin officially granted Gantz 28 days to try to form a government, a task which proved impossible for any candidate following the two elections last year.

Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving premier and the first ever to be indicted in office, on graft charges, has insisted that voters in the March 2 election gave him a mandate to continue as Prime Minister. The vote saw Likud secure the most seats but, along with its religious party allies, it fell three seats short of a majority.

Mr. Gantz has a “hollow mandate,” political columnist Sima Kadmon wrote in the Yediot Aharonot newspaper, referring to the possibly insurmountable divisions within the anti-Netanyahu camp.

Necessity for a government

Mr. Rivlin has made clear he wants a government in place soon to help Israel beat back the COVID-19 pandemic. He said political leaders had a duty to form a government amid “the national and international emergency.”

“Fourth elections are not a possibility,” added Rivlin, who is largely a ceremonial figure. The President summoned Mr. Gantz and Mr. Netanyahu on Sunday for an “urgent conversation”, which ended without agreement, but Likud and Blue and White said the talks would continue. But prospects for the two men coming to terms may be remote, especially as mutual acrimony has ramped up in recent days.

A new Knesset will also be sworn in later Monday in a stripped-down ceremony due to coronavirus. Writing in the left-wing Haaretz newspaper, columnist Raviv Drucker said the pandemic “could be our political establishment’s miracle,” forcing a compromise that has proved elusive over the past year of political deadlock.

Israel has 255 confirmed cases of coronavirus with no fatalities but tens of thousands in home-quarantine. Authorities have banned gatherings of more than 10 people and ordered schools, universities, restaurants and cafés to close, among other measures.

Pandemic coalition

Mr. Netanyahu, 70, on Sunday proposed a six-month unity government that he would lead to manage the response to the pandemic. He also offered a four-year arrangement that would see the two leaders equally split the job of Prime Minister.

“Gantz doesn’t believe a single word Netanyahu says,” columnist Nahum Barnea wrote in Yediot Aharonot, arguing against the prospects of an alliance. But, Mr. Barnea added, coronavirus could prove “key to a deal”.

Mr. Gantz has consistently refused to serve in any government led by someone facing criminal charges. Mr. Netanyahu was formally charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in January. He denies wrongdoing. His trial had been due to open on Tuesday, but Jerusalem’s District Court postponed it to May 24, blaming the pandemic.

The Prime Minister’s rivals cried foul, accusing him of using the health crisis to push back his long-anticipated day in court.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/essol0/article31084615.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17-ISRAEL-GANTZ2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/benny-gantz-chosen-to-form-israel-government/article31084616.ece
13,2020/03/16,Coronavirus | Virus toll in Iran climbs as lockdowns deepen across Middleast,"Lebanon was largely shut down while Iraqis were preparing for a curfew set to begin later this week

Iran reported another 129 fatalities from the new coronavirus on Monday, the largest one-day rise in deaths since it began battling the Middle East’s worst outbreak, which has claimed more than 850 lives and infected a number of senior officials in the country.

Businesses in Iran’s capital remained open, however, even as other countries in the region moved toward full lockdowns, with Lebanon largely shutting down and Iraqis racing to prepare for a curfew set to begin later this week.

The divergent approaches adopted by local authorities reflect continued uncertainty over how to slow the spread of a virus that has infected around 170,000 people worldwide and caused more than 6,500 deaths.

Some have opted for an even more aggressive response, with Israel authorizing the use of phone-snooping technology long used against Palestinian militants to track COVID-19 patients. Such practices will spark renewed debate over privacy issues as countries around the world confront the pandemic.

Most people experience only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, and recover within weeks. But the virus is highly contagious and can be spread by people with no visible symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

Panic broke out in Iraq after authorities announced a weeklong curfew late on Sunday. People raced to supermarkets and swiftly emptied shelves, while others stocked up on kerosene and cooking gas. The curfew, which is set to begin late Tuesday, includes the suspension of all flights from Baghdad’s international airport.

Iraq’s Health Ministry has reported 124 cases of coronavirus and nine deaths.

In Lebanon, where the government ordered a lockdown, traffic was thin and some streets were completely empty on Monday, the start of the working week. Restaurants, cafes and bars have been closed since last week and most private businesses were shuttered Monday.

Police asked shop owners to close in line with the government orders and moved to clear the few remaining people from Beirut’s seaside corniche. Pharmacies, bakeries and other businesses related to making or selling food were allowed to stay open. The small country has reported 99 cases and three deaths from the new coronavirus.

Both Iraq and Lebanon have been largely in disarray since anti-government protests broke out last year, and Lebanon was mired in its worst financial crisis in years even before the pandemic began.

One of the worst outbreaks in the world has unfolded in Iran, which has close ties to both Iraq and Lebanon. Authorities there have reported 14,991 confirmed cases and 853 deaths. Monday’s jump in fatalities was the largest one-day rise since the epidemic began. The real numbers may be even higher, as some have questioned the government’s reporting.

Many Iranians have dismissed fears about the virus and advice from public health officials to avoid social contact. Restaurants and cafes have remained open, though business has diminished.

A member of the Assembly of Experts, which has the power to appoint or dismiss the country’s supreme leader, died from the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus, the semi-official Fars and Tasnim news agencies reported Monday.

Ayatollah Hashem Bathaei, 78, is the latest of several senior Iranian officials to have been infected. Cabinet ministers, members of parliament, Revolutionary Guard members and Health Ministry officials have caught the virus, compounding fears about Iran’s response to the global pandemic. A member of another clerical body that advises Iran’s supreme leader died earlier this month. Several other officials have also died.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is 80 years old and has been in power since 1989, wore disposable gloves at a recent public event, apparently as a precaution.

The official leading Iran’s response to the virus on Sunday expressed concerns that health facilities could be overwhelmed if the rate of new cases continues to climb.

But on Monday, despite the mounting toll, President Hassan Rouhani said he believed Iran had moved past the “peak” of the virus, even as he advised people to stay at home, according to the official Mizan news agency.

Elsewhere in the region, the number of infections has continued to climb even as authorities have imposed strict travel and quarantine measures.

Mideast stock markets also tumbled Monday, with the Dubai Financial Market closing down 6.14% and the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange down 7.83%. Both have closed their trading floors over fears about the virus.

Israel on Monday said its total number of infections had climbed to 250, more than double what it was just a few days ago. Authorities have closed all malls, restaurants, cinemas, gyms and day care centers, and have urged anyone who can work from home to do so.

Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial announced Monday that its annual Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony would be held this year without an audience. The ceremony typically draws the country’s top leadership, foreign dignitaries and elderly Holocaust survivors. This year’s ceremony was scheduled to take place on April 20.

Later on Monday, Israel will swear in its new Knesset, or parliament, after elections earlier this month. The 120 members will take the oath of office in groups of three, in keeping with bans on large gatherings.

Authorities at Jerusalem’s Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can pray, meanwhile, asked visitors to refrain from kissing the stones of the wall. The sprawling plaza has remained open for prayers, but officials have curbed access to enclosed areas.

In Dubai, authorities announced that all bars and pubs would be closed through the end of the month. Community pools were also locked down, and the public was ordered not to hold weddings or other parties at their homes.

The Persian Gulf island nation of Bahrain, meanwhile, reported its first death from the virus. It has reported 221 confirmed cases.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/evf22j/article31083391.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THIRANOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-virus-toll-in-iran-climbs-as-lockdowns-deepen-across-middleast/article31083392.ece

Several eminent Indian-American groups in the US have set up helplines and deployed volunteers to help community members, including a large number of Indian students, hit by the coronavirus crisis.

The COVID-19 pandemic has infected 3,777 people and claimed 69 lives in the country. The country has stepped up efforts to contain the virus by placing travel restrictions, closing schools, restaurants and bars and cancelling entertainment events across the country.

Sewa International, a leading Indian-American non-profit organization, has released $10,000 to run its 24X7 helpline and coronavirus awareness campaign through a team of 20 physicians.

It has also established various chapters across the country who are working with the Indian Embassy and consulates to help families obtain visas to travel to India in emergency situations.

There are over 250,000 students from India studying in US universities. More than 300 US Universities have closed including some who have moved instructions to a virtual mode, and even shut their dorms. Sewa has fielded calls from Indian foreign students from such universities who are finding it difficult to cope up emotionally, health wise and financially, said Professor Sree Sreenath, president of Sewa International.

We even had a couple of concerned parents call us from India, Sreenath said.

A team of 20 physicians is helping Sewa in providing free advice through Sewa coronavirus helpline. Over 400 volunteers in 20 major cities in the country are working tirelessly to put up a formidable community response at this difficult time, said Swadesh Katoch, Sewa’s vice president for Disaster Relief.

Local businesses and medical professionals are offering their services to the community most times pro bono through Sewa International.

Its volunteers are providing multiple services including delivering free food, assisting the elderly in grocery shopping and visiting a doctor and helping those who are faced with travel and visa issues.

We are also offering family therapist calls for helping parents deal with anxiety and stress, he said.

Sewa is also helping people with COVID-19 like symptoms to meet with doctors. In a few cases our Family Services volunteers are working with friends and family of patients who are in self-quarantine or being tested for COVID-19. Sewa is running a daily Facebook Live campaign to spread awareness about preventing the infection, Katoch said.

Federation of Indian-American Associations of Georgia is working with all universities across Georgia and Alabama to help students hit by the situation created due to the coronavirus crisis.

We have daily meetings with the university authorities as well as with various student organisations at their campuses to assess the situation and have offered our help to provide them with food, accommodation and any other help they need, the association said.

We are also in constant discussion with our partner organisations who can provide their spaces to the affected students in case we need them. As of now, Gujarati Samaj, Gokuldham and Shakti Mandir have graciously offered their places to host the students impacted by the virus, it added.

15,2020/03/16,Coronavirus | Bat guano collectors in Thailand undeterred by possible link to coronavirus,"The source of the virus remains a matter of debate after it emerged in China late last year, but some scientists believe it could have originated in bats before passing to humans, perhaps being transferred through another animal.

Thai villagers scouring a dark cave for bat guano, sought after by farmers as a nutrient-rich crop fertiliser, are undaunted by scientists' suggestion that it could be behind a coronavirus that has infected more than 150,000 people worldwide.

The source of the virus remains a matter of debate after it emerged in China late last year, but some scientists believe it could have originated in bats before passing to humans, perhaps being transferred through another animal.

But that link is not a concern for Jaew Yaemjam, a collector of bat droppings in Thailand's western province of Ratchaburi, even though the southeast Asian nation has recorded 114 virus infections and one death.

Also Read Thailand reports 11 new coronavirus cases, bringing total to 70

“No, I'm not worried because the virus didn't originate from here,” said Jaew, 65, who is one of several villagers making the nightly trek into a smelly cave near a Buddhist temple, Wat Khao Chong Phran, to fill their sacks with the droppings.

They start work after dark, when millions of chittering bats stream out of the cave to hunt for food. Some of those who have been collecting for decades, earning less than $1 for each bucketload, say they have never had any health issues.

“Bat guano could be carrying various diseases,” said Pikul Temket, a provincial health official. “However, we've been clearing it out every week, so our cave is considered to be quite clean.”

Guano collection began generations ago, when the abbot then in charge of the temple asked villagers to help clean the cave.

At $6 a bucket, the guano, rich in chemicals such as nitrogen, phosphate and potassium, brings in the bulk of the temple's earnings from farmers keen to boost crops and improve the taste of fruit.

In the past, it also went into gunpowder and explosives.

“I've been collecting bat guano for 40 years already, and never got sick,” Jaew said. “I just use a piece of cloth to cover my face, nothing much, really.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lnkcci/article31080486.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSTHAILAND-BATS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bat-guano-collectors-in-thailand-undeterred-by-possible-link-to-coronavirus/article31080487.ece

A fire and explosion occurred at the Pengerang refining and petrochemicals complex in southern Malaysia, state news agency Bernama reported on Monday, citing the Petronas-Saudi Aramco joint venture that runs the operation.

The incident occurred on Sunday night and an emergency response team has been activated, Bernama reported.

“The situation is under control,” Bernama said, citing a statement. The news agency did not report any injuries or damage.

Petronas directed queries to the joint venture company Pengerang Refining and Petrochemical (PRefChem), which has not responded to a Reuters request for comment.

This is the second fire at the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) in less than a year.

In April 2019, an explosion and fire occurred at the plant's atmospheric residue desulphurisation unit (ARDS), a unit that removes sulphur from fuel oil, which is then used to produce gasoline in a residue fluid catalytic cracker.

There were no casualties in the April fire, and Petronas said commercial operations at the refinery would start on time by end-2019. The ARDS has been scheduled for operation by mid-2020, Petronas has said.

The refinery, which will process around 300,000 barrels per day of crude oil once fully operational, is expected to sell fuel to customers in Malaysia and across Southeast Asia.

The PIC also includes a petrochemical complex with annual production capacity of 3.3 million tonnes.

Cambodia reported four new cases of coronavirus including in a four-month-old French boy and two people who had travelled to Malaysia for a religious ceremony, the Ministry of Health said late Sunday.

The baby is the son of a French man who travelled from Paris via Singapore to Phnom Penh and tested positive for the virus earlier on Sunday, the ministry said. His wife tested negative.

A Cambodian man returning from France and two other people returning from the Islamic ceremony in Malaysia also tested positive, bringing the country's tally of cases to 12, the ministry said.

18,2020/03/16,"Brazil President takes selfies, cheers demonstrators despite virus warnings","House Speaker Rodrigo Maia called Mr. Bolsonaro's support for the protests “an attack against public health” and Senate President Davi Alcolumbre called it “reckless to stimulate gatherings in the streets” in separate written statements.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro took selfies with supporters and celebrated their demonstrations in major cities on Sunday, drawing criticism from congressional leaders for encouraging large gatherings that could worsen the spreading coronavirus.

Mr. Bolsonaro also appeared to shrug off the advice of medical experts suggesting he take precautions after several members of his recent delegation to Florida tested positive for the virus. The president tested negative for the virus, as did U.S. President Donald Trump after their meeting, but newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo reported that Bolsonaro's medical team has suggested he remain isolated until early next week.

The paper also reported on Sunday that a seventh member of Bolsonaro's entourage in Florida had tested positive for the coronavirus, along with four members of the trip's support team.

Mr. Bolsonaro strode down the ramp of the presidential palace in a Brazilian soccer jersey and met a throng of protesters at the gate, where he bumped fists, grabbed cell phones to take pictures and leaned in for selfies with the crowd.

In streaming video of the encounter from his official Facebook account, Mr. Bolsonaro said it was “priceless” to see so many public demonstrations in favor of his agenda, playing down his warnings against them in a Thursday address to the nation.

“Although I suggested [a postponement], I can't order anything because this protest isn't mine,” Mr. Bolsonaro said. “With everything against them the press, the virus, the recommendations the people took to the streets.”

House Speaker Rodrigo Maia called Mr. Bolsonaro's support for the protests “an attack against public health” and Senate President Davi Alcolumbre called it “reckless to stimulate gatherings in the streets” in separate written statements.

Mr. Bolsonaro fired back in an interview to CNN Brasil: “I'd like them to go out in the street and see how they're received.”

However, Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta echoed concerns in a separate interview with the network, reiterating that large gatherings were a mistake and comparing his warning to anti-tobacco advisories, which people ignore at their peril.

Although the coronavirus was slow to catch on in Latin America, the number of confirmed cases in Brazil has jumped to 200 on Sunday from just over a dozen a week before. Neighboring Argentina and Peru said Sunday they were closing their borders.

Mr. Bolsonaro played up Sunday's demonstrations in cities from Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro to Belem and Porto Alegre, with over three dozen Twitter posts with videos and photos of crowds.

He insisted that the demonstrations showed support for his agenda and not attacks against any particular adversaries.

19,2020/03/16,"If I’m elected president, I will appoint a woman to be vice president, says Joe Biden","Mr. Biden made that assertion during Sunday night’s debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders in response to a video question from a voter about how he would handle women’s health issues.

Former Vice President Joe Biden on Sunday committed to naming a woman as his running mate if he’s the Democratic presidential nominee, making a definitive assertion clamored for by some voters who have watched a historically diverse candidate field dwindle to two white men.

Mr. Biden made that assertion during Sunday night’s debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders in response to a video question from a voter about how he would handle women’s health issues. Asked the same question, Mr. Sanders didn’t definitively commit but said, “In all likelihood, I will.”

Mr. Biden has previously said he would seriously consider naming a woman or a person of color as his running mate.

Also on Sunday night, he repeated a previous pledge to nominate a black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court if given the chance to do so as president. During last month’s debate in Charleston, South Carolina, ahead of that state’s primary - where a victory gave Biden momentum that propelled him into Super Tuesday wins just days later - Mr. Biden said he was “looking forward” to making that a reality.

Throughout the lengthy primary campaign, Mr. Biden has often eschewed running mate talk as presumptuous, though he has at times posited several names. Asked by a voter at a campaign stop in Winterset, Iowa, in November, Mr. Biden described several prominent women he’d consider, were he to win the nomination.

""I could start naming people, but the press will think that’s who I picked,” Mr. Biden said, noting it was premature.

Still, he went on to suggest Stacey Abrams, who ran for Georgia governor in 2018, calling her “the woman who should have been the governor of Georgia.”

Likewise, he suggested, without giving their names, that he would consider former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and the two senators from New Hampshire, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen.

In December, Mr. Biden told voters in New Hampshire he’d want to pick someone “simpatico” with him and his priorities, telling voters there were “a lot of qualified women” and “a lot of qualified African Americans.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/81bjz5/article31070358.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15-US-BIDENANDSANDERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/joe-biden-commits-to-picking-woman-as-running-mate-if-nominated/article31079476.ece
20,2020/03/16,Coronavirus | U.S. death toll hits 65 from COVID-19 as Fed takes aggressive action to bolster economy,"For the second time since the financial crisis of 2008, the Fed cut rates at an emergency meeting, aiming for a target range of 0% to 0.25% to help put a floor under a rapidly disintegrating global economy.

With panic buying on Main Street and fear-driven sell-offs on Wall Street, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near zero on Sunday in another emergency move to help shore up the U.S. economy amid the rapidly escalating coronavirus pandemic.

For the second time since the financial crisis of 2008, the Fed cut rates at an emergency meeting, aiming for a target range of 0% to 0.25% to help put a floor under a rapidly disintegrating global economy.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who had openly pressed the Fed for further action, called the move “terrific” and “very good news.”

Americans are waking up to a new reality as coronavirus spreads, with store shelves stripped bare of essentials, schools closed and millions of jobs in jeopardy as businesses temporarily shut their doors. New York City joined the nation's other major public school systems in calling off classes starting this week.

“We're learning from watching other countries,” Mr. Trump said. ”It's a very contagious virus ... but it's something that we have tremendous control of.”

Mr. Trump has faced criticism at home and abroad for sometimes downplaying the seriousness of the coronavirus and overstating his administration's ability to handle it.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious diseases expert, said the United States was entering a new phase of coronavirus testing but tempered the president's optimism.

“The worst is yet ahead for us,” Fauci said, a warning he has issued frequently in the past week. “It is how we respond to that challenge that is going to what the ultimate end point is going to be.”

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said testing for coronavirus was expanding with more than 2,000 labs across the country ready to process tests and 10 states operating drive-through testing.

U.S. Assistant Health Secretary Brett Giroir said there will be 1.9 million high-throughput tests available this week.

The United States has lagged behind other industrialized nations in its ability to test for the coronavirus. In early March, the Trump administration said close to 1 million coronavirus tests would soon be available and anyone who needed a test would get one, a promise it failed to keep.

With limited testing available, U.S. officials have recorded nearly 3,000 cases and 65 deaths, up from 58 on Saturday. Globally more than 162,000 are infected and over 6,000 have died.

Mr. Pence also said the government on Monday morning would issue updated federal guidelines, which he described as “broad-based recommendations for the American public.”

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Sunday recommended that events with gatherings of 50 or more people over the next eight weeks be postponed or cancelled.

Don’t hoard

The White House appealed to Americans not to hoard as the coronavirus spreads, reassuring them that grocery supply chains were strong.

Mr. Trump held a phone call on Sunday with 30 executives from grocery stores including Amazon.com Inc's Whole Foods, Target Corp, Costco Wholesale Corp and Walmart Inc, the White House said.

“Have a nice dinner, relax because there's plenty, but you don't have to ... you don't have to buy the quantities,” Mr. Trump said. “We're doing really, really well. A lot of good things are going to happen.”

Mr. Trump tested negative for coronavirus, his doctors said on Saturday, as the president extended a travel ban to Britain and Ireland to try to slow the pandemic.

Mr. Trump's spokesman, Judd Deere, said temperature checks will be conducted on everyone who enters the White House grounds, beginning Monday morning.

Travelers returning to the United States and being screened for the coronavirus were met by long lines and massive delays at some major airports, prompting federal officials to deploy more staff and Mr. Trump to appeal for patience.

Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, squaring off in a Democratic debate, blasted Mr. Trump's handling of the coronavirus and touted their own plans to deal with it.

In their first one-on-one debate, the two Democratic contenders to face Mr. Trump in the November election said the Republican president had contributed to worries about the pandemic by minimizing the threat before declaring a national emergency on Friday.

Closures expand

The U.S. containment measures have so far been mild compared to the nationwide lockdowns imposed in Italy, France and Spain. However, Ohio and Illinois on Sunday ordered all bars and restaurants to close, although carry-out and delivery are still allowed.

“I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing,” Fauci said on NBC's “Meet the Press.”

Fauci said he did not see domestic travel restrictions in the immediate future.

Even though Americans are not barred from going to the movies, ticket sales in North America fell to their lowest level in more than two decades this weekend, according to measurement firm Comscore.

New York schools closed

Democratic New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that schools in New York City, Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk counties would close from Monday, and he called on Trump to mobilize the Army Corps of Engineers to create more hospital beds.

Mr. Cuomo had been criticised for not closing schools as other states have done, given that New York has a large cluster of coronavirus cases.

A clinical trial to evaluate a vaccine designed to protect against coronavirus will begin on Monday, the Associated Press reported, citing an unnamed U.S. government official.

It would take a year to 18 months to fully validate any potential vaccine, the AP added, citing public health officials.

21,2020/03/16,"Coronavirus: Spain, France tighten border controls","Germany also plans to close borders from Monday; death toll from the virus crosses 6,000

Cafes, shops and restaurants shut down across France and Spain on Sunday as governments stepped up their fight against the COVID-19 pandemic which has now reportedly killed more than 6,000.

France ordered the closure of all non-essential businesses, while Spain went a step further and banned people from leaving home except to go to work, get medical care or buy food. Cases also spiked in Germany and sources said that the government planned to shut its borders with France, Switzerland and Austria on Monday.

Spain and France are among the worst-hit countries in Europe although Italy, which imposed Europe’s most draconian lockdown on its 60 million citizens last week, still dominates in terms of infections from COVID-19.

Spike in Spain deaths

A spike in deaths reported in Spain from 183 on Saturday to 288 on Sunday took the global toll to 6,036 from almost 1,60,000 infections, according to an AFP tally compiled from official sources.

Experts warn, however, that the real figure is likely to be higher as tests are not available to everyone and people can be infected without showing symptoms.

The disease has now hit all global regions, ripping up sporting and cultural calendars, causing panic in stock markets and companies and prompting often contradictory responses from governments. As the virus continued its global spread, the plight of existing hotspots intensified. Iran announced 113 new deaths on Sunday taking its total to 724, the world’s third-worst toll after China and Italy, and officials urged people to avoid public gatherings. Britain, which had avoided crackdowns and instead tried to manage the spread and create “herd immunity”, cancelled local elections and hinted that it would follow most other affected European nations and ban mass gatherings.

Local elections

On the other hand, France allowed municipal elections to go ahead on Sunday even as officials imposed a drastic nationwide shutdown on all non-essential businesses and promised to progressively restrict long-distance travel.

Several countries have announced bans on foreigners entering their countries.

Austria banned gatherings of more than five people on Sunday, telling citizens to stay in unless absolutely necessary.

Norway announced it would shut ports and airports with international connections on Saturday before retreating a day later and saying although foreigners would be turned away, the facilities would remain open.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/5kj41i/article31076181.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16-ITALY-HALTINGANOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-spain-france-tighten-border-controls/article31076182.ece

Around 900 more infections were recorded in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 5,400 since January, Veran told France 2 television.

Separately, the national health agency Sante Publique France, which has been updating its tally daily, put the new toll at 127 deaths.

Veran said government officials would meet with scientific advisers in the coming days to determine if the second round of voting will be held next Sunday.

""Probably on Tuesday I will ask them about the second round,"" Veran said, while refusing to be drawn on rumours the government will soon announce a complete lockdown and confine people to their homes.

Several African governments on March 15 closed borders, canceled flights and imposed strict entry and quarantine requirements to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, which has a foothold in at least 26 countries on the continent as cases keep rising.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a national state of disaster and warned the outbreak could have a ”potentially lasting” impact on the continent's most-developed economy, which is already in recession.

Measures to be taken there include barring travel to and from countries such as Italy, Germany, China and the United States.

“Any foreign national who has visited high-risk countries in the past 20 days will be denied a visa,” he said, adding that South Africans who visited targeted countries would be subjected to testing and quarantine when returning home.

South Africa, which has recorded 61 cases, will also prohibit gatherings of more than 100 people, Ramaphosa said.

Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said his government was suspending travel from any country with reported COVID-19 cases.

“Only Kenyan citizens, and any foreigners with valid residence permits will be allowed to come in, provided they proceed on self-quarantine,” he told the nation in a televised address.

The ban would take effect within 48 hours and remain in place for at least 30 days, he said.

Schools should close immediately and universities by the end of the week, he added. Citizens would be encouraged to make cashless transactions to cut the risk of handling contaminated money.

Kenya and Ethiopia have now recorded three and four cases respectively, authorities in each nation said on Sunday, two days after they both reported their first cases.

In West Africa, Ghana will ban entry from Tuesday to anyone who has been to a country with more than 200 coronavirus cases in the past 14 days, unless they are an official resident or Ghanaian national. Ghana has recorded six cases.

In southern Africa, Namibia ordered schools to close for a month after recording its first two cases on Saturday.

Djibouti, which has no confirmed case of COVID-19, said on Sunday it was suspending all international flights. Tanzania, which also has no cases yet, canceled flights to India and suspended school games.

25,2020/03/16,Israel’s president to ask Netanyahu rival Benny Gantz to form government,"Comes as a blow to Benjamin Netanyahu, who is fighting for his political life

Opposition leader Benny Gantz will be asked to form a new government, Israel's president said on Sunday, March 15, boosting his chances of ousting veteran Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

It was a blow to Mr. Netanyahu, who is fighting for his political life amid unprecedented political deadlock and a criminal indictment for corruption, which he denies.

But it remains unclear whether Mr. Gantz's centrist Blue and White Party can break a stalemate that has been marked by three inconclusive elections in less than a year.

Also read: Explained | Why is Israel holding its third election in a year?

Mr. Netanyahu, 70, is Israel's longest-serving leader and has been heading the country's efforts to combat the coronavirus.

But last year he twice tried unsucccessfully to put together a ruling coalition.

And on Sunday Mr. Gantz won support from two key parties, leading President Reuven Rivlin to say that he would get the first chance at forming a government after the latest election on March 2.

Editorial | Advantage Bibi: On Israel’s third election in 12 months

“Tomorrow, around midday, the president will assign the task of forming the government to head of (Blue and White party) Benny Gantz,” Mr. Rivlin's office said in a statement.

The announcement came at the end of a day in which Mr. Rivlin held consultations with all parties in the 120-seat Israeli parliament, the Knesset.

“At the end of the consultations, 61 Members of Knesset had recommended... Benny Gantz, as opposed to 58 Members of Knesset who had recommended the current prime minister and head of Likud, MK Benjamin Netanyahu,” the statement said. One member of parliament gave no recommendation.

Unlikely partners

As things stand, a Gantz coalition would likely have to be underpinned by two bitter enemies, who have both endorsed him.

One is the Joint List, a coalition of lawmakers from Israel's 21% Arab minority, and the other is hawkish former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman's far-right Yisrael Beiteinu.

Mr. Netanyahu, 70, was due to go on trial this Tuesday, but the coronavirus emergency has promoted restrictions of gatherings that delayed the start of proceedings for alleged bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges. He has denied any wrongdoing, accusing his enemies of a witch-hunt.

Mr. Netanyahu proposed a six-month “national emergency” government, led by him, to confront the coronavirus crisis.

Mr. Rivlin has voiced support for a unity government to break the deadlock. But Mr. Gantz, who made an issue of Mr. Netanyahu's character during the election campaigns, has been cool on teaming up with his rival.

Mr. Lieberman said on Sunday: “We recommend Benny Gantz for a very, very simple reason. In the previous election, we said the most important thing was to prevent a fourth election.”

And Joint List head Ayman Odeh said his Arab coalition's voters had said “an emphatic 'no' to a right-wing government and Benjamin Netanyahu”. Mr. Odeh said his bloc would not join a government led by Mr. Gantz, but could potentially provide it enough votes to govern.

About a fifth of Israeli citizens are Arabs, Palestinian by heritage but Israeli by citizenship. No Israeli government has ever included an Arab political party.

26,2020/03/16,‘Kitho aaya corona?’: Coronavirus bhajan by singer Narendra Chanchal goes viral,"A clip of a large group of people repeating the singer’s lyrics after him, was shared by comedian Mallika Dua on Instagram

The internet is rife with measures on how to fight the spread of the coronavirus in India. Some use hand sanitizers. Others self-isolate. Yet others host cow urine drinking parties.

But this could be the most popular — and maybe easiest — of them all: sing a corona bhajan!

A clip of popular bhajan singer Narendra Chanchal, singing at a Holi event in Paharganj, New Delhi, has gone viral. The ‘corona’ bhajan goes, “Dengue vi aaya, Swine Flu vi aaya. Chickunguniya ne shor machaya. Khabre ki-ki ho na? Kitho aaya corona? Maiya Ji, Kitho aaya corona?” and is repeated by a large group of people repeating after him.. the irony.

Comedian Mallika Dua shared the clip on Instagram with the caption, “O kitthon aaya Corona? Jagrata is better than cure.”

27,2020/03/16,Inclusion is the new diversity?,"Diversity has become a cold word enunciating our differences into otherness. Inclusion, on the other hand, is the element of reaching out to connect and to support

I once worked with a man from a thinktank — someone who goes to Davos and hobnobs with the biggest names in the development sector. He told this very inappropriate joke at a meeting: A group of three, him included, sat together discussing research work. They realised they were all Christian men, and the only element of diversity they had was that one of them (my colleague) was brown. They joked about having more diversity by including a single black woman, who was lesbian and Jewish.

I was too shocked to react but that’s the kind of conversation the word diversity leads to. It’s as if you’re doing everyone a favour by putting their names down as a part of the team. Much like in school, where the boys were asked to add two girls to the cricket team, and everyone groaned — the boys at having someone slow their game down, the girls at being talked down to, having decisions made on their behalf, denied a voice, and treated like crap once they were on the field.

Inclusion, on the other hand, is about seeing someone sit on the sidelines and asking them to come join a game, or about a person opting in and getting amalgamated into the team without a song and dance about how different they look or dress. It’s still not ideal, because the person is an ‘outsider’ until accepted, but it has less of a demeaning ring to it. Diversity is ‘allowing’ your son or daughter to marry ‘out of the community’ and then acting like you’ve done everyone a favour; inclusion is believing and saying to them that no matter who they bring home you’re only looking out for the couple’s happiness.

As someone who changed nine schools across 12 years — my father was in a transferable job, I didn’t get thrown out of schools — I was often faced with situations where I knew no one, and felt I stuck out like a sore thumb: I was tall, dark, and spoke in English, and very different from most students in the way I looked and communicated. I don’t remember any school that helped with inclusion, but I do remember that certain students took it upon themselves to help me in whatever way they could — showing me the bathroom, or sharing the time table with me. It is little things that go a long way.

It is this element of reaching out to connect, to support, that is inclusion. Diversity has become a cold word enunciating our differences into otherness. It’s a term used by a bunch of people who sit in privilege, ticking boxes patronisingly. Inclusion builds our resilience, and is a reflection of our emotional health in offering and receiving help; it gives us a chance to expand our being and a chance to belong. Diversity reinforces bias and stereotyping and is a buzzword used by ‘evolved’ HR teams to show how good they are.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/fbg0oo/article31083232.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16mpcould,https://www.thehindu.com/society/inclusion-is-the-new-diversity/article31083234.ece
28,2020/03/16,Chennai’s elderly have somebody to lean on,"City-based organisation Udhavi bridges the gap between the young and old, providing the city’s senior citizens with support and cheer

When author, playwright, novelist and textile researcher Sabita Radhakrishnan decided to launch an NGO for elder care and support in 2013, she was clear about one aspect. Apart from providing geriatric support, she also wanted to spread cheer. “The elderly (over 65 years) population in the city is on the rise, and is largely neglected. As long as they live as couples, they manage, but after one of them departs, they begin to seek support, and the quality of life decreases with their children living and working outside the country,” says Sabita. “Our country is not at all elderly-friendly, be it easy access to buildings or priority to services.”

During her growing-up years in Bangalore, where her father was a medical practitioner, she had always had elders, especially grandparents, stay with the family. “I have such good memories of playing board games, listening to stories. My father believed that if old people had good mental health, it reflected in their physical wellbeing. In his hospital, he also accommodated nurses and matrons whose children simply abandoned them here and migrated to Australia and England. These people lived within the nursing home.” So Sabita was naturally inclined to take up service to elders as an adult.

“I decided to start an NGO to support the elderly population in memory of my daughter who passed away at a young age. But I could not do it all by myself, and started looking out for like-minded people,” says Sabita. She approached the founders of Old is Gold store in Adyar, KP Jayashree and Sanjay Dattatri, and they joined hands. Today, Udhavi has 13 core members and over 40 volunteers.

“The mission of Udhavi is to stave off loneliness,” says Sabita. “The idea that someone has the time to spend with them excites the beneficiaries, most of whom have had full-fledged careers, loving spouses and extended families. With many offspring living outside the country, it does become a great deal for them to even chat with anyone in person,” she says.

Quality time

Lalitha Ramachander, one of the core group members, says that they encourage volunteers to make house visits and spend time with the beneficiaries — play a game of Scrabble, accompany them to the doctor, collect their outfits from tailor, take then to a movie or a concert, drive them to park or beach, or even chat over a plate of dosa and filter coffee.

Extracts from Handbook For Silvers Cooking is therapeutic for both men and women, but do it with assistance.

Try to revive your old interests or hobbies. Read the newspaper or listen to the news, and keep yourself up to date.

Keep your latest medical files accessible, so that the person who comes over to help you can find it easily.

Making homes elderly user friendly is vital, as people over 70 need support.

Don’t become a recluse. It can be lonely, and it is easy to sink into depression which could turn clinical and harder to treat. Let people who care about you enter your life.

Says Sudhesh Sharma, another core group member, “As far as possible, we match the profiles and intellectual levels of the beneficiaries and the volunteers so that they spend meaningful time together. We need young volunteers as these seniors say that they feel rejuvenated when a youngster spends quality time with them.”

But the younger ones are not doing it all one. According to Sabita, “Our committed core team at times goes out of their way to provide support and care, even though they themselves are in the 60s. One of our core team members even sends vegetarian food to beneficiaries who miss home-cooked food whenever possible,” says Sabita. She says that even elders who live with their children often feel lonely as they spend the entire day all by themselves. “I want young people to understand what it is to be old and what kind of support is to be provided. We take our parents for granted.”

Down memory lane

Volunteers also teach the elderly to use the Internet, Skype and smartphones. While some of the beneficiaries of Udhavi prefer to get out of their homes with volunteers, some prefer to be in their home environment and chat. A Bengali playwright and a scholar, Sundanda Ghosh, loves to go to Besant Nagar beach and stop for a cup of coffee and snack once in a while, as she has lived in the locality for many decades and the drive brings back pleasant memories.

Last year, after Dr Sridhar Vaitheswaran was roped in as their consultant psychiatrist, they have started visits to patients identified by him. The core team underwent training in handling mentally ill seniors. “We wanted insights into the life of people with dementia, Alzheimer’s and various other conditions, so that we can understand the challenges and provide necessary support,” Sabita says.

Time, not money

As a policy, Udhavi does not accept any cash donations. They only seek volunteers who can spend their time. Once every quarter, the core team contributes to expenditures incurred. “We utilise these funds to reimburse taxi, entertainment and other expenses incurred by volunteers,” says Kalpana Ramani of the core team.

“We are now trying to focus on elders in the underprivileged section of our society by helping them procure Aadhar card, insurance card and avail Government benefits,” says Sabitha, who has recently published a booklet, Handbook For Silvers, an elaborate set of guidelines for seniors living by themselves.

Another beneficiary is civic activist and long time-resident of Besant Nagar, 93-year old Kamakshi Subramaniyan, well known as Kamakshi Patti among her neighbours. She says, “They usually send two volunteers for hospital visits. I live on my own and manage fairly well, but of late I have felt the need for help with shopping. I simply love to chat away with Udhavi volunteers, and I wish they come more often.” .

29,2020/03/16,Karnataka Ganakala Parishat golden jubilee celebrations held,"Sangita Sangama – Sahitya Sambhrama

The recently concluded golden jubilee celebrations of Karnataka Ganakala Parishat was a one-of-a-kind event where the confluence of Sangitam, Sahityam, Gana Yagnam and ‘anna dasoham’ (distribution of food prasadam) took place with amazing precision for 16 days.

Musicians of national and international repute made the event a shining example of ‘a world unified by music.’

The inaugural day began in the presence of Sri Sri Sri Shivarathri Deshikendra Swami of Veerasimhaasana Maha Sansthan, Suttur Kshetra. The Golden Jubilee celebrations working committee was also announced at the time.

Five books were released and their authors were also honoured on the occasion.

With the exception of the inaugural day and the concluding day, each of the 14 days started with a Gana Yagna by musicians led by Dr.R.K.Padmanabha, paying obeisance to Vaggeyakaras, Raga devathas and the chanting of relevant Sanskrit slokas.

All the concerts and lecture demonstrations were special in their own way, full of substance and depth.

Some vocal and instrumental music concerts included performances by T.S.Satyavathi, Dr. Suma Sudhindra, the Saralaya Sisters, a and many others.

The exposition, exploration, interpretation, scholarly analysis of music and various aspects of musicology by musicians in their lecture demonstration sessions were fascinating, educative and interesting.

Topics such as ‘Tyagaraja’s Kritis on Tulasi’, ‘Violin Vadya Vaibhava’ “ Mridanga Tarang’, and the Tradition of Nagaswara in Temples were covered.

30,2020/03/16,Exhibition marks Krishnamurti’s 125th birth anniversary,"Remembering Jiddu Krishnamurti

Philosopher, thinker and writer Jiddu Krishnamurti spoke a great deal of words. They were ubiquitous in “The First Step is The Last Step”, the exhibition celebrating Krishnamurti’s 125th birth anniversary by the Krishnamurti Foundation India (KFI) at The Valley School in Kanakapura. His contemplations on life, death, education, fear were hung from trees, woven into installations, run across a staircase and reflected through subtle design elements.

At the entrance of the exhibition was a huge tree with suspended ropes holding placards. They had many of his famous quotes: Religion is the transformation and regeneration of man; Desire and thought have made man an instrument of violence, cruel human beings’; Can you end violence immediately, not take time over it? You do so only when you don’t run away from it, suppress it or indulge in it. That is, to remain with the feeling of violence and not introduce any other factor. How Krishnamurti would have reacted to the mind-numbing violence in the name of religion today, I thought to myself.

Bengaluru-based designer and dancer Miti Desai had conceptualised and designed the exhibition. It was divided into four parts:Voice, Study, Life and Teachings on education, fear, religion and violence. And the tree was The Voice. At Vasanta Vihar, the headquarters of KFI, in Chennai, Krishnamurti held his talks under the wild Badam tree.

That’s how Desai conceived the idea. “The Banyan tree was also significant in his life so I hung these ropes symbolising the tree. You sit under it and hear him talk. It’s very experiential. It recreates J Krishnamurti through his voice,” she explains. In the Chennai leg of the exhibition, the same wild Badam tree under which the philosopher sat and gave talks, became The Voice.

The exhibition drew its title “The First Step is The Last Step” from Krishnamurti’s conversation with Pupul Jayakar, cultural activist-writer and also his biographer. The phrase underlined the perception of the truth by an individual in that very moment. Next moment, a new perception will begin and end. “Visually in my mind, it created architectural shapes. I thought of squares and lines that don’t end.”

According to KFI: In the past, the focus of the Krishnamurti Foundation India has been the dissemination of Krishnamurti’s teachings through public talks, dialogues and retreats, video screenings and publication of books. After more than 3 decades of his departing, there has come into being a new generation of people who are perhaps not acquainted either with the teacher or his teachings. Therefore, it was felt that the foundation should endeavour to introduce and make available Krishnamurti’s vision of life to a new and wider audience who may find that these timeless teachings are also very contemporary and relevant to their personal lives.

Born in a Brahmanical household in Madanapalle, Jiddu Krishnamurti went on to become a thinker and spiritual leader who questioned caste, religion and much more. He became part of the Theosophical Society and adopted by Annie Besant. Krishnamurti was groomed to be the New World Teacher but in 1929 he broke away from the movement. He spent his life travelling across the world speaking on subjects like death, fear, education, religion, violence, relationships etc. The section of Life encapsulated Krishnamurti’s journey from his life till death, through his images and noting seminal events in his life.

It was not easy to put together an exhibition on a figure like him. While KFI curated the text, Desai was tasked with the visualisation. She says it was challenging. “I couldn’t be descriptive. I couldn’t use any symbols. He said there is no horizontal, no vertical and no dimensions. He spoke about the formless. He always spoke about fine intellectual engagement.”

She focused on creating an experiential exhibition that used a lot of materiality - ropes, bamboo, water, cloth and mirror. The various sections reflected the flow of non-linear thoughts. At the Valley School, the Voice welcomed the viewers and then encouraged them to seamlessly move to the sections of Life and Study. At the Study, the visitors could listen to 21 talks by Krishnamurti on headphones or the sculptural installations in the section of Teachings.

The chronology of his travels took the viewers to a long winding quote on Love that ran across a staircase which led them to his teachings on various subjects. In a corner, the subject of violence was evoked through criss-crossing threads with his words emblazoned on the wall, forming the background.

At the Rajghat Study Centre in Banaras, where the exhibition was first held, the empty wooden frame was hung capturing the Ganga which flows right beside the centre. Here Desai placed it in a way that it captured the lush green environs of the Kanakapura.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/dwt1ck/article31081467.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FRP4Lead3jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/exhibition-marks-krishnamurtis-125th-birth-anniversary/article31081470.ece
31,2020/03/16,"Investors get poorer by ₹7.62 lakh crore, Indian indices at lowest since Sept. 2017","Sensex loses 2,713 points, Nifty plunges 758; over 2,000 stocks decline on BSE

Global equity markets continued to be in turmoil on Monday on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, even as the Indian benchmarks registered their second biggest single-day fall in absolute points and fell to their lowest level since September 2017.

Investors’ wealth eroded by ₹7.62 lakh crore, with the market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies dropping by ₹7,62,290.23 crore to ₹1,21,63,952.59 crore at the close of trade.

The 30-share Sensex lost a whopping 2,713.41 points, or 7.96%, to close at 31,390.07. The Sensex has now lost 10,884 points or nearly 26% from its record high of 42,274 touched in January.

The broader Nifty plunged 757.80 points, or 7.61%, to close at 9,197.40. The India VIX index spiked over 14% on Monday.

This was the second biggest single-day fall for the indices, having recorded their worst fall on March 12. More importantly, market participants believe that there still exists uncertainty as to whether the markets have reached their bottom given that concerns around the pandemic are far from over.

“The equity market will bottom out once the infection numbers peak and start to recede... and then bottom-fishing opportunities could open up, but that is possible after clarity emerges in the next few months with respect to an effective cure for the disease or the effectiveness of strong policy actions,” global financial major Credit Suisse said in its latest India strategy report.

Monday saw leading Asian benchmarks such as Nikkei, Hang Seng and Kospi losing heavy ground as the virus outbreak threatens to impact global economic activity.

On the BSE, more than 2,000 stocks declined on Monday, as against only around 411 gainers. Provisional numbers showed that foreign investors were net sellers at ₹3,809 crore on Monday. In the Sensex pack, stocks such as Infosys, Axis Bank, HDFC, Tata Steel, ICICI Bank, ITC and IndusInd Bank all lost more than 9% on Monday.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/u9etnq/article31085322.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17Sensex-grafbw,https://www.thehindu.com/business/virus-tightens-grip-indian-indices-at-lowest-since-sept-2017/article31085324.ece
32,2020/03/16,RBI tells banks to assess impact of COVID-19,"Asset quality, liquidity to be studied

The Reserve Bank of India has asked financial institutions to assess the impact on their asset quality, liquidity and other parameters due to spread of the COVID-19.

While announcing operational and business continuity measures in the wake of the spread of the deadly virus, RBI said, “supervised entities should also assess the impact on their balance sheet, asset quality, liquidity, etc. arising out of potential scenarios such as further spread of COVID-19 in India and its effect on the economy, contagion from wider disruption in the global economy and the global financial system, etc.”

Banks have also been asked to encourage their customers to use digital banking facilities as far as possible.

These entities have been asked to take immediate contingency measures to manage the risks following the impact assessment.

The banking regulator said banks and financial institutions will have to devise strategy and monitoring mechanisms concerning the spread of the disease within the organisation, and should make timely interventions for preventing further spread in case of detection of infected employees, including travel plans and quarantine requirements, as well as avoiding spread of panic among staff.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rbi-tells-banks-to-assess-impact-of-covid-19/article31085290.ece
33,2020/03/16,No proposal to ban short selling: exchanges,"Deny any such move by regulator SEBI

The stock exchanges on Monday clarified that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) was not considering any proposal regarding a ban on short selling to curb the ongoing volatility and equity sell-off.

The spokespersons for BSE and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) said ‘there is no proposal on ban on short selling with SEBI’, after a media report suggested that the capital markets regulator was considering such a ban among other measures.

Regulators in a few countries like Spain, South Korea and Italy have banned short selling amid huge volatility and a fall in stock prices.

Traders’ bet

Short selling refers to a strategy by which traders bet on a decline in prices and try to profit at a time when the markets are falling.

Indian indices have fallen more than 25% from their record highs reached in January.

In market parlance, a fall of over 20% is looked upon as a sign of the markets entering a bear market.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/no-proposal-to-ban-short-selling-exchanges/article31085264.ece
34,2020/03/16,RBI’s focus on liquidity is correct,"Rate cut is an option for another day

The messaging from the press conference of RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das is loud and clear: the central bank has an armoury of weapons and it will not hesitate to deploy them to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. The two steps that Mr. Das has outlined now — forex swap and a second long-term repo operation (LTRO) of ₹1 lakh crore — are aimed at supporting liquidity in the market. Market rates may incidentally fall as the LTRO is at the repo rate of 5.15%.

The focus on liquidity is the right thing to do at this point in time. A rate cut, while being a short-term sentiment booster, is not going to help in alleviating the situation as seen by the experience in the U.S., where the Federal Reserve has taken the funds rate to zero, but the markets remain unimpressed.

The situation is clearly an evolving one and prudent action requires that the central bank keep its powder dry simply because we may not have seen the worst yet in terms of the virus impact, both in human and economic terms. In fact, in economic terms, this is just the start of what’s likely to be a long period of instability and falling growth in the global economy. The falling indices and currencies are only a manifestation of the first order impact. The second, and more severe one, will come when major economies either slow down sharply or tip into recession. The disruption caused to commerce, trade and travel already is so immense that the effects on the world economy will be felt for the rest of this calendar year. The effect will multiply if the virus infection curve does not flatten over the next 2-3 weeks.

India cannot remain insulated from global economic turbulence and economic growth is sure to slow down in the coming quarters. In such a situation, it is sensible to hold on to the rate cut option for use at a more challenging time, which is bound to follow. With headline inflation and core inflation — both CPI and WPI — trending south, food prices reducing and fuel prices falling (despite the government appropriating some of the benefit in the form of higher excise duty), the environment is indeed favourable for a rate cut, if the monetary policy committee were to decide on one.

The question is one of timing. The RBI Governor would surely want elbow room in the monetary policy space and not find himself in the position of the Fed or the central banks of other developed countries, where rates have been beaten down to zero or close to zero, leaving no space for action. The focus will be on the next meeting of the monetary policy committee in the first week of April, unless if the situation deteriorates so badly that the RBI is forced to act urgently.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rt0mbg/article31085241.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THBUDAS1,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rbis-focus-on-liquidity-is-correct/article31085242.ece
35,2020/03/16,"COVID-19: Airlines, hotels take extra steps to reassure customers","During the extraordinary situation created by the outbreak of COVID-19, airline, hospitality and manufacturing companies are balancing between keeping their staff safe from infection and striving to minimise business disruption by reassuring customers about the safety and hygiene of their products and services.

IndiGo Airlines, for example, has taken measure to ensure compliance with the best advice from medical authorities and the government. Its ground staff at international terminals have been equipped with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as masks, gloves, and shoe covers which are disposed of at regular intervals.

While the crew on all its aircraft are following personal protective measures as well. Crew members aboard international flights wear PPE that is changed every 8 hours.

“And because this disease is most easily transmitted through surfaces, each and every aircraft is cleansed with cleaning agents and disinfectants that are approved by the WHO and Airbus,” Ronojoy Dutta, Chief Executive Officer, IndiGo said in a letter.

Indian Hotels Company Limited (IHCL) of the Tata Group, in light of the current situation, has implemented additional precautionary hygiene measures across its hotels based on the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare advisory and guidelines for prevention and transmission.

“This includes training our associates to the protocol prescribed by the Government of India, sanitization of all areas, increased access to alcohol-based hand sanitizers at prominent locations and body temperature checks for everyone visiting our premises using non-invasive laser thermometers,” an IHCL spokesperson said.

As mandated, the company is notifying local authorities on travellers coming from affected countries.

Similarly, Marriott International is taking precautions to ensure a healthy stay at any of its hotels across the globe.

“In this climate I want you to know that the safety of our guests and associates is our top priority,” said Arne Sorenson, President and CEO, Marriott International, in a message.

“Given the impact of COVID-19 on how we work, socialise and travel, we have been adapting our cancellation policy over the past several weeks to the evolving nature of this epidemic. Now, we are updating our policy to provide our customers the most flexibility we can offer during these challenging times,” he said.

Tata Motors Ltd. (TML) has developed a three-tier response plan based on incidence of infection in cities it operates. The company has suspended all international travel by executives. For domestic travel involving public transport such as road, rail and air, prior approval is mandatory.

“Visits to TML sites have been restricted and pregnant women and employees with chronic respiratory/cardiac illness have been advised to work from home,” Guenter Butschek, CEO & MD, TML, said in a letter.

“Classroom training, meetings with more than 20, internal and external events have been suspended and distance between seats in the canteens have been increased and staggered timings have been introduced to prevent crowding,” he said,

36,2020/03/16,COVID-19 hits all industry verticals,"Supply chain hit, demand drops, outlook for 2020 bleak, say observers

India may face a further dip in GST collections as most of the industries such as poultry, sea food, consumer durables and electronics, tour and travel, hospitality, apparel, gems and jewellery etc. are likely to see a significant decline in revenue due to COVID-19 outbreak, as per industry observers.

Cross border trade is also likely to get hit as exports to prominent countries like Europe, U.S. and China will see a decline due to the corona outbreak. For instance, the textile industry, which accounts for 10% of the annual exports, is heading towards a major decline in revenue as supply chain has been disrupted and export orders have been on a drastic decline, as per observations made by Vayana Network, a third party supply chain finance platform.

Ram Iyer, Founder & CEO, Vayana Network, said, ``Supply chain is seriously damaged. Both exports and imports are affected. The corona factor will create serious working capital shortages for corporates and the entire supply chain ecosystem.’’

According to ICRA, demand in the key markets has remained subdued, with impact heightened by the rapid spread of the COVID-19 across regions in the recent weeks.

ICRA expects the Indian apparel exporters to report a moderation in profitability in FY2020, with pressures likely to sustain at least in the near term, and the turnover growth to be subdued, except for a few larger players with an established client base.

Mr. Jayanta Roy, Senior Vice-President and Group Head, Corporate Sector Ratings, ICRA said, ``The Indian apparel exporters are passing through testing times, with several internal and external challenges. The external issues primarily stem from an unfavourable demand-supply scenario.’’

As per ICRA analysis, the industry is also facing challenges like increased bargaining power of buyers amid intense competition, cost-side pressures emanating from disruptions in procurement of materials and consumables such as colours, chemicals, accessories/trims etc, from China.

While demand from the EU has remained weak, recent trends in the U.S. apparel imports have also been discouraging, corroborated by a volumetric decline of about 12% Y-o-Y in apparel imports by the US in Q3 FY2020 and an overall decline of ~0.3% Y-o-Y in 9M FY2020. This follows an about 17% and about 5% Y-o-Y decline in domestic retail sales of clothing and clothing accessories (in value terms) in the U.S. in Q3 FY2020 and 9M FY2020 respectively, ICRA further says.

38,2020/03/16,Most airlines may fly into bankruptcy on COVID-19: CAPA,"Govt., industry must act in tandem to avoid catastrophe

As of now, 145 countries have been affected by COVID-19 and most airlines in the world will go bankrupt by the end of May 2020 on account of restrictions being put in place to prevent the spread of the virus, said Centre for Aviation (CAPA), a leading aviation consulting group, in a report.

It said co-ordinated government and industry action is now needed “if a catastrophe is to be avoided.”

“As the impact of COVID-19 and multiple government travel reactions sweep through our world, many airlines have probably already been driven into technical bankruptcy, or are at least substantially in breach of debt covenants. Cash reserves are running down quickly as fleets are grounded and what flights there are, operate much less than half full,” CAPA said.

“Forward bookings are far outweighed by cancellations and each time there is a new government recommendation, it is to discourage flying.

“Demand is drying up in ways that are completely unprecedented. Normality is not yet on the horizon,” it added.

Commenting on the Indian scenario Kapil Kaul, CEO and director, CAPA South Asia, said, “The CAPA report is in global context. Depending on the extent of the spread of COVID-19corona virus in India, the impact on Indian airlines with weaker balance sheets will be severe.

“More important, raising funds, if required, may be very challenging. Reducing Goods and Services Tax (GST) on aviation turbine fuel (ATF) may be critically required but this may not be enough to compensate for a sharp demand slump. At this stage, we are now not commenting on the impact in India but it is likely that risks will significantly increase,” Mr. Kaul said.

As per CAPA, different governments are failing to co-operate with airlines in a bid to make them stay afloat. “At a time, while governments are grappling with the health challenges of COVID-19, it is clear that there is little instinct to act cooperatively. Messages are mixed and frequently quite different. Each nation is adopting the solution that appears best suited to it, right or wrong, without consideration of its neighbours or trading partners,” it said.

When, for example, U.S. President Donald Trump peremptorily announced the effective cancellation of airline access to most Europeans, he didn’t even advise his European government counterparts in advance, let alone consult with them. Other governments have performed little better, CAPA said.

CAPA said the post COVID-19 chaos will offer an opportunity to reframe the foundations of a global airline industry.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/lol265/article31084861.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THBUAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/most-airlines-may-fly-into-bankruptcy-on-covid-19-capa/article31084862.ece

The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers on Monday said it has approached the Supreme Court seeking directions to ensure that sale and registration of BS-IV complaint is allowed till March 31, 2020.

The move follows circulars from some State governments setting a cut-off date ranging between February 29 and March 25, 2020, for accepting registration applications for BS-IV-compliant vehicles. “SIAM has filed an application in the Supreme Court seeking directions for ensuring that sale and/or registration of BS-IV vehicles is allowed till the cut-off date of March 31, 2020,” the industry body’s president Rajan Wadhera said.

He added that some State governments have recently issued circulars directing that no applications for registration of BS IV vehicles be accepted on or after a certain date, which are much ahead of March 31, 2020, deadline.

“These circulars have put the customers, dealers and vehicle manufacturers in severe discomfort as each of them are racing against time to exhaust the BS IV stocks which are with the dealers,” he added.

Coffee Day Enterprises on Monday said the investigation initiated by its board after the death of founder V.G. Siddhartha will be concluded and the report released latest by the end of March.

According to a media report, at least $270 million was missing from the company’s accounts.

“It is true that some amount is missing, but the actual figure is different, which will be known soon once the report is released,’’ a top company official told The Hindu.

According to a spokespersion, the promoter family and management are fully cooperating with the investigation but are oblivious to its outcome as their priority is to keep the business running in a challenging environment and meet all stakeholder commitments, including 30,000 jobs associated with the group.

Not involved in business

To a query on the ‘missing funds,’ he said, “The promoter family was not involved in the business at the time of founder V.G. Siddhartha’s unfortunate demise. They stepped in assume responsibility of the large and diversified business on the fifth day of the tragedy, while still being in a state of shock.’’

He further said Coffee Day Enterprises team was working towards bringing down group level debt to manageable level by divesting non-core enterprises.

46,2020/03/16,MSMEs will be the biggest casualty of COVID-19 in India: study,"India currently has over 75 million MSMEs (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises) and close to a quarter of these firms will face closure if the lockdown, induced by Covid-19, goes beyond four weeks while a staggering 43% will shut shop if the panic extends beyond eight weeks, as per a study commissioned by the All India Manufacturer’s Organisation (AIMO).

AIMO on Monday made an urgent plea to the Centre to look into the needs of the MSME sector in the context of the pandemic.

K.E.Raghunathan, past president, AIMO who conducted the study, said, “more livelihoods would be lost than lives due to COVID-19. Based on ground impact information gathered from various sources, AIMO believes that a large number of MSMEs in the country will vanish if the panic continued beyond a month.”

MSMEs, that are the back bone of the Indian economy and provide employment to over 114 million people and contribute to more than 30% of the GDP, have gone through most difficult times in the last three years, as per an AIMO statement.

“It is a known fact, that they faced one setback after another, first being demonetisation then followed by glitchy GST implementation, then came economic slowdown of real estate and auto sector to which most of the MSMEs were main sources of suppliers. Then came the financial and banking crisis. Now, COVID-19 which seems to be the final blow to the MSMEs,” added Mr. Raghunathan.

Signs of decline are already visible. MSMEs have already started facing huge financial burden of unpaid salaries (will eventually result in loss of employment), unpaid EMIs ( will impact the balance sheets of financial institutions) and finally, closure of such operations. Loss-making balance sheets does not allow them to get any finance from banks or NBFCs as per RBI norms, resulting in increased unsold inventory pile-up and getting into dead investments and result in huge losses. These and many more issues such as lack of availability of raw materials from China etc. are all leading towards the eventual shutdown, AIMO further said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/msmes-will-be-the-biggest-casualty-of-covid-19-in-india-study/article31084751.ece
47,2020/03/16,"Government tables notifications on rise in excise duty and road cess on petrol, diesel","Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur placed before the House the notifications seeking to raise additional excise duty on petrol by ₹2 to ₹8 per litre for petrol and to ₹4 per litre litre from ₹2 for diesel.

Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur on Monday tabled two notifications relating to increase in excise duty and road cess on petrol and diesel by ₹3 per per litre, amidst uproar by Opposition in Lok Sabha.

Mr. Thakur placed before the House the notifications dated March 13, 2020 seeking to raise special additional excise duty on petrol by ₹2 to ₹8 per litre in case of petrol and to ₹4 per litre litre from ₹2 in case of diesel.

News Analysis | Why oil prices are crashing

Additionally road and infrastructure cess was raised by ₹1 per litre on petrol and diesel to ₹10.

Opposition members protested the government move. They questioned the hike in duty when global crude prices have come down significantly. Later in the day, Mr. Thakur also tabled the notifications along with the explanatory memorandum before Rajya Sabha.

This was opposed by AITC member Sukhendu Sekhar Ray.

“The price of crude oil has come down substantially in the world market and price of diesel and petrol has been enhanced in our market along with road cess,” Mr. Ray said.

With this, the total incidence of excise duty on petrol has risen to ₹22.98 per litre and that on diesel to ₹18.83.

The tax on petrol was ₹9.48 per litre when the Modi government took office in 2014 and that on diesel was ₹3.56 a litre.

In all, duty on petrol rate was hiked by ₹11.77 per litre and that on diesel by 13.47 a litre in those 15 months that helped the government to more than double the excise mop up to ₹2,42,000 crore in 2016-17 from ₹99,000 crore in 2014-15.

It cut excise duty by ₹2 in October 2017 and by ₹1.50 a year later. But it raised excise duty by ₹2 per litre in July 2019.

Benchmark crude oil prices have halved since January to USD 32 per barrel. In sync with this, the prices of petrol and diesel have also come down by more than ₹6 per litre (from ₹76.01 a litre on January 11, 2020 to ₹69.87 a litre on March 14 for petrol, and from ₹69.17 to ₹62.58 for diesel during the same period in Delhi).",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/4tbb1o/article31082727.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-petrol-diesel,https://www.thehindu.com/business/government-tables-notifications-on-rise-in-excise-duty-and-road-cess-on-petrol-diesel/article31082721.ece

State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Monday said investments by banks in crippled Yes Bank are being made to maintain financial stability in the system, and not guided by the principle of return on investment (RoI).

“The decision of the State Bank of India (SBI) and all other banks coming together, it is not guided by the return on capital principles or investments.

51,2020/03/16,"In U-turn, govt. moots 20-year window to clear telco dues","Plea in SC cites possible job losses, NPAs

Nearly five months after winning its legal battle in the Supreme Court against telecom majors including Vodafone and Bharti Airtel for payment of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues worth several lakhs of crores of rupees, the Centre did a virtual U-turn on Monday by urging the court to give the companies a 20-year window to pay the money back.

In an application mentioned for urgent hearing in the apex court, the government said it has, after “detailed and long-drawn deliberations”, devised a “formula” to soften the blow of the October 24, 2019 judgment directing the companies to cough up the AGR in three months.

Also read: AGR dues: Bharti Airtel pays ₹3,004 crore as full and final settlement

Staggered instalments

“All the licensees impacted by the judgment be allowed to pay the unpaid or remaining amount of past DoT assessed/calculated dues in annual instalments over 20 years (or less if they so opt), duly protecting the net present value of the said dues using a discount rate of 8% (based on one year marginal cost of lending rate of SBI which is currently 7.75%),” the application said.

A document annexed to the application shows that the total demand of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) as in October 2019 was ₹1,69,048.65 crore from 16 major telecom service providers (TSPs). The payment received till March 6, 2020, from these companies was ₹25,901.56 crore. Dues to the tune of ₹1,43,271.74 crore remain outstanding.

The application said the formula was crafted taking into consideration the “larger interest, economic consequences on the nation and with a view to ensure that the Supreme Court order is complied with in letter and spirit.” It said deliberations were held at various levels of the government in the administrative hierarchy, including the Cabinet.

The application said vital issues related to the financial health and viability of the telecom sector and need for maintaining competition and level playing field in the interest of consumers were considered.

It said the closure of one or more TSPs would adversely impact the digital connectivity of the country driving e-governance projects in commerce, banking and health. It would also dent the spread of digitisation in rural India.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8s7xom/article31085379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THRDSC1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/in-u-turn-govt-moots-20-year-window-to-clear-telco-dues/article31085380.ece
52,2020/03/16,Kerala women in Kabul jail quizzed,"They had joined the Islamic State in Khorasan Province with their husbands

A group of Indian women who travelled to Afghanistan to join the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP) between 2016 and 2018 have been interrogated by Indian security agencies in Afghanistan. The government is discussing if the women and their children could be allowed to return since their husbands have been killed in airstrikes and if so would they pose a security risk.

Stratnewsglobal.com, a strategic affairs website, published a video of the interrogation of three of the 10 women who are in the custody of Afghanistan authorities at a prison in Kabul. The questioning was done in December 2019.

Read: ‘Six Kerala men among Islamic State fighters in Syria’

The women are among thousands of IS fighters and affiliates, including children, who surrendered before the Afghanistan authorities from November-December last year.

A group of 21 men and women from Kerala left India in 2016 in batches to join the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP) in Afghanistan.

The three women who appear in the video published by the web portal are Sonia Sebastian, alias Ayisha, Raffeala and Nimisha, alias Fathima Isa.

According to a 2017 chargesheet filed by National Investigation Agency (NIA), Sonia, a resident of Kasargod in Kerala, left India on May 31, 2016 with her husband, Abdul Rashid Abdulla, from Mumbai airport.

In her interview with the Indian security officials, Sonia says she came with her husband as he would have gone to Nangarhar in Afghanistan anyway and this way she got to spend three more years with him.

“Once we reached here many things were not up to our expectation; we came here expecting an Islamic life. No system here, people don’t come to thye masjid to pray five times a day. But the leaders didn’t do anything about it. He [her husband] stopped making audios (propaganda material). A brother who witnessed his death said his last words were ‘I am done with this duniya (world)’,” Sebastian is heard saying, accompanied by her little daughter. “I want to return to India and live with my in-laws,” she says.

The second woman, Nimisha, told interrogators that she had a comfortable life in Khilafah.

“In Daesh (IS) widows and orphans will be taken care of, money will be provided without getting remarried,” she says.

Nimisha converted to Islam and travelled with her husband and child to join the IS. Her mother Bindhu has made several appeals asking her to come back.

The third Indian woman in the video, Raffeala, recalls that they were given ₹5,000 by a Pakistani woman to reach safe haven from IS controlled territory. “After Rashid’s death we have been running only,” she says.

“Women are living together….we were running and walking. After he got killed it was difficult for us. I have seen bodies of women and children killed in airstrikes, wont that hurt us?” Raffeala says, adding that mostly confined to their homes she used to make pizzas and cake.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala-women-in-kabul-jail-quizzed/article31085364.ece
53,2020/03/16,Former CJI Ranjan Gogoi nominated to Rajya Sabha,"The vacancy was created due to the retirement of K.T.S. Tulsi at the end of February

President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday nominated former Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi to the Rajya Sabha.

“In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-clause (a) of clause (1) of article 80 of the Constitution of India, read with clause (3) of that article, President is pleased to nominate Shri Ranjan Gogoi to Council of States to fill the vacancy caused due to the retirement of one of the nominated members,” the Home Ministry said in its notification.

The vacancy was created due to the retirement of K.T.S. Tulsi at the end of February.

Justice Gogoi, who retired in November, headed the five-judge Bench that delivered the verdict in the sensitive Ayodhya land title dispute on November 9.

Soon after the unanimous verdict was delivered, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had lauded the judiciary for bringing an end to the decades-old Ayodhya land title dispute.

Justice Gogoi, who had a tenure of a little more than 13 months after being sworn in on October 3, 2018, also headed a bench that had held that the office of the CJI was a public authority and came under the purview of the Right to Information Act.

Justice Gogoi also headed the benches that heard matters like a review of the apex court’s verdict allowing the entry of women into the Sabarimala temple and the Rafale fighter jet deal. While the court gave a clean chit to the government in the Rafale case, in the Sabarimala review the bench referred the larger question of religious freedom to a nine-judge bench.

“The picture says it all,” tweeted Congress communications chief Randeep Surjewala that had two screenshots, one of Justice Gogoi’s nomination to the Rajya Sabha and another news headline that said “India’s Judiciary is Facing an Increasing Lack of Trust by Public”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nom8x/article31085273.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17TH-RANJAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/former-cji-ranjan-gogoi-nominated-to-rajya-sabha/article31085274.ece
54,2020/03/16,"Indonesia again flags concerns over CAA, Delhi riots","‘Public reaction to Indian events posing issue for Jakarta’

Ties between India and Indonesia have been strained further over a series of growing protests in Jakarta. The Indonesian government has reached out to New Delhi again to “convey concerns” over the violence in Delhi and riots that left 53 people dead, while India has demanded security assurances for the Indian embassy in Jakarta and the Indian consulate in Medan.

The message that the Widodo government in Jakarta has delivered is two fold: that it is committed to assuring safety and security for the Indian Embassy in Jakarta and the Indian consulate in Medan, while at the same time asking India to engage with the negative public perception in Indonesia.

“[Our] civil society and many organisations had a message and those messages were conveyed [to the government of India]. People have concerns, but the Indonesian govt. is confident that we are both pluralistic, democratic countries,” sources said, referring to the fact that Indonesia that has an 80% Muslim majority is also home to Buddhists and Hindus, and is not an Islamic state.

The source also added that Indonesia would not “interfere” in India’s internal issues, but that the Indonesian public’s reaction to events in India was becoming an issue for their government as well.

On March 1, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had called in Indian Ambassador Pradeep Kumar Rawat to discuss the concerns, while Indonesian Ambassador to India Sidhartho Suryodipuro has held more than one meeting with the Ministry of External Affairs to raise the issues and discuss security arrangements for the Indian missions. Mr. Rawat is also due to meet Indonesian Vice-President Maaruf Amin, an Islamic cleric, later this week.

On March 13, Jakarta saw another big gathering of protesters belonging mainly to Islamist organisations and civil society NGOs who picketed the Indian mission to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the violence in Delhi. The protests have been organised on every Friday for the three weeks, with an unprecedented 1,100 police personnel deployed to ensure the embassy’s safety.

Of particular worry was a meeting of the “Indonesian Ulema Council” (MUI) on Thursday that called for a “fact-finding team” from the United Nations to be sent to India to look into the CAA, riots and actions in Jammu and Kashmir, condemning what it called “the actions of Hindu extremists….against Indian Muslims,” and even called on the Indonesian government to ""boycott Indian goods"".

India has not reacted thus far to the events in Indonesia. Last year, the government had raised strong objections with the U.K. government after protesters were allowed to picket the High Commission in London.

The government has publicly criticised Malaysia and Turkey for their comments on the CAA and events in Jammu and Kashmir as these are “internal matters”.

Tensions between India and Indonesia are also brewing over reports in the Indian media that an Indonesian Islamic NGO Aksi Cepat Tanggap had ‘funded’ the violence in Delhi and was linked to Pakistan’s Lashkar-e-Toiba. The reports, in at least two national television channels and a national daily, appeared a day after Home Minister Amit Shah had referred to evidence of a “foreign hand” in funding the riots from February 24-26 in northeast Delhi that has left thousands homeless.

In a statement released ahead of the protests on Friday, ACT supervisory council member Syuhelmaidi Syukur denied the allegations saying the organisation had only funded “humanitarian aid” to “victims whose houses have been damaged, widows who lost their children and people who lost their source of income due to the riots”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/t81jbz/article31085119.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17TH-SURYO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indonesia-again-flags-concerns-over-caa-delhi-riots/article31085120.ece

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned for questioning over a dozen senior officials of five top alleged defaulters and others for recording their statements in connection with the Yes Bank case.

A senior ED official said they had been summoned between March 17 and March 21. “Among them are the Wadhawans of the Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL), who have been asked to appear on March 17. The statement of former, Jet Airways chairman Naresh Goyal and Essel Group’s Subhash Chandra are also to be recorded on March 18,” the official said,” the official said.

Among those summoned are Reliance Group chief Anil Ambani, Wadhawans of DHFL, Jet Airways’ Naresh Goyal, Essel Group’s Subhash Chandra and Indiabulls’ Sameer Gehlaut.

Through his Twitter handle, Mr. Chandra said: “I have been requested by ED to make a statement on the information which is already available with them. I will be more than happy to be personally present at their office, honouring their request, in order to extend all the required co-operation.”

The ED probe is based on two FIRs registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation against the then Yes Bank promoter director Rana Kapoor, his wife and others.

When asked for comments, an Indiabulls spokesperson said, “ We have not received any such summon. Your information is incorrect. Indiabulls Housing has no term loans outstanding from Yes Bank. Sameer Gehlaut or any company related to him or his relatives have no loans outstanding from Yes Bank.”

“There was a similar rumour of CBI raid on Friday which became quite apparent was untrue by CBIs formal release itself. We also had sent a release on the same to the stock exchange . Kindly do not get influenced by such incorrect rumours which keep getting floated,” he added.

Essel Group has confirmed that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has requested Dr. Subhash Chandra’s presence on March 18 2020, to make a statement on the information which is already available with them.

57,2020/03/16,Coronavirus | Experts say India still in second transmission stage,"Will know trends by tomorrow: officials

Senior scientists and health officials have said that India currently is showing no evidence of any community transmission and that enough tests were being done to pick up any early indication of third stage transmission.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

“We are testing enough and so far there is no evidence for the need to go in for mass testing. You have to remember that India started proactive action from January 17 onwards, whereas our first cases came in the end of January. The country had put in early measures to ensure that transmission stays localised and any indications otherwise are picked up,”’ said Dr. Raman R. Gangakhedkar, head of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases-I (ECD-I), Division, Indian Council of Medical Research, on Monday.

State Helpline numbers

He further added that ICMR was doing random testing to understand and gain any indication of community transmission.

‘Very few samples’

“We will be getting the results of our random sampling by Wednesday, which will give us a flavour of where we are headed. As of now, the transmission is localised and our labs are receiving very few samples, and can test far more than the the number of samples that we are getting,” he said.

This is when several experts have noted that India isn’t testing enough, which could be the reason for its relatively low number of COVID-19 cases, while also exposing the country to an outbreak.

Currently, 63 laboratories (62 Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratories and 1 National Centre for Disease Control) are functioning to test COVID-19, and nine laboratories are expected to start functioning shortly.

The ICMR has meanwhile noted that it has ordered a million probes from Germany to ensure that all laboratories in the country are ready for sample testing, if needed. “Earlier, we had ordered 2 lakh probes but we have now asked for more as we have increased the number of labs across the country,’’ Dr. Gangakhedkar explained.

Random sample testing

The ICMR has also noted that it has intensified random sample testing of people who display flu-like symptoms but don’t have a travel history to any of the coronavirus-hit countries.

“We have picked up 20 samples from over 50 labs for testing any community transmission. We had previously taken a smaller group of samples from our labs to check for community transmission between February 15 and 29. But since this is an evolving virus, we need to keep a check,” he added.

Replying to questions on whether weather conditions have an impact on the virus and if repeated infection was possible, he said that, so far, there was no clear evidence that a large section of people can get re-infected. “Also, since the virus hasn’t seen many seasons, we cannot say conclusively that the virus will slow down with higher temperature,” Dr. Gangakhedkar said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dblvtn/article31084998.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THCUTOUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-experts-say-india-still-in-second-transmission-stage/article31085000.ece

59,2020/03/16,Offending posts not made from Omar’s FB account: Sara Abdullah Pilot,"His sister Sara Abdullah Pilot tells Supreme Court that the URL is non-existent

The social media posts which form the basis for the continued detention of former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah were not made from his official Facebook account, his sister Sara Abdullah Pilot said on Monday.

A scrutiny of the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) shown on the posts draws a blank. The URL is non-existent, she told the Supreme Court.

Ms. Pilot said these social media posts formed the sole basis for the government’s decision to detain her brother under the Public Safety Act since February 5, 2020. Mr. Abdullah was first detained on August 5, 2019, just before the abrogation of the special status accorded to the Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution.

The government said Mr. Abdullah disturbed the maintenance of public order with his “activities.”

In her reply affidavit, Ms. Pilot said it was “appalling” that the government was justifying her brother’s detention on the ground that the standards of “public order” in J&K was different due to its close geographical proximity with Pakistan. “Pakistan is in close geographical proximity with three other States [Gujarat, Punjab and Rajasthan] as well, and by extended logic, the public order in such States should also be contextually modified,” the affidavit said.

Ms. Pilot has asked the apex court to direct the authorities to produce her brother in court and set him free immediately. She said she had no information of his whereabouts.

Shahid Iqbal Chaudhary, District Magistrate of Srinagar, had recently informed the apex court in his affidavit that Mr. Abdullah “was, and continues to be, detained in conformity with the mandatory provisions of the PSA.”

Mr. Chaudhary, represented by Attorney General K.K. Venugopal and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, had argued that Mr. Abdullah’s continued detention under PSA was based on material and documents showing his “activities,” even before his first detention in August 2019, was “calculated to disturb public peace and tranquillity”.

The Magistrate had said the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority, the grounds of detention and the dossier prepared for his detention under PSA all clearly indicate a “live and proximate link” between the activities of Mr. Abdullah and the “events that occurred in the past.”

The Magistrate had said the previous activities of Mr. Abdullah, which were available in the public domain, indicated that he may act in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order in J&K even in future.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/j00aw5/article31084974.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SARAABDULLAHPILOT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/offending-posts-not-made-from-omars-fb-account/article31084975.ece
60,2020/03/16,JKLF chief Yasin Malik charged in 1990 case,"Four IAF officials were killed in an attack in Srinagar on January 25 that year

A Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act (TADA) court framed charges against separatist e Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) chief Yasin Malik and six others on Monday in a 30-year-old case of a militant attack that killed four Air Force officials in Srinagar in 1990.

Mr. Malik, who refused to take any defence lawyer in the case, pleaded “not guilty” and stated that it was a fabricated case.

The charges were framed under Section 302, 307 of the Ranbir Penal Code, Section3 (3) and Section 4(1) of the TADA Act, 1987, and Section 7/27 of the Arms Act 1959, and Section 120-B of the RPC.

The court mentioned the CBI chargesheet, including documentary and oral confessional evidence recorded under Section 164 of CrPC and Section 15 of TADA, as it framed the charges. Special Judge, NIA, Subhash Gupta observed that prima facie evidences could safely be considered as incriminating material against all the accused.

“I do not plead guilty. It is a fabricated case,” Mr. Malik told the court. He also questioned reopening of the case after 30 years. Judge Gupta read out the charges to Mr. Malik, who is lodged in the Tihra Jail, through video conferencing.

The charges have been framed under sections of Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act and the Arms Act of the Ranbir Penal Code. The court will hear the case again on March 30.

“The court has framed charges against all the seven accused, including Yasin Malik and Showkat Bakshi, lodged in Tihar and Ambedkar Nagar jails,” additional public prosecutor Rakesh Singh, representing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), said.

Four Indian Air Force (IAF) officials, including Squadron Leader Ravi Khanna, were killed in the attack in Srinagar on January 25, 1990. Though the CBI first filed its first chargesheet in 1990, the case was granted a prolonged stay on its trial, which was vacated recently. The then government decided against pursuing the case immediately after JKLF declared a ceasefire in 1994 and pledged to stop armed insurgency in J&K. In fact, JKLF chief Malik decided to follow the Gandhian way of politics in Kashmir.

A JKLF spokesman termed the charge-sheet “fictitious, concocted and politically motivated.”

“Unfortunately, Malik is not allowed to represent himself. Ultimately, the truth will triumph,” said the spokesman.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5tzz1f/article31084958.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17TH-YAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jklf-chief-yasin-malik-charged-in-1990-case/article31084959.ece

66,2020/03/16,Private firms ready to test for COVID-19,"‘The relatively low mortality and cases compared to other countries likely guiding govt.’s approach’

Companies that offer diagnostic tests say they have the capacity to mass-test for COVID-19 but have mixed responses to India’s policy of restricting testing to government laboratories.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

The Mumbai-headquartered Metropolis Labs, a chain of diagnostic labs with a presence across India, said they had already set up a “dedicated and isolated” COVID-19 laboratory and were awaiting the Union Health Ministry’s permission.

State Helpline numbers

The company had already been “approved” by the Mumbai Municipal Commissioner for offering testing services. “We are getting another facility ready on standby and this would be ready in the next seven days. We are importing kits from Altona, Germany for sample testing,” Ameera Shah, Promoter & Managing Director, Metropolis Healthcare Limited, said in a statement.

The tests are real time polymerase chain reaction tests (RT-PCR) that can, within a day — sometimes in hours — confirm the presence of SARS-COV2, the virus responsible for the ongoing pandemic. All of these tests are proprietary products of multinational pharma companies and Indian laboratories must firm up licensing deals, order kits and appropriate chemicals, and train staff to use them.

Other leading laboratories said they were having “discussions” with the Health Ministry regarding allowing private diagnostic companies to test. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has currently authorised 65 diagnostic centres across the country and claims to be able to test at least 10,000 a day but, as a policy, has restricted testing to only those showing symptoms — of cough, fever and breathing difficulties — and having a travel history, or a link, to COVID-19-affected countries.

Low mortality

One company official said the relatively low mortality in India and cases compared to other countries and directives to quarantine international travellers were likely guiding India’s approach to testing. “We are interacting with government every day,” said Arvind Lal, Chairman and Managing Director, Lal Pathlabs, “The sense is that the government has enough capacity now and when they needs us we are there. During the swine flu outbreak of 2009, the government eventually involved the private sector and we offered tests at ₹4,500.”

Demand for test kits

Navin Dang, Co-founder and Director, Dr. Dangs Labs, said the industry as a whole was equipped to handle a “million cases in India ” if the need arose, however given the global nature of disease there could be shortages in procuring reagents as well as difficulty in scaling demand to produce test kits. “There’s a concern among people and I’ve personally met some who feel they are sick but are afraid of going to government hospitals. Shouldn’t they have that option?” he argued.

ICMR tests

To concerns that the virus may be circulating among some, undetected, in India — or exhibiting community transmission — the ICMR said it had started to test 150-250 samples from those exhibiting flu symptoms to determine this and would be able to get a sense later this week. “So far we have no evidence. Moreover, restricting testing to government facilities means we can also effectively quarantine and treat patients and monitor their contacts,” R. Gangakhedkar, who leads epidemiology efforts at the ICMR, said at a press briefing on Monday.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/erwvou/article31084770.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-872482918,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/private-firms-ready-to-test-for-covid-19/article31084756.ece

An Army team of six doctors and eight paramedical personnel has been deployed in Maldives, Col. Anand stated.

On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a video conference with heads of SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) member-states and announced an initial contribution of $10mn for an emergency fund to fight COVID-19 in the region.

Giving details of the quarantine efforts by the military, a Defence Ministry official said over 555 people have so far been isolated in military-run facilities in different batches, of whom 372 have been discharged after the mandatory 14-day quarantine period.

Two Indian Air Force (IAF) C-17 Globemasters were used for evacuating 112 Indian citizens from Wuhan in China on February 27 and 58 Indian citizens from Tehran, Iran, on March 10. “The 34 crew members of Indian Air Force C-17 Globemasters who flew evacuation sorties from Wuhan and Tehran have been quarantined as a precaution. Of these, 17 crew members have been discharged after completion of the quarantine,” the official stated.

The Army has two facilities at Manesar, outside the national capital, and at Jaisalmer, which was activated on Sunday for those coming from Iran. The Navy has a quarantine facility at Ghatkopar, Mumbai, and the IAF has one at Hindon airbase.

On Monday, 53 evacuees from Iran arrived at the Army Wellness Centre, Jaisalmer, for two weeks of quarantine and observation. This is in addition to the first batch of 236 evacuees that arrived at Jaisalmer on March 15. “As per the procedure, preliminary screening of these persons was undertaken at the Airport upon arrival, Army officials added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3dmoqh/article30702492.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Indian-Army-Quarantine-facility,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/army-team-in-maldives-to-set-up-virus-testing-lab/article31084662.ece
68,2020/03/16,Rahul Gandhi protests after Speaker denies second supplementary question,"He had sought the list of the top 50 wilful defaulters, the funds loaned and the amount written off by banks

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday said he was ‘hurt’ at Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla’s decision to deny him an opportunity to pose a second supplementary to his question during Question Hour, wherein he had sought details of banks’ bad loans and the names of 50 wilful defaulters.

Mr. Gandhi and Congress members also staged a walkout in protest soon after Mr. Birla announced the end of the Question Hour and moved on to the next item on the day’s agenda.

Earlier, posing his first supplementary question, Mr. Gandhi said he wanted to know the list of top 50 wilful defaulters, the funds loaned and the amount written off by banks, a query to which the Finance ministry had failed to provide a satisfactory reply in its written answer.

“The Indian economy is going through a difficult period; banking system is facing difficulties, banking is failing and many more banks are going to fail,” Mr. Gandhi said in the Lok Sabha. “One of the main reasons for the failure of banks is stealing of bank money by a large number of people. The Prime Minister had said those who have stolen the money will be brought back and punished. But I have not got the answer to my simple question,” he added.

As soon as Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur rose to reply, Mr. Gandhi and Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury protested and pointed out that since Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman was present in the House, she ought to be the one replying.

Interjecting, the Speaker observed that is was normal for the junior Ministers to furnish answers during Question Hour.

In his reply, Mr. Thakur said the Congress was trying to put the blame on the NDA government for bank irregularities committed during the UPA regime.

“The list of all bank defaulters above ₹25 lakh loans is available on the website of the Central Information Commission. I have the list and if the Chair allows me, I am ready to table it in the House,” he said.

The junior Finance Minister asserted that ₹4.8 lakh crore of defaulted loans had been recovered ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assumed office, adding that a number of steps, including the enactment of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, had been taken so that the guilty could be punished.

Referring to the recent Yes Bank crisis, Mr. Thakur said the Union Finance Minister had already said banks were safe and that the money deposited in Yes Bank was also safe.

The Minister also asserted that he didn’t want to politicise the issue “by bringing up who sold paintings and to which accounts the money went”. The Congress, earlier this month, responding to an allegation by the BJP of deep links between the Gandhi family and Yes Bank’s detained founder Rana Kapoor , asserted that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had sold an M.F. Husain painting, gifted to her father, Rajiv Gandhi, at an auction. The entire auction amount had been received by Ms. Vadra in a cheque and had been fully disclosed in her income tax returns.

The Speaker promptly ended the Question Hour even as Mr. Gandhi strongly protested at being denied a second question.

“The minister did not answer my question and I was quite hurt because it is the duty of the Honorable Speaker to protect my right to speak and allow me to ask a second supplementary question,” Mr. Gandhi told reporters outside Parliament House.

Later, addressing a press conference, party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi asserted that the reason the government had not given the details was because wilful defaults had increased from ₹39,504 crore in 2014 to ₹1.21 lakh crore.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9gt6wk/article31084485.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THRAHULGANDHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rahul-protests-after-speaker-denies-second-supplementary-question/article31084486.ece
69,2020/03/16,Bill granting Central status to three Sanskrit deemed varsities passed,"Government promoting Sanskrit at the expense of 5 other classical languages, says Opposition.

A Bill to grant the status of Central universities to three deemed Sanskrit universities was passed by the Rajya Sabha on Monday after several Opposition MPs raised concern over the other five classical Indian languages being neglected by the government.

The Central Sanskrit Universities Bill, 2020, was passed through a voice vote. Since the Bill had earlier been passed by the Lok Sabha in December 2019, it’s title was amended in the Rajya Sabha to change the year. The amended Bill will now be sent back to the Lok Sabha. It gives Central status to the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan and Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeeth in Delhi and the Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeeth in Tirupati.

While he supported the Bill and made part of his speech in Sanskrit, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh said Sanskrit was a “beautiful language” but its history of being an “instrument of caste oppression” could not be forgotten. He said the government, to a question on expenditure on classical languages in the last three years in the Lok Sabha on February 3, said it had spent around ₹640 crore on promotion of Sanskrit, ₹24 crore on Tamil, ₹3 crore each on Telugu and Kannada and nothing on Malayalam and Odia. He said all six classical languages should be promoted equally. He suggested that the government name two of the universities after Sanskrit scholars like Panini.

In his reply to the discussion, Human Resource Development Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ refuted the allegation that the government was promoting Sanskrit at the expense of other languages. He said the passage of the Bill would boost the growth of the language.

Earlier in the discussion, Samajwadi Party MP Ram Gopal Yadav suggested that the students council proposed in the Bill should instead be a students’ union comprising elected members. K.K. Ragesh of the CPI(Marxist) said the government was discriminating against South Indian languages. M. Shanmugam of the DMK said the government was trying to impose Hindi and Sanskrit.

Vandana Chavan of the Nationalist Congress Party and Manoj Jha of the Rashtriya Janata Dal both supported the Bill but said all classical languages should be given equal importance. Vaiko of the MDMK said he opposed the Bill which he termed ‘obnoxious’.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tmo8ul/article30042032.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THRAMESHPOKHRIYALNISHANK-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bill-granting-central-status-to-three-sanskrit-deemed-varsities-passed/article31084089.ece

A senior Health Ministry official said if an Indian from Europe or U.K. or Turkey travels to another country from which there is no ban, such as the U.S. or Australia, he or she will be “allowed entry and quarantined or advised home quarantine depending on his condition.” He added that this was already being allowed for Indians returning from France or Germany via Dubai in UAE.

Speaking at a press meet, Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry Lav Agarwal, assured that “adequate number of tests are being done to get information about any community transmission”.

“We don’t want to create panic and conduct unnecessary mass testing of people as of now. There is no requirement for it,” he added.

Mr. Agarwal said social distancing is a non-pharmaceutical infection prevention and control intervention implemented to avoid/decrease contact between those who are infected with a disease causing pathogen and those who are not, so as to stop or slow down the rate and extent of disease transmission in a community.

“This eventually leads to decrease in spread, morbidity and mortality due to the disease,” he added.

The GoM also recommend closure of all educational establishments, gyms, museums, cultural and social centres, swimming pools and theatres, avoiding non-essential travel, encourage private sector organizations/employers to allow employees to work from home wherever and do video conference meetings.

Religious centres, restaurants and market associations have also been asked to minimise crowds.

After the Central government has declared masks and hand sanitisers as essential commodities, the Haryana government has ordered its officials to carry out operations against speculators and those involved in black marketing and over pricing amid the COVID-19 scare.

The director of State Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs has asked the district food supplies controllers (DFSCs) to inspect pharmacies, chemists and drug wholesalers to ensure availability of products at reasonable prices.

“As district head of consumer affairs, the DFSCs and their subordinate inspection staff shall visit chemist shops, pharmacies and drug wholesalers to check their stock of masks and hand sanitisers. Hoarding and refusal to dispense shall be reported and acted against,” said the order.

The order said the officials should check if excessive price was being levied on the items and examine if supply to chemists from manufactures had been reduced without any reason. The officials should also ensure increased availability of both the items to the general public at reasonable price below the maximum retail price, it added.

Notably, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution has regulated the production, quality, distribution, logistics of masks (2ply & 3 ply surgical masks, N95 masks) and hand sanitisers for COVID-19 management. Both masks and hand sanitisers have been brought under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, empowering States to regulate production, distribution and prices and also crackdown on hoarding and black marketing.

As many as 138 cases of infiltration by terrorists were reported along the Line of Control (LoC) and International Border (IB) in 2019 and 157 terrorists were “neutralised” in the said period in Jammu and Kashmir, the government informed the Parliament on Monday.

In a written response to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Defence Shripad Yesso Naik said, “There have been 138 cases of infiltration by terrorists along Line of Control/International Border during the year 2019. Due to concerted and synergised efforts of security forces, 157 terrorists were neutralised in the year 2019 in Jammu & Kashmir.”

Replying to another question, the Minister said in the last five years – 2015-16 to 2019-20 (up to January, 2020) – 158 contracts were signed with Indian vendors and 100 with foreign vendors for capital procurement of defence equipment for the armed forces.

The defence equipment procured from Indian vendors over the last five years included helicopters, radars, electronic fuses, bridges, ballistic helmets, bullet-proof jackets, rocket launchers and vehicles, he added.

The defence equipment procured from foreign vendors in the said period included helicopters, aircraft, search-and-rescue equipment, air defence radars and systems, assault rifles and rockets, Mr. Naik said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xv0yvz/article29529273.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHRIPADYESSONAIK-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/138-infiltration-cases-reported-along-loc-and-ib-157-terrorists-neutralised-in-2019-shripad-naik/article31083545.ece
73,2020/03/16,CPI(M) slams ‘horse-trading’ for toppling elected governments,"The party said Union Home minister Amit Shah’s statement in Parliament that nobody would be marked as a doubtful citizen in the NPR updation process was of no consequence as long as the Rules under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act-2003 remained.

In light of the developments in Madhya Pradesh, the Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s Polit Bureau has denounced the “brazen horse-trading and the use of threats” to enforce defections of MLAs to topple democratically-elected governments and violate the people’s mandate.

“Earlier too, in Karnataka and elsewhere, similar tactics betrayed the people’s mandate in the States,” the CPI(M) said in a statement on Monday, following a meeting of its Polit Bureau on March 14-15. “These are anti-democratic acts which make a mockery of popular verdict of the people and democracy,” the Left party added.

Coronavirus awareness

The party called upon its cadre to create public awareness on the precautions that need to be adopted for containing the coronavirus pandemic. The Polit Bureau commended the Kerala government’s efforts in arresting the spread. It also criticised the Centre for the partial modification of an order that earlier had envisaged providing compensation to families which have lost a member to the virus and for the cost of treatment of positive cases.

“This has to be reversed immediately,” said the party, which also demanded that the government provide assistance to workers in the informal/organised sectors who may have lost jobs due to the epidemic-triggered shutdowns.

The CPI(M) said Union Home minister Amit Shah’s statement in Parliament that nobody would be marked as a doubtful citizen in the NPR updation process was of no consequence as long as the Rules under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act-2003 remained. Demanding that these norms be scrapped, the party said, “Unless these measures are undertaken by the government of India, the peaceful protests will continue”.

Delhi violence

The party also condemned the recent communal violence in Delhi and sought a time-bound, court-monitored probe for bringing the guilty to justice. It also condemned the Home minister’s statement on the use of facial recognition technology to identify those involved.

“The government, itself, has admitted before the courts that this technology had an accuracy rate of only 2% in 2018, which dropped to a mere 1% in 2019... this opens up possibilities for harassment and persecution of innocent people. Moreover, there is no legal framework or any judicial order to use such technology for such identification,” it said.

For relief to the victims, the party had collected more than ₹6 crore, with the Kerala State committee having raised more than ₹5.3 crore.

Jammu & Kashmir

Welcoming the release of MP Farooq Abdullah after seven months of detention, the Polit Bureau demanded the immediate release of all those detained from the night of August 4/5, 2019. “J&K Statehood with special status, as it had [been] under the Indian Constitution, must be restored immediately,” it said.

The Polit Bureau also discussed the “collapse” of Yes Bank and observed that “in a classic instance of privatisation of profits and nationalisation of losses, the State Bank of India has been asked to bailout this bank”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cpim-slams-horse-trading-for-toppling-elected-governments/article31083446.ece
74,2020/03/16,"Will add liquidity if needed, RBI assures Yes Bank depositors","There is no need to carry out panic withdrawals on Wednesday, says Shaktikanta Das

Describing the reconstruction scheme for Yes Bank as credible and sustainable, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das on Monday sought to assure the private bank’s depositors that their hard-earned money is safe.

He also said that the central bank will infuse additional liquidity into private lender, if required, and urged depositors that there was no need to carry out panic withdrawals after the moratorium on the bank ends on Wednesday (March 18).

Watch | Yes Bank crisis explained

“It is a very credible and sustainable restructuring plan,” Mr. Das said while addressing the media here on the Yes Bank issue and the coronavirus crisis.

Terming the restructuring of the bank a “historic development”, he said that it is the first time a weak and failing bank has not been merged with another stronger lender and rather the central bank has gone ahead with reconstructing the bank.”It is also an instance of public private partnership (PPP) for revival of a private sector bank,” he said.

Against the backdrop of the Maharashtra government deciding to desist from having accounts in private sector banks, Mr. Das said that RBI has written to all state governments saying that the Indian banking sector is sound and safe, including the private banking sector.

“There is no reason for the state authorities to keep away from private banks who are important components of the banking sector,” he said.

Explained: Why did Yes Bank have to be bailed out?

The government on Saturday notified the scheme of reconstruction for cash-strapped Yes Bank Ltd paving the way for the lender to resume full operations. The bank on Monday said that it will resume its full-fledged operations at 6 p.m. on Wednesday (March 18).

Investment by private banks has so far reached ₹3,950 crore. Among the private players, ICICI Bank and Housing Development Finance Corporation committed ₹1,000 crore each. Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank committed to invest ₹ 600 crore and ₹500 crore respectively. Both Federal Bank and Bandhan Bank have been allotted shares for ₹ 300 crore each as per their commitment and IDFC First Bank has been issued equity shares in the crisis-ridden bank for a consideration of ₹250 crore.

Further, SBI which would hold 49 per cent stake in the cash-strapped lender has been allotted 605 crore shares for ₹6,050 crore. SBI, the largest public sector bank in the country, has in fact committed ₹7,250 crore. On Thursday, it said that its Executive Committee of the Central Board (ECCB) has approved the purchase of 725 crore shares in Yes Bank at Rs 10 per share.

The private sector bank had been put under a moratorium by the Reserve Bank of India since March 5 which has restricted deposit withdrawals up to ₹50,000 per month. Under the terms of the notified scheme, this moratorium will now be lifted at 6 p.m. on March 18.

The Central government has appointed former SBI official Prashant Kumar as the new Chief Executive Officer of the financially troubled Yes Bank. Mr. Kumar is currently the administrator of bank, and the former Chief Financial Officer and Deputy Managing Director of SBI will take over his new responsibilities once the moratorium on the stressed lender is lifted on Wednesday.

RBI hints at rate cut

Reserve Bank on Monday hinted at a rate cut at the next Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meet on April 3 and announced more liquidity enhancing measures.

The market was expecting a rate cut as the presser was called only around noon after as many as 43 other central banks, including the US Fed, the European Central Bank and Bank of England, did so.

75,2020/03/16,10% decrease in deaths due to road accidents after new law: Nitin Gadkari,"The Transport Minister said Tamil Nadu has made significant progress in reducing the number of deaths in road accidents by 24% in last five months.

There has been a 10% reduction in the number of deaths caused due to accidents in the country since the passage of the amended Motor Vehicles Act five months ago, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari informed Rajya Sabha on Monday.

The Minister, while replying to supplementaries during the Question Hour, said the government has pledged to reduce 50% accidents in the next five years, and India is a signatory to this at the World Safety Conference held in Sweden recently.

Mr. Gadkari said a total of 5 lakh accidents happen in the country and around 1.5 lakh people lose their lives in these accidents. Of these, 65% people die in the age group of 18 to 35 years, he said.

He said Tamil Nadu has made significant progress in reducing the number of deaths in road accidents in the country by 24% in the last five months, the maximum anywhere in the country.

“There has been a 10% reduction in the number of deaths due to accidents in the country in the last five months ever since the passage of the new Motor Vehicles Act by Parliament,” Mr. Gadkari informed the House.

“We have been able to save 10,000 lives,” he said, adding that Tamil Nadu has done some good work in this regard.

Mr. Gadkari said Jammu and Kashmir and Chandigarh have shown 15% reduction in the number of deaths due to accidents, Gujarat has helped reduce 14% deaths, Uttar Pradesh 13% and Andhra Pradesh 7%, while Manipur reduced 4%.

“However, in Kerala there has been a rise of 4.9% in deaths due to road accidents and Assam has shown 8% rise,” he told the House.

The Minister also informed that among various steps being taken to reduce accidents, the government proposes to open 1,000 driving schools in the country, of which 22 have already been opened.

He said most accidents happened due to poor road engineering and the government has identified 3,000 black spots to help reduce accidents in the country.

He said a ₹14,000-crore plan has been put in place whereby the World Bank and Asian Development Bank will invest ₹7,000 crore and the same amount will be spent by the Government of India towards education, enforcement and improving road engineering to help reduce accidents.

The Transport Minister also informed that the Motor Vehicles Act is in the Concurrent list and States are empowered to compound the offences and implement the provisions of the Act as per their requirements.

He said both his and a Chief Minister’s vehicle have been challaned [billed] for traffic violations and no one is spared whatever the position one may occupy.

He also told the members that there is no discrimination on the basis of sex, caste or class of people and anyone violating the law will be punished and billed.

76,2020/03/16,Delhi High Court to hear plea for drafting uniform civil code next week,"The petition came up for hearing before a Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar which said it will hear the plea on March 23.

The Delhi High Court said on Monday it will hear a plea seeking drafting of a uniform civil code (UCC) to secure gender justice, equality and dignity of women, next week.

Also Read Uniform civil code neither necessary nor desirable at this stage, says Law Commission

The petition came up for hearing before a Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar which said it will hear the plea on March 23.

Five other similar petitions, in which the court has sought the Centre’s response, are also listed for hearing on March 23.

The fresh petition filed by social activist Danish Eqbal has sought direction to the Centre for drafting the UCC and publishing it on the website for public debate. As an alternative, it has sought direction for the Law Commission to draft the UCC within three months by including uniform minimum age of marriage; grounds of divorce, maintenance and alimony; adoption and guardianship; and succession and inheritance within three months and publish it on the website for wider public deliberation.

The plea said that country-wide application of UCC will end multiple personal laws promoting tolerance among various groups across the nation.

The first petition was filed by BJP leader and lawyer Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay last year seeking framing of a UCC to promote national integration and gender justice, equality and dignity of women.

Besides the five pleas, the court had earlier issued a notice to Mr. Upadhyay and the Centre on an application by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) seeking to be impleaded as a party in the petition filed by the BJP leader.

After Mr. Upadhyay, lawyer Abhinav Beri moved a similar plea in August last year for direction to the Centre to constitute a judicial commission or a high-level committee to draft the UCC.

A third petition was filed by Firoz Bakht Ahmed, the Chancellor of Maulana Azad National Urdu University and grandnephew of first Education Minister Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, in October last year.

The fourth PIL was moved by Amber Zaidi, who claims in her plea to be a social activist and media personality. Ms. Zaidi has contended that India “urgently needs a UCC or Indian Civil Code in the spirit of Article 44 read with Article 14” of the Constitution.

She has claimed she moved the plea with the “sole purpose to secure gender justice, gender equability and dignity of women”.

The fifth petition was filed by Nighat Abbass, who claims to be a social activist, media panellist and political analyst.

The five petitions have sought directions to the Centre to constitute a judicial commission or a high-level expert committee to draft the UCC within three months, while considering the best practices of all religions and sects, civil laws of developed countries and international conventions.

All the petitioners have contended that India “urgently needs a uniform civil code” to promote national integration as well as gender justice, equality and dignity of women.

The petitioners have contended that gender justice and gender equality, guaranteed under Articles 14-15 of the Constitution and dignity of women, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, cannot be secured without implementing Article 44 (the State shall endeavour to secure for citizens a UCC throughout the territory of India).

The petitions have claimed that a UCC would replace the personal laws, based on the scriptures and customs of various religious communities, with a common set of rules governing every citizen of the country.

The BJP, in its manifesto before the 2019 Lok Sabha election, had mentioned the UCC, saying Article 44 of the Constitution lists it as one of the Directive Principles of State Policy.

Mr. Upadhyay, in his plea, has claimed that the issue of UCC is there in BJP’s manifesto since the time of Jan Sangh in 1952. He has contended that the Centre has “failed” to put in place a UCC as provided under Article 44.

Mr. Beri’s petition has sought a direction to the Law Commission to draft a UCC within three months and publish that on its website for at least 90 days for wide public debate and feedback.

In last 70 years, the Constitution has been amended 125 times and judgment of the Supreme Court has been nullified five times but the executive has not taken serious steps to implement UCC, the plea has said.

In December 2015, the Supreme Court Bench headed by the then Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur had declined to hear Mr. Upadhyay’s petition in which he had sought to bring the civil code which brings all religious personal laws under one umbrella. He had then withdrawn the petition.

In October 2015, while dealing with a divorce case under the Christian Divorce Act, a Supreme Court Bench headed by Justice Vikramajit Sen asked the government to take a quick decision on the UCC to end the confusion over personal community laws.

In July 2003, an apex court Bench led by the then CJI V.N. Khare said Article 44 was based on the premise that there was no necessary connection between religious and personal law in a civilised society.

The apex court was hearing a petition challenging section 118 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, which prevents Christians from bequeathing property for religious and charitable purposes.

The Punjab Cabinet on Monday held a meeting to take stock of the situation arising out of the COVID-19 outbreak and gave ex-post facto approval to the Chief Minister’s decision on extending the services of the doctors and paramedical staff working with the Health and Family Welfare department.

An official statement said the services had been extended till September 30, 2020, for which a resolution was passed at the meeting as the Cabinet reviewed the reports of the 7-member Group of Ministers (GoM) constituted under the chairmanship of Local Bodies Minister Brahm Mohindra to oversee the preventive measures undertaken to combat the threat.

All doctors and paramedical staff in the department would continue to work irrespective of their age of retirement.

Talking to journalists on the occasion of completion of three years of his government, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said he was committed to elimination of all kinds of mafia and monopoly. He said he would not allow mining, liquor, drug and transport mafias, gangsters and terrorists to disturb the State’s peaceful environment.

The Chief Minister said his government had been working to end all this since taking over Punjab’s reins “but these things take time. We have done our best and we could not have done any better considering the situation,” he said.

Describing unemployment as the biggest concern, he announced that one lakh government vacancies would be filled up in the next two years, through transparent and merit-based system. The aim was to achieve the target of 20 lakh total employment by 2022, he said.

Asked about the monopoly of a family on buses being operated from the Delhi airports to Punjab, the Chief Minister said his government was working to address the issue but the Delhi government also had to be on board with any decision.

Referring to complaints of continued illegal practices in sand mining, Capt. Amarinder said he had asked the Water Resources Minister to thoroughly review and make this system fully transparent. He said his government remained committed to transparency in governance and to this end would soon bring in the new Lokpal Bill (covering all government functionaries including the Chief Minister), along with the Punjab Anti Red Tape legislation and a Land Leasing & Tenancy Act.

The Chief Minister said the back of the drug mafia had already been broken by his government, which could not have done more in this limited period. Narco terrorists were using new ways to push drugs into the State using drones and new routes. “But we are prepared to deal with them,” he said pointing out that besides the Pakistan border, the sea route from the Gujarat port was being used by drug smugglers, along with Nepal, Burma, Uri (Kashmir), Chamba (Himachal Pradesh) and even Delhi.

He declared that the closure of the Kartarpur corridor was only a temporary measure in view of the COVID-19 outbreak.

The Supreme Court on Monday took suo motu cognisance of the risk of COVID-19 infection spreading within and from overcrowded prisons across the country.

Making its pleasure known for the preventive steps taken by the Government of Kerala to isolate and test prisoners in the State, a Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde ordered States and Union Territories to respond on the preventive measures in place in prisons against the virus by March 20.

“The Director General of Prisons, Kerala, has set up isolation cells within prisons across Kerala. Those suffering with COVID-19 symptoms such as cold and fever are being moved to these isolation cells. All the new inmates who will be admitted to the prisons in Kerala will be isolated in the isolation cells in the admissions block for six days before permitting their entry into the regular prison cells,” the Supreme Court order said.

Isolation ward in Tihar

The apex court noted that similarly an isolation ward has been set up in the Tihar Jail in Delhi and all the 17,500 inmates were checked for COVID-19.

It was found that none displayed any symptoms relating to COVID-19. The Tihar Jail authorities have also decided that new inmates will be screened and put in different wards for three days, the order said.

The court observed that social distancing, an effective antidote against the virus spread, is difficult in prisons. There are 1,339 prisons with approximately 4,66,084 inmates. The court said the National Crime Records Bureau shows the occupancy rate of Indian prisons is at 117.6%.

“Contagious viruses such as COVID-19 proliferate in closed spaces such as prisons. Studies establish that prison inmates are highly prone to contagious viruses. The rate of ingress and egress in prisons is very high, especially since persons (accused, convicts, detenues, etc.) are brought to the prisons on a daily basis. Apart from them, several correctional officers and other prison staff enter the prisons regularly, and so do visitors (kith and kin of prisoners) and lawyers...

80,2020/03/16,"Bhima Koregaon case: no pre-arrest bail, SC tells activists Navlakha, Teltumbde","Court gives them three weeks to surrender; directs them to surrender their passports immediately

The Supreme Court on Monday rejected pleas made by activists Anand Teltumbde and Gautam Navlakha for pre-arrest bail in the Bhima Koregaon case.

A Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and M.R. Shah invoked Section 43D (4) of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and held that the provision “bars” the relief of anticipatory bail to those accused of offences under the UAPA.

The Bench, during the arguments, made it clear that there seemed to be “prima facie evidence” under the UAPA against the activists. Justice Shah repeatedly told senior advocates Kapil Sibal and A.M. Singhvi, for the activists, that the High Court had earlier concluded the existence of prima facie material against the duo.

Section 43D (4) of UAPA mandates that “nothing in Section 438 CrPC (anticipatory or pre-arrest bail) shall apply in relation to any case involving the arrest of any person accused of having committed an offence punishable under this Act (UAPA)”.

The court gave Navlakha and Teltumbde three weeks to surrender. It directed them to surrender their passports immediately.

“We give them [Teltumbde and Navlakha] three weeks to surrender as they have enjoyed protection from arrest since January 21, 2018, appropriately one-and-a-half years,” Justice Mishra said.

Navlakha statement

Thanking the Supreme Court for giving him three weeks to surrender, Navlakha, in a statement, said, “Now that I have to surrender within three weeks I ask myself - dare I hope to be freed from the burden of being accused in what appears to me, to be yet another conspiracy trial, one more in the long list of such trials? Will the co-accused and others like them get their freedom back? These questions creep in because of the times we live in where civil liberties are getting progressively squeezed, and where only one narrative dominates, backed by crassness in public life… The dreadful act - the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act - allows for banning of an organisation and outlaws its ideology. As a result, the most innocuous and legitimate of engagement and interaction can become criminal in the eyes of the State. It is a law that makes the very process an instrument of punishment, without even waiting for the trial and its outcome”.

The order came after a lengthy hearing. The court decided to pass a short order after considering the uncertainty surrounding its functioning in the wake of the COVID infection spread.

“I am not a violent reactionary of any sort. I have an intellectual approach which may on some issues be against the State. I have been used a mediator to urge people who use violence to turn away from it... But now they call me violent?"" Mr. Singhvi, assisted by advocate Shadan Farasat, argued.

Mr. Sibal, for Teltumbde, said the probe agencies have not received any material or communication from his client or his house. Whatever they were using to build a case against his client was found in a computer.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta countered that all others in the Bhima Koregaon case have been arrested, except Teltumbde and Navlakha. “We need their custodial interrogation. We have questions,” Mr. Mehta submitted.

At one point, Mr. Mehta referred to Varavara Rao, who is also an accused in the case, saying he was “supposed to be a poet” but there was evidence associating him with rocket launchers and grenades. Mr. Mehta said all the accused, including well-known lawyer, Sudha Bhardwaj, were “all acting in tandem”.

“This is not an offence against individuals but against the nation. It is for a reason that we are seeking custodial interrogation,” Mr. Mehta pressed his case. He said the “Maoist activities” of the two men was quite apparent. He claimed that there was enough evidence of involvement with separatists, which they happen to call “Liberation Struggle” in Kashmir. “They have consistently lost pleas for quashing the case against them. This shows prima facie that there is a case against them,” he argued.

In his rebuttal, Mr. Sibal challenged the prosecution to show if there was any direct evidence to show the direct involvement of the two activists. “Somebody may have written something referring to my name. But that does not implicate me,” he argued.

Justice Shah responded, “If this court has refused to interfere earlier and there is evidence that there have been references to you, is it not correct that there is a prima facie case against you?”

In September 2018, a majority judgment of the Supreme Court held that arrests made in the Bhima Koregaon case were not an attempt to silence dissenting voices in the country. It had given the go-ahead to the Maharashtra police to pursue the case under the draconian UAPA.

81,2020/03/16,SC to hear today plea for M.P. trust vote,"Petition filed by ex-CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, 9 other BJP MLAs

The Supreme Court will on Tuesday urgently hear a petition filed by former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and nine other BJP MLAs seeking the holding of a vote of confidence on the floor of the Legislative Assembly against the Kamalnath-led Congress government.

Mr. Chouhan and his fellow BJP legislators, who approached the Supreme Court on March 16, wanted the floor test to be held immediately, possibly within the next 12 hours. They challenged the decision of the Assembly Speaker to adjourn the floor test to March 26. Mr. Chouhan informed the court that “horse-trading is at its peak” in the State.

The petition is listed for hearing before a Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta.

“Any deferment of the floor test will further encourage horse-trading and would be in utter violation of the directions issued by the Governor and the law laid down by this Court and the spirit and Basic Structure of the Constitution,” the BJP leaders contended.

The demand for a floor test arose after the departure of Jyotiraditya Scindia from the Congress.

The petition said 22 Congress legislators resigned on account of their dissatisfaction with Mr. Nath’s “non-fulfilment of promises made prior to elections”. They tendered their resignation to the Speaker on March 10.

It is believed that their resignations have reduced the present Congress government’s numbers in the House to a minority.

“Since the government appears to have lost the majority in the House and the Chief Minister had himself expressed willingness to conduct the floor test, the Governor, in exercise of his constitutional powers, in a letter dated March 14, directed the Chief Minister to conduct a floor test in the House and prove his majority on March 16, when the Budget Session of the Assembly begins,” the petition said.

However, despite the clear-cut directions issued by the Governor to the Chief Minister to seek a vote of confidence and prove his majority on March 16 after the address of the Governor, the confidence vote has not been included in the business of the House for the day.

“The direction of the Governor has, thus, intentionally and wilfully been defied. The Chief Minister and his party leaders have publicly declined to conduct the floor test,” the petition said. It reiterated that with the “lack of confidence and resignation” of the 22 MLAs, of which six have been accepted by the Speaker, the Nath government has been reduced to a minority.

“It has no moral, legal, democratic or constitutional right to remain in power even for a single day. All possible attempts are being made by the Chief Minister to convert his minority government into majority by giving all possible threats, allurements to the members of the Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha. The horse-trading is at its peak,” it said.

Whenever a situation has arisen over the issue of majority of a government in the House, the top court had always issued directions for immediate conduct of floor test. Both the Speaker and the Chief Minister have deliberately defied the Governor and violated fundamental rights.

Besides Mr. Chouhan, the other petitioners are Gopal Bhargava, Narottam Mishra, Bhupendra Singh, Rameshwar Sharma, Vishnu Khatri, Vishwas Sarang, Sanjay Satyendra Pathak, Krishna Gaur and Suresh Rai.

82,2020/03/16,"Madhya Pradesh crisis: Kamal Nath, Governor spar over floor test","Surprised that Governor believed prima facie govt had lost majority, says M.P. CM Kamal Nath

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Monday wrote to the Governor, claiming that the latter was overstepping powers conferred on him under the Constitution and held his “prima facie belief” of the government being in minority based on the BJP’s opinion, while ignoring the Congress government’s charge against it.

In the evening, Governor Lalji Tandon shot back a letter to him expressing regret that the language and tone of Mr. Nath’s letter was “not in consonance with parliamentary propriety.”

The sparring began as Mr. Tandon, after a BJP delegation met him, on Sunday directed Mr. Nath to hold a floor test and prove majority in the Vidhan Sabha in any condition on Monday, without attempting to stall the vote. And with the session adjourned, Mr. Tandon has now requested him to prove majority in the Vidhan Sabha by Tuesday. “Otherwise it will be held that in reality you don’t have a majority in the house,” he wrote.

Mr. Nath stated that he was surprised that the Governor believed prima facie the government had lost the majority. “It appears that you believed this based on information received from the BJP. In this relation, legal provisions are clear that the Governor cannot take notice of any such group separated from the main party which does not fulfil the parameters (two-third majority] laid down in the Schedule 10. The reality is that in the present conditions, this group is in the clutches of the BJP. That is why it is inappropriate for you to reach such a prima facie conclusion.”

In the light of the perspective given by the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, wrote Mr. Nath, the letter given by the Governor “appears to be beyond powers conferred on the Governor under the Constitution.”

Besides, he said, it was a matter of public concern the BJP had possibly “given bribes, lurements and restricted” several Congress MLAs, as he had explained in the previous letter.

He stated that with “utter sadness” and “anguish”, that far from finding a solution to the “illegal conducts like restrictions on my MLAs”, the Governor had not even mentioned it in his letter.

Mr. Nath further wrote that he was also surprised that in Mr. Tandon’s direction, in the form of a message, he had expectations from him on matters pertaining to the Vidhan Sabha’s functioning which, in his opinion, fell in the domain of the Speaker.

“I hope and have faith that your honour will work according to law and the Constitution in the future,” he wrote.

Mr. Nath pointed out to the Governor that by holding several Congress MLAs “hostage” under the control of the police, the BJP was compelling them to make statements. “...In such a situation that there is no point in holding a floor test of any kind and doing this would be unconstitutional and undemocratic. A floor test will be justified when all MLAs are free from restrictions and duress.”

Tandon’s Assembly address

After his address in the Assembly on Monday, Mr. Tandon advised MLAs that given the turmoil in the State, those with responsibility should “work independently” and “stick to constitutional principles”. He held the reasons given by Mr. Nath for his inability to hold a test as “baseless” and “meaningless”.

Mr. Tandon wrote: “You didn’t initiate the process to seek a trust vote of the Assembly and didn’t make meaningful efforts towards it”.

When the question arises if a government had the trust of the House or not, he said, the Supreme Court, in several undisputed orders, had established the answer laid in floor test.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/getzzy/article31080359.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI15-03-2020000078B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kamal-nath-writes-to-governor-stating-floor-test-isnt-possible-when-mlas-are-in-captivity/article31081180.ece

Reliance Group Chairman Anil Ambani has been summoned by the ED in connection with its money laundering probe against Yes Bank promoter Rana Kapoor and others, officials said on Monday.

They said Ambani has been asked to depose at the Enforcement Directorate office in Mumbai on Monday as his group companies are one among the big entities whose loans went bad after borrowing from the crisis-hit bank.

It is understood that Ambani has sought exemption on health grounds from the agency and he may be issued a new date.

Ambani’s group companies are stated to have taken loans of about Rs 12,800 crore from the bank that turned NPA.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said in a March 6 press conference that the Anil Ambani Group, Essel, ILFS, DHFL and Vodafone were among the stressed corporates Yes Bank had exposure to.

Officials said promoters of all the big companies who had taken large loans from the beleaguered bank which later turned bad, are being summoned for questioning in the case to take investigation forward.

Ambani’s statement will be recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) upon deposition, they said.

Kapoor (62), is at present in ED custody after he was arrested by the central probe agency early this month.

“The Chief Minister is more concerned about the elections rather than the lives of people,” Mr Naidu alleged addressing a press conference at the party office in Guntur district on Monday.

Mr. Naidu said that The State government moved Supreme Court asking for the orders to continue the election process of local bodies. The State government challenged the decision of the State Election Commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar to postpone the local body elections in the Supreme Court. At a time when every country was worried about the spread of coronavirus, Mr. Jagan Mohan reddy was keen on conducting the elections and summoned former Election Commissioner Ramakanth Reddy to seek his suggestion on conducting the elections. The Chief Minister’s focus was only on the elections but not on tackling the Covid-19, he said.

The Centre has cautioned the States to be a vigilant on Covid-19. Section 144 was imposed in Mumbai and restrictions were in vogue in Delhi.

The government, in its petition before the apex court, accused the SEC of not taking it into confidence while taking the major decision of deferring the polls and called the move anti- constitutional.

The government also found fault with the SEC for not consulting the High Court on whose instructions the elections were scheduled.

92,2020/03/16,CS urges poll panel to revoke its orders,"‘Large-scale outbreak of Covid-19 unlikely in the next three to four weeks’

Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney wrote a letter to the State Election Commission (SEC) urging it to revoke its order of postponing the elections and adhere to the schedule announced earlier.

The Chief Secretary’s letter comes in the wake of the SEC decision to postpone the elections in view of the Covid-19 scare.

Ms. Sawhney, in the letter, said the situation related to Covid-19 was under control in the State and it would continue to be under control for another three to four weeks. Further, considering that there is no local transmission, leave alone community transmission, there may be no threat of outbreak in the next three to four weeks. However, looking at the trend in other countries, in spite of all efforts, nothing can be predicted of the situation after four weeks. Thus, any postponement of elections would make the conduct of elections very uncertain depriving the State of the 3rd tier of the government which is critical at this juncture, she said.

Referring to Centre’s notification, she said it was made more for enabling the State governments to access funds from SDRF for meeting expenditures for containment of Covid-19 rather than for declaring the coronavirus outbreak a notified disaster.

The State Election Commission on Sunday issued a notification halting the process of local body elections by six weeks in the view of the coronavirus threat.

State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar had said that after six weeks or after the threat of coronavirus recedes, the election process would continue with changes wherever necessary. For the panchayat elections, a fresh notification would be issued once normalcy is restored. He had also said the Centre had issued an advisory to State governments to control large gatherings.

The Chief Secretary said the government would like to assure that it has been taking and would continue to take all necessary steps fro containment of Covid-19. Concerns with regard to the election coming in the way of containing Covid-19 can be addressed by issuing suitable advisories with regard to election campaigning by candidates and congregation at the polling stations.

Prior consultation

Stating that public health was the responsibility of the State government and therefore the SEC could have held prior consultation with the State. “This would have helped us to appraise the correct status of Covid-19 before coming to a conclusion regarding postponement of the elections,” she said.

Terming the postponement of local body elections as a conspiracy by the Telugu Desam Party, Minister for Transport and I&PR Perni Venkataramaiah (Nani) has said that the State Election Commission colluded with former Chief Minister N.

The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) resolved to sanction a financial aid of ₹ 25 crore to the Endowments Department for taking up renovation / restoration of about 90 identified temples in the State.

The decision comes in the wake of a letter from the Endowments Commissioner in which a formal request was made to the TTD seeking an aid of ₹28.50 crore for taking up renovation / restoration of the 90 temples which were more than 100 years old. A thorough scrutiny of each case revealed that the temples which were either ancient or of historical importance were plagued by paucity of funds.

It was also stated in the letter that works would be taken up through the engineering wing of the department.

However, annexure 1 enclosed by the officials read that the total cost of works worked out to ₹25 crore.

For the record, the TTD board, way back in 2007, had resolved to take up works relating to renovation of of the temples, including ones of Lord Venkateswara, reflecting Indian culture across the State with a ceiling cost of ₹ 25 lakh and in the process also had sanctioned 114 such works at an estimated cost of ₹2341.15 lakh. Of this, 67 works were completed and 15 were under progress. Six are yet to be taken up and the remaining 26 works were pending due to non-receipt of funds by way of mandatory public contributions.

The TTD in 2017 again wrote to to the Endowments Commissioner, urging him to furnish the details of all ancient temples of Lord Venkateswara in the State and based on the inspection committee report, resolved to take up the renovation of about 36 endowments temples at a cost of ₹7 crore.

It is against this back drop that the board which met recently discussed the issue threadbare and taking cognisance of the previous history and patronage extended by TTD to the Endowments Department, resolved to grant a one-time financial aid of ₹25 crore besides addressing a detailed letter to the government seeking its approval.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/436yy9/article31083645.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17VJPAGETIRUMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ttd-to-fund-renovation-ofabout-90-temples-in-state/article31083646.ece
98,2020/03/16,BJP seeks issue of fresh notification for local body polls,"‘There were reports of threats to some candidates’

BJP leader and former MLA P. Vishnu Kumar Raju demanded scrapping of the election process and issue of a fresh notification for the local body polls.

While appreciating the decision of the State Election Commission to postpone the elections in view of the threat of COVID-2019, the BJP leader said that the YSR Congress government should also understand the gravity of the situation and take a cue from neighbouring Telangana, which has ordered closure of schools and shopping malls in view of the virus threat. He said that there was an acute shortage of masks and sanitisers at medical shops in the city.

Referring to the transfer of a few IAS and police officers by the Election Commission, Mr. Raju said that it was an indication that some irregularities had occurred during the filing of nominations for the local body polls at some places in the State. There were reports of threats to some candidates in a bid to prevent them from filing their nominations. All these call for scrapping of the election process and issue of fresh notification.

He wondered as to how unanimous election was possible, when there were four/five parties contesting the elections. Mere postponement of elections was not the solution as the candidates would continue to face threats. The BJP leader also suggested allowing the candidate to file nomination at a few places in the area to prevent instances of kidnapping of candidates, when they come to file nomination at the designated place.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bjp-seeks-issue-of-fresh-notification-for-local-body-polls/article31083291.ece
99,2020/03/16,Opposition parties strongly object to CM’s remarks against SEC,"‘Launch election process afresh to protect democracy’

Opposition parties, including the TDP, BJP and Lok Satta Party, on Monday strongly objected to allegations levelled by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy against State Election Commissioner (SEC) Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar who had postponed the elections while citing coronavirus scare.

They said that that making allegations against the constitutional bodies was unfortunate and no leader had made such comments against the SEC previously.

BJP leaders, including Pakalapati Sanyasi Raju, Reddi Pavani and Bhavireddy Sivaprasad Reddy, submitted a memorandum to District Collector M. Hari Jawaharlal seeking action over violent incidents relating to local body elections. They insisted on re-issuing of election notification to ensure free and fair elections. Ms. Pavani said that the SEC had taken action on many Collectors and police officials after observing the violence in many places and his decisions with regard to postponement of election and action on officials should not be questioned by anyone, including the Chief Minister.

TDP Vizianagaram district president Mahanti Chinnam Naidu, Vizianagaram Constituency in-charge Aditi Gajapathi Raju sought an inquiry over the unprecedented irregularities in the election process. They said that YSRCP leaders had threatened others to withdraw their nominations at many places. They strongly insisted on launching the election process afresh to protect democracy in the State.

Lok Satta Party State Executive president Bhisetti Babji urged the ruling party leaders to withdraw their allegations against Mr. Ramesh Kumar. He said that postponement of election might cause inconvenience to many but holding free and fair election was equally important to allow people to exercise their franchise without any fear.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/6c38y1/article31083190.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17VJRJYPAGEMEMO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/opposition-parties-strongly-object-to-cms-remarks-against-sec/article31083192.ece
100,2020/03/16,TTD to fund renovation of 90 temples in Andhra Pradesh,"A thorough scrutiny of each case also revealed that the temples which were either ancient or of historical importance were plagued by paucity of funds

The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has resolved to sanction ₹ 25 crore to the State Endowments Department for taking up renovation/restoration of about 90 identified temples spread in all the 13 districts of the state.

The decision comes in the wake of a letter from the Endowments Commissioner (ROC.No. P1/COE/729/2018) dated 03.01.2019 in which a formal request was made to the TTD for sanctioning a financial aid of ₹ 28.5 crore for taking up renovation/restoration works to 90 identified temples in the State. It also categorically stated that the temples were of more than 100 years old. A thorough scrutiny of each case based purely on merit also revealed that the temples which were either ancient or of historical importance were plagued by paucity of funds.

Reflecting Indian culture

The letter also had a categorical mentioning that the works will be taken up through the Engineering Wing of its department. However the Annexure-I, enclosed by the officials read that the total cost of works worked out to ₹ 25 crore.

For the record, the TTD Board way back in 2007 had resolved to take up works relating to renovation of gopurams and monuments of the temples, including the temples of Lord Venkateswara reflecting Indian culture across the State with a ceiling cost of ₹ 25 lakh and in the process also had sanctioned 114 such works at an estimated cost of Rs. 23.41crore. Of this, while 67 works were completed, 15 are still under progress, six yet to be taken up, and the remaining 26 works were pending due to non-receipt of funds by way of mandatory public contributions.

For reviving past glory

Further, to achieve its desired objective, the TTD in 2017 again shot a letter to the Endowments Commissioner requesting him to furnish the information of all the ancient temples of Lord Venkateswara in the State, and based on the Inspection Committee report resolved to take up the renovation of about 36 endowments temples at a cost of ₹ 7 crore.

101,2020/03/16,Parties fume at A.P. Government’s insouciance about COVID-19,"BJP, Congress and Jana Sena flay the State for ‘unpreparedness’

Major political parties joined in flaying the State government for making light of the COVID-19 scare that is rocking the entire world. The government came under fire for gross unpreparedness, even as its neighbours Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka had pulled up their socks to face the pandemic.

CM’s paracetamol tip: ignorance or apathy?

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State President Kanna Lakshminarayana said here on Monday that the State government should hang its head in shame for having shown ‘utter disregard’ for the people’s well-being. On Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s suggestion to take paracetamol to control the COVID-19 virus, he said it was unfortunate for Andhra Pradesh to be governed by such leaders.

BJP workers staged a demonstration earlier and burnt copies of the letter written by the Chief Secretary to the State Election Commission (SEC) requesting the latter to hold the local body elections. BJP State General Secretary G. Bhanuprakash Reddy wondered why the government was more concerned about elections rather than public health. “Political heads and officials swear on the Constitution to stand by the people, but in this case, they appear to be more inclined towards bagging seats,” he said.

Tirupati: ‘a high-risk area’

Demanding declaring a ‘health emergency’ in the State, former MP Chinta Mohan said the Tirupati Parliamentary constituency faced ‘high risk’ vis-a-vis COVID-19 threat, in view of the presence of Tirumala Hills, Sri City Industrial City and Krishnapatnam Port. He blamed the unrestricted entry of devotees to Tirupati, flow of manpower and material between Sri City and the worst-hit Asian countries and import/export of goods at Krishnapatnam Port for the same.

“Looking beyond a cursory request to devotees, the TTD should ban entry of outsiders into Tirupati for at least a fortnight,” Dr. Mohan told the media, adding that the health of local residents had been compromised. He also suggested that the Kanchi Mutt’s unused medical college building near Renigunta Airport be used as an isolation ward, instead of SVIMS and Ruia Hospital, so as to prevent its spread to denizens.

Meanwhile, Jana Sena State coordinator Pasupuleti Hariprasad accused the Chief Minister of not only neglecting people’s health, but also for naively suggesting paracetamol. Calling it a ‘crude joke’ on the people, he wondered if the State would ever wake up to the reality.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/parties-fume-over-govt-insouciance/article31082362.ece

Andhra Pradesh Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan on Monday summoned State Election Commissioner (SEC) N. Ramesh Kumar and enquired the reasons for putting on hold the local body elections for about 45 days.

The Election Commissioner on Sunday announced the postponement of MPTC, ZPTC, Municipalties and Gram Panchayat elections due to outbreak of Coronavirus in many countries, which spread to a few States in India.

Cites Centre’s declaration

Mr. Ramesh Kumar explained that the Centre has declared the epidemic as a disaster and advised prevention of large gatherings to avoid the spread of COVID-19.

Mr. Harichandan, who met Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy at Raj Bhavan yesterday and discussed developments, spoke on the measures being taken by the government to prevent the spread of the virus, and the law and order situation in the State.

Minister for Irrigation Anil Kumar Yadav has termed the decision of the State Election Commission (SEC) to defer the local body elections as unilateral, and said the decision was taken to benefit a section of leaders unable to digest their imminent defeat in the polls.

To appease Naidu

Addressing media persons at the YSR Congress Party Central Office in Tadepalli, Mr. Yadav said: “The State Election Commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar has taken the decision to appease TDP president Nara Chandrababu Naidu.”

“If the SEC takes a decision basing on warnings from the Health Department over Coronavirus threat, we could face a situation wherein hundreds of people will return to India from foreign countries.

104,2020/03/16,A.P. Chief Secretary urges SEC to revoke orders on postponement of local body polls,"The COVID-19 situation was under control in the State and it would continue to be under control for another three to four weeks, she said

Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney wrote a letter to the State Election Commission (SEC) urging it to revoke its order of postponing the local body elections and adhere to the election schedule announced earlier.

The Chief Secretary’s letter comes in the wake of the SEC decision to postpone the elections in view of Covid-19.

Ms. Sawhney, in the letter dated Sunday, said the situation related to Covid-19 was under control in the State and it would continue to be under control for another three to four weeks. Further, considering that there is no local transmission, leave alone community transmission, there may be no threat of the outbreak in alarming proportion in the next three to four weeks.

Deprives 3rd tier government

“However, looking at the trend in other countries, in spite of all efforts, nothing can be predicted of the situation after four weeks from now. Thus any, postponement of elections would make the conduct of elections very uncertain depriving the State from having the availability of third tier of Government which is critical at this juncture,” she said.

Further, the CS said the State government would like to assure that it has been taking, and would continue to take all necessary steps for the containment of Covid-19. Concerns with regard to the election coming in the way of containing Covid-19 can be addressed by issuing suitable advisories with regard to election campaigning by the candidates, and congregation at the polling stations.

‘Could have consulted’

Moreover, she stated that public health was the responsibility of the State government, and therefore the SEC could have held prior consultation with the State. “This would have helped us to appraise the correct status of Covid-19 before coming to a conclusion regarding postponement of the elections,” she said.

It may be recalled that the SEC on Sunday had issued a notification deferring the polls by six weeks in view of the coronavirus threat. State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar said after six weeks, or after the threat of coronavirus recedes, the election process will continue with changes wherever necessary. As regard to Panchayat elections, a fresh notification will be issued once normalcy is restored.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ap-cs-urges-sec-to-revoke-order/article31080795.ece

TikTok, a video-sharing social networking service, is now a household name, thanks to its popularity among the youngsters. People of all age groups use it to convey their messages in a funny way.

However, its misuse has become a cause for concern, say representatives of women organisations. Against this backdrop, two girls — Esha Manohari Priya and Sai Chandini — who have more than 10 lakh followers have urged TikTok users to showcase their talent for the benefit of society. They joined hands with ‘We are for you’ — a charitable organisation run by some college students of Vizianagaram.

They have been participating in flash mob and other fun activities to raise funds for the needy such as poor patients suffering from cancer, kidney and other dreaded diseases and EBC students pursuing higher studies. “One can feel real happiness when someone is getting benefited by our service. That is why, we are associating with charitable organisations run by students,” says Sai Chandini who is pursuing beautician course. She hails from Vizianagaram and advises students to be active on social media platforms only when during their leisure period.

Former chairman of Nagari Municipality and YSRCP leader K.J. Kumar, along with his followers, on Sunday created a flutter by barging into the chamber of the election officer (for Nagari Municipality) at Nagari and finding fault with him for accepting the B-forms from candidates seeking to contest for the post of councillor.

As per information, Mr. Kumar and his followers barged into the election officer’s chamber in the morning, much before the State Election Commission announced the postponement of elections to the local bodies.

Mr. Kumar was said to have questioned the officer as to how he accepted the B-form from another YSRCP candidate when he had already submitted his nomination papers from the ward concerned.

A video footage of the incident that went viral on social media platforms allegedly showed Mr. Kumar and his followers moving menacingly towards the officer and using abusive language against him.

“As per the guidelines, the issue will be viewed seriously. Based on the complaint from the election officer, a case will be booked against the accused,” said Nagari CI. Party cadres observed that it was becoming difficult for Mr. Kumar to have his say after R.K.

Members of the State and Krishna district chapters of Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) and AP wing of the National Neonatology Forum (NNF) on Sunday said cases from China suggested that children could contract the coronavirus as much as an adult or the elderly but they experience milder or no symptoms. The need, therefore, was to safeguard them in schools and at homes, they said, addressing a press conference.

Citing UNICEF and WHO guidelines to protect children, they said children should be provided with information about how to protect themselves, steps should be taken to promote hand-washing and other hygiene practices, clean and disinfect school buildings, especially water and sanitation facilities, and increase airflow and ventilation in classrooms.

They also urged parents and teachers to monitor children’s health and keep them home if they were ill, encourage children to ask questions and express their concerns and cough or sneeze into a tissue and avoid touching their face, eyes, mouth and nose.

They said in Andhra Pradesh, the government had set up screening centre at SVIMS in Tirupati and planned to open two more at Vijayawada and Kakinada. Isolation and quarantine places were opened in Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam and Tirupati.

TDP leader and former MLA Kotla Sujathamma came down heavily on the ruling YSR Congress Party and district administration, alleging that the rules are being flouted and that YSRCP is “destroying” democracy.

Addressing reporters at the local TDP office here on Sunday, Ms. Sujathamma said that many opposition party’s MPTC candidates were forced to withdraw their nominations. “Candidates were threatened with dire consequences if they did not withdraw,” she said.

Alleging that the police showed complacency in the matter, she said: “A few sub-inspectors have threatened opposition party candidates.” Ms. Sujathamma later alleged that the district authorities are also flouting the rules. She added that the authorities refused to meet her when she wanted to raise concerns. She said she was told that the authorities were in a meeting.

Former Panyam MLA Gowru Charitha Reddy also seconded Ms. Sujathamma’s claims. “If the YSRCP had a good reputation, why are they resorting to threats?” she questioned. Ms. Charitha Redddy demanded that the election process happen democratically.

Speaking after them, district TDP president Somisetty Venkateswarlu said that Chief Minister Y.S.

111,2020/03/16,"Local body elections put on hold, not cancelled: SEC","‘Attributing motives to the acts of the election commission regrettable’

In an oblique reference to the reservations expressed by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on the postponement of elections to the local bodies, State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar clarified through a press note on Sunday that violence was a matter that engaged the commission and that various political parties had highlighted several incidents.

Violence was also a subject matter in an ongoing litigation before the High Court, in which the commission was a respondent, he pointed out.

As far as the restriction imposed by the commission on the distribution of house-site pattas, Mr. Ramesh Kumar said it was covered by the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) that would be in force during every election.

Mr. Ramesh Kumar observed that the present elections were merely put on hold and not cancelled. As the elections were likely to restart in six weeks, or earlier, if the coronavirus threat was de-escalated, a correct view was taken that the MCC would be in force.

Health advisory

Mr. Kumar further said that the Government of India had issued a health advisory to the States to avoid large public gatherings some time ago and, on March 14, it classified coronavirus as a disaster and kept the nation in a state of preparedness.

The commission contacted the national-level functionaries before deciding on the threat posed by coronavirus.

If the aforesaid warning was de-escalated, the commission would resume the election process without the loss of a single day.

Finally, Mr. Ramesh Kumar regretted that motives were attributed to the acts of the commission, which was a constitutional body, and the Commissioner, who was at par with a judge of the High Court.

He stated that all the safeguards available to the judge of the High Court were applicable to the Commissioner, and casting aspersions on the institution would weaken it.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/local-body-elections-put-on-hold-not-cancelled-sec/article31077251.ece
112,2020/03/16,YSRCP sitting pretty with many seats declared unanimous,"None can stop our march to power, says Energy Minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy

The ruling YSR Congress Party is all set to sweep the local body elections in Prakasam district going by the trend in the ZPTC and MPTC seats declared unanimous.

Buchepalli Venkaiamma, the YSRCP nominee for the Zilla Parishad Chairperson post won unanimously and 12 other Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies(ZPTCs) in the district with 56 ZPTC seats.

As many as 350 of the 742 Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituency(MPTC) seats were decided unanimously making it comfortable for YSRCP coming to power in 15 MPPs.

Meanwhile, Energy Minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy calming the partymen upset with the postponement of the local body elections by the State Election Commission(SEC), said: “People’s health is more important. None can stop the YSRCP’s ascendancy to power in the Zilla and Mandal parishads.”

More defections from the opposition TDP are in the offing, he said after Sidda Hanumantha Rao, brother of former TDP Minister Sidda Raghava Rao joined the party here along with his followers on Sunday.

Leaders cutting across party lines were eager to join the ruling party impressed with the “pro-people” policies of the Jagan Mohan Government, he opined, adding that it would be better if former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu realised this and retired from politics.

Meanwhile, TDP Prakasam district President Damacharla Janardhana Rao demanded conduct of the local body elections by the Election Commission of India in a free and fair manner starting the filing of nomination process afresh.

Kurnool

Candidates of the YSR Congress party were elected unanimously in 15 of the 53 ZPTC seats in the district. Apart from that, they have also swept nine mandals, in both ZPTC and MPTC seats.

According to data released by district authorities, Banaganipalle, Gospadu, Koilkuntla, Chippagiri, Sanjamala, Bethamcherla, Kosigi, Manthralayam, Owk, Kolimigundla, Uyyalawada, Bandi Atmakur, Holagunda, Peaupuly and Krishnagiri were swept by the ruling party.

The places where candidates secured both ZPTC and MPTC seats were: Bethamcherla, Peapully, Uyyalawda, Banaganapalli, Koilkuntla, Kolimigundla, Sanjamala, Kosigi and Chippagiri.

Speaking with The Hindu, Kurnool Parliament Constituency in-charge B.Y. Ramaiah said that about 244 MPTCs have been won across the district unanimously.

Allegations

While the TDP leaders allege that their candidates were threatened or wooed by the ruling party members, Mr. Ramaiah completely brushed off their allegations. “YSRCP is not a party that threatens people. We have never tried to woo anyone. It is TDP’s policy to threaten and woo people,” he said.

“Did we ask MLC K.E. Prabhakar to resign from TDP? Why are the TDP leaders now lining up to join YSRCP?” he questioned.

Explaining the unanimous victory, Mr. Ramaiah claimed that the TDP leaders are not in a position to ask for votes from the people. “They have not done anything productive,” he said.

He added that the TDP leaders are unable to give their nominations because they knew that the YSRCP would win the local body elections.

Tirupati

In Tirupati too, the ruling YSR Congress Party seems to be resolute in continuing its winning streak, going by the number of local body seats it has won unanimously.

Chandragiri Assembly Constituency, represented by government whip and TUDA Chairman Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy, seems to have achieved a rare distinction where 86 out of the 95 seats have been unanimously won by the YSR Congress, giving 95% majority to the ruling party.

Only one ZPTC and five MPTC seats are going for elections in the constituency. The ‘unanimous spree’ also saw the debut of Mr. Bhaskar Reddy’s son Ch. Mohith Reddy into direct politics, as he was declared elected as MPTC member of Perumallapalle-1 seat in Tirupati rural mandal.

Similarly, Thamballapalle Constituency saw all the 72 MPTC and six ZPTC seats going unanimously into YSRC’s kitty. In Punganur, represented by party strongman and Panchayat Raj Minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy, the ruling party won 65 out of 69 MPTC seats and all the six ZPTCs without contest.

The YSRC won all but one in Srikalahasti segment having 64 MPTC and all four ZPTC seats.

The party, however, claimed that all the seats were won through consensus and sans violence, coercion or allurement. The ‘understanding’ also left the TDP with a handful of seats in many mandals, though it was not happy at the final result.

Anantapur

All the 63 ZPTC seats in Anantapur district will go to polls as and when the dates are finalised.

None of theZPTC aspirant was elected unanimously unlike 41 MPTC members who have been elected unopposed out of 841.

113,2020/03/16,YSRCP will challenge SEC order in Supreme Court: Vijaya Sai,"‘Reasons cited to put off polls are unfounded and based on presumptions’

The YSRCP will challenge in the Supreme Court the State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar’s order postponing the local body elections by six weeks citing the threat posed by coronavirus, according to party national general secretary and Rajya Sabha member V. Vijaya Sai Reddy.

Addressing the media here on Sunday along with district in-charge and Agriculture Minister K. Kannababu, Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao and others, Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy accused Mr. Ramesh Kumar of taking a unilateral decision without consulting the Chief Secretary, the Health Secretary and other officials on the prevailing health situation in the State.

Mr. Reddy alleged that Mr. Ramesh Kumar, appointed as SEC during the TDP rule, was dancing to the tune of its president N. Chandrababu Naidu. He said that the reasons cited by Mr. Kumar for the “extraordinary decision” were “unfounded and based on presumptions and assumptions.”

“On moral grounds, Mr. Kumar should step down for murdering democracy,” Mr. Reddy demanded.

‘Situation not alarming’

Only one person who had visited Italy and contracted the disease there was undergoing treatment in an isolation ward in Nellore. The situation was not at all alarming as the SEC and the TDP were trying to portray, he said.

Anticipating a severe drubbing, the TDP had been crying foul since the beginning, he said, and reiterated the charge that the SEC decision was aimed at saving the “sinking boat” of the TDP.

Dig at Kanna

Mr. Reddy termed BJP State president Kanna Lakshminarayana, who sought postponement of the elections due to spread of coronavirus, as an “agent of Mr. Naidu.”

Mr. Kannababu and Mr. Srinivasa Rao contested the basis on which the SEC took the decision to put off the elections by six weeks, and alleged that there could be a conspiracy to deprive the State the allotment of over ₹5,000 crore by the Finance Commission.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/yo2vxc/article31077221.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16VJPG4-SAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ysrcp-will-challenge-sec-order-in-supreme-court-vijaya-sai/article31077222.ece
114,2020/03/16,Model code remains in force: SEC,"‘Commission has taken serious note of intimidation of and physical attacks on candidates’

While asserting that the State Election Commission (SEC) has postponed the local body elections under exceptional circumstances, its Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar said on Sunday that the Model Conduct of Conduct (MCC) would continue to be in force during the period and the process that had happened so far remained intact.

The situation would be reviewed after six weeks, and then the schedule of the elections to the village panchayats would be released.

Transfer of officials

The commission recommended the transfer of the Collectors of Guntur and Chittoor districts; the Superintendents of Police of Guntur Rural and Tirupati Urban; the DSPs of Palamaner and Srikalahasti; and the CIs of Punganur, Rayadurgam and Tadipatri, besides the suspension of Macherla CI.

Addressing the media here, Mr. Ramesh Kumar said the commission had taken a serious view of the “intimidation” of and “physical attacks” on the candidates during the filing of nominations for the elections to teh ZPTCs and MPTCs, and the “inaction” of the polling officers and staff.

‘Cannot ignore virus threat’

Mr. Ramesh Kumar said the opinion of all the stakeholders about the prevalence of COVID-19 was taken into account after a detailed assessment was made at the highest level. Though the elections were important, the threat of coronavirus could not be overlooked, he said.

The arrangements were by-and-large completed, but SEC did not have any option but to put the elections on hold because of the virus scare, in exercise of its discretionary powers conferred on it by the Constitution and the Panchayat Raj Act, he added.

The Commissioner further said that the “unanimous candidates” would be considered elected, and the notifications for the ZPTCs and the urban local bodies, which had already been issued, would be revised.

“The commission has the responsibility to ensure free and transparent elections, and it will take necessary action,” he stated, adding that a large number of complaints were being lodged about the conduct of the village volunteers and they needed to be controlled by the government officers concerned.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/model-code-remains-in-force-sec/article31077201.ece
115,2020/03/16,Ramesh Kumar was not the choice of TDP govt.: Naidu,"‘Jagan seems to be more interested in polls than people’s safety’

TDP national president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Sunday took objection to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s comments on State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar.

Addressing the media at the party office in Guntur on Sunday, Mr. Naidu refuted the Chief Minister’s charge that Mr. Ramesh Kumar was his choice.

The TDP government had recommended the name of C.R. Biswa to the post of the SEC. The then Governor, E.S.L. Narasimhan, however, had recommended the name of Mr. Ramesh Kumar to the post. Hence, he was appointed.

“For his political interests, the Chief Minister is attributing the appointment to me,” Mr. Naidu said.

“Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy has spoken in an irresponsible manner and exhibited his ignorance before the media. How can the Chief Minister intimidate the Election Commission? Who gave him absolute powers? The Election Commission is an independent institution. The election code is applicable to all the political parties,” Mr. Naidu said.

More than one lakh people contracted coronavirus globally and more than 5,000 people died, he said.

“Except for pharma companies, everything has been shut down in China and Italy. While this is the threat perception, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy seems to have no concern for people’s safety,” Mr. Naidu said.

“The Chief Minister has no right to play with the lives of people. Are elections more important than people’s lives? Hospitals will not be sufficient if coronavirus spreads in the country,” he said.

“Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy feels that he will be Chief Minister forever. People will show him his place if he resorts to such politics,” Mr. Naidu added.

Referring to the violence in the conduct of the local body elections, he said the police foisted cases against the Opposition leaders. The police were unfit to perform election duty. Paramilitary forces should be deployed while conducting the elections, he observed.

Reacting to Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s comments that the Finance Commission would not release the funds if the local body elections were not held by March 31, Mr. Naidu said, “We will write a letter to the Central government, requesting it to take steps to release the funds.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ramesh-kumar-was-not-the-choice-of-tdp-govt-naidu/article31077183.ece
116,2020/03/16,Groundbreaking ceremony for temple in Chennai on April 9,"TTD chief urges T.N. CM to hand over the identified land

Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has invited Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswamy for the groundbreaking ceremony ahead of the construction of Sri Padmavathi temple in Chennai on April 9.

TTD Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy and Executive Officer Anil Kumar Singhal called on Mr. Palaniswamy at his Chennai office and extended formal invitation for the ceremonial event.

Ulundurpet too

The TTD had requested and identified 11 acres of land on the Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) and East Coast Road (ECR) area for developing Sri Venkateswara Divya Kshetram, Kalyana Mandapam and an Information Centre. Mr. Reddy asked the Chief Minister to hand over the land to the TTD at the earliest for commencing the construction of the temple.

In Ulundurpet town, local MLA and TTD board member Kumara Guru offered land to the TTD for Sri Venkateswara temple, while local devotees agreed to donate ₹10 crore towards its construction.

In this regard, Mr. Subba Reddy said the Srivari temple project at Ulundurpet would be decided after discussing with the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister.

The Chintoor police on Sunday arrested three persons in connection with the kidnap and murder of a 40-year-old Koya tribal man on March 12. A dispute over the distribution of four acres of ancestral property is suspected to be the cause.

Sode Muttaiah, accompanied by his two relatives, had reportedly kidnapped and axed his brother Sode Nagi Reddi to death on the night of March 11 while he was sleeping outside his house on a cot at Tummala village under Chintoor police station limits in East Godavari district.

They also reportedly buried the body and the dismantled cot to hush up the crime.

Chintoor DSP S. Khadar Basha said, “The accused have been identified as S. Muttaiah, victim’s brother, Kannayya and another local man. Acase has been registered and investigation is on.” The family members of the victim lodged a complaint that he had been missing since the night of March 11.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/brother-two-others-held-for-murder-of-tribal-man/article31077156.ece
118,2020/03/16,Number of persons under observation rises,"Russian national referred by hospital at Puttaparthi among them

The number of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients currently under observation at homes and hospitals across the State increased slightly on Sunday as more foreign returnees were identified.

As per the latest Health Department’s bulletin, 562 persons, including 534 at homes, with no symptoms and 28 at hospitals with symptoms were under observation.

The authorities had sent nine more samples for tests on Sunday and eight of them turned negative to COVID-19. The result of one was awaited. The results of 13 more samples were awaited.

The government had invoked Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, empowering the district Collectors and DMHOs to order containment of any area when required.

The Government General Hospital (Siddhartha Medical College) laboratory equipped with Real-Time Pulmonary Reaction (RTPR) machine was commissioned for preliminary testing of samples.

In Nellore, the number of persons in the isolation ward rose to four with the admission of a youth with symptoms to the GGH, Collector V. Vinod Kumar said. “We have taken all precautions to contain the spread of the disease, including house quarantine of 252 persons with foreign travel history so far,” he said.

In Prakasam, 178 foreign returnees were put under house quarantine so far. “We are fully geared to check spread of the disease,” said Collector P. Bhaskar.

In Chittoor, the administration of Sri Varasiddi Vinayaka Swami Devasthanam at Kanipakkam appealed to the devotees to avoid bringing children and elderly persons.

In Anantapur, a Russian national who visited Puttaparthi was put under observation in the GGH. He was sent from the Sri Sathya Sai Super Speciality Hospital at Puttaparthi after he developed cold and cough on his arrival.

“The Russian national has mild symptoms, but not strong enough to doubt that he has contracted COVID-19. His samples have been sent to the SVIMS in Tirupati,” said GGH RMO R. Lalitha.

A person from Anantapur, who came to the hospital on Friday on his own, was also under observation.

Officials received information about 27 foreign returnees who belong to Anantapur as per their passports.

“The whereabouts of the returnees are not known now as some of the addresses are old, or they have shifted to other cities,” DMHO K.V.N.S Anil Kumar told The Hindu.

Helpline

Officials asked people to adhere to the cough etiquette and frequently wash their hands with soap and water.

People can dial helpline ‘0866 2410978’ and the foreign returnees can dial ‘104’ for health advisory and ‘108’ if they have symptoms and need to be admitted to hospital.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/number-of-persons-under-observation-rises/article31077111.ece
119,2020/03/16,BEE seeks APERC support to implement ISO standards in industries,"Move to improve energy performance, reduce wasteful consumption

Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) Secretary R.K. Rai met A.P. Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) Chairman Justice C.V. Nagarjuna Reddy and sought his support for effective implementation of ISO standards and other energy efficiency programmes in the State.

Mr. Nagarjuna Reddy promised to extend full support for the implementation of ISO 50001:2018 energy management standards in industries to enable them to improve energy performance, reduce wasteful energy consumption and achieve sustainable development.

According to an official release, Mr. Rai said the BEE would provide an international framework for industrial plants for good energy management and prioritise new energy efficient technologies.

Highest consumption

He pointed out that industries were the highest energy consuming sector accounting for 40% of the total consumption in the country. The energy consumption was expected to reach 443.40 Million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) by 2031 against the present 347 Mtoe.

To reduce consumption to the extent possible, ISO 50001:2018 norms were sought to be implemented initially in industrial units identified under PAT (Perform, Achieve and Trade) scheme, Mr. Rai told the APERC Chairman.

The BEE set a target of cumulative energy savings of 165 Mtoe (worth around ₹1.80 lakh crore) by implementing energy efficiency in industrial sector through PAT Scheme in the country by 2030. In its first cycle, the PAT scheme realised energy savings of 8.67 Mtoe, exceeding the target of 6.686 Mtoe by over 30%.

Justice Nagarjuna Reddy told Mr. Rai that he gave instructions to power utilities to strictly implement energy efficiency measures and actively promote energy efficiency programmes with the support and coordination of A.P. State Energy Conservation Mission (APSECM).",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bee-seeks-aperc-support-to-implement-iso-standards-in-industries/article31077054.ece
120,2020/03/16,"Govt. was kept in the dark, says Chief Minister","Election commissioner’s action smacks of bias, he alleges

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has reacted sharply to the decision of the State Election Commission to postpone the elections to the local bodies citing the threat posed by coronavirus.

Coming down heavily on State Election Commissioner (SEC) Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar, the Chief Minister told the media at his camp office at Tadepalli near here on Sunday that “he (the SEC) lost his discernment and is reading out the orders written by someone else.”

“We did not appoint the State Election Commissioner. Chandrababu Naidu (TDP president and former Chief Minister ) appointed a person belonging to his community,” Mr. Jagan said.

“Under the pretext of coronavirus, he has indefinitely postponed the local body elections,” he fumed.

“The SEC had neither discussed the matter with the Chief Secretary nor the officials of the Health Department. Impartiality should be the primary characteristic of the SEC. The commission should discharge its duties beyond caste, region, religion and political parties. Only then it can save its reputation and respect,” he observed.

“Mr. Naidu may have bestowed upon him the post. Both may belong to the same community, but is it justified to show such discrimination?” the Chief Minister questioned.

Pat for police

On the one hand, Mr. Kumar, citing discretionary powers, postponed the elections indefinitely and on the other transferred the district Collectors and SPs of Guntur and Chittoor. He also transferred the Macherla CI, the Chief Minister said.

“How can he transfer the Collectors and SPs unilaterally? Does he have more powers than an elected government? If so, the SEC can rule the State. The police have discharged their duties with utmost sincerity. They have even booked attempt-to-murder cases. We have brought the SEC issue to the notice of the Governor. The matter will be scaled up to the next level if the State Election Commissioner does not mend his ways,” Mr. Jagan said.

The 14th Finance Commission would not release about ₹5,000 crore unless the elections were held before March 31, he said.

Earlier, the Chief Minister met the Governor and complained of what he called an irrational move to postpone the elections and said the government would explore all avenues for justice. He alleged that the SEC did not take the government into confidence while taking the decision.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vzlvcd/article31076994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16VJPAGE1JAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/govt-was-kept-in-the-dark-says-chief-minister/article31076995.ece
121,2020/03/16,Coronavirus | Andhra Pradesh local body polls postponed by 6 weeks,"The State Election Commission (SEC) has deferred the local body elections by six weeks due to the threat of COVID-19 and decided to continue the process from where it stopped in respect of ZPTCs and MPTCs and urban local bodies after six weeks or after the COVID threat recedes whichever is earlier.

The conduct of elections in two phases for the village panchayats for which notifications were scheduled to be issued on March 15 and 17 has been kept in abeyance, the SEC stated in its notification.

Announcing this at a press conference here on Sunday, State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar said the political parties had requested him at a meeting held on March 6 to postpone the elections due to the outbreak of coronavirus in several parts of the country and public gatherings taking place across the towns and villages for elections.

The commission had taken inputs from senior health functionaries, who indicated that health safeguards needed to be put in place immediately to avoid large public gatherings in order to contain the possible spread of coronavirus.

Mr. Ramesh Kumar said the Central government has declared its outbreak as a notified disaster prompting necessary measures by the States.

Movement of voters

He also observed that there was a likelihood of the movement of a large number of voters from Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Odisha, which could aggravate the situation.

Citing a Supreme Court judgment, Mr. Ramesh Kumar said the elections could be postponed for genuine supervening difficulties and exceptional circumstances such as natural disasters or man-made calamities such as rioting or (L&O) breakdown, till normalcy was restored.

He said the decision to put the elections on hold has been taken in view of the challenge posed by COVID-19. Several northern States took steps against large congregations in public schools and Telangana and Karnataka also took containment measures.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/3qwg9n/article31076932.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16VJPAGE1SEC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sec-postpones-local-body-elections-by-six-weeks/article31076933.ece
122,2020/03/16,No need to press panic button on coronavirus: CM,"Preventive steps being taken, labs, hospitals readied, says Jagan

Allaying the fears over COVID-19, Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has said that the State government has been taking all preventive measures to deal with the coronavirus.

Addressing mediapersons after the postponement of local body polls at his camp office near here on Sunday, Mr. Jagan said that the government was taking measures to prevent it, like any other disease. Two labs had been set up for testing, in Tirupati and Vijayawada, and another would come up in Kakinada. A 200-bedded hospital at Visakhapatnam, a 100-bedded hospital at the Eastern Naval Command and isolation wards were kept ready as part of preparedness plans. It was going to be a continuous process, he said.

Deportees

Very soon, people of Andhra Pradesh living in other countries, particularly Middle East, might be deported as those countries might not be willing to provide healthcare for them. In such cases, the government would carry out the necessary procedures like screening at airports, and home quarantine for people returning from coronavirus-affected countries.

There would be regular monitoring, and care would be provided for those who showed symptoms. In cases where it was required, they would be moved to isolation wards. Currently, facilities to isolate persons returning from abroad were available only in Visakhapatnam. Quarantine facilities were less in Vijayawada but the number of persons returning from abroad to the place were also less, he said.

Risk groups

The disease mainly affected people above 60 years and those suffering from kidney and liver problems, diabetes, hypertension etc. The mortality rate around the world had been very low. Experience across the globe showed that only 4.7% of the cases turned critical while 80.9% of corona-positive cases were cured with mere home isolation. “There is no need to press the panic button. The coronavirus can be treated with paracetamol,” he said.

Out of 70 samples sent from Andhra Pradesh, there was only one positive case. The government had conducted a door-to-door survey within 1 km radius of the house in Nellore where the positive case was reported. More than 20,000 houses were covered. The volunteers were visiting every house to create awareness among the public, he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/no-need-to-press-panic-button-on-coronavirus-cm/article31076924.ece
123,2020/03/16,Coronavirus scare set to take a toll on tourist footfalls in city,"Travel operators say that holiday-makers are mulling to cancel their visit

Popular tourist destinations in the city are likely to wear a deserted look with holiday-goers having a change of mind due to the coronavirus scare.

Though no cases have been detected yet in Visakhapatnam region, tourists from other States are said to be wary of travelling to other parts of the country with the COVID-19 pandemic showing no signs of subsiding.

Thousands of tourists from neighbouring districts and States visit the city every summer to spend time on the beaches and in Araku Valley. However, many tour operators in the city fear that the situation might be different this year.

“Tourists have been in contact with us about the situation here. Though we have informed them that it is safe here, they are reluctant to come. Some feel that travelling on trains and flights is unsafe during this time,” said L Ramu, a tour operator from the city.

Sunit Kumar Panja, a tour operator from the city, said that many tourists who had booked their rooms a couple of months ago are now reluctant to visit the city following the COVID-19 outbreak in other parts of the country.

“Many tourists from West Bengal are mulling to cancel their holidays here. As schools and public places have been shut down in Kolkata, they are worried that a similar situation is prevailing here too. We told them that there is no need for undue panic but they are planning to opt out,” he said.

In 2019, 2.73 crore domestic tourists visited Visakhapatnam, as against 1.97 crore the previous year. Officials said that the summer season sees more tourists coming to the city from various parts of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana compared to those from Odisha or West Bengal.

Demand dips for AC buses

The APSRTC Visakhapatnam Region has been witnessing a decline in demand for AC buses ever since COVID-19 cases surfaced in Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

According to APSRTC Regional Manager M.Y. Danam, the occupancy ratio for AC buses plying from Visakhapatnam to Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru has declined by 25%.

“Many fear that the virus can spread more rapidly in cold conditions, which might be why they are opting for non-AC buses instead of AC buses,” he said. “We have seen a reduction in footfalls on the Hyderabad route,” he said.

APTDC takes precautions

The Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) is chalking out plans to deal with the potential drop in tourist footfalls in the coming months.

According to officials, awareness campaigns are being organised for tourists at APTDC hotels. Staff have been informing tourists about the measures to be taken while travelling. Meanwhile, posters have been displayed at hotels and resorts belonging to APTDC.

“As of now, we do not see COVID-19 having much of an impact on domestic tourism. We have started receiving bookings for hotel rooms and other trips from the tourists for May. However, we are organising awareness camps as a precautionary measure and also for the well-being of our tourists,” said APTDC Divisional Manager, Visakhapatnam, T.G. Prasad Reddy.

Mr. Reddy said that the staff have been instructed to conduct cleaning, spraying in hotel rooms, pools, boating facilities and at other places. He also said that the staff have been told to inform the medical teams/health department officials immediately if they come across any guests with COVID-19 symptoms like cold, cough, fever and respiratory problems.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/p8dicx/article31076917.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16-VZ-TOURISTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/coronavirus-scare-set-to-take-a-toll-on-tourist-footfalls-in-city/article31076918.ece
124,2020/03/16,"‘Kanna, Pawan making land grab charges for political gain’","Voters will teach them a fitting lesson, says YSRCP spokesman Gudivada Amarnath

Anakapalle MLA and YSRCP official spokesperson Gudivada Amarnath on Sunday accused the BJP and JSP of indulging in mudslinging against the State government.

Dismissing allegations levelled by BJP State president Kanna Lakshminarayana that some YSRCP activists were trying to grab his land in Visakhapatnam, Mr. Amarnath told a press conference here on Sunday that the BJP leader was trying to show the Jagan Mohan Reddy government in a poor light.

“Mr. Lakshminarayana claimed that some persons were trying to grab his land, but that they later went back after coming to know that the land belonged to him. He had also claimed that attempts were being made to grab land owned by the BJP office in the city. Being a former Minister, the BJP leader should know that any responsible citizen should first lodge a complaint with the local police,” the YSRCP spokesman said.

The YSRCP spokesman said that the BJP State president’s statements are a clear indication of his plans to join the TDP.

Mr. Amarnath alleged that first the TDP, and now the JSP and BJP, are trying to stall the growth of Visakhapatnam by making baseless allegations of land-grabbing against the ruling party. “The people of Visakhapatnam are closely watching the opposition parties and will teach them a befitting lesson in the elections,” Mr. Amarnath said.

Referring to allegations made by the JSP chief Pawan Kalyan, Mr. Amarnath said that the voters knew enough to not vote for the ‘criminals’ in the 2019 elections. “Mr. Pawan Kalyan must have realised by now the reason for his defeat from both the places that he contested from. It was because the people had realised that he was hand in glove with the TDP,” he said.

The YSRCP leader also found fault with Mr. Pawan for describing voters as cowards for not voting him to power. He said that the JSP president had no courage to fight the elections on his own and was therefore allying with one party or the other.

Replying to queries, Mr. Amarnath dismissed the violence during filing of nominations as ‘stray’ incidents and said that during the TDP rule in the past, even murders had taken place. He felt that there was no need to postpone the local body elections.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/kanna-pawan-making-land-grab-charges-for-political-gain/article31076912.ece
125,2020/03/16,Regular eye screening can prevent glaucoma,"Glaucoma is a disease that damages the optic nerve that connects the eye to the brain, usually due to high eye pressure. It normally happens when fluid builds up in the front part of the eye. The extra fluid increases the pressure in the eye, damaging the optic nerve.

While the major causes of blindness, i.e., refractive errors and cataract, are reversible and being dealt with on a war footing, the second major cause of blindness, glaucoma, affects the visual faculties in an irreversible manner.

“Periodic screening is advisable for those who are above 40 years of age. High risk groups such as diabetics and those with a family history of glaucoma must do it to prevent further eye damage,” said Dr. T. Raveendra, head of Glaucoma and Anterior Segment of Sankar Foundation Eye Hospital.

Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) is a common variant, which does not show any symptoms like eye pain and sudden visual disturbance. Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG), though less common, shows symptoms like eye pain, redness, vomiting and sudden visual disturbance. The World Glaucoma Week, being observed by the hospital from March 8, is aimed at bridging the gap between science and society through the much-needed awareness programmes.

Glaucoma is asymptomatic until it gets to an advanced stage and severity, and hence invisible to patients as a disease or even a symptom. Due to its asymptomatic nature, it is known by the slogan: ‘Stealthy thief of vision’.

Glaucoma may be invisible to caregivers too as a readily discernable disease, calling for highly disciplined, focused and cost-intensive approach of case finding as a strategy of prevention of the disease and disability.

Dr. Raveendra underlined the need for conducting massive awareness campaigns on the lines of pulse polio immunisation to impress upon people the need for regular eye testing after 40 years of age and to use drugs prescribed by ophthalmologists for the rest of their lives.

The basic tests include: eye pressure check up, optic nerve examination and gonioscopy. The advanced tests include: visual field analysis, optical coherence, tomography and pachymetry.

The hospital has been performing surgeries for more than 500 glaucoma patients every year, while taking care of several thousand with medications alone. It has conducted training programs for doctors in the field of Glaucoma. The magnitude of the problem calls for concerted efforts from all sections of society in spreading awareness about the disease and helping the poor and needy with funding support for medicines and surgeries, he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/regular-eye-screening-can-prevent-glaucoma/article31076907.ece
126,2020/03/16,"State Election Commissioner acted unilaterally, says Botcha","Decision taken only to keep the TDP chief in good humour, alleges Minister

Municipal Administration Minister Botcha Satyanarayana on Sunday alleged that State Election Commissioner Nimagadda Ramesh Kumar had paid his ‘guru dakshina’ to TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu by indefinitely postponing the local body elections without consulting the State Government.

“Without any documentary evidence on the magnitude of the situation arising out of the coronavirus scare, Mr. Ramesh Kumar unilaterally took a decision to postpone the elections by six weeks just to keep Mr. Naidu, who appointed him in 2016 as SEC, in good humour,” Mr. Satyanarayana alleged.

The Minister also recalled how Mr. Naidu had put pressure on State Legislative Council Chairman Shariff Mohammed Ahmed to use his discretionary powers and refer the State Decentralisation Bill to a Select Committee to delay the formation of the three capitals. “Today, the order to put off the local body elections was also another attempt to derail welfare activities in the State,” Mr. Satyanarayana said.

The Minister wondered how the Central Election Commission allowed distribution of money under the ‘Pasupu Kumkuma’ scheme introduced by Mr. Naidu just before the 2019 general elections, and how the SEC had now passed orders to not distribute house-site pattas to the poor on Ugadi as announced earlier by the State Government.

The Minister said people had lost faith in Mr. Naidu due to his negative approach and alleged that he was not in favour developing the State. “Mr. Naidu is interested solely in his family and his party,” Mr. Satyanarayana remarked.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/state-election-commissioner-acted-unilaterally-says-botcha/article31076904.ece
127,2020/03/16,SCR takes steps to check spread of COVID-19,"Trains, railway premises being sanitised, announcements being made on dos and don’ts

Officials of the South Central Railway (SCR) have taken steps to prevent the spread of coronavirus and protect passengers and railway employees from the epidemic. Awareness programmes are being taken up at railway stations on maintaining hygiene on platforms and on moving trains.

Many passengers were cancelling their reserved tickets and there was a drop in the footfall in major railway stations in the zone, the railway authorities said.

Sanitation workers and the Medical and Health department staff of the SCR were seen cleaning the seating arms, door and window grills, railings on platforms, compartments and at the ticket issuing counters with sanitisers on Sunday.

“We cancelled all meetings, training programmes, conferences and workshops for one month as per the advisory of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the authorities of Indian Railways. Instructions have been issued to all station directors and masters in this regard,” said Vijayawada Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) P. Srinivas.

Isolation wards had been arranged at Vijayawada, Rajahmundry, Bitragunta, Gudur and other hospitals. Special teams would be provided in the stations for providing treatment to suspected patients. The railway hospital superintendents, medical officers and in-charges were instructed to be in touch with the district officials concerned, the DRM said.

Cancellations

Senior Divisional Commercial Manager (Sr. DCM) P. Bhaskar Reddy said cancellation of reserved tickets had gone up in many routes in the past few days.

“SCR is taking all preventive measures. Public announcements are being made in the stations on dos and don’ts, and we are maintaining temperatures in all AC coaches between 23° and 25° Celsius. We request passengers to use online ticket booking as a precautionary measure,” he said.

Training programmes were conducted for the staff in all railway hospitals and dispensaries to handle suspected coronavirus cases. Heads of all wings were directed not to hold any gatherings and conferences.

Surprise checks

Railway officials were making surprise visits to canteens, juice and fruit stalls and fast food centres on railway premises besides toilets and waiting halls and appealing to the establishment owners and passengers to maintain hygiene.

“We are supplying bedsheets and pillows as usual, but woollen blankets are being provided on demand only. Reserved passengers are being intimated through SMS accordingly. If passengers do not want to use the blankets and bedsheets being supplied by railway staff, they can make their own arrangements,” Mr. Bhaskar Reddy said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/scr-takes-steps-to-check-spread-of-covid-19/article31076895.ece
128,2020/03/16,"COVID-19 | 60 students, including Anand Singh’s daughter, stranded at Rome airport","The students from Karnataka have been stuck there since March 11

As Italy reels under COVID-19, parents in India are anxious about their children now stuck in Rome airport, unable to return without the mandatory blood tests. As many as 60 students from Karnataka, including the daughter of Forest Minister B.S. Anand Singh, studying in different colleges across Italy are now inside the airport unable to leave.

During a discussion on COVID-19 in the Legislative Council, Mr. Singh himself brought up the issue of students from Karnataka stuck at Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport in Rome. “We are all anxious. My daughter is among the 60 students from here stuck inside the airport since March 11. There is hardly any information coming in. The State government should get in touch with the Union government to help them to return home soon,” he said.

He said, many students, including his daughter, were deboarded from the flight just before take off.

“Unless blood samples collected from them by Indian doctors are tested in India and certified to be healthy, they cannot fly. Now, we are being informed that all flights out of Rome might be cancelled. By the time blood reports come in, there is a possibility of cancellation of flights from Rome,” he said.

According to Mr. Singh’s aide, his daughter Vaishnavi Singh, studying interior design in Florence in Central Italy, had reached Rome to return home. She along with others, however, were stopped from flying on March 11 unless their blood samples were tested in India. “Initially, the Indian community in Rome helped them with food. Now, the embassy is helping them. They are now sleeping on the benches or available space in the airport,” the aide said.

Janata Dal (Secular) member K.T. Srikante Gowda also urged the State to identify people from Karnataka stuck in various countries.

‘211 students are back’

Meanwhile, acknowledging the problem, Health Minister B. Sriramulu said that the State government has already enabled the return of 211 students from Italy.

“All are Kannadigas. These students used WhatsApp messages and calls to get in touch with me. We enabled them to take different airlines to return home. All of them are here now.” He further said that he was in touch with Union Health Minister Harshvardhan on this issue.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fv7bsk/article31085480.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/coronavirus-60-students-including-anand-singhs-daughter-stranded-at-rome-airport/article31085483.ece
129,2020/03/16,"COVID-19 | Precautionary measures taken by Karnataka ‘inadequate’, says Opposition","Sriramulu counters by saying ₹36 cr. has been spent to contain spread of virus

Amidst the Opposition slamming the State government for “inadequate” measures being put in place across the State to contain the spread of COVID-19, Health Minister B. Sriramulu on Monday said ₹36 crore has been spent to contain the spread of virus and the State was in the process of purchasing 10,000 thermal sensors.

Raising the issue in the Legislative Council, Leader of the Opposition S.R. Patil said that the State government has failed to take enough measures to check its spread. “Preventive measures have not been put in place. Every international passenger coming into the State from affected countries should have been isolated. It is unfortunate that Karnataka now has an ignominious record of reporting the first COVID-19 casualty in the country. This is a black spot on the Health Department,” he said.

Stating that district-level laboratories to test blood samples are yet to be established, he said that measures in districts, including keeping beds ready, are far from satisfactory. “While the government should instil confidence among the people, it should set aside a separate fund to fight the virus on the lines of the U.S. government. Isolate every passenger coming from the affected countries,” he said.

While Congress member Ivan D’Souza accused private hospitals of not doing enough and not cooperating with State government, another member N.S. Bose Raju said that border areas were completely being ignored. “No testing facility has been established. Patients have to depend on hospitals in Hyderabad,” Mr. Raju said.

Many members raised the issue of inadequate facilities in rural areas, and wanted to know the fate of religious festivals that would attract huge gatherings. “Masks available in the market were not up to the mark and some are even recycled,” Congress Chief Whip M. Narayanswamy alleged.

Responding to the criticism, Mr. Sriramulu said: “I’m pained at the death of the senior citizen in Kalaburagi. However, we are taking enough precautions. Leaves for doctors have been cancelled and they are being deputed to areas where needed. There is no dearth of money and the Union government has also promised financial assistance.”

Labs to be set up

On the absence of laboratories, he said the government will set them up in all districts, but it would take time. “Somehow, private hospitals are not participating in the measures. In the first case, the private hospital where the senior citizen was admitted did not inform the government. Private hospitals are also not sure of admitting the affected people,” Mr. Sriramulu said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ifb0qp/article31085466.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGNARAYANASWAMYMASK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-precautionary-measures-taken-by-karnataka-inadequate-says-opposition/article31085467.ece
130,2020/03/16,Two BJP MLAs take govt. to task for ‘ignoring’ monkey fever,"They claimed that the situation was better during the previous government

The State government faced embarrassment in the Legislative Assembly on Monday with two MLAs from the Bharatiya Janata Party taking it to task over the spread of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) that has reportedly claimed four lives this year in Malnad areas.

One of the MLAs even said that the measures to tackle KFD, also known as monkey fever, were more effective during the previous government compared to the situation now.

While the issue was raised during the Zero Hour by BJP member and former Minister H. Halappa, he was supported by his party member Araga Jnanedra.

Both the MLAs alleged that the government, which was focussing on tackling COVID-19, had not shown similar seriousness in handling KFD though it had claimed the lives of nearly 25 in the last one year. “Is it right on your part to completely ignore KFD, which is affecting villagers near forest areas?” asked Mr. Halappa.

Accusing the Health Department officials of lacking seriousness and commitment in dealing with the disease, he wondered how they could ignore KFD deaths being reported in Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s home district of Shivamogga.

Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri pointed out that his constituency too had witnessed a KFD death. Mr. Halappa expressed concern that preventive measures were not heightened in the affected districts of Shivamogga, Uttara Kannada and Chikkamagaluru despite the State witnessing four deaths this year.

“The situation was better under the previous government as three ambulances equipped with ventilators used to be parked in the affected villages and there was a provision to take the affected persons to private hospitals for treatment,” said Mr. Halappa, adding that now they are only taken to the government hospital in Shivamogga, where he said there are no adequate facilities.

Mr. Halappa lost his cool when Health Minister B. Sriramulu claimed that 15 persons had died due to KFD in the previous year. Countering him, the MLAs said the actual death toll was 23.

The Health Minister assured them of setting up a laboratory to deal with KFD and promised to arrange a meeting between MLAs of the affected areas and Mr. Yediyurappa.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/uz86qb/article31085446.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THHANDOUTLEGISLATIVEASSEMBLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/two-bjp-mlas-take-govt-to-task-for-ignoring-monkey-fever/article31085450.ece
131,2020/03/16,COVID-19 | Foreign returnees leave hamlet anxious,"Special camp held to address their fears and educate them about COVID-19

The residents of Shikaripura, a Hakki Pikki tribal hamlet near Nagamangala in Mandya district, are anxious for the past few days subsequent to the return of some people from the community after a trip to South Africa.

This is given the fear that anyone who has a travel history to a foreign nation is susceptible to COVID-19. A good number of nomadic tribal community members at the hamlet travel overseas frequently. Recently, some of them had returned from South Africa. Consequent to a request from the elders at the hamlet, a special camp was organised on Saturday for the community members to address their fears as well as to educate them about COVID-19, said H.P. Manche Gowda, District Health Officer. No one in the hamlet showed any symptoms, the officer told The Hindu.

The population of the hamlet is about 350. Many of them often travel to Sri Lanka, African countries, and even to the U.K. to sell their medicines, spices and for offering pain-relief services like body massage. “The department will continue to monitor the health conditions of the residents, besides educate them on tackling the outbreak/spread of viruses,” Dr. Gowda said.

Members of the community said that they had stopped visiting the houses of those who returned from South Africa out of fear. They said that the news on television had created fear. Some members are still abroad and the government should thoroughly screen them at airports before letting them return to the hamlet, an elderly person at the hamlet said.

The community is one among the most socio-economically backward nomadic tribal communities in the country. It had been depending on hunting for centuries for livelihood. However, in recent years, they make a living out of selling medicines, spices and so on.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/m92ndw/article31085080.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGHAKKIPIKKI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/coronavirus-foreign-returnees-leave-hamlet-anxious/article31085082.ece
132,2020/03/16,‘Hold survey to identify children upto 14 years as per RTE norms’,"High Court directs State govt. to complete household survey by April 30

The High Court of Karnataka on Monday directed the State government to ensure that all local authorities, from city corporations to panchayats, conduct a household survey to maintain records of children from their birth till they attain 14 years, as per the provisions of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act and the Karnataka RTE Rules.

Observing that obligation in the law was not to conduct survey of only children in the age group of 6-14 and out-of-school children but the household survey was to collect data of children from their birth to 14 years, the court directed that the survey will have to be completed by April 30, and the records of children up to 14 years should be generated at least six weeks before the commencement of the 2020-21 academic year.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the interim order on a PIL petition suo motu initiated in 2013 on the issue of out-of-school children.

Not to use teachers

The State government must ensure that all local authorities update the record of children every year through household survey at least two months before the commencement of the academic year, the Bench said, while making it clear that teachers cannot be used for the survey as section RTE Act does not allow use of teachers for non-educational purposes, except for certain tasks like population census, elections, and disaster relief.

The local authorities can use self-help groups and NGOs working in the field for conducting survey, the Bench said.

‘Analyse data’

Observing that various obligations set out under the RTE Act and and Rules cannot be enforced at all without the data of children from their birth till they attain age of 14 years, the Bench said the government, after completion of survey by the local authorities, should analyse the data and submit a comprehensive report to the court.

Fill vacant posts

Meanwhile, the Bench also directed the government to fill remaining posts of education coordinators, who acted as attendance authority, within a period of one month and impart training to them on provision so the RTE Act and the Rules, and their specific roles.

The Bench also directed the State to reconsider its decisions of giving only ₹500 per month for their work related to out-of-school children, and not to pay travel allowance to parents of out-of-school children to attend meetings of child welfare committee as per the provisions of the RTE Act.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dohfmb/article31088198.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hold-survey-to-identify-children-upto-14-years-as-per-rte-norms/article31084978.ece
133,2020/03/16,I’ll retire from politics if charges against my father are proved: HDK,"He challenges Yatnal to prove allegations of amassing wealth levelled against H. D. Deve Gowda

Taking exception to the charges of amassing wealth against former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda levelled by BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy on Monday challenged him to prove the charges and remarked that he would quit active politics if he did so.

Participating in a special debate on Constitution, Mr. Kumaraswamy asked BJP leaders to desist from talking lightly. He said Mr. Deve Gowda had borrowed ₹5 lakh from a Bengaluru-based private money-lender to meet election expenses in 2004. “Why would he borrow if he had amassed wealth?” he wondered.

‘Pittance for BJP’

When the BJP members taunted him by wondering if ₹5 lakh was enough to meet election expenses, Mr. Kumaraswamy hit out at them saying: “It was enough for us then. But I am sure it’s pittance for BJP leaders.”

Launching a counter-attack at the BJP, he said: “Whatever postings you [BJP government] have given officers within two days of coming to power are those who had approached me for good positions when I was the Chief Minister. I had refused to yield to pressure from corrupt people... I am willing to extend all co-operation to tackle corruption. But are you willing to check corruption?”

In reference to the BJP’s efforts to destabilise the governments in various States by wooing MLAs from rival camps, he said: “In the coming days, no government can feel secure even if it has 150 MLAs [in 224-member House] going by the present trend of political defections.”

On appointments

Expressing concern over cancellation of appointments for KAS made by Karnataka Public Service Commission in 2011, Mr. Kumaraswamy expressed concern over the future of these candidates.

Hailing the spirit of the Indian Constitution, he wondered if it had been possible to implement the intentions of the constitution in letter and spirit.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ill-retire-from-politics-if-charges-against-my-father-are-proved-hdk/article31084971.ece

The dust catcher unit of Hemavati Cooperative Sugar Factory at Srinivasapura near Channarayapatna collapsed after a blast on Sunday, leaving the farmers, who expected the crushing of sugarcane to begin later this month, worried.

The dust catcher attached to the boiler exploded and fell off, making the employees at the unit run for safety. However, none was injured. Fire tenders rushed to the spot and extinguished the blaze. The installation of the dust catcher was completed only on Saturday.

The factory is managed by a private company – Chamundeshwari Sugars. It had taken up renovation of the factory and had scheduled crushing activity from March 29. The company had hired a Delhi-based company to company to install the dust catcher.

137,2020/03/16,Heavy vehicles on Charmadi Ghat still a long way off,"PWD’s National Highways division unable to commence restoration works

Charmadi Ghat that witnessed massive destruction during the August 2019 downpour may not be ready for heavy vehicles any time soon as the National Highways division of State Public Works Department (PWD) has been unable to commence permanent restoration works.

Inordinate delay by the regional office of Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in Bengaluru to clear the estimate and proposal for restoration is said to be the reason behind PWD being unable to take up the works. The department had reportedly sent the proposal immediately after the rains, by September end, to the regional office, which cleared it only last month, sources said.

This, sources added, too was a month after Deputy Chief Minister and PWD in charge Govind Karjol asked the official concerned to expedite the process. Delay at the regional office notwithstanding, the Ministry cleared the proposal immediately and tenders will be called in about a fortnight.

While heavy vehicles may not be allowed till the restoration works are completed, light vehicles including mini buses could continue to ply via Charmadi Ghat that connects coastal Karnataka with many parts of the State, sources said. The ghat was the link to most parts of North Karnataka and even neighbouring Chikkamagaluru, Shivamogga, and Hassan districts.

Pending approval of the estimate by MoRTH, PWD through its contractors is undertaking construction of guard walls at many stretches and stabilising road flanks. Since guard walls had collapsed at many places, their absence, particularly during nights, were dangerous for vehicle drivers and hence the urgent works, sources noted.

Retaining walls

The proposal seeks to reconstruct/build retaining walls on valley side the Ghat road using soil-nailing technology at an estimated cost of ₹19 crore. While portions of the ghat in Dakshina Kannada district did not witness much destruction, those in Chikkamagaluru district witnessed massive slides. There was not much problem on the hill side portion of the ghat road, sources said.

Portions of Charmadi Ghat had witnessed landslips during the 2018 monsoon too, but they were mostly confined in Dakshina Kannada limits and on the hill sides. The cloudburst in August last, however, wrecked havoc all along Charmadi region, destroying roads, houses and bridges in many parts.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/wyx77u/article31088725.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGCHARMADIGHAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/heavy-vehicles-on-charmadi-ghat-still-a-long-way-off/article31083942.ece

“The annual RSS meet was cut short due to Covid-19 scare. However, Akhil Bharatiya Karyakari Mandal (ABKM), a top policy making body of RSS, met and passed these resolutions,” said Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi, General Secretary, RSS.

RSS in its resolution congratulated Union Government for legislating CAA, 2019, and says: “It is the moral and constitutional obligation of Bharatiya society and government of Bharat to protect the interests of persecuted minorities [from the three Islamic countries].” Arguing and said the Act doesn't affect any “citizen of Bharat.” It accused “the Jehadi-Left combine”, with the support of selfish political parties, of being involved in communal politics, and some “foreign forces” of “making nefarious efforts to spread violence and anarchy.”

Mr. Joshi speaking to press persons said that the union government must hold talks with all political parties to clear doubts and fears about CAA. “Unfortunately a national issue has become political. Certain political parties are creating confusion but we appeal to them to support the Law in the interest of the nation,” The Prime Minister and Home Minister have repeatedly invited people for talks but the response has not been positive,” he said adding it was the duty of the union government to talk to political parties and create awareness.

RSS resolution welcomed dilution of Article 370 and said, “recent decision and their implementation would nullify constitutional and political anamolies” and argues “reorganisation of the state has opened up new vistas”. The resolution said: “The process of secured and dignified rehabilitation of the displaced Hindu community from the Kashmir valley should be initiated at the earliest.” It had a word of advice for the union government as well. “The ABKM calls upon the Government to clear all apprehensions among the citizens of the area and fulfill their aspirations through effective and just governance and economic development.”

Another RSS resolution terms the apex court order on Ram Janmabhoomi “highly balanced verdict” and says it was a “matter of joy that no section society has taken the verdict as a sign of its victory or defeat instead, accepted it as victory of the nation, constitution and justice.” The resolution also lauds the union government for “winning the trust of all sections with patience and fortitude”. It also welcomes the decision to make the “Sri Ram Janmabhumi Teerth Kshetra” as a society driven trust with government only as a facilitator.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/rss-lauds-ram-mandir-verdict-decision-on-article-370-and-caa/article31083901.ece

140,2020/03/16,"COVID-19: Foreign tourists already in Mysuru to be tracked, screened","MCC staff engaged in survey of hotels, homestays: Deputy Commissioner

The district administration has stepped up its efforts to track international tourists already in Mysuru and who have been put up in resorts, homestays and hotels in a bid to screen them for COVID-19.

The Deputy Commissioner, Abhiram G, Sankar, said here on Monday that the staff of the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) are engaged in a survey of hotels and home-stay properties across Mysuru since the last few days and appealed to owners of such properties to provide their travel history and information.

He said the district administration is furnished with information of Mysuru-bound passengers arriving at Bengaluru International Airport. But there are tourists whose first port of arrival is not Bengaluru and have come to Mysuru by train or bus or other means and efforts are on to track them.

“Though we have appealed to the resort and hotel owners to provide the district administration with information there have been instances of non-cooperation’’, said Mr. Abhiram Sankar.

Tourists come for sightseeing or for yoga and these institutions have been directed to provide information to the authorities about any new registrations with an advisory to the traveller to subject themselves to isolation for 14 days. “Isolation is not an arrest and we request the travellers and property owners to cooperate with home quarantine as this is a public health emergency’’ said the Deputy Commissioner.

He cautioned that in the event of any eventuality, those who evaded providing travel history or evaded being screened would be brought to book. “Do not force us to use coercion’’, he said.

In reply to a question on IT industry in Mysuru, the Deputy Commissioner said the officials of the companies were evaluating the situation and giving feedback and have curbed travel. But they would let the authorities know in case the training centres and hostels were to be closed.

The DC said there was no dearth of test kits and infrastructure was being ramped up to cope with any surge in suspect cases.

A decision to close the two till March 31 was taken at a meeting chaired by Vice-Chancellor of University of Mysore Hemanth Kumar to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Hundreds of people make a beeline to Kukkarahalli Lake and Manasagangotri campus in the morning and evening for walking and jogging.

While Kukkarahalli Lake is estimated to attract about 4,000 people every day, Manasagangotri campus too had emerged as one of the preferred open spaces in the city for morning walks, particularly after the centenary clock tower resembling the Big Ben was constructed in 2015.

The Manasagangotri campus is believed to draw as many people as the nearby Kukkarahalli Lake does.

Registrar of University of Mysore Shivappa R. told The Hindu that the decision was taken on the same lines as the decision of the authorities to close parks.

With almost all the gyms in the city remaining closed since the last few days, a large number of fitness enthusiasts had flocked to Kukkarahalli lake and Manasagangotri campus on Monday morning. However, the walkers and joggers who turned up at the lake on Monday evening, were greeted with a notice board put up at the entrance that the premises will be out of bounds till March 31 in view of the virus scare.

However, no decision has been taken on closure of Oval grounds in front of Crawford Hall, the University authorities said.

The other lung spaces such as Karanji Nature Park and Lingambudhi Lake too have been shut.

In a complaint, Seena, a labourer, said his two children – one in Class 7 and another in Class 5 – studying in the Government Higher Primary School in Padladi of Laila village were left behind in the school while 52 students from Classes 5 to 7 were taken for lunch offered by a person who held a house warming ceremony on February 26.

On being informed by his children the next day, Seena brought this to the notice of Belthangady Block Education Officer and sought disciplinary action against Assistant Teacher Uma Rao, who was holding the charge of headmaster of the school. Seena accused Ms. Rao of hurting the sentiments of his children. Ms. Rao had illegally allowed children to attend a private function during the school time, he alleged in the complaint.

As the BEO failed to take any action, Mr. Seena filed a complaint with the police on March 12.

Ms. Rao retired from service on February 29.

The Belthangady police registered the complaint against Ms. Rao under Section 3 (R) of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Deputy Superintendent of Police, Bantwal, Valentine D'Souza, is investigating the case.

The police have taken the statements of the two children. As students belonging to the Scheduled Tribe community were among those who went out for lunch, legal opinion from the Department of Prosecution about the way to proceed under the SC and ST Act is being sought.

The swab samples of four persons with suspected infection, including two who were in close contact with the 76-year-old person who died due to COVID-19 on March 12, were sent to Bengaluru for testing, Deputy Commissioner B. Sharat said here today.

The other two, one each from Chittapur and Chincholi taluk, had a travel history to foreign countries. They were kept in the isolation ward of a hospital.

Besides 71 persons who were in direct contact with the country’s first fatality from the virus in Kalaburagi, 238 more persons who were in contact with them were also brought under observation in the city on Monday. Around 60 persons who had travelled to various countries also remained under home isolation. Totally 370 persons are under public health monitoring for the deadly virus. Of them, presently eight suspected cases were admitted to the isolation ward, he added.

“Five isolation wards have been established at each taluk centre in the district. We have activated 50 isolation wards at the ESIC hospital and 12 wards at the Gulbarga Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), besides a 200-bed quarantine ward at ESIC hospital,” Mr. Sharat said.

“In Bengaluru, we are holding talks with various medical colleges such as East Point Medical College, Akash Institute of Medical Sciences and Research and MVJ Medical College. In private hospitals too we want to convert one floor into an isolation zone. We want to make sure that we have at least 3,000 beds for isolating patients in Bengaluru,” he asserted.

To ensure timely testing of samples and reduce the load on the existing labs, the government is planning to set up more testing centres in Belagavi, Kalaburagi, Hubballi and Mangaluru. “We have already announced that testing centres will be set up in Hassan, Shivamogga and Mysuru. Three labs are already functioning in Bengaluru,” he said.

Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary, Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education, will review surveillance measures taken in districts to tackle Covid-19 through video conference every day, Mr. Sudhakar said.

“We are doing all that is required to contain the spread of the disease in stage two, at the cluster level itself. In future, if required we are ready to convert vacant government and private buildings into treatment facilities,” he said adding that doctors, paramedics staff and other health workers who are in the forefront of these disease control measures are the “real heroes.” “They will be provided insurance and additional incentives, he said

The Department of Health and Family Welfare stated that the 45-year-old woman tested positive on Sunday. Her condition is stable. Her father died on March 10 and it was later learnt that he tested positive for COVID-19. A total of four members, who came in contact with him and developed symptoms, had been quarantined in the ESIC Medical Complex. The samples of three others were found to be negative for COVID-19.

148,2020/03/16,"Decades on, these tribal families continue their wait for a place to call home","The families of Havugolla, a tribal community, staying put in makeshift tents at Balekoppa in N.R. Pura taluk have been fighting for land to build houses for over two decades. They have spent years visiting different offices seeking land, but their demand has not been fulfilled yet.

As many as 70 people spread over 18 families are living in tents without basic amenities. During the rainy season and winter months, they suffer without a proper shelter. The community is known for capturing snakes and they keep moving from place top place. But the younger generation does not know the job. They settle in one place and work in estates as farm labourers.

Ramesh, 32, a father of three, told The Hindu that his parents moved to Kaimara about 25 years ago. Since then, the community has been seeking land to settle down. “All through my life, I have been staying in tents. I don’t know if we will get to move to a proper house in my lifetime,” he said. He also alleged that the officers identify land in remote areas, with no proper transport facilities. “If we stay in a remote area, how will we get to work?” he asked.

Earlier, they had put up tents near Kaimara in the taluk. The death of two youths of the community in July 2018 forced them to leave the place. Worried about the deaths, the community leaders visited temples of their deities. It is said the deities, through the priests who invoke them, told the people to shift immediately to avoid more deaths. Suddenly, they all moved to different places. The Hindu had carried a report on this. Later, the local administration brought them back, assuring them of a proper place to stay. Temporarily, the N.R. Pura taluk administration allowed them to stay on the premises of a defunct school at Balekoppa.

N.R. Pura tahsildar H.M. Nagaraj said land was identified for the community on survey number 179 of Nagalapura panchayat and was handed over to the panchayat for further processing. “However, there were many trees on said land. The panchayat sought permission to cut them, but did not get it from the Forest Department,” he said.

Subsequently, the taluk administration identified another plot of land at Aralikoppa village for the community. “The process of reserving the land for the community is still under way. They will get it soon,” the official said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/24zxp5/article31077356.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGHAVUGOLLA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/decades-on-they-continue-their-wait-for-a-place-to-call-home/article31077357.ece
149,2020/03/16,New KPCC president faces onerous task of uniting different camps,"Over the past two days, the president-designate of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC), D.K. Shivakumar, has been meeting senior Congress leaders, seeking their cooperation in his stint, which is likely to start from April. For the former Minister, the biggest challenge will be in taking along different groups and bringing some much-needed coordination in a house divided by caste and regional pulls.

Party sources said that internal power struggles among the groups led by former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, former Deputy Chief Minister G. Parameshwara, and former Leader of Congress in the Lok Sabha M. Mallikarjun Kharge had eroded confidence in the grassroots workers to an extent. The fight for the upper hand within the party between the “old guards” and “migrants” is another dimension to the problem.

“For Mr. Shivakumar, the urgent need is to bring the groups together under a collective leadership. Groupism in the party led to the fall of the Janata Dal (S)-Congress coalition. He could have gone alone to Delhi for thanksgiving, but he wants to take all leaders along with him,” a source close to Mr. Shivakumar said. “At a time when the BJP’s infighting could blow out of proportion, an alternative cannot be given unless the Congress is stronger.”

However, it is to be seen how his equations will work out with Mr. Siddaramaiah, who had opposed appointing a KPCC chief from the Old Mysore region. “It was not against Mr. Shivakumar, it was to bring about regional balance as Mr. Siddaramaiah also hails from Old Mysore,” a source close to the former CM said. While initially, Mr. Shivakumar did not like the idea of having four working presidents, a proposal mooted by Mr. Siddaramaiah’s camp, he now will have three working presidents, including Ishwar Khadre, the incumbent.

Old foes

A Vokkaliga member becoming the KPCC president after a gap of two decades is likely to have repercussions for the JD(S), the Congress’ main opponent in Old Mysore region. Though Mr. Shivakumar and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy had shown newfound bonhomie after the formation of the JD(S)-Congress coalition, the equation between the two Vokkaliga leaders is likely to change now. The two families had fought bitterly in Ramanagaram since the 1980s, before informally announcing a truce of sorts a couple of years ago.

“The Congress has not had a big leader from the Vokkaliga community after S.M. Krishna. This appointment is likely to bring disenchanted former and sitting Vokkaliga legislators from other parties, especially the JD(S), to Congress,” a party source said. “The chief ministerial ambitions of Mr. Shivakumar are quite clear. In such a case, Vokkaliga votes may get divided in the heartland, which could hurt the JD(S) which derives its strength from there. The more he grows, the more it will affect the JD(S).”

However, a senior JD(S) legislator said that the threat to the party coming from Mr. Shivakumar may not be big, and that the party leadership has not expressed any big worry over this appointment.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/51bzdl/article31077350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGDKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/new-kpcc-president-faces-onerous-task-of-uniting-different-camps/article31077351.ece
150,2020/03/16,Pressure on JD(S) patriarch Deve Gowda to contest Rajya Sabha polls,"Amid hectic political developments on the BJP front, calls for former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda to contest in the Rajya Sabha elections from Karnataka are growing within the JD(S). When some party leaders raised the issue in January, and the veteran politician refused to yield, but it again came up for discussion at the JD(S) meeting held last week.

“All the legislators present at the meeting urged the party patriarch to be the party’s candidate. The issue was not pursued further as Mr. Gowda did not want to discuss it at this juncture,” a senior legislator said, adding that the party was keen to have Mr. Gowda in Parliament. Sources close to Mr. Gowda said he was yet to make up his mind.

In one of the biggest upsets that the State saw during the May 2019 elections to the Lok Sabha, Mr. Gowda lost from Tumakuru. He had vacated the Hassan Lok Sabha seat for his grandson Prajwal Revanna, who made his debut in Parliament.

As many as four seats in the Rajya Sabha from Karnataka, including one from the JD(S), will be vacated in June following the end of the six-year term. Currently, the party is represented by Kupendra Reddy. While the BJP, with its numerical strength, is capable of sending two members to the Rajya Sabha, the Congress can send one. The JD(S), with 34 members in the Assembly, will have to get additional votes to send its candidate, as each candidate requires 45 votes.

Party sources said the Congress, which was a coalition partner of the JD(S), has additional votes which could be transferred to Mr. Gowda. However, so far the JD(S) has not raised the issue with the Congress.

Meanwhile, Congress sources close to Congress Legislature Party leader and Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah said there was a possibility that the two seats that can be won by Opposition parties could go to veteran Congress leader M. Mallikarjun Kharge and a JD(S) nominee, who is likely to be Mr. Gowda. “So far, discussions have not happened,” a source said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/en9trd/article31080005.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGDEVEGOWDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pressure-on-jds-patriarch-deve-gowda-to-contest-rajya-sabha-polls/article31077280.ece

Yediyurappa attended the grand wedding celebrations of the daughter of BJP MLC Mahantesh Kavatagimath in Belagavi on Sunday.

The Chief Minister had advised citizens to put off weddings till the COVID-19 scare passed, or to restrict the number of guests to just around 100. But the wedding in Udyambag industrial area of Belagavi had many more times the number of visitors prescribed by him for the people of the State.

A police officer on duty at the venue estimated the crowd at over 3,000.

Hundreds of cars were parked on both sides of Khanapur road, outside the venue, which was decorated with flowers, buntings and rolls of paper and colourful cloth. Two huge banners about preventing the spread of COVID-19 were put up at the venue. There are wash basins at two ends and several hand sanitiser counters across the ground.

Apart from Union Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi, Minister Srimanth Patil and MLA Mahesh Kumathalli, there were several leaders from the BJP, Congress and JD(S) who attended the marriage. Some officials from the city corporation and district administration were also among the guests. The Chief Minister arrived around 11 a.m. and stayed for nearly an hour at the venue. He left after wishing the couple and greeting some leaders.

152,2020/03/16,"Despite efforts, investment gulf remains between Bengaluru and rest of Karnataka","Despite several efforts by the State government to push investments in tier II and III cities, the Statewide investment pattern during the last four years (2016-17 to 2019-20) clearly reveals that entrepreneurs and industrialists are showing interest in investing only in and around Bengaluru, with the district bagging 31% of the total investments in medium-scale industries.

Though the State received ₹3,304.42 crore in investments in 491 medium-scale industries and generated 23,409 jobs in this period, Bengaluru Urban district received investments of ₹1,026.7 crore, providing jobs to 8,226 persons. In contrast, the neighbouring Bengaluru Rural bagged merely ₹166.31 crore, generating 521 jobs.

The districts that received more than ₹100 crore in investment are Belagavi (₹241.6 crore), Mysuru (₹143.21 crore), Dharwad (₹163.86 crore), Ballari (₹106.4 crore), Chitradurga (₹152.69 crore), Raichur (₹106.4 crore), Tumakuru (₹189.13 crore), and Bidar (₹105.17 crore).

The periodic industrial policies brought out by the government have been giving encouragement to industrialists to invest in smaller cities and towns. But only retail industries, gas bunks and restaurants have been established in tier II and III towns. Many large and medium industries have not been showing interest in investment in these towns because of infrastructure bottlenecks, logistical issues, non-availability of manpower, and demand for goods and services, said an expert.

Data provided by the Industries Department revealed that three districts — Kodagu, Gadag and Chamarajanagar — did not receive any investment during the last four years. Interestingly, despite close proximity to the State capital, districts such as Ramanagaram (₹52.62 crore), Chickballapur (₹77.53 crore) and Kolar (₹75.89 crore) received small amounts of investment.

Other districts that received negligible amounts in investment in the medium-scale sector are Yadgir (₹32.8 crore), Dakshina Kannada (₹22.85 crore), Kalaburagi (₹23.83 crore), Shivamogga (₹43.2 crore), Chikkamagaluru (₹25.8 crore), and Hassan (₹37.16 crore).

Recent initiatives

For reducing Bengaluru-centric development, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has said that the government will focus on development of airports in tier II and III cities and towns. Already, the Kalaburagi and Bidar airports have become operational. Under the ‘Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik’ scheme, some airlines are providing services to smaller airports.

Large and Medium Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar said the 2019-24 Industrial Policy would given a lot of incentives in the form of tax holidays and subsidies to entrepreneurs keen to invest in tier II and III cites and towns. Enthused with the memoranda signed for the tune of ₹73,000 crore in investments during the investment summit organised in Hubballi last month, the department has proposed to hold investors’ meets at the divisional level to attract more investments, Mr. Shettar said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/dun9yq/article29778548.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THLT-RUPEE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/despite-efforts-investment-gulf-remains-between-bengaluru-and-rest-of-karnataka/article31077256.ece

Officers of Revenue Department, with the help of police, cleared the tents put up by residents of Satyamangala village on government land as part of the protest to demand land for building houses, on Saturday.

A few families had put up tents in a hurry on Friday night on the land at survey no. 254 and 244 of Satyamangala, reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes beneficiaries. However, the land has not been granted to beneficiaries due to objections raised by a few, who had also moved court.

Officers of Satyamangala Gram Panchayat and Hassan tahsildar learnt about the development and rushed to the spot on Saturday. They also called the police to the spot as tension prevailed for some time following arguments between the villagers and officers. The officers told the villagers that putting up tents before the land was sanctioned to them was illegal and such an act would attract punishment.

However, the people maintained that they had been living in rented houses for years. The district administration had been delaying allotment of land, despite reserving it for them years ago. Finally, the officers succeeded in convincing the people, who removed the tents.

Shivashankarappa, tahsildar, said the land had been reserved for SC/STs of the village. The district administration had held meetings on granting the land. However, a few from the same community had claimed that the land belonged to them and moved the court.

A native of Harihar in Davangere district, who had gone missing about three-and-half-a-months ago, has been traced to the Indo-Bangadesh border in Assam. With the help of Border Security Force officers, the woman has been reunited with her family.

An Intelligence Officer of the BSF noticed Kalamma, 40, roaming at Mahisasan railway station close to the border on March 12.

Upon enquiry, the officer surmised that she was from south India.

He took the help of Pandaranath, a BSF constable who hails from Karnataka, to talk to her and learnt that she was a native of Ramtirtha, a village in Harihar taluk. J.C. Nayak, DIG (BSF), told The Hindu that his officers collected her address and the number of her brother, Kumar. “We contacted Kumar who said that his sister had been missing for the past three-four months. He took a flight and reached the BSF camp and we sent his sister with him,” he said. The BSF officer also recalled that in October 2018, he and his staff had rescued a lady from Hassan and sent her back home after tracing her daughter.

Ms. Kalamma and her brother have expressed gratitude to the officers of BSF for their help in reuniting the family.

Speaking to The Hindu, Ms. Kallamma said she had been separated from her husband and she had no children. About three-four months ago, she took a train to Bengaluru from Davangere in search of a job in any garment units.

“My health was also not good. One day I thought of returning to my place and reached the railway station. I got into a train and it went on and on for a long time and I got down at the last stop,” she said.

Ms. Kalamma, who has physical disabilities, begged on the platforms to survive. She swept the station premises for which she got a few rupees from the staff occasionally.

Mr. Kumar, a daily-wager in a carpenter’s shop, said: “Earlier, she had gone to different places and returned home after a couple of months. This time too, we thought she would come back and did not file a complaint with the police”.

Only after he was contacted by the BSF, he learnt about her whereabouts. “I earn about ₹300 a day. I have spent more than ₹35,000, raising loans from people, to bring back my sister. I am thankful to BSF officers, for reuniting us,” he said.

155,2020/03/16,Kannadigas in Goa worried over campaign seeking reservation for native Goans,"POGO Yatra began in December last after attempts to get a Bill tabled failed

While residents of Karnataka are seeking reservation on their own land and urging the government to implement the recommendations of the Sarojini Mahishi-led committee in toto, Kannadigas in Goa, who form a big chunk of the migrant population, are worried these days following a campaign by native Goans.

A campaign to seek the passage of a Bill to give preference only to native Goans has become a cause for concern for lakhs of Kannada-speaking people residing for decades in Goa. The campaign, better known as ‘POGO Yatra’, is basically aimed at seeking the passage of the “Persons of Goan Origin (POGO) Bill” in the Goan Assembly. It was launched by Revolutionary Goans, an organisation of “native Goans” led by Manoj Parab.

POGO Yatra began December last after attempts to get the Bill tabled in the Goa Assembly did not yield results. According to the organisation, POGO are those who resided in Goa before the Goan liberation from Portuguese rule, which happened in 1961. The main demand of the organisation is 100% reservation in government jobs and 80% reservation in private sector, and for restriction of government benefits and schemes to only those families that resided in Goa before 1961.

Goa had a population of five lakh at the time of its liberation; it has subsequently increased to around 15 lakh. Mr. Parab was earlier with the Aam Aadmi Party and his organisation says the campaign is for saving native identity. Over a period of time, the POGO Yatra has covered various places.

“Not all native Goans are with him. In some cases, native Goans have stood behind migrants when a few persons tried to create problems for them,” said Govind Lamani, a Kannadiga and a member of the gram panchayat in Sancoale, Goa.

But according to him, the campaign has disturbed the peaceful coexistence of native Goans and the migrant population. There have been instances of harassment of migrants, and in some cases discrimination based on caste, he said.

Several among the migrant population, particularly those of the second and third generations, have now taken to social media platforms to take on Mr. Parab. “We have also begun awareness programmes among the migrant communities. We plan to submit memoranda to all those concerned in the government to treat everyone equally as we are all part and parcel of Goa. We are against discriminating against anyone,” Mr. Lamani said.

Need for intervention

Meanwhile, former Minister Basavaraj Horatti, who raised the issue in the Karnataka Legislative Council, told The Hindu that the floor leader had promised to take up the issue with the Chief Minister. “We want the government to take a delegation to Goa on the issue. After a discussion with the Chief Minister on Monday, a decision is likely to be taken,” he said.

Mr. Horatti, who is in contact with some of the organisations of migrant Kannadigas, said there have been several cases of exploitation and the Goa government should intervene. “What is a matter of concern is that several among the Kannadigas are elected representatives in local bodies. They are also being subjected to such treatment,” he said.

In Belagavi, Basavaraj Gundenatti and others of Vishwa Navanirmana Vedike submitted a memorandum to the Deputy Commissioner on Saturday urging the State government to intervene in the matter and protect the interests of Kannadigas in Goa.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/lxqr24/article31076823.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGHORATTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kannadigas-in-goa-worried-over-campaign-seeking-reservation-for-native-goans/article31076824.ece
156,2020/03/16,74 in home quarantine in Kodagu,"Three suspected cases admitted to isolation ward of district hospital in Madikeri

Three suspected cases of COVID-19 have been admitted to the isolation ward of the district hospital in Madikeri. They had returned from a foreign trip, according to the Kodagu district administration. The samples of the suspected cases had been sent for lab tests and the reports are being awaited. They are being constantly monitored by the medical teams put in-charge of the isolation ward.

As many as 74 persons had been placed under home quarantine in Kodagu as a precautionary measure following their return from foreign journey, a note from the Deputy Commissioner said.

Acting on the government directives, the district administration managed to find out the people who had returned to Kodagu from foreign trips and these persons had been counselled to cooperate with the authorities on the current situation.

In Madikeri, 37 such persons had been contacted and asked them to be at home as a safety precaution. Likewise, 19 from Virajpet and 21 from Somawarpet had been home quarantined, according to Deputy Commissioner Annies Kanmani Joy.

Tourists banned

In what is seen as a step to stop people from visiting the tourist destinations, the Kodagu district administration has clamped ban orders at the government-operated tourist sites in the district. The orders had been issued under Section 144 Cr. PC from March 14 to 21. The directive prevents assembly of more than five persons.

Meanwhile, health workers and ASHA volunteers are carrying out awareness drives across the district following the COVID-19 scare. People moving across the Kerala borders are being monitored and sensitised on the precautions to be taken in the wake of the outbreak.

157,2020/03/16,MSMEs fear slowdown may turn worse,"Bulk of raw materials sourced from China

The manufacturing sector in Mysuru fears that the COVID-19 pandemic could add to the general slowdown in the industry if the situation does not ease early.

Mysuru has a huge network of ancillary units manufacturing automobile components but if the vehicle manufacturer suffers a slowdown then it will disrupt the production of local MSMEs that are part of the supply chain. Similarly, the city has emerged as a centre for electronic hardware and supplier of components,

Cascading effect

But a disruption at one level could have a cascading impact down to the local units.

Sudhakar Shetty, former president of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI), told The Hindu that MSME units in Mysuru would suffer as they import most of the components in bulk from China and assemble it locally. With the supplies taking a hit, the MSMEs had to brace to source raw materials from other places. He warned that if the pandemic does not ebb within the next 15 to 30 days then even the manufacturing sector would begin to feel the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Most manufacturers as a rule maintain a buffer and inventory of the raw materials for about 90 days to tide over any uncertainty. But these are already being utiliSed in the interim and once the stock exhausts and the COVID-19 situation does not ease, then the industry will begin to feel the heat,” Mr. Shetty added.

Meanwhile, the manufacturing units have begun to scout for raw materials from fellow-Indian suppliers as the imports from China have slowed down or stopped as a fallout of the pandemic, said Suresh Kumar Jain, secretary, Mysore Industries Association.

However, he said it was impossible for fellow-Indian suppliers to match the cost of Chinese suppliers given their scale of production. But with no option the manufacturers would be forced to opt for Indian suppliers to meet their requirements though it may be at a higher cost, Mr. Jain added.

Earlier, the bulk of raw materials used to be procured from China, especially the electronic items, sanitary fittings and electrical gadgets besides chemicals.

Also, whether domestic suppliers can met the sudden surge in demand and shore up their production to meet the orders is a question that is haunting the stakeholders.

While there is no immediate fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic on the manufacturing sector, there is no escaping from its medium- to long-term impact, according to the stakeholders. It was pointed out that there has been no closure of units because of the prevailing situation but the same could not be said if the disruption in supply continues.

“This is a lesson for us not depend only on one country for raw materials and instead encourage India-made products,” said Mr. Shetty. However, he rued that apart from impressive slogans coined by the government, there was nothing on the ground to give a boost to Make in India concept by way of reduced interest rates or creating infrastructure for mass production.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/9edswn/article31076774.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGMSME,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/msmes-fear-slowdown-may-turn-worse/article31076767.ece
158,2020/03/16,"Missing woman found murdered, four held","Man with whom she was in a relationship among those arrested

A 42-year-old married woman, who went missing from her house at Maganahalli in Chamarajanagar district’s Hanur taluk more than a month ago, was found murdered and buried in a farmhouse in Akkuru Doddi in T. Narsipur taluk in Mysuru.

The Mysuru district police, which had formed a special team traced the accused, including the missing woman’s paramour Mahesh, who led them to the farmhouse from where the body was exhumed in the presence of the tahsildar on Saturday and sent for post-mortem.

Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, Superintendent of Mysuru district police C.B. Ryshyanth said a missing complaint was lodged at Hanur police station on January 28 when Rajamma, 42, disappeared from her house in Maganahalli.

But, soon after receiving a complaint a few days ago that her paramour was behind her murder, the T. Narispur police took up the investigation and traced Mahesh, 38, a construction worker from Alagodu village in T. Narispur on March 13.

During interrogation, Mahesh, who is also married, confessed to having an illicit relationship with Rajamma. As she was bringing pressure on him to stay with her, Mahesh took her to the farmhouse, which his associate Soma, 34, was looking after, and allegedly murdered her.

The body was left in the farmhouse for two or three days before he returned with his associates Chowdaiah, 58, and Mahadeva, 50, to bury Rajamma’s dead body.

All the four accused were involved in the destruction of evidence and burial of Rajamma’s body, the police said.

To a question, Mr. Ryshyanth said the murder had taken place in the days soon after a complaint about her going missing was registered in Hanur on January 28.

The police had recovered an iron rod, which was the weapon used in the commission of the crime, besides mobile phones and the black-beaded necklace worn by Rajamma.

The accused were produced before a court, which has remanded Chowdaiah and Mahadeva to judicial custody while handing over the Mahesh and Soma to police custody for further interrogation.

Mr. Ryshyanth has complimented the police team for cracking the case.

159,2020/03/16,Mysuru SP frowns on false messages targeting Tibetans,"He says serious action will be taken against rumour-mongers

Coming down on social media posts asking people to stay away from Tibetans residing in the Bylakuppe settlement in Periyapatna, Superintendent of Police C.B. Ryshyanth warned that serious action will be taken against people spreading rumours on coronavirus.

Speaking to reporters in Mysuru on Sunday, Mr. Ryshyanth referred to the fake messages doing the rounds on WhatsApp asking people to stay away from Tibetans residing in Bylakuppe by claiming that they had come from the border of China and could be carriers of the coronavirus.

The message is fake as the Tibetans were residing in the colony in Bylakuppe since several decades. “The problem is that such fake messages are forwarded from one person to another,” he regretted.

He not only asked people to ignore such fake messages, but also threatened the persons indulging in the mischief of scaring people in the name of coronavirus with strong legal action.

Making it clear that there has not been a single positive case of coronavirus from anywhere in Mysuru district, the Superintendent of Police said there was no need for pressing the panic button.

A few people, who had returned from abroad, had been home quarantined, he said.

Meanwhile, the Mysuru District Health and Family Welfare Officer has lodged a complaint against another fake message that has gone viral on social media about a youth from T. Narsipur has tested positive.

In the complaint to the Superintendent of Police, the District Health and Family Welfare Officer has asked the authorities to take action to remove the post from social media platform and also take punitive action against the miscreants involved in such mischief.

It may be mentioned here that two people had been arrested by the Chamarajanagar police on Friday night for spreading false information that a man in Kabbali village in Gundlupet taluk and a girl from Nanjangud had tested positive for the disease.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysuru-sp-frowns-on-false-messages-targeting-tibetans/article31076716.ece

The bacterial infection that caused mass death of ducks in Kuttanad in recent days has been brought under control, according to the Animal Husbandry Department. Speaking to reporters here on Monday, officials said here on Monday that 4,830 ducks had perished in Champakulam, Kandankary and Thalavady.

“The situation has changed. We have brought the disease under control,”said an official.

Earlier, the duck farmers expressed dissatisfaction over conducting tests at the Avian Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at Thiruvalla. However, the officials said that the laboratory was well-equipped. The lab is the only one functioning directly under the control of the Animal Husbandry Department Director, said an official

Officials observed that several farmers were giving incorrect medical treatment to birds. “Farmers are administering high amounts of antibiotics in ducklings. Besides, ducks are not vaccinated on a regular basis,” said an official.

161,2020/03/16,Cinema industry takes a hit,"Shooting of films, digital entertainment suspended from March 19 to 31

The COVID-19 outbreak seems to have taken a heavy toll on the entertainment industry in the State.

The Indian Motion Picture Producers’ Association and other fraternal organisations, after a meeting in Mumbai on Sunday, decided to suspend the shooting of films, television and web series and other digital entertainment programmes from March 19 to 31 as a precautionary measure.

Resumption of shooting with new schedules is a daunting task. The decision, made as part of the industry’s commitment to complement the government efforts to contain the pandemic, would deepen the crisis in the industry.

Shows suspended

The suspension of shows in 650-odd cinema houses across the State has already rendered a blow to the industry. Construction of a number of cinema houses is progressing and most of them are set to be commissioned soon, taking the number of screens to about 750.

Online content

According to producer G. Suresh Kumar, a cinema with 100 seats would post a daily loss of ₹1 lakh and this would go up in the case of bigger halls. Also, six films that had registered reasonable returns in the past 30 days and were still drawing crowds may not sustain the same rate of collection once the shows are resumed.

Moreover, film producers now strike a deal with online content providers and secure their financial assistance for completing the projects. After releasing films, they are mandated to transfer the right of the films to the content companies. Once released on the online platforms, it would impact the turnout and collection in cinema halls.

In spite of such problems, the industry is committed to aiding the government’s efforts to contain the crisis, Mr. Kumar said.

Release deferred

The release of a slew of films slated for the month has been deferred and if the virus threat extends beyond March, it would affect the Vishu festival collection as well.

The industry is hopeful that the crisis may be contained before the festival season sets in. The government would have to provide due support to the exhibitors to disinfect and resume shows once the crisis blows over, film industry sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/iay4pt/article31090494.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17TVKIHEALTH-CORONAVIRUSINDIA-REVENUE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cinema-industry-takes-a-hit/article31085333.ece
162,2020/03/16,Curbs on foreign tourists in Kottayam,"Resorts asked to furnish travel details of foreign guests

As part of strengthening the preventive measures against the spread of COVID-19 in the district, the authorities have imposed strict regulations on the stay of foreigners in the various hotels and resorts in the district.

In a meeting convened here on Monday, District Collector P.K. Sudheer Babu directed the hotel and resort operators to furnish the travel details of their foreign guests over the past one month. Further, they were also asked to share the details of foreign guests who are currently staying at these locations on a daily basis.

Though no guests who had booked rooms in advance should be denied accommodation, a directive with regard to regulating the number of new bookings was also issued.

Quarantine

In view of the rising number of COVID-19 cases across the globe, foreigners should be quarantined in their rooms for two weeks. If anyone exhibited symptoms of the disease, the Corona Control Room should be alerted.

Foreign tourists have been also banned from roaming around their place of stay and from using the public transportation systems. The hotels have also been directed to arrange vehicles for their return journey to the airport.

The Health Department on Monday started a survey to collect details of the guests staying at the hotels and resorts. The survey teams, led by the Primary Health Centres concerned, also comprised police officials.

With the authorities suggesting home quarantine of 122 people in Kottayam, the number of persons under observation in their homes rose to 1,301 on Monday. Two persons, including a child who had come into direct contact with one of the COVID-19 patients, were admitted to special isolation ward at the Government Medical College Hospital.

Campaign launched

Earlier in the day, Food and Civil Supplies Minister P. Thilothaman inaugurated the district-level launch of the ‘Break the Chain’ campaign.

164,2020/03/16,Coronavirus pandemic leaves KSRTC reeling,"Daily revenue falls from ₹5.6 cr. to ₹2.8 cr. between March 10 and 15

COVID-19 is taking a toll on the crisis-ridden Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), which has seen a drastic drop in the number of passengers and daily revenue over the past one week.

Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran told media here on Monday that the daily average revenue per km had dropped from ₹38 on March 10 to ₹27.32 in a week. The daily revenue had fallen from ₹5.65 crore to ₹2.83 crore between March 10 and March 15. “On March 10, there were 26.14 lakh passengers. The next day, it became 23 lakh. On March 14, it went down to 16.38 lakh,” Mr. Saseendran said.

The Minister said the collection on March 11 was ₹5.03 crore. The next day, it fell to ₹4.41 crore. On March 13, the revenue was ₹4.15 crore. It has become difficult for the corporation to go ahead without government support, he said.

Mr. Saseendran said private bus operators too were facing a tough time. “Around 300 buses had to cut down on their services in Kozhikode on Sunday alone. The government will examine the possibility of extending the date to remit taxes,” he said. Asked about the KSRTC reducing its scheduled trips, the Minister said it might have happened because of the drop in the number of passengers.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ovqvk9/article31085306.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17tvwytransportminister,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-leaves-ksrtc-reeling/article31085280.ece
165,2020/03/16,Kerala school sets up bamboo garden housing 50 rare species,"Four-acre garden at Wayanad school houses 50 rare species, eight of them endemic

Many developments have left nature bruised and a school in Wayanad is doing its bit to restore it by setting up a bambusetum on its premises. The four-acre bambusetum (bamboo garden) at the Navodaya Adivasi Aided Upper Primary School at Manikavu houses 50 rare species of bamboos, eight of them endemic. Six come under the endangered category. For the endeavour, the school bagged the prestigious Vanamitra Award instituted by the Forest Department for 2019-20.

Begins in 2002

The project was initiated by the then headmaster P.V. Poulose in early 2002 by planting 26 species. Initially it was planned to conserve only the bamboo species of the Western Ghats. Later, many bamboo species were collected from across the country. The Meenangadi grama panchayat, which is venturing to be the first carbon-neutral grama panchayat in the country, has provided all support to the project through programmes such as Green Campus and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. The panchayat has spent ₹15 lakh on the conservatory, says P. Pavithran, biodiversity management committee convener, Meenangadi grama panchaya.

According to scientists at the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) here bamboos in the school garden can broadly be classified into three groups: those used for eco restoration, for making handicrafts, and bamboo with ornamental values. Species such as Ochlandra travancorica (common reed) and Bambusa bambusa (common bamboo) come under the first category. Bambusa gigantea (Aanamula) and Pencil oda belong to the second category, while species such as white dragon bamboo and golden bamboo are included in the last segment, they say.

Biodiversity register

“The MSSRF and Uravu, a non-governmental organisation, supplied us with bamboos and helped us prepare a School Biodiversity Register,” says C.K. Anil Kumar, headmaster, says.

The school takes every effort to conserve the bamboos and intends to add to the collection. The school also possesses a medicinal plant garden with 30 species of plants, an arboretum with 84 tree species, and a collection of 26 wild edible fruit conservatory.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/5xu34/article31088567.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16tvwychildrenunderbamboogovesone,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/reconnecting-with-nature-through-bamboos/article31085267.ece

Taking note of the rising number of deaths at psychiatric hospitals and rehabilitation centres, the Kottayam district administration has launched a probe into the episode.

According to officials, District Collector P.K. Sudheer Babu has directed the Drugs Control Department to probe the case and submit a report. The action followed a preliminary report submitted by District Medical Officer Jacob Varghese.

After the three deaths which were reported at the Puthujeevan Trust Hospital for Psychological Medicine and De-addiction, Changanassery, between February 23 and 28, five inmates at the Sanjeevani Psycho-social Rehabilitation Centre at Karukachal died between March 9 and 13.

More deaths

Similarly, three patients at the Jeevan Jyothi Ashram at Kurichi were reported dead between March 10 and 14. Further, around nine inmates from these centres have been shifted to Government Medical College Hospital, Kottayam, after their health condition deteriorated suddenly.

Though the exact reason is yet to be ascertained, preliminary assessment by medical experts pointed out the deteriorating health condition of these patients following the usage of a particular brand of anti-psychotic drug. Accordingly, the health officials have collected samples of the particular drug for an examination by the drugs control unit.

Considering the petition, Judge G. Gopakumar directed the bishop to stand trial in the case, registered by the Kuravilangad police on the basis of a complaint filed by a nun of the same diocese.

The petition, filed on January 25, sought to discharge the bishop by citing that the nun had fabricated a story out of her personal grudge to him. The prosecution, represented by special public prosecutor Jithesh J. Babu, filed an objection to it.

After hearing both sides, the court concluded that there was a case to frame charges against him. The court turned down the petitioner’s argument that the prosecution witnesses were not trustworthy and there was no cogent evidence against the accused.

The case will be taken up for further proceedings on March 24.

To move HC

As per the prosecution case, the bishop raped and forced the nun to unnatural sex on many occasions between 2014 and 2017.

The bishop has been arraigned as an accused in the case under Indian Penal Code Sections342 (wrongful confinement), 376(2)(k) (rape on a woman incapable of giving consent), 376(2)(n) (causing grievous bodily harm during rape), 376(c)(a) (sexual intercourse by person in authority) 377 (unnatural offence), and 506(1) (criminal intimidation).

Sources said counsel of the accused would now approach the High Court against the trial court order.

Meanwhile, the court is slated to consider two more petitions moved by the accused on the same date. While the first petition pertained to stopping the media from reporting the trial, the second one sought to initiate contempt of court proceedings against the prosecution and the media for publishing the records under the court’s consideration without permission.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rg7e7z/article31088471.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17TVFRANCOMULAKKAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/discharge-petition-by-bishop-dismissed/article31085236.ece
170,2020/03/16,Police vetting video of woman in IS camp,"She wants govt. to help her return home

The State police are examining a recent video purportedly by a Keralite woman who allegedly defected to the Islamic State (IS) in 2015 and now wants the government to help her return home from Afghanistan.

Officers say the woman in the video could be Nimisha Fathima, a resident of Thiruvananthapuram, who went missing along with her husband Isa, alias Bexin Vincent, in 2015. Nimisha is a trained dentist. The police believe that the couple converted to Islam, got radicalised, and travelled to Afghanistan to join the IS. She delivered of a baby in that country.

Arrested in 2019

Officers believe that an allied bombing killed her husband and the law enforcement agency in Khorasan province arrested her in 2019.

In the video, the woman appears seated on a sofa. She sports a headscarf and cradles a child on her lap. She speaks in English and says she would like to return home and hopes the government would not imprison her.

The possibility that Nimisha might be alive first surfaced in 2019 when the National Investigation Agency (NIA) called on her mother, Bindu Sampath, and showed her a set of photographs of foreign fighters and their families in the custody of the Afghanistan government.

Mother seeks help

Ms. Sampath told journalists here on Monday that the woman in the video is her daughter and that she would move the Central government to ensure Nimisha’s return. “I am seeing my daughter alive for the first time after she left me,” she said.

Officials said Nimisha could face formidable legal hurdles to return to civilian life in the country. The NIA is investigating her on charges of violating the provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Indian Passport Act. Moreover, security agencies are wary of allowing former IS members into society out of fear that they could radicalise others.

The police say Central agencies have flagged the possibility that Sonia Sebastian, 33, alias Ayisha, a resident of Kasaragod who joined the IS along with her husband in 2014, could be with Nimisha. They were among several Malayalees who left Kerala in groups to join the IS in Syria and Afghanistan during 2014-16.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/police-vetting-video-of-woman-in-is-camp/article31085227.ece
171,2020/03/16,"Three more test positive, COVID-19 cases rise to 24 in State","Strictly adhere to quarantine norms and don’t treat foreign tourists with hostility, says Chief Minister

Three more people tested positive for COVID-19 in the State on Monday. Two of them are in Malappuram and one in Kasaragod. With this, the total number of COVID-19 patients in the State rose to 24.

Of the three, two are from Dubai and one from Saudi Arabia. They had been put on home quarantine on their arrival itself, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said.

With Keralites arriving in hordes from all over the world, the number of people under surveillance has been going up steadily. On Monday, 1,815 more people went into home quarantine, while another 72 were admitted to isolation wards in hospitals. The total number of those in home quarantine now is 12,470, while those isolated in hospitals is 270.

Helping foreigners

Briefing mediapersons after an all-party meeting held to discuss the COVID-19 situation, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan reiterated that tourism was very important for the State and that while Kerala was in for a long engagement with COVID-19, people should not give a bad impression about the State by treating foreign tourists with hostility.

He expressed concern that the COVID-19 containment efforts of the Health Department were being derailed by people who refused to observe home quarantine properly, in the process endangering more in the community.

He said more staff were being deployed and more counters were being opened at airports to ease the immigration process so that there was less crowding in airports.

He appealed to all religious places of worship to take all efforts to ensure that there was no crowding. No more than 100 persons should gather for weddings.

Junior medical students (first and second year MBBS) would be granted holiday as they have no role in clinical care.

The government has asked for the entire list of hospitals which are non-functioning in the State to create quarantine facilities.

Councillors quarantined

Six councillors of the Kozhikode Corporation have been advised to remain in home quarantine for the next 14 days after they flew back from Dubai on Friday after cutting short a visit to the Gulf. The CPI(M) councillors who had left for Dubai on invitation from friends and relatives on March 7 were scheduled to return on March 15.

The Health Department has launched a help desk at Kuttanellur, near Thrissur, since it has been confirmed that a British tourist who tested positive for COVID-19 had attended the Kuttanellur temple festival on March 8.

It was on the appeals filed by the State government and the mother of the young girls against the trial court’s judgment that the High Court issued the order on Monday.

173,2020/03/16,COVID-positive British tourist had attended Pooram,"Health Department sets up help desk at Kuttanellur to clear people’s doubts on the virus

The Health Department has launched a help desk at Kuttanellur, near here, since it has been confirmed that a British tourist who tested positive for COVID-19 had attended the Kuttanellur temple festival on March 8. The help desk is aimed at clearing people’s doubts.

It is reported that a 19-member tourist team, of which the COVID-19-positive person was a part, had danced to percussion ensembles and taken selfies with the local people at the festival. Health officials have asked people who mingled closely with the tourists to report at the control room.

Route map

More help desks have been opened at the KSRTC stand and the railway station at Irinjalakuda. The district administration is preparing the route map of the British tourists and taking precautionary measures. “People need not panic, but should take sufficient precautions,” officials said.

Before attending the festival, the team visited the Paramekkavu temple, though they did not go inside the temple.

It was the security guard at Paramekkavu temple who told them about the Kuttanellur Pooram when they asked him whether any pooram was on in the vicinity. They watched the percussion ensemble led by Peruvanam Kuttan Marar and took selfies with some local people. Many have posted videos of the tourists enjoying the pooram on social media. The Health Department is checking all these.

The tourists also visited Athirappilly and Cheruthuruthy. The Health Department has already asked the resort in which they stayed in Cheruthuruthy to close down. Around 60 people, including those who stayed in the resort and the resort workers, are under observation. The team had food from Athirappilly. The Health officials closed a bar hotel at Poovathingal, near Athirappilly, as part of security measures.

In all, 2,425 people are under observation in connection with COVID-19 preventive measures. Of them, 45 are in various hospitals. Officials say that many people who have returned from abroad refuse to maintain guidelines of home quarantine. Police help had to be taken in some cases.

Railway stations

Surveillance is continuing at railway stations. In all, 1,230 people who came from Bengaluru, Gujarat and Mumbai, have been asked to remain in home quarantine.

174,2020/03/16,Kerala for lesser crowds at places of worship to curb infection,"Series of steps to strengthen screening in four airports in the State

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday stressed the need for social distancing at places of worship to prevent the possible peer-to-peer spread of COVID-19 infection.

He urged religious leaders and managements of places of worship to take a call on the matter to prevent the outbreak from overwhelming the State and its finite health-care resources. He said in many countries people answered the muezzin’s call for worship by praying in their own houses.

Consensus

Ideally, management of churches, mosques and temples should reach a consensus and decide against allowing huge congregations. They should stick to rituals alone. The government was constrained to restrict the number at weddings to 100 for the time being, he said.

He said the government had extended the last date for applying for welfare pensions by three months to prevent queues at village offices.

He advised migrant workers from crowding at public places for work till the government decided the threat of pestilence receded. The government would request the High Court to instruct family courts to restrict trials to urgent cases alone.

Airports

The Chief Minister suggested a series of steps to strengthen the screening of passengers arriving and leaving through the four international airports of the State.

In a videoconferencing with the Directors of the Thiruvananthapuram, Cochin, Kannur and Kozhikode airports, he asked them to ensure that all domestic passengers and those proceeding abroad were screened.

Steps would have to be taken to ensure the speedy screening of the passengers. More counters should be set up and more personnel should be posted. The government would extend support for creating the facilities.

The airport Directors were asked to look into opening more emigration and customs counters for faster clearance of the flyers and to avoid queues. It should be ensured that there was no crowd in the airports. Relatives coming in large numbers to receive and see off the flyers should be discouraged.

Those showing symptoms of COVID-19 should be transferred from the airport in ambulance to hospital. Those without symptoms and returning after foreign travel should be kept in isolation at home. Their details should be forwarded to the Health Department Cell. They should be sent home under the supervision of the police.

The Chief Minister said more ambulances would be made available in the four airports.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/qx6cvz/article31090553.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17tvmpm-SFI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-for-lesser-crowds-at-places-of-worship-to-curb-infection/article31085169.ece

176,2020/03/16,Earn While You Learn from next year,"College students can take up part-time jobs for a maximum of 90 days a year

The government has framed guidelines for its ambitious Earn While You Learn (EWYL) scheme and expedited steps to implement it from next academic year. The parallel efforts being made to advance class hours in colleges will enable students to pursue internship and part-time jobs.

The scheme enables students in the 18-25 age group to earn honorariums through part-time employment. The Labour and Skills Department has been designated as the nodal agency.

The scheme will facilitate part-time employment in government departments, local self-government institutions, public and private enterprises, and other organisations. The students will be permitted to work for a maximum of 90 days a year. Besides, government institutions can earmark 15% of the funds under the salary head to provide honorarium to students.

According to official sources consultations scheduled to be begin next week with various stakeholders on adjusting class hours from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. (in place of the current 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.) are expected to provide an impetus to the implementation of the EWYL scheme.

“The proposed timings will enable students to seek part-time employment without affecting their academic pursuits. The government has received favourable response from all quarters. We hope to rectify the possible inadequacies that could arise subsequently,” says an official.

Multiple benefits

Officials of the Kerala State Higher Education Council, which has proposed the guidelines, point out that the endeavour could garner multiple benefits beyond imparting skills of employability to the beneficiaries. It is expected to go a long way in supporting those hailing from economically backward sections.

It could benefit at least 3.28 lakh students of 229 government and aided arts and science colleges affiliated to Kerala, Mahatma Gandhi, Calicut and Kannur universities and nearly 51,000 students of 179 engineering colleges in the State, sources say.

The council has recommended the need to design career-oriented supplementary courses and recognise work experience as part of academic assessment. It has also mooted steps to foster industry-university linkages.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/earn-while-you-learn-from-next-year/article31083489.ece
177,2020/03/16,Ranni limps back to normalcy,"Shops reopen as more samples test negative for COVID-19

With more and more throat swab and blood samples collected from quarantined people testing negative, Ranni, the epicentre of the second spell of COVID-19 outbreak in the State, is limping back to normalcy.

It was on March 8 that news came out about three from Aythala in Ranni, who returned from Italy, and two of their neighbours testing positive for COVID-19.

The three who returned from Italy reportedly slipped the surveillance at the Kochi airport to reach their home at Aythala on February 29. They, along with two of their kin at Aythala, were admitted to the isolation ward of Pathanamthitta General Hospital with symptoms of COVID-19 on March 6. All the five tested positive for the virus infection on March 8.

The Health Department swung into action and identified a large number of

people in and around Ranni who came into contact with the affected people. All of them were quarantined, either at hospitals or at their homes, for 14 to 28 days as part of the intensive disease-prevention drive.

The entire Ranni town, a vibrant market for hill produce in the district, came to a standstill with shops and other business establishments in the town downing shutters and vehicles keeping off the road.

Even the State Bank of India branch at Thottamon in Ranni where they visited twice was closed down.

Now, after more than 10 days since their hospitalisation, their condition has been stable and they are fast recovering from disease. Moreover, clinical test results of the throat swab and blood samples collected from primary and secondary contacts of these people have been negative, infusing confidence among the villagers, who were facing some sort of alienation from the rest of the State.

Vehicles too started plying in Ranni town since Saturday. Though there is a visible slump in business, shops and markets too were found open on Monday.

Autorickshaw stands too turned active in the town and on the Aythala Road.

“The situation was not like this a week ago when people outside Ranni

were reluctant to board buses coming from Ranni. But that situation has changed for the better,” says Anilkumar, a building contractor from Kattoor, near Ranni.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ranni-limps-back-to-normalcy/article31083471.ece
178,2020/03/16,Tough times for foreign tourists,"Many find it hard to find a place to stay or use public transport

With the State on high alert in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak, foreign tourists visiting God’s Own Country are finding it difficult to get accommodation and move around, prompting the government to disapprove of such acts and asking people not to see every foreigner as a SARS-nCoV2 carrier.

Amid the stepped-up preventive measures, several cases of foreigners being ‘denied’ travel in public transport systems and stay in hotels have been reported in the past few days from various parts of the State.

Cautioning against such acts, Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran described overseas visitors as “our friends” and “guests” and called for a change of mindset of some people who allegedly treated them as carriers of the virus.

On Sunday, authorities were forced to shift two foreign nationals to a quarantine facility at a government hospital in nearby Pala after their co-passengers in a State-owned transport corporation bus raised an alarm.

The two from Spain were travelling in the bus when the police stopped it at Kuravilangad after co-passengers said they could not travel with them due to the virus threat. Though the two were advised to remain in quarantine for 14 days, they were allegedly denied stay in a hotel or lodge in the area.

A foreign tourist visiting the scenic Wagamon hill station bordering Kottayam and Idukki district allegedly slept in the cemetery of a church after he was denied lodging facility due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

People visiting the church for attending the Sunday morning mass reportedly saw the tourist coming out of the cemetery. However, he could not be traced despite a search being launched, the police said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tough-times-for-foreign-tourists/article31083360.ece
179,2020/03/16,Norton’s Bungalow in Alappuzha crumbling,"Conservation plan runs into rough weather

By the side of Jubilee Road near Dutch Square lies a 200-year-old structure with great historical significance.

The two-storey Norton Bungalow (Mission Bungalow), the residence of Thomas Norton — the first Church Mission Society (CMS) missionary in Travancore — is today a sorry sight and in danger of crumbling.

A plan to conserve Norton Bungalow and turn it into a museum under the Alappuzha Heritage project has run into rough weather due to stiff opposition from a section of Church of South India (CSI) members. Thomas Norton, his wife and two-year-old son sailed from Plymouth in England and reached Kochi in May 1816. He later moved to Alappuzha and established a church there.

₹3.25-cr. project

The ₹3.25-crore project was proposed as a joint initiative of the State government and the CSI Madhya Kerala Diocese.

“A memorandum of understanding (MoU) has been signed with the Church to transform the structure into a missionary museum. From the government side, we have prepared a detailed project report and awarded the work to a contractor several months ago. But, things have come to a standstill after CSI authorities asked us to halt the process,” says P.M. Noushad, managing director, Muziris Spice Route Heritage Project.

Lack of consensus

CSI authorities say that there is a lack of consensus among its members.

“There is a lack of support for the project, especially from members of the local church. We have already informed the government of the situation. Although a final decision is pending, it is unlikely the project will get the necessary endorsement,” says Simon John, lay secretary, CSI Madhya Kerala Diocese.

Mr. John admits that the structure is in a dilapidated state and something should be done before the southwest monsoon sets in to protect it. “A subcommittee has been constituted to look into the matter,” he says.

The property was donated to the CMS by Rani Gowri Parvathi Bayi, the then Regent of Travancore in the 19th century.

Earlier, the bungalow was given to the National Cadet Corps on lease and it failed to vacate the place after using it for 40 years.

This led to a long-drawn legal battle, with the court ruling in favour of the Church in 2016.

MoU

As per the MoU, the government will renovate the bungalow. Both the government and the Church will jointly run the museum for 20 years.

A member of the Church will be appointed manager. The entire property will remain with the Church.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/55ryb2/article31088307.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15alsam1--nortoGRR78HGD04jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nortons-bungalow-crumbling/article31082733.ece

The State police are examining a recent video purportedly by a Keralite woman who had allegedly gone to Afghanistan to join the Islamic State in 2015 and now wanted the government to help her return home.

Officials said the woman in the video could be Nimisha Fathima, a resident of Thiruvananthapuram, who had gone missing along with her husband Isa alias Bexin Vincent, from Kerala in 2015.

Fathima is a trained dentist. The police believe that the couple had converted to Islam, got radicalised and travelled to Afghanistan to join the IS. She had given birth to a child in that country.

Officials believed that an allied bombing killed Vincent and the law enforcement in Khorasan province had arrested Fathima in 2019.

In the video, the woman appeared seated on a sofa, sporting a headscarf and with a child on her lap. She spoke in English and said she would like to return home and hoped the government would not imprison her.

The possibility that Fathima might be alive had first surfaced in 2019 when the National Investigation Agency (NIA) called on her mother, Bindu Sampath, and showed her a set of photographs of foreign fighters and their families in the custody of the Afghanistan government.

Ms. Sampath told journalists here on Monday that the woman in the video was her daughter. She said she would move the Central government to ensure Fathima’s return. ‘I am seeing my daughter alive for the first time after she left me,” she said.

Legal hurdles

Officials said Fathima could face formidable legal hurdles to return to civilian life in the country.

The NIA is investigating her on charges of violating the provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and the Indian Passport Act. Moreover, security agencies are wary of allowing former IS members into society out of fear that they could radicalise others.

The police said that Central agencies had flagged the possibility that Sonia Sebastian, 33, alias Ayisha, a resident of Kasargod, who had joined the IS along with her husband in 2014, could be with Fathima.

Officials said that Fathima and Sonia were among several Keralites who had left in groups to join the IS in Syria and Afghanistan during the 2014-16 period.

Online mobilisers of the IS appeared to have convincingly sold them the allure of living in an idealistic Islamic State-run caliphate.

181,2020/03/16,Bishop Franco Mulakkal’s discharge petition dismissed,"Judge G. Gopakumar directed the Bishop to face trial in the case.

In a major set back to Bishop Franco Mulakkal, former head of the Latin Catholic Diocese of Jalandhar, the Additional District and Sessions Court I, Kottayam on Monday dismissed a petition seeking to discharge him from the nun rape case.

Considering the petition, judge G. Gopakumar directed the bishop to face trial in the case, registered by the Kuravilangad police on the basis of a complaint filed by a Catholic nun of the same diocese.

The petition, filed on January 25 when the court was about to commence a preliminary hearing on the case, sought to discharge the Bishop without even stepping into the hearing as the nun had fabricated a story out of her personal grudge to him. After hearing both sides, the court, however, observed that all the charges against the accused in the charge sheet will remain.

The court also turned down the petitioner's argument that the prosecution witnesses were not trustworthy and there was no cogent evidence against the accused. Accordingly, the case will be taken up for further proceedings on March 24.

Meanwhile, the court is slated to consider two more petitions moved by the accused on the same date. While the first petition pertained to banning the media from reporting about the case and its trial, the second one sought to initiate contempt of court proceedings against the prosecution and the media for publishing the records under the court’s consideration without permission.

After disposing off the petitions, the court is slated to conduct a preliminary hearing and freae the charges accordingly. The accused will have to turn up in the court for every posting, but can request for exemption in exceptional conditions.

182,2020/03/16,SC approves Kerala slotting construction in orange category,"Declines to interfere in appeal filed by CREDAI against NGT

The Supreme Court has declined to interfere in an appeal filed by the Kerala chapter of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI) against the National Green Tribunal’s rejection of its contention that the inclusion of constructions between 2,000 sq.m and 20,000 sq.m in the ‘orange category’ by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board was arbitrary.

A Bench, led by Justice Arun Mishra, allowed the CREDAI’s Kerala chapter, represented by senior advocate V. Giri, to withdraw the appeal on March 6, 2020. The State Pollution Control Board was represented by advocates Jogy Scaria and Beena Victor.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) slotted industrial activities into the red, orange, green and white categories, based on the pollution index, in March 2016. The very next year, the State Pollution Control Board, in pursuance of the CPCB’s direction and the report of an expert committee, brought flats, apartments and commercial buildings — spanning over 2,000 sq.m, but less than 20,000 sq.m — under the orange category.

The CREDAI successfully challenged the State Pollution Control Board’s circular before the Appellate Authority on the ground that residential constructions did not fall in the category of industry. The State Pollution Control Board had argued that it was authorised to impose stringent conditions to prevent environmental degradation and pollution. It had said it merely exercised its powers under the directions of the CPCB and the Environment (Protection) Rules. But the circular did not find favour with the Appellate Authority.

The State Pollution Control Board then appealed before the NGT, which set aside the Appellate Authority’s decision and held that these stringent conditions were required on account of higher groundwater level and contamination of waterbodies and the groundwater.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sc-approves-kerala-slotting-construction-in-orange-category/article31078546.ece

However, “Board exams for Class 10, 11 and 12 and examinations in colleges and practical examinations and entrance examinations would be held as scheduled. Until the exams are completed, hostels for students and residential schools would continue to function,” an official release said. Government offices, medical and related educational institutions would function as usual.

After chairing a review meeting in the Secretariat in the evening, Mr. Palaniswami ordered the closure of all sports stadiums, clubs, bars (including those run by TASMAC) till March 31.

No major congregations, processions, public meetings, summer camps, conferences, seminars, commercial exhibitions, cultural events and sports meet would be permitted till the month end.

Resorts, which have to remain closed during the period, cannot accept any advance booking from guests till then.

The Chief Minister appealed to the people to avoid thronging temples, churches, mosques and other places of worships and going on tours. Marriage halls must not be rented out for any fresh ceremonies and at already planned events the gathering must be sparse.

Quarantine facilities near airport, Helpline

The Chief Minister said that as far as possible facilities would be established near the international airports in Chennai, Coimbatore, Tiruchi and Madurai to quarantine Indians if they return from 14 countries from where arrival of foreigners has been banned by the Indian Government.

The government also said that 24-hour helpline can be accessed on the phone numbers 104, 044-29510400, 044-29510500, 9444340496 and 8754448477.

The government warned that those spreading false information or causing unwarranted panic over COVID-19 either in the form of news or on social media or any other form would be prosecuted under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code and Disaster Management Act, 2005.

Anganwadi centres would also be closed in Tamil Nadu till March 31 but dry rations for children in these anganwadis would be handed over to their parents.

“Other than those mentioned, all other essential and necessary activities would continue normally,” the release specified.

Noting that many private companies have given work-from-home options for their employees and since educational institutions would be closed, the Chief Minister said the people should not use the opportunity to go on tours or picnics.

Asked if the government would urge private companies to offer ‘work from home option’ to employees, a senior official said it was for the respective establishments to decide depending on the nature of work. “Since the option would not be feasible for companies into manufacturing and other sectors, it is up to them,” he said.

“Health experts are advising against gathering in large numbers in social functions and events. I request the general public to follow the advice,” he said.

Mr Palaniswami instructed officials in health, transport, police and respective district administration officials in border districts to organise screening equipment to screen passengers with thermal scanners at toll plazas.

He also wrote to the Railway Minister to advice the General Manager of Southern Railway to ensure cleaning of railway coaches and premises. He instructed the Commissioner of Revenue Administration (CRA) to ensure screening and precautionary measures in all border districts to check spread of the pandemic from neighbouring states. Places with central air conditioning are to be cleaned at least once a week.

184,2020/03/16,CAA: Minister hints that government is not inclined towards all-party meet,"Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar said in the Legislative Assembly that Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had promised to safeguard the interests of the minorities

The AIADMK government is not inclined to hold an all-party meeting on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar indicated in the Legislative Assembly on Monday.

Replying to DMK president and Leader of the Opposition M.K. Stalin, who urged the State government to call for an all-party meeting to discuss the issue, Mr. Udhayakumar said several litigations were pending before the Supreme Court challenging the CAA. Besides, Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, responding to queries raised by the Opposition leaders, had promised to safeguard the interests of the minorities. “Hence, we have to think whether we should have an all-party meeting on the same subject, which has been debated in the House,” Mr. Udhayakumar said. The CAA, NPR and NRC were “sensitive issues” and the Chief Minister has been taking steps to allay the apprehensions of the minorities, he added.

Earlier, soon after the Question Hour in the House, Mr. Stalin referred to a meeting convened by the Chief Secretary and senior bureaucrats and police officers with representatives from various Muslim organisations on March 14 and sought to know further details of the meeting. Mr. Stalin wanted to know the demands made by the representatives and the response given by the State government. He argued that the CAA was not affecting only Muslims but the people, as a whole. He urged the government to convene an all-party meeting to discuss about it.

In his reply, Mr. Udhayakumar said representatives from 49 Muslim organisations participated in the meeting convened by the Chief Secretary in which the Home Secretary, Director General of Police and Chennai Police Commissioner also attended.

Mr. Udhayakumar cited the statements made by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in the Rajya Sabha that no document was to be submitted during the NPR enumeration.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/qgvyg7/article31082325.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16FEBTH--UDHAYKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/caa-minister-hints-that-government-is-not-inclined-towards-all-party-meet/article31082327.ece

Attempting to allay apprehensions raised by the DMK over the spread of COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu, the ruling AIADMK government on Monday reiterated that the situation was “under control” and there was no need to panic.

However, the DMK urged the Chief Minister to hold video conference meetings with his counterparts in neighbouring States.

Replying to the concerns raised by DMK Deputy Floor Leader Duraimurugan in the House, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar listed the efforts taken by the State government as precautionary measures. Certain restrictive actions against non-essential establishments, such as cinema halls and shopping malls have been effected in border districts, he said.

Raising the issue in the Zero Hour, Mr. Duraimurugan said the general public had fears over the spread of the virus and referred to Legislative Assemblies in Kerala and Odisha, which adjourned their proceedings due to its threat. He further urged the CM to hold video conference meetings with his counterparts in neighbouring States over the issue.

Replying, Mr. Vijayabaskar said the CM has ordered the sanction of ₹60 crore for screening and precautionary measures across the State. He underlined the importance of washing hands by people.

186,2020/03/16,Speaker of Tamil Nadu Assembly reprimands DMK MLA,"S. Austin was reprimanded for interrupting Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami in the House

Speaker of the State Legislative Assembly P. Dhanapal on Monday reprimanded DMK legislator S. Austin (Kanyakumari) for interrupting Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami in the House. Though the Chair ordered the eviction of the DMK MLA, the decision was eventually put on hold.

Mr. Austin was seen attempting to interrupt Mr. Palaniswami, who was criticising the DMK for making tall promises for winning elections. A visibly angry Chief Minster asked the Speaker not to allow such interruptions any more.

“When the Leader of the Opposition made his remarks, we patiently listened to him. But when I attempt to speak, you interrupt me. You should remember which party gave you identity. If not for the AIADMK, you would not have an address now,” an agitated Mr. Palaniswami said, leading to ruling party members making angry gestures against the DMK MLA.

While the Speaker warned Mr. Austin against his actions, Leader of the House and AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam insisted on action against the legislator, contending that Mr. Austin had been given warnings several times but in vain. He went on to urge the Chair to evict Mr. Austin from the House.

Though the Speaker ordered the eviction of the DMK MLA, the debate between the CM and DMK president and Leader of the Opposition M.K. Stalin continued.

Meanwhile, House marshals entered the House to evict the MLA but his party colleagues raised their voices to prevent them.

Later, DMK Deputy Floor Leader Duraimurugan appealed to the Chair to drop the action against Mr. Austin. Eventually, Mr. Panneerselvam proposed dropping the action against the DMK MLA, which was accepted by the Speaker. However, the Chair warned the DMK MLA against such actions in the future.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/speaker-of-tamil-nadu-assembly-reprimands-dmk-mla/article31082050.ece

She wanted to know if her cousin, who will be arriving from the U.S., should advance her journey to accommodate the 14-day quarantine period. To this, Mr. Vijayabaskar replied, “Madam, We anticipate things will settle before 10th April, hence your cousin may not be required to prepone her trip.”

When asked if he believed that things would take a turn for the better in less than a month, the Minister told The Hindu that the woman had asked a question concerning someone travelling from the United States. “The U.S. is not on the home quarantine list the Central government had given us. So, I told her that the situation could change. Any crisis will not sustain. Even in China, the situation has improved. The idea is not [to] create panic,” he said.

The State government should not confine dialogue on issues pertaining to the CAA, the NRC and the NPR to representatives of Muslim organisations, and should expand its consultations instead, the State Platform for Common School System-T.N. said on Sunday.

Against the backdrop of the Chief Secretary holding talks with Muslim leaders, the organisation’s general secretary P.B. Prince Gajendra Babu said the government had not responded to a memorandum on the same issue last month.

“It is a welcome decision to invite people and have a dialogue for allaying their fears. But, it is disturbing when the government is confining the issue to a particular religion. Government of a State, functioning under a secular Constitution, is not expected to invite leaders of a particular religion alone ignoring the representations of various organisations as the issue is not confined to the people following a particular faith,” Mr Babu said in a release.

There could not be a bureaucratic answer to a political question, he said and added that the Chief Secretary, along with the DGP, meeting the leaders of a particular religion, raises a serious doubt whether the issue was being seen by the government as a law and order problem.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-government-must-not-confine-dialogue-on-caa-to-muslims/article31078736.ece
191,2020/03/16,The Hindu launches book on Swami Vivekananda,"Swami Gautamananda lauds The Hindu Group for the initiative

Sri Ramakrishna Math President Swami Gautamananda on Sunday launched a book titled ‘The Monk who took India to the World’ on Swami Vivekananda brought out by The Hindu Group of Publications.

Speaking on the occasion, he said the first biography on Swami Vivekananda was brought out in 1933 after which more and more materials have been brought out by various persons, including Mary Louis and Prof. Shankari Prasad Basu.

“I am glad that The Hindu Group has brought out this book. I feel anybody associated with Swami Vivekananda and his message is doing great national and international work,” Swami Gautamananda said. He also hoped that The Hindu Group would bring out similar books on Swami Ramakrishna and Mother Sarada Devi.

N. Ravi, Publisher, The Hindu Group, said that more than a century has gone — 117 years to be exact — since the passing of Swami Vivekananda, yet his message of oneness of religions, tolerance and concern for the common people remain as relevant today as during his time.

During the period when Swami Vivekananda strode on the Indian nationalist stage, The Hindu reported extensively on his travels, lectures and his call to the people on what Swami Gautamanandaji describes in his message published in the book as “man making” and “nation building,” he said.

Malini Parthasarathy, Co-Chair, The Hindu Group, said in the foreword, “One of India’s greatest leaders and a timelessly stellar example of Hinduism’s fundamentally universalist essence is Swami Vivekananda whose rich life continues to fire our imaginations and uplift our collective consciousness.”

Transcripts of his addresses at the Parliament of Religions including the famous opening address that began with the words, “Sisters and brothers of America” are included in the volume priced at ₹399.

There is an interview done on February 6, 1897 with a correspondent on the train from Chingleput to Madras on religion and ritual in daily life. The book touches upon the life and travels of Swami Vivekananda, his erudition, his essential message of the universal acceptance of all religions, compassion, call for service to the poor and the disadvantaged as reported in The Hindu.

Swami Vimurtananda, Manager, Ramakrishna Math, Chennai; Swami Dayatmananda, formerly of Vedanta Society, London; K.N. Ramaswamy, Director, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Chennai Kendra and L.V. Navaneeth, CEO, The Hindu Group, were also present during the launch.

Donations to UHET

STARS Alumni Association donated ₹1.30 lakh to the Universal Higher Education Trust (UHET), which provides scholarships to poor rural students for their higher education.

Likewise, headmasters of schools in Vellore district contributed ₹50,000 to the trust. The cheques were handed over to VIT Chancellor G. Viswanathan.

According to the release, STARS is an initiative which aims to provide opportunities to the underprivileged rural students to pursue higher education. Every year since its inception in 2008, 62 students have been chosen from rural Tamil Nadu, each one a topper in the higher secondary examinations conducted by the State in their respective districts.

199,2020/03/16,No need to panic about coronavirus: T.N. Health Minister,"‘Sole patient in Chennai will be discharged today’

Additional precautionary measures have been taken in Tamil Nadu in view of the large number of COVID-19 cases that have been reported in neighbouring Kerala, and people need not panic, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said in Tiruchi on Sunday.

The Minister said there had been no additional cases in the State other than the one reported in Chennai. “The patient who tested positive and [was] admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital in Chennai will be discharged tomorrow (Monday) as he is recovering well,” he said.

“The four patients that were admitted to the isolation ward in Tiruchi are currently asymptomatic and are only under observation,” Mr. Vijayabaskar told reporters after carrying out a surprise inspection of the isolation wards at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) along with District Collector S. Sivarasu.

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had provided a detailed protocol to be followed by all government hospitals, and MGMGH was complying with the same, he said.

Mr. Vijayabaskar said that with the addition of the Tirunelveli Medical College on Saturday, Tamil Nadu now had four testing facilities for SARS-CoV-2.

""There will soon be four more facilities, including one at the Madras Medical College, to carry out the tests,” he said.

He said private hospitals were coming forward to set up isolation wards for COVID-19. “The deans of government hospitals and a microbiologist will be asked to inspect the isolation wards at the private hospitals and give their approval before these hospitals can begin admitting patients,” the Minister added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/bbi8l5/article31078762.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16HEALTH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/no-need-to-panic-about-coronavirus-health-minister/article31077239.ece
200,2020/03/16,Rajinikanth is not backtracking on his stated political objective: Tamilaruvi Manian,"He wants to draw a line between party and govt.: Gandhiya Makkal Iyakkam chief

Superstar Rajinikanth has left many wondering if he will indeed take the political plunge by stating that he wants to see a resurgence among the people first. However, Gandhiya Makkal Iyakkam founder Tamilaruvi Manian, considered to be a key political advisor of the actor, insists that Mr. Rajinikanth is not rowing back on his stated objective. Excerpts:

What do we make of Mr. Rajinikanth’s announcement that he will project someone else as the Chief Ministerial candidate of his proposed party?

It reflects his individuality. When leaders who don’t have even 1% vote base claim they will become the CM, it is a matter of pride that Mr. Rajinikanth, who enjoys the goodwill of the people and the support of lakhs of fans, has said he is not interested in the CM’s chair.

Kamaraj is still seen as a model politician because he quit Chief Ministership to carry out party work. Gandhi’s greatness lies in not having become the Prime Minister. Jayaprakash Narayan proclaimed total revolution but did not head the Janata government.

These leaders rejected positions which came their way. Mr. Rajinikanth has not even started a party...

Mr. Rajinikanth will also be getting the opportunity to become the Chief Minister. If he enters the political arena, a lot of people are willing to join hands with him. They know that he is the winning horse. The ruling AIADMK is a house of cards that will collapse after its tenure. The DMK’s vote bank is between 20 and 25%. It is supporting the minorities only to consolidate the 13% vote bank they represent.

But he seems to be in doubt about his political objective…

He is not backtracking. He is going to launch a party and tour the State to meet the people. He wants to draw a line between the party and the government. It is a healthy trend. He has clarified that the government will implement what the party conceives, and that the CM is just a CEO. He will be monitoring the government.

Isn’t this akin to enjoying power without responsibility?

I raised the issue with him. He could be accused of functioning as an extra-constitutional authority like Sanjay Gandhi. But he made it clear that he would not interfere with the government’s functioning.

But shouldn’t he be holding the reins of the government?

I agree. When I met him three years ago, he said it was not in his blood to be CM. He wants to make an honest, talented and efficient leader the Chief Minister.

He is consistent in his stand. He told me that he did not want to have his portraits adorning Fort St. George. He is particular about making way for new talent and changing the polluted political atmosphere.

What’s the guarantee that his chosen CM candidate won’t be corrupt?

It will not happen if we have a charismatic leader. CM Edappadi K. Palaniswami could resist Sasikala. O. Panneerselvam held the CM’s office two times under the watchful eyes of Jayalalithaa. A CM or a Minister cannot go against a charismatic party leader.

There is no sign of him launching the party…

He will soon launch it. He is not in a hurry and is not interested in offering false promises. He wants to pursue value-based politics. He argues that if he senses that the people will stand by him, he will take the plunge.

But he expects people to show resurgence…

This question does indeed arise. A leader should play his role. The masses will not mobilise of their own accord for political change. He says the Dravidian parties have exploited the State for the last 50 years and the people should revolt against them. He wonders why they have not expressed their anger. His argument is that the first voice of revolt should come from those affected, and then he could come in and deliver.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sovcth/article31077235.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16TAMILARUVIMANIAN2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rajinikanth-is-not-backtracking-on-his-stated-political-objective/article31077236.ece
201,2020/03/16,Industries seek measures to offset impact,"‘Important for govt. to boost market sentiment’

Industries have sought measures like deferment of tax and loan payments, concessional power tariffs and relaxation of NPA norms and time frames for board meetings in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.

“The industry slowdown, coupled with COVID-19, has led to a challenging situation for all businesses. It is important for the government to boost market sentiment through a slew of measures so that the industry does not cut capacity utilisation, resulting in job cuts. It is important now to save jobs,” Hari K. Thiagarajan, chairman, CII Tamil Nadu State Council, told The Hindu. He sought duty exemption for products imported from China, including dyes and chemicals, non-woven material, resins used in the plastic industry and automotive components, which will help the textile and manufacturing sectors.

Mr. Thiagarajan said 40% of yarn exports from India went to China, which was a major destination. “We request the government to provide 5-6% as return on state taxes and levies, which is nil now. This will boost yarn exports to various markets,” he said.

Mr. Thiagarajan requested the Tamil Nadu government to provide a concession in power tariff of ₹1-2 per unit and the banks to offer a moratorium on repayment of the principal amount.

“A lot of loans are coming up for repayment in the fourth quarter [January-March]. We request a moratorium on this to be granted till the first quarter as many expect it will take 4-5 months for things to settle down. Also, banks should provide working capital, which is very much needed,” he added.

Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, president, Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the spread of COVID-19 was leading to shrinkage of exports, cessation of production, non-availability of particular imports and slowdown in consumption, among other issues. “Extraordinary circumstances demand extraordinary measures,” he said. The MCCI sought deferment of due date for payment of GST for March 2020.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/industries-seek-measures-to-offset-impact/article31077223.ece
202,2020/03/16,"Why did AIADMK vote for CAB, woman asks Ministers","‘Had ruling party not done so, the issue wouldn’t have arisen’

A Muslim woman on Sunday left Ministers stunned by asking them why the AIADMK voted for the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in the Rajya Sabha. She told them that if they had not done that, the problem would not have arisen.

The woman, identified as Nilofar Fatima, 42, of Virudhunagar, was among the beneficiaries at a government function in which Ministers Sellur K. Raju (Cooperation) and K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji (Dairy Development) took part.

Both the Ministers were taken aback by her query.

Meanwhile, a man intervened and took the woman away. However, she was invited back on to the stage and the Ministers tried hard to convince her. “Are you by any means affected by it [CAA],” Mr. Raju asked her. She replied in the negative.

When Mr. Bhalaji attempted to pacify her saying, “Edappadi [K. Palaniswami] government would give [you all] protection,” the woman, who cut him short, said, “Had you not voted [in favour of CAB], would this problem have arisen? Just ponder over it first.”

205,2020/03/16,Rajinikanth is not backtracking: Tamilaruvi Manian,"‘He wants to draw a line between party and government’

Tamil film superstar Rajinikanth has left many in doubt about his intention to take the political plunge by stating that he wants to see resurgence among the people before launching his party. However, Gandhiya Makkal Iyakkam founder Tamilaruvi Manian, considered as a key political advisor to the actor, insists that Mr. Rajinikanth is not shying away from his stated objective. Excerpts from an interview with The Hindu:

What do we make out of Rajinikanth’s announcement that he will project someone else as Chief Ministerial candidate of his proposed political party?

There is no confusion at all. On the contrary it reflects his individuality. When leaders, who do not have one per cent vote base, claim they will become the Chief Minister, it is a matter of pride that Mr Rajinikanth, who enjoys the goodwill of the people and the support of lakhs of fans, says he is not interested in the chair. Kamaraj provided a golden rule, but he is still seen as a model politician because he quit Chief Ministership to do party work. Gandhi’s greatness lies in not becoming the Prime Minister. Jayaprakash Narayan proclaimed total revolution and he did not become the Prime Minister in the Janata Party government.

But all these leaders had rejected position after it came their way. In Mr. Rajinikanth’s case, he has not even started the party...

Mr Rajinikanth is also getting the opportunity to become the Chief Minister. When you compare him with other political leaders of the state, he enjoys the overwhelming support of the people. He can make use of his popularity and create a strong alliance. If he enters the political arena, a lot of people are willing to join hands with him. But I do not want to disclose all the details now. They know that he is the winning horse. The ruling AIADMK is a house of cards and it will collapse after its tenure is over. The DMK vote bank is between 20 and 25%. The party is supporting the minorities only to increase its vote bank. The DMK is not genuinely interested in their welfare. If the NPR affects the minority, you should keep in mind that it was the Manmohan Singh government that announced the NPR in 2010. The DMK was a coalition partner in the government. Again, Mr Narendra Modi introduced it in 2015 and the DMK did not raise any objection. NPR has nothing to do with citizenship and it is [similar to] a census. The DMK is raising the issue to consolidate the 13% minority vote in Tamil Nadu. It knows that it cannot come to power without the votes of the minorities.

How do you expect his proposed party to gain momentum if he opts out of Chief Ministerial race?

He is not backtracking. He is going to launch the party and enter the political arena. He will tour across the state to meet people. He wants to draw a line between the party and government. It is a healthy trend. He has clarified the government will implement what the party conceives and the Chief Minister is just a Chief Executive Officer (CEO). He will be monitoring the government.

Don’t you think that it is akin to enjoying power without responsibility?

I raised the issue with him during a discussion. He could be accused of functioning like an extra-constitutional authority like Sanjay Gandhi worked during emergency. But he made it clear that he would not interfere with the functioning of the government. It could function independently and he would only remind the government of the manifesto of the party. He would enter the scene only when those who are in power are found to be corrupt and remove them.

Instead of operating as a backroom boy, can’t he effectively hold the reins of the government, should an opportunity arise?

It is also my personal opinion. When I met him three years ago for a lengthy discussion, he clarified that he would launch a political party and would not become the Chief Minister. He said it was not in his blood. He wants to make an honest, talented and efficient leader as Chief Minister. He is consistent in his stand. He told me that he does not want to have his portraits adorning the Fort St George. His only intention is to change the system and the political culture of the state. The Dravidian parties have MLAs and MPs who have crossed the age of 50s and 60s. There is no space for youngsters. The district secretaries of the DMK and the AIADMK are ruling in their turfs for over three decades. Only their children and family members get tickets in election and become MLAs and MPs. New talent cannot enter the political arena. He is particular to make way for new talents and change the political atmosphere, which has been polluted to the core. He said he was not interested in enjoying power.

What is the guarantee that the person he places as the Chief Minister will not turn out to be corrupt?

It will not happen if we have charismatic leader. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami could resist Sasikala and not Jayalalithaa. Mr Panneerselvam held the office for two times under the watchful eyes of Jayalalithaa. He also knew that only Jayalalithaa has the mandate of the people. A Chief Minister or a minister cannot go against a charismatic party leader. He said people were going to vote for him and if the Chief Minister or ministers turned corrupt, they would be removed.

But time is moving fast and there is no sign of him launching the party…

He will soon launch the party. He is not in a hurry and not interested in offering false promises. He told me that he could not offer cars because a political party is offering two-wheelers. He is also particular that wrong people should not be promoted in politics and government. He wants to pursue value-based politics. People have been inviting him to enter politics. He argues that if he senses that people will stand by him, he will take a plunge.

But he has not done anything to mobilise people, instead he expects people to show resurgence…

Indeed this question does arise. A leader should play his role and the mass will not mobilise itself for a political change on its own. He says that the Dravidian parties have exploited the state for the last 50 years and the people should revolt against them. He wonders why they have not expressed their anger. He wants them to express it openly. His argument is that the first voice of revolt should come from the affected and he could come to the scene to deliver them.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamilaruvi-manian-interview-on-rajinikanth/article31075818.ece
206,2020/03/16,"Amol Palekar, not the boy-next-door","Actor says he will consider returning to films if something different and challenging comes his way, but he would not call it a comeback

After a gap of 25 years, Amol Palekar returned to theatre with Kusur (Mistake), directed and written by his wife Sandhya Gokhale and presented by Rotary Bangalore, Indiranagar. The actor, who won hearts with his roles in films such as Chhoti Si Baat and Golmaal, among others, spoke candidly to the press in Bengaluru, prior to the staging of his play at Chowdaiah Memorial Hall.

Dressed in a bush shirt, Amol looked every bit the unassuming charmer he used to play on screen. The actor resists labels. “Initially, I used to get disturbed when people said ‘boy-next- door’ because they were not trying to look beyond that. In my first film Rajanigandha, the boy is such an extrovert, but throughout the film he doesn’t say ‘I love you’ even once and yet manages to convey his love to the girl. On the other hand, in Chhoti Si Baat the boy is an opposite. He is an introvert and shy... so shy that he crosses the road when he sees the girl he loves. My character in Bhumika is a despicable villain. In Khamosh, the character commits a cold-blooded murder. If you can’t see the difference between these roles, it is your problem, not mine. I am always in search of the complex.”

Amol says his characters are real and relatable. “I try to make them as non-obtrusive as possible. I don’t want Amol Palekar to be remembered. I want the character to be remembered. People don’t even remember the names of most of my film characters, apart from the famous Ram Prasad and Laxman Prasad (Golmaal).”

When asked if he thinks about passing down a legacy, Amol says: “I don’t think I have ever thought about that or even tried. Once you are successful in any field, you are expected to repeat that success and therefore keep doing the same thing. If the ‘Angry Man’ image sells then you keep on selling that. I was probably one of those stupid ones who refused to do that, because it did not interest me any more. Once I know I can do this well and what I am doing is also loved by the audience, I lose interest. I want to try out something that I haven’t tried. When I do not know if I will be able to carry it off. There is an inherent risk in failing, which people don’t often take. I have always taken that risk because it makes it exciting and challenging.”

While comparing Indian cinema of the 70s and 80s to contemporary cinema, is there a tendency to romanticise the past? Amol says there is no-clear cut ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer to that. “Parallel cinema in the ‘70s and ‘80s was so vibrant and meaningful that it gave a significant dimension to Indian cinema. It brought regional cinema to the forefront. A film made in Odiya made national headlines, for example. We made Indian cinema proud within our country and abroad.”

Amol has been a vociferous critic of censorship, his speech in 2019 at National Gallery of Modern Art was in fact cut short. When asked about dissent, he says: “When you see a voice being muzzled or a voice of dissent not being liked, isn’t that censorship? Why do we expect only artistes to fight against censorship? Isn’t this our problem, which has come into our homes?”

As for his comeback to films (his last directorial venture was in 2011, Dhoosar in Marathi), Amol says: “Today, I am primarily a painter (he studied at the Sir JJ School of Arts, Mumbai). I will do 25 performances of my play and that is all. As far as films are concerned, if something different and challenging comes my way, I will certainly do it.

The veteran actor says he would not call it a comeback. “I didn’t leave anything as such. To use a cinematic idiom, certain things are in focus, everything else is out of focus, they remain in the background. So in the visual and performing arts that I dabbled in, I was active. I was fortunate that I was one of the few who was active in all these spaces simultaneously.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/d0qpex/article31083872.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGMAMOL1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/not-the-boy-next-door/article31083874.ece
207,2020/03/16,Papam Pasivadu (1972): A fascinating adaptation of South African movie 'Lost in The Desert',"The superhit Telugu film starred Master Ramu, S.V. Rangarao, Devika, Nagesh, Sathyanarayana.

It was the second Telugu movie to be shot extensively in the deserts of Rajasthan. While the first one, Krishna’s Mosagaallaku Mosagaadu was an action adventure for treasure hunt, Sri Lakshmi Productions, Papam Pasivadu dealt with the escapades of a young boy lost in the desert.

Basking under the commercial success of his 1970 production, Rowdy Rani, a crime thriller, Atluri Purnachandra Rao was on the lookout for a fascinating subject for his next production. The just then released South African movie, Lost in The Desert written, produced and directed by Jamie Hayes (Uys) caught his eye. It is the story of an eight-year-old boy left in the lurch with his pet dog in the Kalahari desert while his father makes desperate attempts to get him back. Sensing a box office kill, Purnachandra Rao commissioned the multi-talented Gollapudi Maruthi Rao to write a story based on the movie.

Retaining the main characters, including the pet dog from Hayes’s story, Gollapudi introduced additional characters, villainy and pumped in loads of sentiment besides thrills in his adaptation.

The story

Venugopala Rao (played by S V Rangarao) and his wife Janaki (Devika) are worried as their only son Gopi (Master Ramu) is diagnosed with tuberculosis and is recommended for treatment in Switzerland by the family doctor (Chittor V Nagaiah). His pilot uncle Pathy (Nagesh) takes him in a chartered plane. On their way, at Thar Desert, Pathy succumbs to heart attack. Gopi and his pet dog Tommy are left in the desert, leading to panicky situations. With the help of an airport official, Chakrapani (Prabhakara Reddy), Venugopala Rao finally locates his son’s whereabouts in a forest near the desert. Even before he reaches there his brother Narasimham (Sathyanarayana) goes to kill Gopi in order to amass his brother’s wealth. However, Gopi is saved and Narasimham dies engulfed by forest fire.

Cast & crew

Gollapudi Maruthi Rao’s intelligent adaptation of Lost in The Desert to suit the tastes of native audience coupled with his taut screenplay greatly helped director V Ramachandra Rao to expand the 90- minute English movie to 139 minutes of exciting entertainment. Gollapudi also penned the crisp dialogues. However, the hero behind the movie was cinematographer M Kannappa. The movie was shot in Eastman colour. Kannappa’s visuals in the desert scenes were a treat to watch. Purnachandra Rao while sharing his unit’s experiences during their 27-day shooting stint in the Thar desert in an article in Vijayachitra said that, “of the 35 unit members there was only actor, Master Ramu and of course the dog.” It indicates that the scenes shot on Nagesh, S V Rangarao, Devika, Prabhakara Reddy and Sathyanarayana were taken in the matching studio sets and on the sands of beaches near Madras. Art director S Krishna Rao needs special mention for bringing in such authenticity and Balu complimented him with crisp editing.

Master Ramu looked every inch a lost child in an unfamiliar territory and won sympathies and admiration from the audience. The cute little Pomeranian named Tommy cornered ‘acting honours’ and won fans as much too. Suryakantham and Chayadevi played relatives of S V Rangarao who were after his wealth.

S V Ranga Rao and Prabhakar Reddy in ‘Papam Pasivadu’

Sathyam composed the tunes for the songs written by Athreya, C Narayana Reddy and Kosaraju. The popular songs are — Amma choodali ninnu naannani choodaali rendered by P Susheela and the dance-drama enacted by choreographer K S Reddy and Vijayasri, Arey manchi annade kaanaraadu (S P Balasubrahmanyam).

Trivia

Atluri Purnachandra Rao started his career as a theatre operator, then worked as a film representative, line inspector, publicity in charge and as a production manager. His debut production was the folklore, Aggi meeda guggilam followed by Ukku Pidugu (1969) both produced under Navabharath Pictures banner. With Rowdy Rani he launched Sri Lakshmi Productions and tasted big success.

Papam Pasivadu was shot near the villages in Sam Tehsil in Jaisalmer district where the iconic Hindi movies, Love and God and Reshma Aur Shera were filmed. Purnachandra Rao’s unit stayed in tents erected in open spaces outside the villages. Taking a cue from the locals that onion smell keeps the desert snakes away, before going to bed, the unit members would chew onions. The shoot was held in March under scorching sun at 53 degrees Celsius. The unit members travelled to the location on camel back. The shooting was held in two sessions daily between 8-11 in the morning and 4-7 in the evening. Every second day a veterinary doctor came to conduct fitness test for the dog. To protect from exposure to sun, after the day’s shoot, the film was sent to Jaisalmer. In its return trip the car brought groceries and water. The forest scenes were filmed at Mudumalai in Tamil Nadu.

The hyena that chases master Ramu and the dog in the desert was hired from a circus company in Udaipur.

Chukkala Veera Venkata Rambabu better known as Master Ramu hailed from Vijayawada and debuted in Tamil as a child actor with the Sivaji Ganesan-Jayalalitha starrer, Enga Mama (1970) and later acted in Nindu Hrudayaalu. But it was Papam Pasivadu that established him as a child actor.

In a first for Telugu films, publicity pamphlets of the movie were tossed from helicopter in various towns. Released on September 29, 1972, Papam Pasivadu ran for 100 days in 10 centres and the celebrations were held at New Woodlands Hotel, Madras. Nagaiah, Akkineni Nageswara Rao and C Narayana Reddy were the chief guests.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/j5ahks/article31082574.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf13Master-Ramujpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/directed-by-v-ramachandra-rao-papam-pasivadu-was-a-classic/article31082582.ece
208,2020/03/16,"Even as COVID-19 hits Kannada cinema, bilingual titled 'Corona' being planned","The coronavirus outbreak has not only affected the screening of films, but also led to huge business losses

“An invisible virus has wreaked havoc on every aspect of our lives,” says filmmaker Jayatheertha. “Countries that hoarded weapons that could destroy the human race, are now kneeling in fear before this new virus.”

Like other film industries across the globe, Kannada cinema is also facing the wrath of coronavirus and activities have come to a stand still. The film industry and the government will incur a loss of 100 crore because of the virus. For the first time in the 85-year history of Kannada cinema, the government has issued a directive to close cinema theatres. Over 800 screens across the state (including single screens and multiplexes) have suspended screening of films since March 14. As many as 500 workers, artistes and technicians, involved in various parts of film production are badly hit, as shooting of films have been called off.

“The state’s move to close theatres has been respected by everyone involved keeping public interest in mind. The government has promised to review the situation and take a decision,” says KV Chandrashekar, President Karnataka Film Exhibitors’ Association. The district administration has directed theatre owners not to screen films till March 31.

Besides the film industry, the government will also incur a huge loss on entertainment tax and GST collection, estimated to be around ₹ 70 crore, says Umesh Banakar, Vice-President Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC). “We have convened a meeting of exhibitors on March 17 to compensate the makers of films of Shivarjuna and Naragunda Bandaya, as these films’ screening was suspended because of the government order. We are also requesting UFO and QUBE-digital distribution platform to waive the transmission fee as the screening of these films were cancelled.”

If big budget films were lined up for release at this juncture, the loss would have been greater says a source from the industry. Producers of Vikram Yoganand’s Kushka, Sachin Shetty’s Ondu Shikariya Kathe and Turtu Nirgama have postponed the release of these films. Tarun Sudhir, director of Roberrt had planned to release his film on April 9, but, adds he will again take a call after watching situation.

This is not the first time the Kannada film industry is shut down. Earlier it was brought to a standstill after the abduction of the Kannada icon Dr Rajkumar in July 2001.

It is the producers who will bear the brunt of this situation. “All others are in the safe zone,” says DK Ramakrishna President Kannada Film Producers’ Association, adding that the total loss for the four films released on March 13 is almost ₹10 crore. The development will have an impact on Roberrt starring Darshan, Yuvarathna with Puneet Rajkumar, Kotigobba-3 starring Sudeep, and Banaras directed by Jayatheertha with the new comers.

Awareness drive by stars

Actors such as Shivarajkumar, Puneet Rajkumar, Ragini, Sri Murali, Harshika Poonachcha are focussing their attention on creating awareness among the people about the impact of the virus by sharing precautionary steps people should take to keep this disease at bay. Shivarajkumar asked people to be “at home with the family”.

Puneeth cancelled his birthday celebration scheduled for March 17 saying, “Your safety is the best present for me on this occasion.”

And now a film Corona

Meanwhile, Umesh Banakar is planning to make a bilingual film in Kannada and Hindi titled Corona. He has registered the title with the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce.

Shivakumar, who partnered with Umesh Banakar, applied for the registration of Deadly Corona with Mumbai Film Chamber of Commerce. “Title registration Committee of KFCC will meet soon to take a call on registering the title.

209,2020/03/16,'Taj Mahal 1989': The poetry and politics of love,"The Netflix show isn’t third-rate by any degree, but it just feels plastic and insincere at times

“Every person wastes his life trying to become someone. Competitions, IAS, Collector’s residence… he’s always becoming something. There’s nothing called life. The world is living. Life is to be lived, flavorfully. Don’t look at life as a bargain. Experience it and enjoy it.” That isn’t the introduction to Netflix’s Taj Mahal 1989, nor is it the philosophical canoe upon which it travels. It’s a line that Sudhakar Mishra (Danish Husain) tells his friend, Akhtar Baig (Neeraj Kabi), under the cover of semi-darkness. They recently bumped into each other at a poetry recitation after a decade or two, and, now, they can’t seem to let go of each other.

They studied together in college, where Sudhakar bagged a gold medal. However, over the course of time, he ended up becoming a tailor by following in his dad’s footsteps, and, the guy who buried his head in poetry, to earn brownie points from the woman he fell in love with, became a Philosophy professor. You never know how life is going to give you the short end of the stick and this is a great example to show you that the jobs that people take up need not necessarily be a measure of their intellectual capacity — academic or otherwise.

Taj Mahal 1989 zooms in on the lives of almost a dozen people from different age groups. While Sudhakar and Mumtaz (Sheeba Chaddha) live together without getting married since they don’t conform to society’s idea of a sacred union, Sarita (Geetanjali Kulkarni) and Akhtar are on the verge of a nervous breakdown — or midlife crisis — and they’re finding it hard to stay together. Well, at least Sarita is disappointed that her husband is more interested in sharpening his poetic knowledge than getting cozy with her. In a rather straightforward comedy-drama tone, while pouring her heart out, she tells her friend, “Intelligence and romance don’t go together.” Her grouse is that Akhtar makes her feel like a dimwit all the time.

Although I do understand her area of pain, I can’t fathom how their relationship survived for 22 years. She’s a Physics professor, so her forte is far removed from Akhtar’s. Perhaps, the time period this series is set in — the late 80s — is what made their marriage sail through. Again, the 80s setting is merely a rough piece of nostalgia that makes up the living rooms of the characters and not their conversations. The team that has worked on the production design gets the props right, but the costumes are way off the mark. Moreover, for a show set in Lucknow, it’s kind of blasphemous to not have scenes that take you through the chambers of the city.

Then, on the other side is a group of three friends — Rashmi (Anshul Chauhan), Dharam (Paras Priyadarshan), and Angad (Anud Singh Dhaka) — of which two are in a relationship. The tonal shift that makes Dharam pick up a gun to scare off a guy from getting too close to his girlfriend and then somehow getting involved in campus politics is flippantly written. Dharam seems to be a puppet for a right-wing political party and Angad, on the contrary, seems to side with the Communist party. But the questions of caste and religion never come into the picture ever.

By totally eliminating caste from the table, Pushpendra concentrates on the financial statuses alone. A rich Sikh student, aka a capitalist, mugs up lines penned by Angad to woo a woman who reads Marx. Likewise, the lower-middle class couple, Sudhakar and Mumtaz (a vegetable seller), is simply poorer than the teaching duo, Akhtar and Sarita. Maybe Pushpendra wanted to keep Taj Mahal 1989 free from the dark realities of an era gone by. But that’s not an excuse you can buy.

The series isn’t third-rate by any degree. It just feels plastic and insincere sometimes.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/4yfzba/article31081793.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FRPage2Web6jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/taj-mahal-1989-the-poetry-and-politics-of-love/article31081794.ece

The Gollapudi Srinivas National Award 2019 will be shared by two debutante directors for the first time in the 23 years since the inception of the honour.

The winners are Aditya Dhar for Hindi film Uri: The Surgical Strike, and Madhu C. Narayanan for Malayalam outing Kumbalangi Nights. Both the filmmakers will receive a cash prize of ₹1,50,000 as well as a memento, during the award ceremony that is scheduled to be held on August 12 in Chennai. The films and directors were selected by a jury comprising of Bharat Bala, Jayendra, Ram Madhvani and Baradwaj Rangan, among 22 nominations in various languages from across the country.

Aditya Dhar, who was a lyricist and dialogue writer earlier, turned filmmaker with Uri that starred Vicky Kaushal, Paresh Rawal and Yami Gautam in lead roles, that was based on the surgical strikes conducted in 2016 by the Indian Army, against militant launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The film was a resounding success across the country commercially.

In a statement, the director said that he felt try blessed to receive the honour, and wanted to thank the esteemed jury and organising team: “I am genuinely humbled. It’s an honour to be sharing this award with an extraordinary talent like Madhu Narayanan. Can’t wait to be in one of my most favourite cities in India, Chennai, for the award ceremony.”

Meanwhile, Madhu C Narayanan’s Kumbalangi Nights was a whimsical drama that revolves around the lives and loves of brothers in a family, and starred an ensemble cast headlined by Fahadh Faasil, Soubin Shahir, Shane Nigam, Sreenath Bhasi and Anna Ben among others. Madhu has also assisted on other acclaimed films such as Maheshinte Prathikaram.

The Malayalam filmmaker said, “Thank you so much for selecting me for the Gollapudi Srinivas National Award for the best Debut Director for 2019. It is a great honour to receive this prestigious National award along with the very talented Aditya Dhar. I thank the jury and I am very excited to be a part of the award ceremony in Chennai.”

The award was established in 1998 to preserve the legacy of Gollapudi Srinivas, a young director, who tragically passed away in an accident during the shoot of his maiden venture in 1992. It is announced annually on March 17 and presented on August 12, every year. The Gollapudi Srinivas National Award promises first-time directors appreciation and recognition of their works on a pan-Indian basis.

Ukrainian-born actor-model Olga Kurylenko has revealed that she has tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

The actor, best known for starring in 2008’s James Bond film Quantum of Solace and 2013’s sci-fi movie Oblivion, took to Instagram on Sunday to share her diagnosis.

Kurylenko, 40, said she had been ill for “almost a week”.

“Locked up at home after having tested positive for coronavirus,” she wrote alongside a photo showing a view through a window.

“I’ve actually been ill for almost a week now. Fever and fatigue are my main symptoms. Take care of yourself and do take this seriously!” she added.

Kurylenko is the latest name from international entertainment industry to have contracted the COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) last week.

213,2020/03/16,"‘Master’ audio launch: Vijay says, ‘Kill them with your success, bury them with your smile’","Co-stars Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi’s camaraderie stole the show at the private event

The audio launch of Vijay’s Master was held on Sunday evening in a private ceremony with great fanfare. In contrast to the promotional events for Vijay’s previous films, the occasion was restricted to just cast and crew members, keeping in mind the coronavirus scare that is rampant across the country.

Also read: ‘Vaathi Raid’: Third single from Vijay’s ‘Master’ released

Vijay first ascended the stage and broke into an impromptu dance with Shanthanu Bhagyaraj and Anirudh Ravichander.

Beginning his speech with his now-famous ‘”n nenjil kudi irukkum” line, he stated that he was deeply upset that his fans couldn’t be invited to the launch.

“Due to the incidents that happened during the Bigil event (during which some fans were injured) and the safety measures followed (due to the coronavirus spread), we had to do a private event. I am sorry, and thank you as always.”

Vijay takes a selfie with the cast and crew of the film

Praising Anirudh for an excellent score, the actor then revealed he wondered why co-star Vijay Sethupathi agreed to play the villain in Master. “Sethupathi has now become a person who cannot be ignored. I went and asked him myself why he agreed to act in this film, and he shut me down replying, ‘It’s simply because I like you very much.’ Vijay Sethupathi doesn’t just share my name, but has also given space for me in his heart.”

Vijay also returned Sethupathi’s earlier kiss on the sets, with a return smooch to his cheek at the end of the event.

Director Lokesh Kanagaraj

He also thanked co-producers Jagdish and Lalit and his uncle Xavier Britto who is the main producer of ‘Master’, and then termed director Lokesh Kanagaraj a ‘small wonder’ : “He used to work in a bank and do short films in his free time, and then suddenly came up with such a complicated film like Maanagaram. But it took me time to adapt to his working style. When the Master shoot happened, I realised he didn’t even distribute scene papers during the shoot — I actually got vexed and thought I’ll go home! But thankfully, it all worked out. He doesn’t just have a plan, but a 'Master'plan. Smart work meets hard work, like the song goes: that’s Lokesh for you.”

Moving on to his famous ‘kutti kadhai’ that has become a customary part of every audio launch, Vijay broke into lines his song Elaam Pugazhum from Azhagiya Tamil Magan, and said, “Like the song goes, our life is also like a river. There will be people at different points who light lamps and let it float, those who sprinkle flowers, and also those who throw stones at the water. But just like the river ebbs and moved on, it’s our job to do the same. Kill them with your success, bury them will your smile,” he grinned to rapturous applause.

Also answering a question as to what he would ask his younger self, Vijay replied, “I would ask him if I could get that peaceful life back.. which was without any raids!”

He also thanked the Tamil people for the support they showed him during the Neyveli shoot of Master when the income tax department halted the film, and then finally addressing his new look for the event — a dapper tux — Vijay stated, “My designer always asks me to try changing my dressing style. Does it suit me? I thought I’ll dress like my friend Ajith for a change!”

Also read: Meet the brains behind Vijay’s ‘Kutti Story’ from Master

Speaking before Vijay, the film’s antagonist, Vijay Sethupathi had thanked Vijay for including the former’s name on the poster too. “It came as a surprise to me actually. After working with him, I asked him why he doesn’t speak so much, and he replied that he prefers to stay quiet and observe others... I learnt something from that. Our vibe was established right from the first photo shoot itself — the comfort zone made a lot of sense to me.”

Vijay Sethupathi confessed he accepted the film because he 'likes Vijay a lot'

Sethupathi also added that he’d been a fan of Vijay’s ‘cute’ expressions right from the time he was a college student. “When I kissed him at the end of the shoot, I hope he understood how much I loved him. He’s smart and shy; quick, do a close-up of him to see him blush as I say this! It’s the first time a man is making another man blush,” he laughed.

“By the way, you all need to know that I’m the actual hero in Master. If I’m the supposed ‘villain’ to Vijay, then is he not a villain to me? That makes me the hero. Master is a double-hero subject actually,” Sethupathi grinned.

He requested everyone to keep their hearts strong during the coronavirus pandemic: “I want to take this opportunity to thank the incredible work of the medical community. Don’t panic, please. Such problems will keep coming, but we need to stay resolute.”

The 96 star also had one piece of advice for the audience: “Don’t believe those who say they are the defenders of God. God has been around for thousands of years. They don’t need people to defend them. Even if someone is talking up their faith, don’t tell them that your god is better but instead offer them love and brotherhood and humanity. That’s what we can offer as people. Don’t fall for anyone who says they speak for God. Only a human being can save a fellow human being. No one from above is going to come rescue you.”

He signed off revealing that his birth name was Vijay Gurunatha Sethupathi Kalimuthu and that his late father would always remain his ‘master’ in life: “I even get drunk and yelled at my dad’s photo sometimes, asking him where he is now. I love him. He’ll always remain my biggest influence and inspiration.”

Director Lokesh has earlier said in his speech that Master would see another dimension to Vijay. “His character is quite unusual compared to his previous films. A lot of people, including my team thought the title was going to be Vaathi — we kept the Master name secret from everyone. The three posters released so far also indicate the beginning, interval and climax of the film.”

Malavika Mohanan at the 'Master' event

The likes of Master heroine Malavika Mohanan, producer Xavier Britto, composer Anirudh Ravichander, and other cast and crew members like actors Shanthnu Bhagyaraj, Arjun Das, cinematographer Sathyan Sooryan, action choreographer Stunt Silva, and others also took the stage during the course of the launch, that was interspersed with dance performances, include a surprise act from Vijay’s former co-star Simran.

Anirudh also revealed that the Master album initially had a total of 12 songs, but they had to settle for eight eventually. Two more songs are set to release in the coming days. The composer also thanked fellow music directors Yuvan Shankar and Santhosh Narayan for singing in the film.

214,2020/03/16,‘Next two weeks critical for India’,"Vaccine for coronavirus may take at least a year: CCMB chief

There is no evidence to suggest that COVID-19, having originated from China, is very different from what is prevalent in Europe, West Asia or United States of America. “There is nothing to indicate it is a less virulent strain, looking at the pattern. Hence, it becomes all the more crucial to control spread of the virus in the community in the next couple of weeks, before it affects large sections of population,” said Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CSIR-CCMB) Director Rakesh Mishra on Monday.

There is no scientific basis to claim that the coronavirus will vanish once summer sets in and a vaccine is a long way off. “Summer will bring in more heat and dryness to that extent the cough droplets may evaporate but the virus can spread indoors — inside cinemas, malls — and wherever there is dampness. There is a good chance it could help but we should not depend on weather alone,” he explained.

Isolation necessary

Therefore, rather than expect some quick remedies, the populace should brace for two weeks of isolating themselves from community gatherings, avoiding travel and practising personal hygiene like washing hands often. “Virus is not the issue as most will recover. We need to break the fast spread to thousands of people and though they too will recover, it will be difficult for the system to tackle large numbers,” said Dr. Mishra

“Central government and scientific heads have decided the next fortnight is going to be crucial in halting the spread of the contagion because even if a virus it is not fatal but a sudden rise in the number of sick people could put the entire healthcare machinery under strain,” he said, in an exclusive interaction.

Top scientists from various research institutes have been interacting with principal scientific adviser K. Vijayaraghavan through video-conferencing in the past few days to deliberate on the steps to be taken to tackle the crisis and on pushing forward the research and development processes with the help of the private sector, he stated.

“A combination of drugs can be tried to tackle any virus, but it comes with the risk of toxicity and uncertainty of benefits. However, a vaccine for coronavirus is many months away and could take at least a year,” said the director.

The CCMB has not banned any visitors as such to its facility but has halted international travel of scientists and non-essential travel. Large gatherings are a no-no and staff have been sensitised about the precautions.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ax2r0z/article31085026.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY17RAKESHMISHRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/next-two-weeks-critical-for-india/article31085027.ece
215,2020/03/16,I’ll quit if Congress shows document of irrigation pact with Maha: CM,"Will fight for our share of Krishna waters, says Chandrasekhar Rao

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has challenged Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader M. Bhatti Vikramarka in the Legislative Assembly on Monday that he would quit immediately if the latter produced document of agreement between the then Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra on the Tummidihatti barrage planned as part of Pranahitha-Chevella lift irrigation project.

The provocation for such a reaction by the Chief Minister was a remark made by Mr. Vikramarka during the debate on the Appropriation Bill, wherein he observed that the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government was claiming too much about Kaleshwaram project by reducing the project height from 152 meters to 100 meters. Angered by the Congress leader’s remark, the Chief Minister was on his toes immediately to state that Mr. Vikramarka was misleading people “as he would do often”.

“We have exhibited better diplomacy with our neighbouring States although we (TRS) are a junior party compared to them (Congress) and entered into agreement with Maharashtra on the height of Medigadda barrage with 100 meter full reservoir level. If Mr. Vikramarka can show any agreement on construction of the barrage (at Tummidihatti), I will resign now itself. They have failed to convince Maharashtra and failed to failed to reach at an understanding and now they (Congress) are not admitting their inefficiency,” the Chief Minister said.

Submergence in Maharashtra

The Telangana government has entered into agreement on Tummidihatti barrage too with 148 meter FRL to prevent submergence of large areas on Maharashtra territory, including a wildlife sanctuary. The Chief Minister said the State government was committed to utilise it share of 950 tmc ft in Godavari waters through Kaleshwaram (530 tmc ft), Devadula (75tmc ft) and Seetharama (175 tmc ft) projects.

He explained that three tmc ft of water would be taken till Mid Manair Reservoir and two tmc ft till Mallannasagar within a year to utilise 530 tmc ft water with the help of Kaleshwaram project. “We have plans to utilise more Godavari water by constructing 1,200 checkdams in the catchment areas over the next two years. At the same time, we are continuing our fight for our share in Krishna waters at the tribunal and other levels,” the Chief Minister said.

The State government would also complete other ongoing irrigation projects swiftly to improve the contribution of agriculture sector to the GSDP.

Sale of sand

The Chief Minister said the State Government was making about ₹2,000 crore revenue now from sand without increasing its price as the money used to go into the pockets of ruling party leaders in the past and now it was reaching the government coffers. During the Congress rule, it was only ₹40 crore, he pointed out.

Mr. Vikramarka said sand was a natural resource and they did not exploit it as the TRS government was doing now.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ill-quit-if-congress-shows-document-of-irrigation-pact-with-maha-cm/article31084745.ece

Fourth case of COVID-19in Telangana was confirmed on Monday. The patient, a man in mid-40s, returned from Scotland three days ago and developed fever a day after. He is currently undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital. Telangana Health department’s Rapid Response Teams (RRT) started to trace people the fourth patient came in contact with.

Two tests were performed to confirm that he is positive for coronavirus. As per protocol, after a sample collected from a suspect tests positive at laboratories in the State, second sample is sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune for confirmation. A person is declared positive for coronavirus after sample tests positive at the Pune lab, too.

Four COVID-19 positive cases were confirmed in Telangana since March 2. The index (first) positive case had travel history to Dubai, second positive patient returned from Italy, third patient from the Netherlands and the fourth case has a travel history to Scotland.

Of them, the index (first) case was discharged on Friday after he recovered completely. The three remaining patients are undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital.

The father of the second positive patient, who returned from Italy, tested negative for coronavirus. This is significant as he was one of the persons who was in contact with her. In case of index COVID-19 patient too, his family members who stayed with him in the same house tested negative for the virus. Till date, according to information provided by State Health department, none of the contacts of the COVID-19 patients in the State contracted the disease.

Apart from the second patient’s father, results of two more from her family were awaited. Officials from the Health department said on Monday that test results of contacts of third patient too were awaited.

221,2020/03/16,TRS govt pushing State into debt trap: Bhatti,"Given past experience there is likely to be a revenue shortfall, says CLP leader

Leader of the Congress Legislature Party Bhatti Vikramarka has said that though the State government proposed an ambitious budget outlay of ₹1,82,914 crore and with a revenue surplus of over ₹4,000 crore for 2020-21, it may end up as deficit budget.

“It does not appear to be a healthy budget,” he said.

He was speaking on the Telangana Appropriation Bill moved by Finance Minister T.Harisha Rao in the Legislative Assembly here on Monday.

Given the difference between the estimated and actual revenue receipts in the last five years was about 25%, Mr. Vikramarka said the government estimated the revenue receipts at ₹85,300 crore , increasing it by ₹14,000 crore over that of 2019-20. In the State’s own tax and non-tax revenue, the shortfall will likely be around ₹25,000 crore, he said. The budget for 2020-21 may end up with a revenue deficit of ₹20,000 crore, he cautioned.

The State might be forced to spend its borrowings to meet revenue expenditure rather than the capital expenditure and this could push the State into a debt trap. He sought DPRs for the irrigation projects be presented to the House as promised to bring in transparency on how the borrowed funds were being spent.

He said the Opposition would get its feedback from people about lapses in execution of programmes like Mission Bhagiratha, unresolved problem of Podu cultivators, unemployment of youth and when these were raised for the benefit of the State, the ruling party made derogatory remarks. The Chief Minister even went to the extent of describing Congress as coronavirus. The remarks should be removed from the records to keep the dignity of the House, he said.

Chief Minister Chandrasekhar Rao said the Opposition should also be dignified and fair in its criticism and appreciate the good work done to get a dignified reply. If the Opposition made wild allegations, the ruling party would also give political reply as people would watch everything. “If the State is not financially healthy, how the government was spending all its welfare programmes and purchasing paddy from all farmers and even stepping in by releasing ₹300 crore for procuring redgram when Centre failed to do so,” he countered.

Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao refuted Mr. Vikramarka claims on unemployment issue and sought to know how many jobs had TDP and Congress given in Telangana region in the combined State. The TRS Party never said it would give 50 lakh jobs and only promised one lakh jobs and kept its word and would give more. “Would you give jobs to 50 lakh people,” he challenged and when Congress leader responded positively, Chief Minister countered why they could not do so in 50 years.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/qam1gf/article31084301.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY17CONGRESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/trs-govt-pushing-state-into-debt-trap-bhatti/article31084059.ece

223,2020/03/16,"TS Assembly passes resolution against CAA, NPR, and NRC","Calls them concerted efforts to tinker with the inclusive, and non-religious nature of citizenship

The Telangana Legislative Assembly has opposed the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR), and National Register of Citizens (NRC), alleging these formed part of concerted attempts to tinker with the inclusive and non-religious nature of citizenship.

Besides violating principles of equality, non-discrimination and secularism, the concerted attempt would also endanger the lives of vulnerable groups who did not possess documentary proof of citizenship. “Moreover, there are serious questions as to the legality and constitutionality of the CAA, NPR and NRC,” a resolution passed by the Legislative Assembly on Monday said.

Seven States

With this, Telangana Assembly has become the seventh State Legislature to pass resolution against the CAA, NPR, and NRC after West Bengal, Kerala, Rajasthan, Punjab, Delhi and Bihar. Meanwhile, the Madhya Pradesh government too opposed the Centre’s moves and the State Cabinet had passed a resolution opposing the process.

Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who introduced the resolution in the Assembly expressed concern that the CAA introduced a “religious test” to acquire Indian citizenship for the first time in the country.

Fear of a theocratic State

The enactment of the CAA raised concerns that by introducing a religious test for citizenship, the Act insulted the memory of India’s founders who consciously chose not to incorporate a “racial principle” or “religious principle” in the provisions applicable to citizenship. The enactment of CAA had created grave apprehensions among various sections of society that it was a prelude to the NPR which would lead to a nationwide NRC.

The Act would make people belonging to certain religions eligible for Indian citizenship, while excluding other solely on the basis of religion. Citizenship on the basis of religion violates not only the principle of equality enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution, but also the principle of secularism which constituted its basic structure. “By discarding secularism and equality before law in our citizenship laws, a theocratic state may be institutionalized,” the resolution said.

Selective protection

The CAA should be understood in combination of the NPR which was being purportedly conducted under the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Card) Rules, 2003. “The Ministry of Home Affairs annual report (2018-19) stated that the NPR was the first step towards creation of the NRC,” it said. According to statements made by the Union Ministers as well as the government of Assam, the CAA was to be used in order to protect non-Muslims who might have been excluded from the NRC in Assam and in future, and the rest of the country.

“Therefore, this is nothing less than an attempt to fundamentally alter and undermine the non-religious nature of Indian citizenship,” the resolution averred. The rules were purportedly made under Section 14A of the Citizenship Act, 1955 which however did not permit or require the creation of NPR. Moreover, the rules were notified on December 10, 2003 while Section 14A came into effect only on December 3 the next year.

Concerns and confusion

“Thus there are valid concerns as to the legality and constitutionality of NPR and NRC. There is confusion even as to the mandatory nature of the NPR,” it said. In addition, the conflation of NPR and Census exercise resulted in endangering the integrity and safety of the Census exercise.

The resolution urged the Central government to amend Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 in order to remove all references to any religion or to any foreign country. Expressing concern over the proposed implementation of NPR and NRC which might result in exclusion of large number of people, the resolution urged the State Government to take all necessary steps to safeguard the people from such exercises.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/doe6gv/article31084355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THPTICAAANDNRC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/telangana-assembly-passes-resolution-opposing-caa-npr-and-nrc/article31081955.ece
224,2020/03/16,State confident of raising revenue to meet budget expenditure: CM,"Borrowings only to meet capital expenditure, Chief Minister tells Assembly

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has asserted that the Telangana government was confident of meeting ₹1,63,000 lakh crore expenditure out of ₹1,82,914 crore Budget outlay for 2020-21 and the remaining ₹20,000 crore will be mobilised through sand and mining resources and upward revision of stamps and registration fee.

Giving a reply during the discussion on Telangana Appropriation Bills in the Legislative Assembly here on Monday, Chief Minister clarified on the doubts expressed by and Congress Legislature Party leader Bhatti Vikramarka. He said government was clear about raising its resources despite the challenges of slowdown of economy and coronovirus impact. The budget was based on realistic estimates, he reiterated.

Government proposed to get revenue of ₹6,000 crore to ₹7,000 crore from the sand mining in the new fiscal as against ₹2,000 crore in 2019-20 and proposed to hike stamps and registration duty, which was not revised in the last six years. Government increased RTC bus fare to help strengthen RTC besides the ₹1,000 crore sanctioned by the State and it would also increase power tariff.

“We said we have to revise power tariff rate to give quality 24x7 power supply. We are not cowards. We stand by what we said,” he said adding people have faith in the Telangana Rashtra Samithi party and hence they have been giving it the mandate repeatedly.

Telangana registered impressive GSDP growth from about ₹5 lakh crore in 2014 to ₹9,69,000 crore. Several sectors like agriculture, power and animal husbandry registered significant growth. Agriculture growth rate increased to 23.7% from – 11.4%. The per capita income of the State was the highest in the country and it was not a claim by the State but endorsed by the CAG itself. The CAG also presented the sector-wise growth registered by the State in the last five years. It was an indication that the capital expenditure made by the State in the last five years on Irrigation, Mission Bhagiratha, yielded results and created wealth.

Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao dismissed the criticism of Congress of increasing debt burden, that touched over ₹3 lakh crore, and said the debts raised were for capital expenditure. “It is a question of economic wisdom. The country with the highest debt is US and Japan’s debt is 400% more than that of its GDP. But it became one of the top economic powers,” he said. Of over ₹ 2 lakh crore debts raised in the last five years, ₹1 lakh crore was spent on irrigation and agriculture sector. The wealth being created by Telangana farmers would help clear the debt in two years, he said.

He further said that while Centre collected taxes of ₹2.72 lakh crore from the State in the last five years, Telangana got only Rs.1.12 lakh crore. “Whose wealth is this?” was his poser to Mr. Vikramarka. Telangana managed to be self-reliant despite slowdown and reduction of tax devolution to State.

He announced that by next year 570 tmc ft of Godavari water would flow in the State through Kaleswaram Lift Irrigation project, 75 tmc ft through Devadula and 175 tmc ft through Sitarama Sagar project. “What the Congress party could not do for 50 years, a junior party like TRS could achieve,” he said.

He said his government would make farmer the king and make Telangana a fertile and evergreen State through its tireless efforts.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ywkg1b/article31084327.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY17KCR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/state-confident-of-raising-revenue-to-meet-budget-expenditure-cm/article31083842.ece
225,2020/03/16,TS will do more than impose stay on NPR: KCR,"Government has a policy on on the issue, says CM

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao assured the Legislative Assembly on Monday that the Telangana government would do much better than Kerala or any other State in the country to prevent its people suffering from the Union government’s decisions such as implementing the National Population Register (NPR).

Speaking as part of clarifications on the reply to the debate on the Appropriation Bill, the Chief Minister, responding to a plea of Floor Leader of AIMIM Akbaruddin Owaisi to announce stay on the implementation of NPR in Telangana, said the State government had taken up a resolution on its own against the Citizenship Amendment Act, NPR and National Register of Citizens.

He made it clear that the government had a policy on the issue and it would stick to it without any dilution. The fight against NPR would be a long drawn battle and he would mobilise the like-minded voices in the country against the discriminatory law. Kerala and West Bengal might have given a stay on the implementation of NPR but Telangana government would do more to prevent suffering of its people from such a law.

The Chief Minister agreed to the suggestion from Mr. Owaisi that a representative of Urdu be appointed in the State Official Language Commission since Urdu had been recognised as the second official language in the State. He also assured to hold a review meeting on the functioning of the Waqf Board soon.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ts-will-do-more-than-impose-stay-on-npr-kcr/article31083741.ece

BJP’s lone MLA Raja Singh said the Centre had repeatedly clarified that not a single individual would be affected by the exercise which was aimed at providing citizenship to refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The issue was however being politicised while vested interests were trying for political gains by inciting violence.

227,2020/03/16,"KCR defends opposition to CAA, NPR, NRC","MIM and Congress support resolution

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has defended the government’s opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) claiming that the Act is considered as prelude to the National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The exercise on the NPR which commenced during former Prime Minister late Atal Behari Vajpayee in 2003 was abandoned later in 2011 as it was considered as a failed experiment. The previous UPA government had said on the floor of Parliament that the programme was failure as the document base was poor especially in the rural areas. The Chief Minister, who moved a resolution against the CAA, NPR and NRC in the Legislative Assembly, advised the Centre against moving ahead with the exercise in haste as isolation of a particular section was not in the interests of the country.

The exercise on CAA and related issued had attracted national and international attention and brought disrepute to the country. “What will be left of the image of the country internationally?” he questioned adding it was not just an issue for particular communities, but was the one concerning social fabric of the country.

He pointed out that while Union Home Minister Amit Shah repeatedly claimed that there was no proposal for taking up the NRC exercise in the country and the Home Ministry’s annual report made it crystal clear that NPR was the first step towards preparation of NRC. “How will people believe? Why should there be double standards on the issue?” he asked.

‘Seeking clarification’

The Chief Minister said the government was seeking clarification on the apprehensions that were prevailing among the people and that triggering panic among the marginal and vulnerable sections was “unwarranted”. The government was prepared to cooperate with the Centre if it was prepared to come up with a new formula that was acceptable to all.

He faulted the comments like “goli maro” made by the BJP members on those agitating against the CAA, NPR and NRC and said such comments were uncalled for and the civilized society would not tolerate such derisive remarks.

Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi said the exercise was aimed at dividing and weakening the country and it was not just against Muslims, but was against the poor, illiterate and vulnerable sections cutting across the caste and religious lines. “The Centre wants to make non-citizens as citizens of the country and citizens as non-citizens in the name of CAA and related exercise,” he alleged.

No legal backing

He lamented that several innocent people were killed in the aftermath of announcement of the exercise on CAA, NPR and NRC claiming that there was no scope for violence had the Centre not brought forth the CAA, NPR and NRC. People were being separated and a sense of hatred was being created in the name of the exercise which could turn out to be a crushing blow to Dalits, tribes and other vulnerable sections.

He urged the Chief Minister to stay the process of NPR which was expected to be taken up along with the Census work as NPR and NRC did not have statutory or legal backing. The rules of NPR enable people to object the inclusion of names in the register and this could in turn result in the names of people included in the doubtful list. “Those in the doubtful category will have to survive at the mercy of those in power,” he said.

Congress floor leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka said the Centre’s moves were against the Constitution and the party welcomed the resolution introduced in the Assembly. But mere introduction of the resolution would not suffice and the government should issue specific orders preventing the employees from taking up NPR work. “The issue should be taken to its logical end. The government should issue specific orders on the lines of Kerala,” he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/kcr-defends-opposition-to-caa-npr-nrc/article31083710.ece
228,2020/03/16,Shabbir welcomes TS Assembly resolution,"Expresses doubts over KCR’s stand on NPR

Welcoming the passing of resolution against CAA, NPR and NRC in Telangana Legislative Assembly on Monday, former minister and ex-leader of Opposition in Telangana Legislative Council Mohammed Ali Shabbir said that Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao has failed to make his stand clear on the issue.

“In the six page resolution, the operational part is of only three sentences which lack clarity on whether or not the CAA would be implemented in Telangana. Further, there is no mention or direct request for stalling the NPR and NRC related activities in the State,” Mr. Shabbir said in a statement issued here.

“Telangana government has only urged the Centre to amend the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 in order to remove all references to any religion or any foreign country. But it did not register its objection in open words. As openly stated by other chief ministers, Chief Minister Chandrasekhar Rao did not make a clear announcement that he would not implement CAA, NRC and NPR in Telangana,” he said.

Mr. Shabbir said that the State Legislative Assembly could not confine itself to ‘expressing concern’ over the proposed implementation of NPR & NRC. As per the resolution, the House, urged the Government of Telangana to take all necessary steps to safeguard the people from exercises such as NPR & NRC. He pointed out that the Kerala government has issued a GO MS No. 247 Dated 20-12-2019 stalling all NPR activities in the State. “Instead of delivering an hour long speech, KCR should have made one specific announcement that CAA, NPR & NRC would not be implemented in Telangana. However, KCR once again used his oratory skills to cheat the people,” he said.

Mr. Shabbir demanded that the State government immediately issue a GO stalling all NPR-related activities until the Central government makes required amendments in the rules. Further, he said that the Chief Minister should issue a statement announcing that contentious CAA, NPR and NRC would not be implemented in Telangana. He demanded that all cases registered against those who participated in peaceful protest against CAA must be withdrawn unconditionally.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ufin5c/article31085163.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY17SHABIR1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/shabbir-welcomes-ts-assembly-resolution/article31083491.ece

According to the police, three persons were killed and two were injured when a car coming from the Shamshabad airport hit a lorry parked on the roadside at Narsingi. They were returning from the airport after sending off their relative Ravi, who went to work in Dubai. Three persons – E. Krishna (28), Phani Anjaneyulu (25) and P.

231,2020/03/16,Turmeric ryots face problem of plenty,"Huge stocks, impending bad weather lowering price of produce

An overcast sky has added to the worries of turmeric farmers in Nizamabad, who have transported large quantities of the produce to the agriculture market yard.

According to sources, huge quantities of turmeric are coming to the yard in the current season. In contrast to normal days, when 10,000 to 15,000 bags used to come daily, now, about 60,000 bags are reaching the yard from Nirmal and Jagityal.

As a result, the price of turmeric is going down. It is between ₹4,000 and ₹5,200 per quintal, which is a disappointing news for the farmers, who invested large amounts of money to raise the eight-month long crop. And, though the e-NAM was launched two years ago, upcountry traders are still not interested to trade online.

While farmers are awaiting help from the Central and State governments to get a good price, there is no response from the authorities. Farmers, who have demanded an MSP of ₹15,000 per quintal, are hoping to earn at least ₹8,000 per quintal to meet their costs.

Sudhala Gangaram, a farmer from Tadapakala of Ergatla mandal, brought in 22 quintals to the yard on Wednesday and is waiting for the ‘best price’. He said that he planted the crop in his one acre land and spent about ₹1 lakh for all costs. “However, the rate in the market is very disheartening,” he said.

Even as the market yard turned yellow with huge mounds of turmeric, farmers are eagerly waiting for clearance of stocks before it rains and damages their produce. “The price is very low, lower than last year. I am unable to get back even the coolie and fertilizer costs. Wages of workers have gone up and fertilizer has become dear,” deplores Aggu Chukkanna of Mendora in Bheemgal mandal.

Manthani Ganga Reddy of Manthani village says that the highest price is ₹5,000 per quintal. “I got ₹4,700 for my ‘erraguntu’ variety,” he said.

When asked, the authorities said that they have been trying to link all the markets in the country to e-NAM and promote direct purchase. With direct purchase, there won’t be any such problems, they said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pbsu5y/article31077147.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-NZM-TURMERIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/turmeric-ryots-face-problem-of-plenty/article31077128.ece

233,2020/03/16,"With Jyotiraditya’s entry, the BJP-Scindia connect is complete","The family patronised Hindu Mahasabha, funded Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s education and laid the base of BJP

V.D. Savarkar’s acrimonious dressing down of the Scindias in his early 20th century writings couldn’t foretell, and rather runs in sharp contrast to, Jyotiraditya joining BJP, a political outfit inspired by his Hindutva thought, a century later. By embracing the only member left out of the party for 18 years, the erstwhile royal family’s decades-old unmistakable link with the BJP has reached its denouement. His aunt Yashodhara, welcoming him, announced: “This is ghar wapsi (homecoming) for him.”

Savarkar’s view

In his 1909 text The Indian War of Independence, Savarkar is particularly miffed at Scindia ruler Jayaji of Gwalior for joining hands with the British during the 1857 revolt. At this, he wrote, people rose in fury. “If Scindia does not wish to fight, we shall fight...will run to liberate her [motherland] without you.” Describing him as a “traitor” and “coward” who betrayed Rani Laxmi Bai of Jhansi, he wrote: “If the Scindia is not for the country, drag him down from his throne.”

Also read: A royal somersault: On Jyotiraditya Scindia’s defection

Remarkably, Savarkar softens his rage towards the Scindias on the eve of the Independence, as Hindu Mahasabha, a political party influenced by Hindutva, begins gaining a toehold in the Madhya Bharat, composed of 25 erstwhile princely states that merged into Madhya Pradesh later. Incidentally, the Scindias were its chief patrons. Christophe Jaffrelot in Religion, Caste and Politics in India notes that Jivaji, grandfather of Jyotiraditya, had been “willing to patronise” a movement which invoked the Maratha empire with pride, as it could help counter Congress influence locally. In Royal to Public Life, Vijaya Raje Scindia wrote that her husband, Jivaji, had “strong faith in the politics and programs of Hindu Mahasabha.”

The socio-economic reforms, explains Jaffrelot, including the abolition of the jagirdari and the zamindari system, announced by the Congress after independence aroused anxieties among princes. “In organising resistance, they had already placed themselves within the confines of the Mahasabha, or resorted to it as a political mouthpiece,” a phenomenon which became evident especially in Madhya Bharat.

Ironically, the Scindia family’s initiation into electoral politics was with Vijaya Raje trouncing P.V.G. Deshpande, the Mahasabha’s president, on a Congress ticket by 60,000 votes on the Guna Lok Sabha seat during the 1957 election, a victory that, however, bruised her pride immensely. “I was thus responsible,” she wrote in her autobiography The Last Maharani of Gwalior, “for throttling a party with which I and my husband had much in common...so began my long pilgrimage in politics, against my will.” The contest was a necessity for Vijaya, eager to quell “rumours” of her husband’s association with the Mahasabha, but for Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, her 10-year stint with the Congress was a probable means at clawing back at its base eroding to the Mahasabha.

But Hindutva inklings of the Scindias can be largely attributed to the Angre clan, whose Chandrojirao Angre, the second-most richest jagirdar in the Gwalior estate, aided and advised Jivaji; later his son Sambhajirao Angre became an associate of Vijaya Raje, and set up the local Hindu Sabha in Gwalior, which was visited by Savarkar in 1938. Jaffrelot points out that C. Angre, who was “a powerful patron of Mahasabha”, by October 1951 had assembled about 40 jagirdars and petty rulers to contest elections on Hindu Mahasabha ticket from Madhya Bharat, Bhopal, Vindhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Outside Central India, the Mahasabha was confronting an electoral rout in the 1950s.

“The Sardar holds the Rajmata in an awe and respect which has not dimmed with time. She in turn looks to him for advice and guidance,” wrote William Dalrymple in The Age of Kali: Indian Travels and Encounters of S.Angre, “They make a good team: he is dry, sober and practical as she is mystical and quixotic.”

When Vijaya Raje joined the Jana Sangh in 1971, and later became a founding-member of the BJP, Angre provided her with the necessary ideological base, but he also became reason for the rift with her son, Madhavrao, who joined the Congress after leaving the Jana Sangh, never to look back, charting a different course from sisters Vasundhara and Yashodhara.

By now, taking to Angre’s moorings, Vijaya Raje at a meeting of the VHP in 1968 declared: “The greatest need of the time is to make our people understand the true meaning of Hindutva.” In addition, when M.S. Golwalkar, former RSS Sarsanghchalak died in 1973, Vijaya Raje stated he left when the nation needed him the most. “This is our country’s misfortune.”

Crucial link

Another crucial link with the BJP for Scindias is former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. To pursue higher studies in Kanpur, he was funded by the Scindias, “whom he naturally revered,” wrote Ullekh N.P. in The Untold Vajpayee: Politician and Paradox.

He worked with Jivaji after studies, as the Rs. 75-a-month scholarship was offered on the condition the beneficiaries would work with the erstwhile ruler for at least three years after studies.

In 1984, Vajpayee was “up against his own mentor’s son” Madhavrao in the Lok Sabha election from Gwalior, and defeated, switched to contesting from Lucknow thereafter.

In 1992, when the Babri Masjid was being torn down, wrote William Dalrymple in The Age of Kali: Indian Travels and Encounters, Vijaya Raje, who had earlier signed a written pledge to the High Court guaranteeing the mosque’s safety, “stood on the viewing platform, cheering an enthusiastically as if she was a football fan watching her team win the World Cup”. The Liberhan Commission report in 2009 named Vijaya Raje, who died in 2001, besides Vajpayee and 66 others, culpable for leading the country to the brink of communal discord after the mosque’s demolition.

Father’s legacy

Four-time MP Jyotiraditya Scindia bore his father’s legacy after his death in a plane crash in 2001, and had carried his resolve to stick to the Congress until now. The Mahasabha and the RSS have clung onto the Gwalior-Chambal belt, a Scindia stronghold.

Jaffrelot points out that the Jana Sangh, BJP’s predecessor, had discovered backing of princes had disadvantages, for once their privileges and purse had been abolished, “their interest in backing the opposition evaporated and they returned to where power lay”. Mr. Scindia, after switching over to the BJP, which is in power in the Centre, was made its Rajya Sabha nominee from the State, and is eyeing a portfolio at the Centre.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/q5t94a/article31085127.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE16-SCINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/with-jyotiradityas-entry-the-bjp-scindia-connect-is-complete/article31085128.ece

After the Union government declared masks and hand sanitisers as essential commodities, the Haryana government has ordered its officials across all districts to carry out operations against black marketing and over pricing amid the COVID-19 outbreak.

Issuing directions to the District Food Supplies Controllers (DFSC), the Director of the State’s Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs has asked officials to inspect chemists and drug wholesalers to ensure availability of products at reasonable prices.

“As district head of consumer affairs in their district, the DFSC and their subordinate inspection staff shall visit chemist shops, pharmacies, drug wholesalers to check their stock of masks and hand sanitisers. Hoarding and refusal to dispense shall be reported and acted against,” said the order.

Notably, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution had regulated the production, quality, distribution, logistics of masks (2ply & 3ply surgical masks, N95 masks) and hand sanitisers for COVID-19 management.

Meanwhile, Chandigarh on Monday decided to put a ban on gathering of more than 100 people in the city. Besides, cinema halls, gymnasiums, swimming pools, pubs, spas, video gaming centres, shopping malls and coaching centres will also be closed till March 31.

Atul Garg, Minister of State for Medical and Health in the Uttar Pradesh government, said on Monday that strict action would be taken against those chemists who sell masks and sanitisers at more than the maximum retail price. District authorities have suspended licences of five chemists for selling masks and sanitisers at 8 to 10 times the regular price.

After surveying government hospitals in Ghaziabad designated for possible COVID-19 patients, Mr. Garg said the situation was under control in the State.

“Strict orders have been passed under the epidemic Act and those who do not follow them would be prosecuted. District Magistrates would ensure that nobody indulges in black marketing of masks and sanitisers,” he said. He also urged citizens to present themselves for testing if they show symptoms of infection. Multiplexes, single-screen theatres, gyms and clubs have been shut down in the district till March 31.

He further said five new sample testing centres were being opened in the State. Right now, labs at the King George Medical College, Lucknow, and Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Aligarh, have the facility to test samples for COVID-19. Mr. Garg said this facility will soon be extended to BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur, and Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi. “In 75 districts of the State, isolation wards with a total of 820 beds have been earmarked for such patients,” he said.

The inquiry by IIT-Kanpur into a complaint against recitation of Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s poem ‘Hum Dekhenge’ on the campus by a student during anti-CAA protests has been “closed” after he accepted that he should not have done it at that time, an official of the institute said.

The inquiry committee has recommended “counselling” of those involved in the incident, the institute’s Deputy Director Manindra Agarwal said.

“We did not have to go into Faiz poem’s interpretation. The person, who read the poem accepted that he should not have recited it at that time and also expressed regret in case anybody’s sentiments were hurt. The matter is closed,” Mr. Agarwal, who was heading the six-member committee, said.

He said that the report was submitted last week and it was concluded that the time and place was not the most suitable to recite the poem, adding that the committee has recommended to “counsel” those involved in the controversy.

On December 17, a peaceful protest was held by about 300 students of the premier institute at its premises to express solidarity with their peers at Jamia Millia Islamia, as they were not allowed to go out due to enforcement of prohibitory orders under Section 144 of, CrPC in the city.

The Punjab Cabinet on Monday held a meeting to take stock of the situation arising out of the COVID-19 outbreak and gave ex-post facto approval to the Chief Minister’s decision on extending the services of retiring doctors and paramedical staff working with the State’s health and family welfare department.

An official statement said that their services have been extended till September 30, for which a resolution was passed at the meeting as the Cabinet reviewed the reports of the 7-member Group of Ministers, constituted under the chairmanship of Local Bodies Minister Brahm Mohindra, to oversee the preventive measures undertaken to combat the threat.

Chief Minister Amarinder Singh later talking to journalists reiterated the total elimination of all kinds of mafia and monopoly in the State.

A Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act (TADA) court on Monday framed charges against separatist JKLF chief Yasin Malik and six others in a 30-year-old militant attack case that left four Indian Air Force officials dead in Srinagar in 1990 .

Refusing to take any defence lawyer in the case, Malik, however, pleaded “not guilty” in the case.

Special Judge NIA Subhash Gupta observed that the prima facie evidence “can safely be considered as incriminating material against all the accused”.

The court mentioned the CBI chargesheet, including documentary and oral confessional evidence recorded under Section 164 of CrPC and Section 15 of TADA, as it framed the charges. “It (evidence) can safely be considered as incriminating material against all the accused... and they further confessed that in furtherance of which, crime was committed by them in the present matter”.

‘Don’t plead guilty’

“I do not plead guilty. It is a fabricated case,” Malik told the court. Sources said the JKLF chief has refused to have anyone as his defence lawyer in the case. He has also questioned reopening of the case after 30 years. Judge Gupta read out the charges to Malik who is lodged in the Tihra Jail, through videoconferencing.

The charges have been framed under sections of Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act and the Arms Act of the Ranbir Penal Code. The court will again hear the case on March 30.

“The court has framed charges against all the seven accused, including Yasin Malik and Showkat Bakshi, lodged in Tihar and Ambedkar Nagar jails,” additional public prosecutor Rakesh Singh, representing the Central Bureau of Investigation said.

239,2020/03/16,U.P. government seeks more time to file compliance report,"Allahabad High Court had ordered removal of ‘name and shame’ posters

The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday moved an application before the Allahabad High Court, seeking more time to file a compliance report in the matter related to the ‘name and shame’ posters of anti-CAA protesters.

In the application, the State government contended that a special leave petition (SLP) against the March 9 decision of the High Court is pending before the Supreme Court, which has referred the matter to a larger Bench.

Hence, in this backdrop of the situation, further time was sought by the State government for the filing of the compliance report till the matter is finally adjudicated by the apex court, said Additional Advocate General Neeraj Tripathi.

The Uttar Pradesh government moved the Supreme Court on Wednesday challenging the Allahabad High Court order directing the State administration to remove posters of those accused of vandalism during anti-CAA protests.

The Allahabad High Court had ordered the immediate removal of the roadside posters in Lucknow, observing that the police action was an “unwarranted interference” in privacy of people.

The Bench of Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Ramesh Sinha also directed the District Magistrate and the Lucknow Police Commissioner to submit a compliance report on or before March 16 and asked the Uttar Pradesh government not to install such posters “without having the authority of law”.

Shaming protesters

240,2020/03/16,Fears mount in rural Odisha as migrant workers return home,"For the past one week, the return of plumbers from different parts of country has unnerved the local villagers and left them fretting about their health in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Remote villages in migration prone Kendrapara and many western Odisha districts are in the grip of mounting anxiety as migrant labourers begin to return home from States affected by the COVID-19 virus outbreak.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India | State Helpline numbers

Kendrapara is popularly dubbed as the plumbing capital of India for the skilled plumbers it exports both to other parts of India and some overseas labour markets.

For the past one week, the return of plumbers from different parts of country has unnerved the local villagers and left them fretting about their health in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.

“As activities came to a halt in different cities due to coronavirus scare, jobless plumbers have started returning to their homes,” said Ardendu Rout, a resident of Pokhariapada locality of Pattamundai town in Kendrapara. “We don’t know if they were screened at bus terminals or railway stations. If one person tests positive for coronavirus, it would have catastrophic impact in the region,” he added.

Meanwhile, the Kendrapara district administration has announced that 250 panchayat buildings will be converted to isolation centres.

Kerala, where the country’s first COVID-19 case was officially reported, imports workers for its plywood industries from Kendrapara and other coastal districts of Odisha. The return of migrant workers from outside the State is matter of concern both for fellow villagers and the local administration.

“When developed countries have failed to contain COVID-19 despite having much improved healthcare service system, we will be left to die if the coronavirus spreads in the community,” said Shankar Charan Parida, a native of Padanipala village in the Aul block of the coastal district. “We don’t have adequate doctors and paramedical workforce to look after people,” he added.

Hundreds of migrant labourers from Bhadrak, Balangir and Bargarh districts work in the spinning mills of Tamil Nadu.

“Although they work in clusters and are relatively safe, workers want to be with their families at times of crisis,” observed Umi Daniel, a renowned expert on migration issues. “They would definitely return and we should be prepared to face the situation. There should be adequate screening facilities at bus terminals and railway stations,” he added.

Mr. Daniel said, “community should be made aware about importance of sharing information on migrant labourers returning home. If we push panic button unnecessarily, families of migrant labourers would be discriminated in their own villages. Even the possibility of migrant workers being physically driven out of their villages cannot be ruled out.”

About three lakh people, including women and minor children, from six to seven western Odisha districts work in brick kilns outside the State. These seasonal migrant workers usually return in the month of May and June. In light of the coronavirus scare, there are apprehension that they too may return earlier.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/36o6bp/article31085176.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16IN-VIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fears-mount-in-rural-odisha-as-migrant-workers-return-home/article31085059.ece
241,2020/03/16,Rajasthan moves Supreme Court against CAA,"Says the citizenship law is against the country’s secular fabric and violated fundamental rights

The Congress government in Rajasthan on Monday moved the Supreme Court challenging the validity of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) contending that the law was against the country’s secular fabric and violated fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. Rajasthan is the second State after Kerala to challenge the CAA in the top court.

The Left Democratic Front government of Kerala had on January 13 filed the plea under Article 131 seeking declaration of the CAA as violative of constitutional provisions.

Article 131

The Rajasthan government’s suit under Article 131, filed through Additional Advocate General Manish Singhvi, said the States had a stake in the impugned Central legislation because it was going to affect the citizens by its arbitrary provisions. “It is a dispute between the Centre and the State that needs to be adjudicated by the highest court of the land,” said the petition.

The plea sought declaration of the CAA as “ultra vires to the provisions of the Constitution and void.” It said the CAA, with its provision to grant citizenship on the basis of religious identity, violated Articles 14 (equality before law), 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) and 25 (freedom of religion) of the Constitution.

The suit contended that the classification of migrants and countries in the CAA was not based on any “intelligible differentiation” and had no “rational nexus” with the purported objective of the Act.

Assembly resolution

The State Assembly’s resolution passed on January 25 urging the Union government to repeal the CAA was also appended to the petition. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who has been strongly critical of the NDA government’s move, had said during the debate in the House that it was the Centre’s duty to keep the federal structure strong and it should not make it a prestige issue.

The Arunachal Pradesh government on Monday decided to “keep in abeyance” the survey work for a road through the Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR). The project had attracted criticism from wildlife activists, film personalities and political leaders.

A 40km stretch of the ‘East-West Industrial Corridor’ road proposed to connect Seijosa in Pakke Kessang district and Bhalukpong in West Kameng district of the State passes through PTR, a biodiversity hotspot of the eastern Himalayas.

“We cannot afford to destroy our planet’s natural wealth. All survey work for the proposed road through PTR is kept in abeyance following an initial review meeting with the Chief Secretary, and Commissioner-Public Works Department (PWD) today [Monday],” the State’s Chief Minister Pema Khandu said.

He also said that local stakeholders would be part of the next review meeting on the road project.

Seijosa-based environment activist Tana Jorjo Tara had through a Right to Information (RTI) petition raised the alarm over the proposed road through PTR. The Hindu had reported the development in February.

‘Most protected’

Mr. Khandu observed that PTR, home to over 2,000 species of plants, 300 species of birds, 40 species of mammals, 30 species of amphibians and 36 species of reptiles, is one of the most protected sanctuaries in the country and the pride and treasure of Arunachal Pradesh.

“As many species of flora and fauna are globally threatened, and PTR is one of the last remaining strongholds left for these species, we are committed to preserving it for our coming generations. We are aware that any infrastructural development that can be detrimental to the tiger reserve in the future need to be considered seriously before proposing it,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/rvx3u4/article30959201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE02KHANDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/arunachal-puts-off-survey-of-road-through-tiger-reserve/article31084883.ece

244,2020/03/16,Coronavirus | Gujarat Congress MLAs stage walkout in Assembly,"They demanded postponement of the ongoing Budget session due to COVID-19 threat.

Opposition Congress MLAs staged a walkout in the Gujarat Assembly on Monday after the Speaker refused to accept their demand to postpone the ongoing Budget session due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) threat.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

The ruling BJP had opposed the demand claiming the Congress was running scared due to five of its MLAs quitting ahead of the March 26 Rajya Sabha polls.

Congress MLA from Ahmedabad’s Danilimda, Shailesh Parmar, requested Speaker Rajendra Trivedi to postpone the Budget session, scheduled to end on March 31, and resume it when the virus scare dies down.

Backing Mr. Parmar’s demand, Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani said the session could be postponed as discussions on the Budget had been completed, adding that the government had already announced closure of schools, colleges, cinema halls and other places attracting footfalls.

He also cited the example of neighbouring Maharashtra where the Budget session ended ahead of schedule.

However, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani opposed the demand saying such a move would send the wrong message to people amid the coronavirus threat.

Mr. Rupani claimed the Congress was more concerned about the crisis rising from five of its MLAs resigning ahead of the RS polls, and, therefore, was making the postponement demand.

“We should stay back here and worry about the people of the State. If we run away scared, then what will happen to citizens? This is why, as public representatives, we should not be scared, but care about people,” the CM said.

“Their demand for suspension is more due to “todona” [break up] [play on the word corona and a reference to the quitting of MLAs] scare because of the upcoming Rajya Sabha election. If you want to go to Jaipur, its your will. But what will public do if we get scared of coronavirus? We should continue with our work,” he said.

Speaking on the issue, Mr. Dhanani said, “Discussions on the Budget, which took place for four days, is complete, and we are ready for discussions on government policies or programmes if required. We are even ready to stay awake at night if there is a need in order to take up remaining work.”

Mr. Dhanani said his party had postponed its ‘Dandi Yatra’ event, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi March 22 programme in Gandhinagar had also been pushed back due to the virus threat.

Speaker Trivedi refused to accept the Congress’ demand saying preventive measures were being taken, and the State government was doing whatever was required at its level.

Mr. Trivedi told MLAs sanitisers had been placed at the gallery of the House, and visits by groups into the complex had been banned.

“The Opposition is worried about it [coronavirus threat], and so is the government. Now that the Budget session is going on, and the calendar is decided....I believe we are sitting in the temple of democracy, and messages go out from it.....The government will take all precautions required for coronavirus,” the Speaker said.

After their demand was rejected, Congress legislators indulged in sloganeering and walked out of the Assembly, with several BJP MLAs mockingly waving them good bye.

The Speaker then quipped that the Congress legislators would be back (in the Assembly) tomorrow.

245,2020/03/16,Pandemic sparks foreigner phobia in Assam,"Meghalaya suspends Assembly’s Budget session, Nagaland bars entry of tourists

Fears of COVID-19 have triggered foreigner phobia in Assam, one of the States that is yet to report a confirmed case of the virus infection.

A day after a Swiss couple was heckled in western Assam’s Dhubri, people in central Assam’s Nagaon district raised an alarm when three French cyclists neared their village. The trio had come from Myanmar via Manipur and Nagaland.

Watch | COVID-19: Dos and don'ts from the Health Ministry

“This happened when the cyclists reached a village near Kathiatoli on Sunday evening,” a local police officer said on Monday. “We stopped them under public pressure and sent them to the civil hospital for a health check,” added the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

For want of any other vehicle, the trio were made to board a mini truck and sent to the hospital where doctors said they neither had fever nor cough and did not show any symptoms of any disease.

On Saturday, the police in Dhubri had to rescue a couple from Switzerland from local people who believed they were carriers of the virus. The couple had booked a room at an ashram belonging to a temple on the banks of the Brahmaputra in the town.

On March 12, a Greek woman had a difficult time in Majuli, a sandbar on the Brahmaputra, when she was refused transport by local three-wheeler transport operators for fear of contracting COVID-19. A Spanish man also had a tough time that day when hotels in southern Assam’s Silchar refused him a room.

“We appeal to the people to exercise restraint,” said Jayanta Malla Baruah, chairman of Assam Tourism Development Corporation. “We cannot let the fear of a virus harm the hospitable image of Assam,” Mr. Baruah added.

Foreign tourists are not the only ones to face harassment. In Dhubri district, for instance, some villages have turned against those who have returned from Kerala, Mumbai, Bengaluru and other States following the outbreak of COVID-19 there.

“We have tracked a few such returnees and tested the health of their families,” sub-divisional health officer A.K. Azad told newspersons. “They have all tested negative,” he added.

Teachers for awareness

Apart from schools, cinema halls, gyms and sports facilities, the Assam government on Monday ordered the closure of all national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and Guwahati’s zoo till March 31.

“We have set up a COVID-19 testing laboratory each in the medical colleges of Guwahati, Dibrugarh and Jorhat,” Assam Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said, adding that none of the more than 600 people checked so far had tested positive.

He also said that the teachers of all State-run schools and colleges, shut till March 29 as a precautionary measure, had been entrusted with creating awareness in the villages. “We are utilising their break from teaching for awareness, which is of utmost importance in keeping coronavirus at bay,” he added.

Among those who have been quarantined in hospitals on the suspicion that they may be infected are two Nigerians, who had entered the country from Bangladesh. The two have been admitted to the isolation ward of Karimganj Civil Hospital in southern Assam.

Assembly session deferred

Barring Manipur, which had taken the lead, all the north-eastern States on Monday ordered the closure of educational institutions and other public facilities where a large number of people gather as a step for “beating the virus”.

Meghalaya Assembly Speaker Metbah Lyngdoh on Monday suspended the Budget session of the 60-member House indefinitely. The session, which began on March 13, was originally scheduled to run till March 25.

246,2020/03/16,AHRC notice seeks health condition of peasant leader Akhil Gogoi,"AHRC member Deva Kumar Saikia issued the notice after taking cognisance of a complaint filed by All Assam Law Student Union Vice-President Debashish Medhi.

The Assam Human Rights Commission (AHRC) on Monday issued a notice to the Central Jail, Guwahati, asking it to submit a report on the health condition of peasant leader Akhil Gogoi who was arrested on December 27 last year for his alleged role in violence during anti-CAA protests.

AHRC member Deva Kumar Saikia issued the notice after taking cognisance of a complaint filed by All Assam Law Student Union Vice-President Debashish Medhi.

The jail superintendent was directed to submit a detailed report on the health condition of Akhil Gogoi, adviser of peasant body Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), and the steps taken so far for his treatment within a month of receipt of the notice.

In his complaint, Mr. Medhi said Mr. Gogoi, who is also an RTI activist, was suffering from various ailments but he was not provided with proper food and timely treatment.

He also accused the jail authorities of purposely caused delay in taking the peasant leader to a hospital which amounts to violation of human rights.

Earlier this month, a team of doctors met Mr. Gogoi in the jail following a directive by an NIA court to the jail authorities to furnish a detailed report of his health condition after his wife approached the court praying for his proper treatment.

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has registered a case against Mr. Gogoi under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. He is currently in judicial custody.

Mr. Gogoi was taken to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital when he fell ill a day before he and three other KMSS leaders were scheduled to launch an indefinite fast in the jail from March one against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). The stir was subsequently called off.

A series of tests were conducted on the RTI activist in the hospital and was taken back to the jail later.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/aox5hy/article30783391.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26-AKHIL-GOGOI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ahrc-notice-seeks-health-condition-of-peasant-leader-akhil-gogoi/article31083642.ece
247,2020/03/16,Coronavirus: West Bengal invokes Epidemic Diseases Act,"Closure of educational institutions extended to April 15

The West Bengal government on Monday invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and extended the closure of the educational institutions from March 31 to April 15.

The Centre has advised States and Union Territories to invoke provisions of the Section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 so that all advisories being issued from time to time by are enforceable.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who held a meeting with different stakeholders, said that the Act had been invoked to ensure that people with symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) remain in isolation.

Ms. Banerjee said that the State government had created a separate fund of ₹200 crore for fighting the coronavirus. The fund will be used for purchasing masks, protective gear for medical staff, and upgrading infrastructure at health facilities.

Population density

While she maintained that there had been no case of COVID-19 infections in the State, she underlined that West Bengal has a huge population with high density. The Chief Minister said that at present there are only two testing centres in the State and urged the Centre that more testing centres should be opened. Speaking to journalists, she said that closure of educational educations would also extend to the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) centres of the State.

“I will appeal to religious leaders to avoid public gatherings. The way Belur Math [headquarters of the Ramakrishna Mission] has taken measures, I would urge other religious institutions also to do so,” Ms. Banerjee said.

The CM advised all auditoria and cinema halls to remain closed, and said all steps should be taken to restrict public gatherings. However, she said that malls and markets should not be completely closed as people would run out of supplies.

‘People will listen’

Asked whether the government would impose Section 144 of the Cr.PC to restrict gatherings, Ms. Banerjee said that she did not think such measures were required. “I think people will listen to our advice,” she said.

The Chief Minister said that she had cancelled all her administrative meetings and advised State government employees to use hand sanitisers before entering office and also while leaving home.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/acgxzx/article31043306.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THiStock-1202181414,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-west-bengal-invokes-epidemic-diseases-act/article31083238.ece

The Tripura government on Monday announced the closure of all educational institutions in an attempt to stem the spread of COVID-19. Education Minister Ratan Lal Nath announced the decision at a press conference. He said the closure would remain effective from March 17 to 31.

Chief Secretary Manoj Kumar said later that cinema halls, gymnasiums and swimming pools would also be closed. “Hostels attached to the educational institutions will get vacated from March 21 and remain locked till March 31”, he said at a press meet.

Besides, Anganwadi centres would remain closed during the period and food grains under the relevant scheme for Anganwadi students would be provided to their guardians on a regular basis, he stated.

He also spoke on the advisory the State government had received from the Bureau of Immigration (BoI), which discouraged foreign travel.

The decisions were announced after a high-level meeting chaired by Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb, which also reviewed the precautionary initiatives to check the spread of the deadly virus.

249,2020/03/16,COVID-19 cuts short Bihar House session,"Schools, colleges, coaching institutes and cinema halls have already been shut in the State till March 31

In view of the COVID-19 threat, the Bihar budget session was cut short on Monday. Opposition leaders, however, said they wished the session continued.

“The ongoing budget session of the Assembly has been cut short and there will be no sittings of the House after Monday. Debates scheduled for the remaining budgetary demands for various departments will be guillotined,” said Speaker Vijay Kumar Chaudhary.

He said the decision was taken at a meeting of the Business Advisory Committee of the House chaired by him. Mr. Chaudhary, later, adjourned the proceedings of the House till 2 p.m.

The month-long session was scheduled to last till March 31.

Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Tejashwi Yadav told journalists that the House should have continued its session. “What message will it send to the common people? When legislators are not safe [from COVID-19] what will happen to them, they will wonder… but, we have to go with the decision of the Speaker.”

Other Opposition leaders slammed the State government for inadequate medical assistance and laxity in spreading awareness about the infection. “The condition in government hospitals should improve and people in districts must be properly informed about the disease and its prevention,” said Opposition RJD and Congress MLAs.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar appealed to people not to panic. He expressed displeasure at the distribution of masks among employees of the Assembly and tersely told them not to create fear. Later, he spoke to the Speaker and Health Minister Mangal Pandey.

250,2020/03/16,Madhya Pradesh political crisis | Kamal Nath rules out floor test after meeting Governor,"Speaker N.P. Prajapati cites novel coronavirus threat; Governor asks CM Kamala Nath to hold test and prove majority by Tuesday.

Capping a day of hectic political activity, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath called on Governor Lalji Tandon at the Raj Bhavan late on Monday night. He later ruled out holding a floor test in the Assembly, claiming that his government enjoyed a majority.

The late night meeting followed a letter from the Governor directing the Nath-led Congress government to hold a floor test on Tuesday after Speaker N.P. Prajapati earlier adjourned the House till March 26 in view of the COVID-19 threat.

Also Read Kamal Nath, Tandon spar over floor test

An immediate floor test in the Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha is unlikely, as the Assembly Speaker on Monday, the first day of the Budget session, adjourned the House to March 26 in view of the novel coronavirus threat, giving a breather to the embattled Congress government.

However, the Supreme Court will on Tuesday urgently hear a petition filed by former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and nine other BJP MLAs seeking the holding of a vote of confidence on the floor of the Assembly against the Kamalnath-led government.

Also read: Uncertainty over floor test in Madhya Pradesh

After the Governor’s address, Speaker N.P. Prajapati, amid raucous scenes, announced that the session would be adjourned, giving relief to the 92 Congress MLAs, who raised slogans against the BJP thereafter in the House.

“During the Vidhan Sabha session, honourable members and people can’t be stopped from being in groups or meeting anyone,” said Mr. Prajapati. “Considering the health of the honourable members, historic steps taken by other Vidhan Sabhas, advisory issued by the Government of India and in larger public interest, the proceedings of the Vidhan Sabha have been adjourned until March 26.”

Although the BJP has moved the Supreme Court on the test, Governor Lalji Tandon on Monday wrote to Chief Minister Kamala Nath requesting him to hold the test and prove the majority by Tuesday, while “respecting constitutional and democratic values”. He wrote, “Otherwise, it will be considered at present you don’t have a majority in the Vidhan Sabha.”

Speaking with reporters after the adjournment, Mr. Nath dared the BJP to move a no-confidence motion in the Assembly. “If they want a floor test, claiming we don't have a majority, they should bring a no-confidence motion against my government. Why are they shying away from it? We will prove our majority.”

Before the adjournment announcement, Congress chief whip Govind Singh appealed to the Speaker to adjourn the proceedings owing to the disease threat, while Leader of the Opposition (LoP) Gopal Bhargava read out a letter of the Governor to the Chief Minister directing him to take the test on Monday in any condition.

“Honourable Speaker, you have been directed to hold the floor test,” said the LoP, to which Mr. Prajapati responded: “I haven’t received any direction directly from him.”

Mr. Tandon, after his address, advised the members that given the turmoil in the State those with responsibility should “work independently” and “stick to constitutional principles”.

Congress MLAs raise slogans

Meanwhile, Congress MLAs raised slogans of “bring back Congress MLAs” in the Assembly. As of Monday, 16 rebel Congress MLAs, reportedly pledging allegiance to Jyotiraditya Scindia, are still in a Bengaluru resort.

In the letter to Mr. Nath on Sunday, Mr. Tandon directed him to secure the vote of confidence of the House on Monday, in any condition, without delaying, suspending or postponing the session, as his “prima facie belief” was the government was in minority.

Mr. Nath has contended there was no point in a test as long as the 16 MLAs were held “in captivity” by the BJP in Bengaluru under the protection of the Karnataka police.

Also Read SC to hear today plea for M.P. trust vote

Late on Sunday, he said: “The decision on the test will be taken by the Speaker. The Speaker will do his job, while I’ll do mine.” Earlier, he had called upon the Governor to hold a test, on a date fixed by the Speaker.

The possibility of a test was put in doubt as the business of the House mentioned only the Governor’s address and the vote of thanks, prompting Mr. Bhargava to approach the Governor late on Sunday.

In his address, Mr. Tandon said the government was committed to keeping all its promises. “With the empty coffers it inherited, the government had the challenge to fulfil promises made in the manifesto and make the State corruption-free. Despite the challenge, the government has kept a record 365 promises in 365 days.” He read just the first of the 36-page address.

Outside the Assembly, Minister Lakhan Singh Yadav asserted that the Congress was entirely ready for a floor test.

BJP parades MLAs

Meanwhile, the BJP paraded its 106 MLAs to the Raj Bhavan to show that they had the numbers. MLA Narayan Tripathi, who in the previous budget session voted in favour of a Bill tabled by the Congress, was not a part of it.

Claiming that the government was in minority, Mr. Chouhan said, “If they had a majority, then what was the issue in having a test? But the Chief Minister knows his government is in minority and that is why he didn’t heed the Governor's direction.”

Prior to Mr. Scindia switching sides, the strength of the Congress in the Assembly was 114. As many as 22 MLAs had tendered their resignations, of which six have been accepted. Four independent, two BSP and an SP MLA had been supporting the government, at least openly before the political crisis.

After six resignations and two deaths earlier, the effective strength of the House has been reduced to 222. That makes 112 the simple majority mark. For the Kamal Nath government to win the floor test, it needs the support of at least 112 MLAs. The BJP has 107 MLAs.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/getzzy/article31080359.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI15-03-2020000078B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mp-assembly-session-live-suspense-over-floor-test/article31080509.ece

The major political parties in West Bengal have urged the State Election Commission to postpone the coming civic polls in the State in view of the COVID-19 scare. The poll panel has called a meeting on Monday with political parties to discuss the issue.

The Left and the Congress, which are likely to contest the polls together, are also willing to support the deferring of the polls.

State Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has also advised the Commission to take note of the totality of the situation while deciding the dates of the polls. “Post my interaction with the State Election Commissioner and my subsequent communication to him, I am confident the State Election Commission would take appropriate calls on dates of civic elections taking note of totality of circumstances and the contemporaneous situation,” Mr. Dhankar said.

Former Trinamool Congress MP Sugata Bose has written to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, pointing to his “failure” to read out an obituary notice for his mother and three-term member Krishna Bose, who died on February 22.

Under the rules, the Chair in both Houses informs the members of the death of any former member, and then tributes are paid.

Mr. Bose said the family informed the Lok Sabha Secretariat of her death the very next day. He said that though Parliament had been in session for the last two weeks, the Lok Sabha did not care to take note of the death of “as eminent a parliamentarian and citizen as Krishna Bose”.

Krishna Bose was the niece-in-law of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the chairperson of the Netaji Research Bureau.

“We are writing to request you not to read Shrimati Krishna Bose’s obituary notice in the Lok Sabha as it would be a meaningless ritual, and not show genuine respect to the departed soul.

A court on Sunday sent the main accused, Saurav Paul, in police custody for seven days in a horrific incident of murder and rape of a 22-year-old girl at Mohanpur near here.

256,2020/03/16,"CAA triggers fears among sex workers, transgenders","They fear that they will be thrown out of country as most of them don’t even know who their parents are

Of late, Megha, 34, has been distracted. “I am even forgetting to take medicines; it is like this fear of proving citizenship does not let me focus on anything, including my work,” said Ms. Megha, who left her home at the age of 14 and now lives with her partner near Sonagachi, the red light district of Kolkata where she works as ‘Khajrawali’, a transgender woman who works as a sex worker.

People belonging to the Hijra community, a cultural form in South Asia, take up the profession of Khajra (sex work), Challa or Mangti (begging for money in trains or on roads) and Badhai (blessing on auspicious occasions in return for money). And they all, like Megha, are in “deep stress.”

“I was already thrown out of one home, now they want to throw me out of this country too,” added Ms. Megha who has not contacted her parents ever since she left home nearly two decades ago. She fears for her safety “if she is compelled to contact them” just to prove her citizenship.

“They may just not let me enter the house, thinking I came back for the property; forget producing my birth papers,” said Ms. Megha, which is not her real name.

Megha is one among nearly 50,000 gender minorities of West Bengal, as per 2011 census, who are now running from pillar to post to collect birth certificates and related documents to establish their citizenship for the purpose of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). The actual size of the sexual minorities is far higher, experts said, and “the situation is becoming challenging by the day for each one of them,” said Aparna Banerjee, president of the West Bengal Hijra Development Society.

NHRC survey

“According to the survey done by the National Human Rights Commission of India in 2018, only 2% of transgender and Hijra population stay with their families while the rest [98%] are abandoned. How will they produce documents of their ancestors? Most of them don’t even have their own voter ID cards because it’s only a few years ago that we got the right to vote,” said Ms. Banerjee.

Smarajit Jana, founder of the Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC), a collective of sex workers, explains how the CAA is “discriminatory” and violates transgenders and sex workers’ right to reside in the country where they are born.

“In 99% cases when the family gets to know that the newborn is a transgender, that is if they have some ‘physical deformity’ indicating that they don’t belong to either of the genders, they are handed over to the ‘Guruma’ who rears them and they become part of a different community called the Hijra community. Under the CAA they have to prove that one of the parents is an Indian citizen. How will they do that when most of them don’t even know who their parents are?” said Dr. Jana.

Not only transgenders but sex workers too are worried because a large percentage does not have a connection to their family. “Moreover, children of those sex workers will also be affected,” said Dr. Jana.

Living for decades

The sex workers said Sonagachi being the biggest residential hub of the people engaged with sex trade also houses hundreds of people from sexual and gender minority communities from Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and parts of South East Asia. They are here for decades and many are “in their 70s or 80s, suffering from complex age-related diseases. How are they going to get papers?” asks a researcher, who worked in various red light areas of Kolkata.

Swati Bidhan Barua, a transgender lawyer from Assam (where the NRC has already been implemented), points out how the process of the National Register of Citizens is anti-transgender community in its technical aspects.

“The process was not at all inclusive for the transgender community, in the first application there are three options specified under Gender: Male/Female/Others, but in the second application — claims and objections application, after one doesn’t find their name in the first draft, the sex quota is absent,” Ms. Barua said.

“More than 5,000 transgenders have been excluded and the 10,000-15,000 people who were able to get their names included, their gender is marked as male and not as ‘other’,” said Ms. Barua, who has filed an intervention application in the Supreme Court herself albeit “without any result.”

“They are losing their identity for which they have fought for so long,” said Ms. Bidhan.

“The order will come into immediate effect,” district Magistrate Abhishek Prakash said in the order.

In a tweet, the administration also said the recreational and public centres named above were being closed as a “preventive activity”.

The order came in as the number of positive cases in Uttar Pradesh climbed to 13 with the lastest case from Agra, which now has eight positive cases. The other positive cases are from Ghaziabad (2), Lucknow (2) and Noida (1).

The State has so far sent 762 samples for testing, of which 677 were found negative while other results are awaited, the Directorate of Health Services said on Sunday evening.

258,2020/03/16,"COVID-19: as poultry farmers’ losses mount, leaders seek proactive intervention from govt.","AIKS, SSS seek subsidy to help farmers tide over crisis, urge State to intensify efforts to dispel misconceptions linking meat consumption to novel coronavirus

As losses facing Maharashtra’s poultry farmers keep mounting, farmers’ leaders in the State have urged for proactive action from the government to dispel rumours linking COVID-19 to poultry.

Estimating that the poultry industry’s losses had well exceeded ₹500 crore in a matter of weeks, farmers’ leaders like Dr. Ajit Nawale of the All Indian Kisan Sabha (AIKS) and Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) chief Raju Shetti have urged that the government announce some subsidy to poultry farmers to help them tide over the current crisis.

“Thanks to the widely spread misconception that chickens are the wellspring of the novel coronavirus, poultry prices have plummeted to a startling low of ₹5 to ₹10 per kg. Chicken farmers in Maharashtra and neighbouring States like Karnataka find themselves in the grip of a grave crisis,” Dr. Nawale told The Hindu.

Given that the estimated input cost in raising a live chicken weighing 1 kg is ₹75, while a 3 kg chicken costs the farmer ₹215, he urged the State government to actively consider waiving the input cost of poultry farmers to help them surmount this rough patch.

He said the COVID-19 pandemic has had a knock-on effect on farmers growing maize and soybean, essential ingredients which respectively constitute 60% and 25% of poultry feed.

“Prices of maize have plummeted from ₹22 to ₹12 in districts like Nashik and Aurangabad. More seriously, the poultry industry is a source of employment for thousands in the rural hinterland, who have taken up poultry farming as they found agriculture to be economically unfeasible,” Dr. Nawale said.

Mr. Shetti said in the past few weeks, poultry farmers in Kolhapur district alone, which has around 4,500 poultry farms, have suffered losses in excess of ₹15 crore. He said the average wholesale per kg rate of chicken has more than halved as a result of a single rumour linking poultry to COVID-19.

“From ₹110 per kg, chicken is being sold at half price, and many times as low as ₹25-30 per kg. Thanks to such baseless and unfounded rumours, people are turning their backs on chicken, eggs and meat. This misconception has proved catastrophic for the poultry industry, which is a source of employment to many rural youths in this region,” Mr. Shetti said.

Dr. Nawale and Mr. Shetti emphasised the need for the government to intensify its efforts at the district and taluka levels by conducting sustained awareness campaigns to dispel misleading rumours linking poultry to the coronavirus.

Mr. Shetti said poultry farmers should be given assistance of ₹50 per chicken as they face the very real threat of being run out of business if the harmful trend continues. Dr. Nawale said the AIKS will hold a meeting of poultry farmers in Aurangabad district on Monday to review the situation and present their demands before the government.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/z6dssu/article31077744.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BMPOULTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/covid-19-as-poultry-farmers-losses-mount-leaders-seek-proactive-intervention-from-govt/article31077745.ece
259,2020/03/16,"Four cases in Pimpri-Chinchwad without travel history worrisome, says Pune Divisional Commissioner","The patients in Pimpri-Chinchwad contracted infection from relatives.

The man from Pimpri-Chinchwad who tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday is the sixth positive case in the township within a 24-hour span. Three women and two men had tested positive for the infection on Saturday.

The six are among the nine people to test positive thus far in the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation limits. Besides, seven people have tested positive in the Pune Municipal Corporation limits so far.

The man who was found to be infected on Sunday has a travel history to Japan. Pune Divisional Commissioner Dr. Deepak Mhaisekar said his swab sample was sent for testing on March 14.

Dr. Mhaisekar said “it is worrisome” that four of the five Pimpri-Chinchwad patients from Saturday had no history of foreign travel and had contracted the infection from their relatives who had travelled abroad.

The fifth patient had gone to Thailand with 93 others, and the authorities are tracking the other members of the group.

Urging people not to step out of their homes needlessly, Dr. Mhaisekar said the district administration was mulling over imposing Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code in certain places in the city to discourage assembly.

He said that at present, 57 patients are in isolation at Naidu Infectious Disease Hospital. “Till date, we have sent 315 samples to the National Institute of Virology for testing. We have thus far received the reports of 294 samples, of which 16 have tested positive while the remaining have tested negative. The results of 21 samples are awaited,” he said.

He added that 16 patients have been discharged so far.

Urging people to avoid travel, mass gatherings and social engagements, Dr. Mhaisekar said that after the order to shut malls on Saturday, open parks in the city will also be closed.

“We are adopting a two-prong strategy to check the spread of the virus. One, of course, is to strictly enforce home isolation, and the second to try and prevent mass gatherings in public places. Since [Saturday], we have already closed down malls. However, I want to make it clear that medicine shops and groceries located in malls will remain open,” he said. He said institutes cannot force students to evacuate hostels until they had appeared for their examinations.

Pune District Collector Naval Kishore Ram said there had been complaints of residents in housing societies harassing people who had been asked to self-quarantine.

“Henceforth, anyone attempting to give trouble to any foreign-returned individuals who have been asked to quarantine themselves, or complaining about them will face stern action from the district administration,” Mr. Ram warned.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ij3zor/article31077711.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BMPCMC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/four-cases-in-pimpri-chinchwad-without-travel-history-worrisome-says-pune-divisional-commissioner/article31077712.ece
260,2020/03/16,COVID-19: communication key to cope with challenges of isolation,"Experts say social distancing, quarantine can cause anxiety

The novel coronavirus has brought along with it a unique challenge for people — that of social distancing and being quarantined at home or at medical facilities. Experts say that the initial reaction to such measures can cause immense anxiety, but accurate communication can bring relief.

There have been many reports over the past few days of people escaping from isolation facilities or refusing to remain under home quarantine for the prescribed period of 14 days. On Saturday, three people suspected of exposure to the virus escaped from an isolation facility in Ahmednagar and were brought back by the police.

“People have to understand that isolation is not just for them, but for the safety of their loved ones and society at large. The correct message and communication can help,” said Lucknow-based psychiatrist Dr. P.K. Dalal, who is the president of the Indian Psychiatric Society.

Bengaluru-based psychiatrist Dr Ajit Bhide agreed. “Isolation leads to sensory and social deprivation, but people have to be convinced about why it is needed. If we educate people well about the need, the process can be a lot easier,” Dr. Bhide said.

A recent Lancet review that looked at the psychological impact of quarantine and ways to reduce it said that “depriving people of their liberty for the wider public good is often contentious and needs to be handled carefully”. The authors said if quarantine is essential, officials should take every measure to ensure that this experience is as tolerable as possible for people.

“This can be achieved by: telling people what is happening and why, explaining how long it will continue, providing meaningful activities for them to do while in quarantine, providing clear communication, ensuring basic supplies (such as food, water, and medical supplies) are available, and reinforcing the sense of altruism that people should, rightly, be feeling,” the review said.

BMC’s health officer, Dr. Daksha Shah, said when advised home quarantine, people should remain confined in well-ventilated rooms and avoid direct contact with family members, especially those from high-risk groups like senior citizens, pregnant women and those with underlying ailments.

“We found that some people who were in home quarantine had invited relatives home. By doing this, the person may infect many others if he or she is later found positive,” said Dr. Shah.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/p0b1xv/article31077689.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BMCOVID1col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/covid-19-communication-key-to-cope-with-challenges-of-isolation/article31077693.ece
261,2020/03/16,Museums shut in Maharashtra to curb COVID-19 spread,"Cinema halls across State to be closed as well; govt. may impose Section 144 to prevent crowds

The Maharashtra government on Sunday ordered museums to be shut and expanded the closure of cinema halls across the State. The government may also impose Section 144 of of the Criminal Procedure Code at public places, if required, to prevent crowding.

The capacity of the quarantine facilities at Seven Hills Hospital and Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai will be increased. Apart from Kasturba and KEM hospitals, COVID-19 tests will also be conducted at JJ Hospital, Haffkine Institute and Pune’s BJ Medical College in near future, Health Minister Rajesh Tope said on Sunday.

By Sunday, the number of positive novel coronavirus patients in Maharashtra had reached 33. Mr. Tope, addressing a press conference, said the State has so far screened 1.81 lakh passengers arriving on 1,584 flights at various airports.

Of the 758 samples tested for the infection, 669 were found to be negative, 33 tested positive, while the results of the rest are awaited.

Mr. Tope said, “All patients are stable, nobody is severe or critical.” The Health Minister said a majority of the positive patients have a history of foreign travel, and for the rest, the authorities have established the point of contact.

Apart from shutting museums and film theatres, the government will also request the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) to postpone its upcoming exams, he said. Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray had tweeted that the State has postponed all MPSC exams until March 31.

The minister said that since the government has invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, commissioners and district collectors are authorised to take up measures such as directing any hospital — private or public — to set up a quarantine facility, force those who do not isolate to do so, take action against anyone hindering this, and shut down an entire area to ensure social distancing.

Boosting capacity

Seven Hills Hospital, which has been turned into a quarantine facility with a capacity of 400 beds, will undergo some repairs so that additional beds can be added to expand the capacity to 1,000. Kasturba Hospital has an isolation capacity of 80 beds, which will be increased to 125. At present, all 80 beds are occupied.

The State has set aside 450 ventilators for COVID-19 patients.

Besides, the lab at Kasturba Hospital, which can test 250 samples per day, will be boosted to test another 100 samples per day. From Wednesday, the civic-run KEM Hospital will also get a testing lab with a capacity of 250 samples per day. In the next 20 days, JJ Hospital and Haffkine Institute in Mumbai and BJ Medical College in Pune will also get testing facilities.

In future, the State will set up labs in Miraj, Solapur, Dhule and Aurangabad, which will be affiliated to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, and reduce the burden on it.

“Since those quarantined have to stay isolated, we are providing them with television, Wi-Fi and newspapers,” Mr. Tope said.

Preventing crowds

When it was pointed out that people are using time off work to visit beaches and open spaces, the Health Minister said the police have been instructed to impose Section 144 wherever there are crowds.

“The lockdown in Wuhan helped slow down the virus. We will take whatever measures required,” he said.

He also said the traffic police will be instructed to stop using breathalysers on motorists. When asked about random sampling of people for coronavirus, Mr. Tope said the State will follow the Centre’s protocol in such cases. In light of isolated patients running away from an Ahmednagar hospital, he said security, including police bandobast, will be increased.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/etyms3/article31077650.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BMTOPE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/museums-shut-to-curb-covid-19-spread/article31077651.ece
262,2020/03/16,Fear of statelessness haunts thousands rejected by NRC in Assam,"Jabeda Begum, rejected despite submitting 15 documents, is a symbol of widespread despair in Assam.

The fear of statelessness among in Assam has a name now.

Almost everyone in Kamrup district’s Goroimari block knows this name — of 50-year-old Jabeda Begum, declared a foreigner in western Assam’s Baksa district — that has become the template of despair for those left out of the updated National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Also read | Assam’s NRC exercise: The registry test of citizenship

Most of some 21,700 households across 75 villages in this block have at least one member left out of the NRC published on August 31, 2019. “Moktar, Joinal, Akbar Ali, Mirchan Nessa... their documents may be considered as they are among one or two members of their families excluded from the list. What will happen to us when they (courts) are rejecting 15-16 documents?” said Jochhon Ali, a farmer whose 31-member family does not figure in the NRC.

The number is a reference to Ms. Begum, who submitted 15 documents, including PAN card, land revenue receipt and bank passbook but did not pass muster for the Gauhati High Court to overrule the order of a Foreigners Tribunal (FT) declaring her a foreigner of the “post-March 1971 stream”. The court dismissed her petition on February 12.

March 25, 1971 is the cut-off date for detecting and deporting foreigners or illegal immigrants, or “Bangladeshis”, according to the Assam Accord of August 15, 1985.

Since finding themselves among the 19.06 lakh NRC-rejects, Mr. Ali and his three brothers have been trying to salvage any document they might have missed while applying for inclusion in the NRC. But the case of Ms. Begum, who has been absconding after the dismissal of her petition, has made Mr. Ali and thousands like him lose hope as the NRC authorities prepare to issue rejection slips.

The Assam government told the Assembly a few days ago that such slips may be issued from March 30 onwards. A rejected person has to appeal his or her case in a quasi-judicial FT within 120 days of receiving this slip citing the reasons for exclusion.

“What can we show beyond those we have already shown? What will stop them from finding fault with the fresh documents we submit?” said petty trader Jamaluddin. All 26 members of his family were excluded because his father’s name had minor alphabetical changes in different “admissible” documents possibly due to clerical errors.

The NRC authority had during the updating exercise listed 14 documents as admissible. These included the NRC of 1951, which Ms. Begum had submitted (of her parents), electoral rolls up to the midnight of March 24, 1971, land and revenue records, citizenship certificate and refugee registration certificate.

An additional list of admissible documents includes ration card and certificate from circle officer of Gram Panchayat secretary in case of married women.

“The apprehension is understandable. When those running the system are determined not to accept any document, nothing you show will really matter. And the excluded will have to go the FTs, which will be like jumping from the frying pan to the fire,” All Assam Minority Students’ Union president Rejaul Karim Sarkar told The Hindu.

Each FT is headed by a member, who is either a retired judge or bureaucrat with judicial experience or an advocate with at least seven years of practice. Assam had in August 2019 appointed 221 members for 200 FTs to be added to the existing 100 for handling the cases of the NRC-excluded.

In September 2019, the Amnesty International had cited an Assam government’s assessment report that said members are retained or fired depending upon how many people they mark as foreigners.

Bengali Hindus, believed to be the second-largest group after Bengali Muslims to be left out of the NRC, are losing hope too despite the perception that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) will shield them from rejection by the FTs.

“Many NRC-rejected Bengali Hindus have been living in Assam before 1971. The CAA is no guarantee for their inclusion, as they will first have to declare themselves as refugees who entered Assam between 1971 and 2014, which they are not,” said Kamal Chakraborty of Unconditional Citizenship Demand Committee based in southern Assam’s Silchar, a Bengali-dominated town.

“It will be a long legal battle for them, perhaps never-ending, that will kill them and their descendants financially and psychologically,” Mr. Chakraborty said.

Mr. Sarkar agreed. “No matter how long it takes, we will fight it out in the courts, our last hope,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/viwug5/article31077341.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THRDNRC1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fear-of-statelessness-haunts-thousands-rejected-by-nrc-in-assam/article31077342.ece
263,2020/03/16,Madhya Pradesh political crisis | Kamal Nath government faces crucial test of strength,"It will have to secure votes of at least 112 MLAs.

The fate of the Congress-led government in Madhya Pradesh is set to be decided in a floor test on Monday.

Although 92 Congress and four Independent MLAs returned to Bhopal from Jaipur on Sunday, there was no sign of either the 107 BJP or 16 rebel Congress MLAs until late on Sunday evening.

The Kamal Nath government was pushed to the brink following the exit of senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia and the block of 16 lawmakers owing allegiance to him.

It will now have to secure the votes of at least 112 MLAs to prove its simple majority in the Assembly, which has an effective strength of 222 after the resignation of six Congress MLAs and the death of two MLAs in the 230-member House.

Both the Congress and the BJP have issued three-line whips to their MLAs, directing them to attend all Assembly sessions from March 16 to April 13.

The Samajwadi Party has also issued a whip to its lone MLA to vote in favour of the government. However, there has been no direction for the two BSP MLAs who have so far backed the Congress government.

Directing Mr. Nath to take the floor test after his address in the Assembly, Governor Lalji Tandon, in a letter issued at 12.30 a.m. on Sunday, stated his “prima facie belief” was that the government had lost trust of the Assembly and was in a minority. He wrote that the test must be conducted in any condition, shouldn’t be “postponed, delayed or suspended”. Earlier, BJP leaders had claimed the Congress was attempting to stall the test.

Also read: BJP seeks voting by raising of hands in floor test

Meanwhile, 16 rebel Congress MLAs owing allegiance to Mr. Scindia, responding to Speaker N.P. Prajapati’s notice directing them to appear before him in person to attest their resignations, said that given “the bad law and order situation” and “uncertainty” in the State, they would not be able to appear before him. The resignaions of the MLAs, oresently in Bengaluru, were submitted to the Speaker by BJP leaders.

In verbatim letters, the MLAs wrote: “The way you had accepted resignations of six MLAs on March 14, kindly accept mine too.” After six rebel Ministers failed to appear before him despite being given two days for it, Mr. Prajapati on Saturday had accepted their resignations, stating they were not fit to be members.

Following the letters, the Governor requested the State government to provide the MLAs CAPF security. On Sunday, Home Minister Bala Bachchan said the MLAs, “held in captivity by the BJP in Bengaluru,” could seek protection of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), if they required, so that they could return to Bhopal.

As nine rebel MLAs failed to appear before the Speaker on Sunday despite being served notices, Mr. Prajapati said, “As the Vidhan Sabha Speaker, I am the protector of those MLAs. I am worried, being a protector, what is happening to the honourable members. And this is a question mark on democracy.”

Mr. Nath on Saturday had requested Union Home Minister Amit Shah to ensure the “release” of the MLAs by the police of BJP-ruled Karnataka, and assured them full protection in Madhya Pradesh. He had said there was no point in demanding a floor test if MLAs were “being held hostage outside”.

Writing to the Governor on Friday, Mr. Nath had confirmed he was ready for the test, even as he requested inquiry into BJP leaders submitting resignations of Congress MLAs who were “in captivity” in Bengaluru and accused BJP of conspiring to subvert the government. A day later, BJP vice president Shivraj Singh Chouhan said he was ready for a test, requesting the Governor for division of votes and videography of proceedings.

The first signs of a political turmoil in the State emerged on the intervening night of March 3 and 4, when two Ministers claimed to have freed six MLAs, including independents and BSP and SP members, from a poaching bid by the BJP at a hotel in Haryana. Meanwhile, four MLAs were believed to be taken to Bengaluru, with two of them returning to Bhopal later and pledging allegiance to the Congress government.

Then on March 9, 19 MLAs supporting Mr. Scindia went incommunicado and were believed to have moved to Bengaluru, giving jitters to the government, whose 16 Ministers tendered resignations to Mr. Nath the same night, in an attempt to placate the rebels and make space for them. Yet, as Mr. Scindia quit the Congress a day later, as many as 22 MLAs, pledging allegiance to him, tendered resignations to the Speaker through BJP leaders, while remaining in Bengaluru themselves.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/2jnkmh/article31077035.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THRDBHOPAL1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/madhya-pradesh-political-crisis-kamal-nath-government-faces-crucial-test-of-strength/article31077036.ece

The Quinton de Kock-led South African team on Monday had checked into a city hotel near the airport as the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) took all precautions for their safe return home amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

After their three-match ODI series against India was called off due to the virus outbreak, the South African players and support staff stayed in Lucknow where the second match was slated to be held. They had the option to fly to Delhi, but preferred the ‘safest city’ Kolkata as the Eastern metropolis was yet to record a single positive case for COVID-19.

Medical team in place

“We have made full arrangements so that the South African players return home safe. We have a three-member medical team looking into their arrangements. We are taking adequate precautions,” medical committee chairman Pradip Dey told reporters at the city hotel on Rajarhat.

Maintaining social distancing, the team was received at the airport by Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Avishek Dalmiya, secretary Snehasish Ganguly and joint-secretary Debabrata Das.

“Everything is fine. Their rooms are all sanitised. Our liaison manager and medical team are also there in two rooms. They are all equipped with special masks and sanitisers. We have spoken to the players and they are fine,” Avishek said.

The visiting team is flying out to their respective destinations in South Africa on Tuesday morning via Dubai.

For Kapil Dev and V.V.S. Laxman, it is “time to spend time with family” and they also advocate caution and restraint even as the world battles the coronavirus pandemic.

With more and more sporting activities being cancelled or rescheduled, there is a rare lull among the players’ fraternity. “Yes, forced to stay indoors but we all have to understand the seriousness of the situation,” said Kapil, who is a compulsive outdoor person, ready to tee off at a golf course at the break of dawn.

266,2020/03/16,The day Tendulkar completed a century of centuries,"He achieved the feat on March 16, 2012, in the Asia Cup game against Bangladesh

March 16, 2012 will be etched in the minds of cricket fans across the globe as the day when Sachin Tendulkar scored his 100th international century.

During the Asia Cup clash against Bangladesh at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, Tendulkar played a brilliant knock of 114 to bring up his 49th ODI century.

The maestro already had 51 hundreds to his name in the longest format.

His century was also special in the sense that he breached the three-figure mark after a gap of one year.

Match lost

However, Tendulkar’s knock was not enough to seal victory for India as it was unable to defend a target of 290 and the host won the match with four balls to spare.

The century record of Tendulkar still stands untouched. The 47-year-old also has 164 half-centuries to his name, while he amassed a whopping 34,357 runs during his stellar career.

Former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting, with 71 hundreds, is second in the list of players with most international centuries.

267,2020/03/16,Women’s cricket | Tour Down Under was a success: Raman,"Indian women’s team coach says it’s also time to identify a couple of fast bowlers and groom them

A week after returning from the Indian women’s tour of Australia — where Harmanpreet Kaur’s young bunch made it to the final of the tri-series featuring Australia and England and followed it up by zooming into the T20 World Cup final — head coach W.V. Raman recalls the journey with The Hindu. Excerpts:

How would you sum up the tour Down Under?

In both the tournaments, the girls definitely did well. They were in the tri-series against two better sides and in the World Cup, we were placed in a tough group.

To have won all the league games and qualify was quite an achievement given that it’s a young side that’s still on a learning curve in T20s. If you take all this into account, the tour was definitely a success. Yes, winning the final would have been great but these things happen in sport. You can’t help it.

What exactly went wrong in the final? Did the packed house at MCG get to the girls? Or was it the big-match pressure ?

The point is, in a T20 game, you can hardly make a comeback. When the first 30-40 minutes go away from you, it’s very difficult for you to make a comeback.

Just to make a point, when I was with KKR (as assistant coach), we were playing the CLT20 final (in 2014) against CSK. Raina made a mockery of a chase of 180-plus where he got off to a start and never looked back. A similar innings was played by Alyssa Healy. Whatever she tried that day, it came off. All other factors and other reasoning we can think of are just incidental but the long and short of it is that in T20s these things will happen.

Would you say the rise of three teenaged batters is the biggest gain from the tour?

Of course. I mentioned before leaving India that we have players who can go on to become match-winners on their own and the batting side is definitely far well-equipped than it was when I took over.

We have identified the talent and players who can measure up to what is required at the top-level. And also worked on their skills as well as fitness. That gives you a bit of confidence than it did some time ago.

While the spinners continue to come good, the pace bowling, barring Shikha Pandey, remains a concern ahead of the next year’s ODI World Cup…

Spinners have been calling the shots for a couple of years now. We need to identify a couple of fast bowlers and it will take them some time to become consistent performers. It’s not an easy job, bowling fast, especially for Indian girls who are comparatively frail than Caucasian girls. Fast bowling is a lot of hard work, be it male or female. The challenges are going to be slightly more in women’s cricket.

The two senior batters — Harmanpreet and Smriti — had a mediocre World Cup. What would you attribute it to?

I personally felt that they were overkeen to do well. I think once they saw the team perform in the tri-series, they thought this may be a great chance to claim the summit and must have probably felt they needed to up their game.

269,2020/03/16,"Finch, Warner raise concerns over Australia’s COVID-19 measures","The Australian government had announced that anyone arriving in the country from overseas will be forced to self-isolate for 14 days starting Sunday midnight (March 15) in a bid to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Australian limited-overs captain Aaron Finch and opener David Warner have raised concerns over the effectiveness of the self-isolation policy of the government to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Australian government had announced that anyone arriving in the country from overseas will be forced to self-isolate for 14 days starting Sunday midnight (March 15) in a bid to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.

However, a lot of citizens are confused regarding the working of the precaution.

An Australian sports journalist Veronica Eggleton tweeted: “Genuine question - how does the government know if new arrivals are actually self-isolating?”

Finch re-tweeted Eggleton’s tweet adding “Have been wondering the same thing!!”

Finch’s remarks prompted a response from teammate Warner, who wrote “Or, what about the uber/taxi/bus/train they catch from the airport to their place.”

The coronavirus has claimed over 6,000 lives and infected close to 160,000 people world over.

The virus has caused a collapse of sports events worldwide in a year when several quadrennial events like the Olympics, Euro 2020 and Copa America are scheduled.

‘See you guys in 14 days’

Players all over the world are self-isolating. On Monday, former New Zealand pacer Mitchell McClenaghan, who was among several foreign players who left the ongoing Paksitan Super League amid concerns over the affliction, posted a picture of himself self isolating.

“Straight home into isolation, get home to this note from my legendary wife who’s gone to stay with her parents for a few weeks. See you guys in 14 days,” he tweeted.

The sports calendars were shredded worldwide, including international and domestic cricket all over.

Australia’s ODI series against New Zealand was called off after the first match, as was India’s ODI series against South Africa. Both series were to be held without spectators before being scrapped.

England’s tour of Sri Lanka was also cut short before the beginning of the two-match Test series while the upcoming edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), which was due to start on March 29, has also been suspended till April 15.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/hmdio4/article31080540.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FINCH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/finch-warner-raise-concerns-over-australias-covid-19-measures/article31080541.ece
270,2020/03/16,Sanjay Manjrekar reacts to commentary panel snub,"Says it’s the prerogative of the BCCI to employ him or not

Sanjay Manjrekar, the former Test cricketer-turned-commentator, has reacted to his omission from the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI’s) commentary panel.

“I have always considered commentary as a great privilege, but never an entitlement. It is up to my employers whether they choose to have me or not & I will always respect that. Maybe BCCI has not been happy with my performance of late. I accept that as a professional,” Manjrekar wrote on his Twitter timeline on Sunday.

Manjrekar, a regular fixture in the BCCI’s panel of commentators for more than a decade, has been ousted from the panel.

There has been speculation over the possible reasons for his exclusion.

No comment

While BCCI president Sourav Ganguly had, after the IPL Governing Council meeting on Saturday, declined to react to Manjrekar’s omission, the latter’s tweet in a way puts an end to the controversy over his eviction from the commentary box, starting with India’s ODI series against South Africa, which was put off due to COVID-19 after the opener at Dharamshala was washed out.

Controversies

Manjrekar, a TV presenter and commentator for more than two decades, had been embroiled in quite a few controversies. India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja blasted Manjrekar after being referred to as a “bits and pieces cricketer” by the latter on air during last year’s World Cup.

While Manjrekar retracted his statement, he continued to be in the news for the wrong reasons.

Last November, during the pink-ball Test against Bangladesh, Manjrekar made a derogatory remark at fellow commentator Harsha Bhogle.

Manjrekar had stressed on “10-15 years of First Class cricket” experience to express views on the visibility of the ball under lights. In an interview with ESPNcricinfo later on, Manjrekar not only apologised for his remark but also admitted 2019 was “the worst year for me as an analyst and commentator”.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/tiwfrq/article31076020.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16SANJAY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/sanjay-manjrekar-reacts-to-commentary-panel-snub/article31076021.ece

280,2020/03/16,MP seeks merger of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Institute with CUTN,"P.R.

Mr. Natarajan had said that the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Institute functioned under the Ministry of Textiles and had signed an agreement with the Central University and offered B.Sc- textiles, two-year full time post graduate Diploma in Management (PGDM) and MBA courses for various streams connected with the textile industry from 2016-2017.

On the promises given by the administration that the Institute would be merged with the Central University, which promoted textiles related courses in Tamil Nadu, students appeared for the entrance examinations conducted by the CUTN and secured admission in the Institute. They were hopeful of reduction in fees and that the degree certificate would be of merit to help get employment. However, the proposed merger has not happened. The aggrieved students boycotted classes for two weeks to mark their protest.

The management had now reportedly sent letters to their parents informing that the merger between CUTN and SVPITM stood cancelled. It was also learnt that the Institute was to be converted into an advanced textile research centre. This would affect the education of the existing students and the future of the faculty.

284,2020/03/16,Issues facing daily wage conservancy workers come to the fore,"‘Corporation least interested in the welfare of daily wagers’

On March 9, 10 and 11 daily wage conservancy workers (contract workers) staged protests – first in front of the Collectorate and subsequently at the Corporation offices.

The workers, whose number swelled on the second day of the protest on Tuesday, opposed the Corporation appointing 320-odd persons as regular conservancy workers – on a full-time basis on permanent employment – by overlooking their work experience.

A few days prior to the workers' protest, the Corporation had appointed the 320-odd workers at a function held at its South Zone office. The Corporation had called for applications to fill up 549 posts and had received nearly 7,000 applications. The protesting workers had alleged that by overlooking their work experience and their class as daily wage workers, the Corporation had chosen to appoint young, just-out-of-college candidates and therein lay nepotism and corruption.

The workers asked the Corporation how would it ensure that the graduate and post-graduate candidates it had appointed for conservancy work collected and transported garbage, swept streets and dredged drains.

They also wanted the Corporation to not transfer such candidates to office assistant posts or others that did not involve handling waste.

After boycotting work for two continuous days, a few among the workers and their trade union representatives met the Corporation Commissioner Sravan Kumar Jatavath, who told them that they would be wrong to not make a distinction between their demand and the recruitment process that the civic body had initiated.

He told them the Corporation appointed candidates to the 320-odd posts in accordance with G.O. 549 by following the roster system – caste-based reservation system. And, he had not violated the order. Whereas, what the workers had been demanding was regularisation of their services, taking into consideration their years of service as daily wagers.

Dissatisfied with Mr. Jatavath's explanation, the workers continued their protest for the third day on Wednesday as well but gave up soon thereafter following a tripartite meeting in the presence of District Collector K. Rajamani.

At the end of the meeting, the administration released the proceedings of the meeting, which, perhaps, could trigger another round of protest by the workers.

The proceedings, a copy of which was made available to The Hindu, read that the representatives of the Janashakti Labour Union, Coimbatore Labour Union, CITU, Tamilnadu Annal Ambedkar Scavengers and General Employees Union and a few others demanded that the unfilled among the 549 posts be filled with the daily wage conservancy workers.

It also read that the representatives also wanted the Corporation take their demand for regularisation of the workers to the notice of the Municipal Administration Department, increase the daily wage and drop any proposed action against the workers who participated in the three-day protest.

Representatives of the CITU, Annal Ambedkar and Janashakti unions contested the minutes of the proceedings saying it was not what they demanded at the meeting.

E.R. Selvam of the Annal Ambedkar union said the unions' demanded annulling the appointment of the 320-odd persons, regularising the services of all the 3,685 daily wage workers by considering only their seniority and without following the caste-based reservation system and increasing the daily wage till regularisation.

The unions had sent a letter to the Collector asking the administration to issue the correct minutes of the proceedings, added C. Palaniswamy of the Janashakti union.

The Corporation, since the time it engaged daily wage workers for conservancy work, had been denying their dues. As per G.O. 62, the Corporation ought to fix the minimum wages at ₹16,389.75 for conservancy workers, domestic breeding checkers, lorry cleaners and a ₹1,000 more for lorry drivers and water tank operators working as daily wagers.

But the Corporation, he said, chose to go with the minimum daily wages that the Coimbatore district administration fixed under the Minimum Wages Act, which at ₹420 a day worked out to ₹12,600 a month. But the workers did not get their wages at ₹420 a day on monthly basis as the contractor deduced wages for the days that they did not work and that included Sundays and national and state holidays. In effect, the workers received only wages for 25 or 26 days a month.

Mr. Palaniswamy further said that the Corporation, being the principal employer for the daily wage workers, overlooked the fact. It also appeared to be indifferent to the rule that there should be equal wages for equal work.

When conservancy workers on the Corporation's rolls – permanent workers – were getting much more than the daily wagers, why was it shutting its eyes, he asked.

The Corporation also violated other rules when it came to engaging the daily wage workers – the Corporation should have informed the Labour Department about its move to engage workers on daily basis and the number of such workers and taken license. Likewise, the contractors who supplied the daily wagers to the Corporation should have also taken licence.

His organisation's RTI queries had revealed that both had not, he claimed.

Mr. Selvam said the Corporation had violated its undertaking – the one that the then Commissioner K. Vijayakarthikeyan gave before the Labour Department officials to constitute committees to look into the daily wagers' grievances.

To date, the civic body had not implemented it.

This only went on to show that the Corporation was least interested in the welfare of the daily wagers, he added.

The Corporation was not even-handed in its approach towards the permanent workers vis-a-vis other staff, complained S. Selvakumar, member, State-level Committee for the Welfare of Scheduled Castes.

He said the only promotion avenue open for permanent workers was sanitary supervisors. The qualification for the promotion was that the worker concerned should have completed Class X and put in a minimum of five years service.

Though there were many such workers and 42 sanitary supervisor posts vacant, the Corporation had filled the posts on an ad hoc basis with persons as sanitary supervisors in-charge. Why deny the conservancy workers their due, he asked.

Justifying the Corporation's actions, officials said it was profitable for the civic body to engage workers on contract as its financial outgo was lesser than what it would be spending on permanent workers. The permanent workers not only drew higher salary but were also eligible for yearly increment, bonus and other perks. In the absence of such perks to the daily wagers, its financial commitment was less.

The officials pointed out that the Corporation's action was not something that was unique to the city but based on State Government orders. The Government had stopped recruitment of conservancy workers for over a decade and the recent exercise to appoint 549 persons on a permanent basis was a one-off attempt. As for the promotion of permanent workers as sanitary supervisors, the officials said the Corporation was looking into it and very soon it would promote eligible workers.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/g8tzpb/article31079030.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CCB16-STIRR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/issues-facing-daily-wage-conservancy-workers-come-to-the-fore/article31076746.ece

Mr. Kejriwal also made an appeal to postpone wedding functions if possible in order to prevent people from being part of large gatherings. It is imperative that those who have been asked to home quarantine themselves due to coronavirus stay at home, he added.

He said the government has also decided to shut gyms and nightclubs till March 31 — cinema halls and schools, where examinations are not taking place, have already been shut for the same period. The government will ensure that hand sanitizers are made available at as many public places as possible.

Mr. Kejriwal reiterated his appeal that healthy people “do not need to wear masks; this is not an aerial disease”, and advised people to avoid shaking hands and touching one’s eyes, nose, and mouth.

“In our country, fortunately, the virus has been contained to a large extent,” he said, adding that quarantine arrangements have been made at three hotels in Aerocity.

The Delhi High Court Monday sought responses from the Centre, the police and the AAP government on a plea seeking directions to Delhi Police to preserve the CCTV footage of the recent riots in northeast Delhi.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar issued notices to the authorities and listed the matter for further hearing on March 27.

The plea filed by the Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind said Delhi Police should be directed to preserve CCTV footage of the riot-affected areas from February 23 to March 1 and should not remove debris without collecting evidence from the site.

It also sought FIRs against those involved in the violence and setting up of a Special Investigation Team comprising retired judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court.

“There are serious allegations of damaging the CCTV cameras installed in the riots affected areas by the police which is evident from the videos surfaced and circulating in the social media,” the plea said, adding that the debris has been deliberately removed to destroy the evidence from the incident site.

It claimed that FIRs have not been lodged against persons responsible for the riots. It further alleged that the police is not accepting the complaint in which the accused are named and they are insisting that a complaint be filed against unknown persons.

It alleged that the father of one of the riot victims has made specific allegation against BJP leader Kapil Mishra as being responsible for the death of his son and the riots.

The plea further sought taking legal and disciplinary action against police officials for their alleged inaction or active participation in the riots and destruction of evidence.

Four members of the Academic Council (AC) of Delhi University have written to Vice-Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi, saying that teachers should be allowed to work from home so that unnecessary travelling of over 10,000 citizens can be further reduced.

The university has already suspended classes for all students till March 31 in the wake of a nationwide health emergency caused by the spread of COVID-19.

The AC members said that many principals asked teachers to compulsorily report to their respective colleges despite the suspension of classes, even though the university press release clearly insisted on making e-resources available to students on a weekly basis.

The teachers also pointed out that it cannot be assumed that the teaching-learning time lost in the temporary cessation of classes can be made up through e-resources and e-learning modules.

The teachers of the university added that the V-C should consider extending the duration of the semester at an appropriate juncture in order to cover up for the lost hours of regular teaching-learning and make corresponding changes in the examination schedule.

For the fourth time, Tihar jail authorities are making arrangements for the execution of the four convicts in the Nirbhaya case which is scheduled for March 20, officials said.

Convicts are hopeful that their lawyers will find some way to get the date of their hanging postponed once again, said a jail official.

“Hangman Pawan will reach Tihar on March 17 and will carry out dummy executions. The phansi ghar will be inspected again as per jail manual by a team to check whether all things are in place,” said Sandeep Goel, Director General (Prisons)

The hanging of the four men — Mukesh Kumar Singh, Vinay Kumar Sharma , Akshay Kumar Singh and Pawan Gupta — who are lodged in Tihar, was fixed for March 20 at 5.30 a.m in Tihar jail as per a court order.

Out of the four convicts, Mukesh, Vinay and Pawan have already met their families before the February 1 death warrant, while Akshay was left to meet his family for the last time, said the jail officials.

During normal meetings, inmates are allowed to meet their families from behind an iron grill. In the last meeting, they were allowed to meet their families face-to-face for 30 minutes. “We have informed Akshay’s family members about the final meeting. We are hopeful that they will reach Delhi within a couple of days,” said Mr. Goel.

Priority to health

Meanwhile, Tihar jail authorities are taking extra care of convicts in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak.

“The convicts are given round-the-clock security and are put under CCTV surveillance. A team of doctors visit them twice a day for medical check-up. They have been shifted to isolation wards. We are taking extra care of their health and preventing them from getting in contact with other prisoners,” said a jail official.

“We are taking extra care of hygiene inside isolation wards and the convicts are not allowed to meet unnecessary people so as to avoid any chances of getting infected,” the official said. The official added that the convicts haven’t made any special demands.

The first date of execution was fixed on January 22, but it was postponed by the court to February 1.

With several Delhiites practising social distancing as a precautionary measure to protect themselves from the COVID-19 epidemic, restaurants, malls, and even wedding venues have been seeing the number of visitors dwindle.

At an open-air restaurant in south Delhi where getting a table is close to impossible for walk-in visitors over the weekend, a live band that attracts hundreds of patrons was playing for a table occupied by four guests, with the restaurant staff cheering them on.

Abhishek, the manager of the restaurant, said, “We expected less guests but to have only one table full in such a large restaurant shows that people in the city are practising social distancing very seriously. For us, we have to keep running the place and hope that it is back to business as usual. But until then, we are going to suffer a huge loss.”

Mr. Abhishek added that for the past week, they have not got any group bookings and that the band was playing only because they had a contract with the restaurant.

The COVID-19 scare has not only hit businesses, but has also managed to ruin weddings and birthday parties. Rajinder Pal who manages a banquet hall in Mayapuri, says that he has received calls from people who had booked the hall if they could reduce the “minimum guarantee” number that they had promised. “Many people are avoiding social gatherings and at weddings held over the weekend, only close family of the bride and groom have been turning up, whereas the minimum guarantee number given by them was over 200,” Mr. Pal said.

Sakshi Seth, a working mother, says that with schools shut, she has been finding it tough to entertain her children at home as she has to be away at work. “My son can no more attend his drama class, football coaching and several other activities that I had lined up for him after school. All sessions and classes have been cancelled,” Ms. Seth said. She added that as a precaution, she has not been ordering food through food delivery apps as well.

Several conferences at scheduled places in the city have also been cancelled due to the virus outbreak. The Dastakar bazaar has been cut short by the organisers and is scheduled to end on Monday.

The organisers said that they had ensured that every visitor to the bazaar sanitised their hands before entering and that all counter had sanitisers next to them, adding that they decided to cut the event short adhering to the WHO guidelines and other heath advisories on COVID-19.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jalkob/article31077486.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE16MASK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/covid-19-scare-people-avoid-eating-out-attending-parties/article31077487.ece

It will pose threat to the health of the children and senior citizens living in the housing society located next to the PTS. We demand that the screening centre be shifted to some other isolated place,” said Anita, one of the protesters.

Team of doctors called

A senior police officer said that to interact with the protesters, they had called a team of doctors who explained to the residents how COVID-19 spreads. The protest was called off after a few hours after the doctors could successfully convince them.

“We assured them of maintaining high level of hygiene and taking precautions at the screening centre. A team of doctors will be available for them in case they need any medical assistance,” added the police officer.

Meanwhile, Delhi Police Commissioner instructed all district DCPs and police personnel posted in other units, who have direct interface with the public at large, to frequently use sanitisers and wear masks in order to protect themselves from COVID-19.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/3l8yl2/article31077460.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE16PROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/covid-19-kin-of-police-personnel-stage-stir-over-virus-screening-centre/article31077461.ece
302,2020/03/16,Nirbhaya case | Delayed execution of convicts,"After three successive postponements, the court has now set the date for hanging on March 20

Seven years after their barbaric act of gang raping a young paramedic student, the four men convicted for the heinous crime have left no stone unturned to save themselves from the gallows.

Ever since the first death warrants were issued by a trial court here in January this year, all four convicts – Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26), and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) – have made every possible endeavour to delay their execution, even if it meant living for a few more days.

After three successive postponement of the death warrants, the trial court on March 5 set the date of execution at Tihar Jail on March 20 at 5.30 a.m.. Having exhausted all available legal remedies, including mercy petition before the President, the convicts have now been given final time to meet their respective families.

The fateful night

December 16, 2012, would have probably been just another day for the 23-year-old paramedical student returning after watching a movie with a friend, had they not boarded the private bus.

The girl and her friend, after watching Life of Pi at a cinema hall in south Delhi’s Saket, reached the Munirka bus stand at 9 p.m. in an auto. As they could not find any public transport to return home from there, they boarded a chartered bus after its conductor talked them into it.

Inside the bus, there were already four men in the driver’s cabin and two more sitting behind it. They sat next to each other on the left side — second seat in the bus — and paid a fare of ₹20

As the bus reached the flyover near the airport, three boys came out of the driver’s cabin. Two of them started abusing the woman’s friend and asked him where he was taking her late in the evening. One of them hit the victim’s friend who tried fighting back.

Soon, two other boys joined them in beating him with iron rods lying in the bus. As the victim came forward to save her friend, two of the assailants pushed her to the back seat.

While the victim’s friend was being beaten up, the other assailants took turn to rape her. In their brutal act, the convicts damaged her internal organs using an iron rod.

The convicts then tried to throw both the victims out of the moving bus from its rear door. But since they couldn’t open it, they brought them to the front and pushed them out of the moving bus on National Highway 8 near the Mahipalpur flyover. They were later spotted by passers-by, who informed the police.

The passers-by also brought sheets to cover them. They were then rushed to Safdarjung Hospital. The girl was later airlifted to a hospital in Singapore, where she died after 13 days.

Changes in law

The nationwide public outcry, following the incident, led to the passing of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act in 2013 which widened the definition of rape and made punishment more stringent.

Parliament made the amendments on the recommendations of the Justice J.S. Verma Committee, which was constituted to re-look into the criminal laws in the country and suggest changes.

The 2013 Act, which came into effect on April 2, 2013, increased the jail term in most sexual assault cases and also provided for death penalty in rape cases that cause death of the victim or leaves her in a vegetative state. It also created new offences, such as use of criminal force on a woman with intent to disrobe, voyeurism and stalking.

The punishment for gang rape was increased to 20 years to life imprisonment from the earlier 10 years to life imprisonment.

Earlier, there was no specific provision in the law for offences such as use of unwelcome physical contact, words or gestures, demand or request for sexual favours, showing pornography against the will of a woman or making sexual remarks. But, the 2013 Act clearly defined these offences and allocated punishment. Similarly, stalking was made punishable with up to three years in jail.

Arrest and conviction

Within days of the incident, the police arrested all six convicts, including the driver of the bus – Ram Singh – and the lone juvenile assailant.

A fast-track court began proceedings against the five adults on January 17, 2013. The same month, the Juvenile Justice Board ruled that the sixth accused is a minor, who would be dealt with differently.

On March 11, 2013, Ram Singh was found hanging in his cell in Tihar jail.

The juvenile assailant was on August 31 convicted by the Juvenile Justice Board for gang rape and murder and awarded three-year term at a probation home.

The next month, the trial court convicted the remaining four of 13 offences, including gang rape, unnatural offence and murder of a woman and attempt to murder her male friend. It awarded death to all the four.

On March 13, 2014, the Delhi High Court upheld the death sentences awarded to the four convicts. Three years later, the Supreme Court on May 5, 2017, upheld the death penalty.

Rush for execution

On February 2019, the mother of the victim moved a Delhi court seeking death warrants for all convicts. She had contended that it was the need of the hour and law that death sentence be executed as early as possible and not delayed any further.

Seven months before that, the top court had already rejected the review petitions of three of the convicts against their death sentence.

In late October last year, the Tihar Jail authorities informed the convicts that they have only seven days to file mercy petitions before the President as they have exhausted all their legal remedies.

During this period, convict Pawan moved the Delhi High Court claiming that he was a juvenile at the time of the offence. This, however, got dismissed later.

In December the Supreme Court dismissed the review petition filed by the fourth death row convict Akshay.

Akshay, in his last ditch effort to save himself from the gallows, had pleaded that there was no evidence to show that such a punishment has got a deterrent value.

“The State must not simply execute people. It must persistently work towards systematic reforms to bring about change. Executions only kill the criminal, not the crime...” Akshay’s plea argued.

He even referred to the health risks because of the rising pollution level in the Capital to state that, “Life is going short-to-short, then why death penalty”.

Death warrants

On January 7, a Delhi court, while hearing plea by the parents of the victim to expedite the execution of the convicts, issued their death warrants for January 22 at 7 a.m. inside Tihar jail.

The mother of the victim, who was present at the court while the verdict was being pronounced, said the decision to hang the convicts will restore the faith of women in the judiciary.

The second death warrants were issued by the Delhi court on January 17 for February 17 on a day when President Ram Nath Kovind rejected the mercy plea of death row convict Mukesh Kumar. But, the execution of death sentence was postponed for the second time on January 31 by a Delhi court on the ground that Vinay’s mercy plea had not been decided by the President. This led to an unprecedented event, in which the Delhi High Court sat for a hearing on a Sunday to hear the Centre’s plea to remove the stay on execution of the convicts. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Home Ministry, argued that the acts of the four convicts clearly shows their intention to delay the process of execution of death sentences.

There was “a deliberate, calculated, well thought out design to frustrate the mandate of the law”, the Solicitor General had argued.

The High Court declined the plea of the Centre to separately execute the death row convicts but gave all four convicts seven days to exhaust all their available legal remedies.

Meanwhile, the President had rejected the mercy pleas of Mukesh, Vinay and Akshay. On February 17, the Delhi court issued fresh death warrants for the execution of the four convicts on March 3, at 6 a.m.

During this period, Vinay moved the Election Commission of India questioning the timing of the rejection of his mercy plea. In the representation, he contended that the model code of conduct for the Delhi elections was still in force when the Delhi government made its recommendation to the President to reject his mercy plea. Finally on March 5, the Delhi court issued the latest death warrants for the convicts to be executed on March 20 at 5.30 a.m. inside Tihar.

Even after exhausting all legal remedies, Vinay has moved a fresh mercy petition before Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal, seeking commutation of his death penalty to life imprisonment.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/j1svc1/article31077430.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI552017000048B1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delayed-execution/article31077434.ece
303,2020/03/16,‘Son of woman who died due to COVID-19 in Delhi stable’,"The son of the 68-year-old woman from west Delhi who was the second COVID-19 casualty in the country, is being treated at the Centre-run Safdarjung Hospital and his condition is stated to be stable, official sources said on Sunday.

The 46-year-old man, a resident of Janakpuri, who was shifted from Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital to Safdarjung Hospital on Friday, was shifted to an isolation ward on Saturday from the ICU after his condition improved.

“He is out of the ICU and his condition is stable. He is not stuck to bed,” an official source said.

The man could not attend the funeral of his mother who was cremated at Nigam Bodh Ghat under the supervision of medical staff.

He had travelled to Switzerland and Italy between February 5 and 22 and returned to India on February 23. He initially was asymptomatic, but developed fever and cough after a day and reported to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital on March 7.

“As per protocol, the family was screened and since he and his mother had fever and cough, both were hospitalised,” a Health Ministry official said, adding the man had to be put on oxygen support after he developed severe respiratory problems.

304,2020/03/16,"In communal flare-ups, rumours have tactical use","Irrespective of religion, people shielded temples during the recent riots

In instances of communal violence, truth is often the first casualty and a mobilisation tactic used by those behind fomenting trouble is to spread rumours that places of worship have been destroyed.

A fact check by The Hindu found that while there were instances of stone pelting at temples, local residents, including Muslims, came forward to defend at least three temples during the recent outbreak of violence in north-east Delhi in which 53 persons were killed.

At the Shri Durga Fakiri Mandir in Chand Bagh, where sporadic episodes of stone pelting led to violent clashes on February 24, both Muslim and Hindu residents came out to defend the temple, its prabandhak Sanjay Malhotra said.

“There were violent clashes for at least three hours but only the board affixed above the gate was damaged; all the credit goes to members to the seven-odd Muslim families who stay in the gali. They came on their own and stood beside the Hindus to save the temple. I wish I could introduce you to them myself but most of them have sent their families away and have, after weeks, finally gone back to their trades,” Mr. Malhotra, a resident of Geeta Colony, said.

“I could only come here the next morning after [paramilitary] forces were deployed and saw that the only damage inflicted on the temple was to a board bearing its name. My family has overseen the functioning of this temple since 1978...the area always had both Hindus and Muslims residing in it, but there was never the kind of fear and mistrust that exists here now,” he said.

Two smaller temples located in bylanes across the road from each other — one in Muslim-dominated Chaman Park and the other in Bhagirathi Vihar which has a mixed population — visibly remained untouched by the violence which occurred along the main road leading towards the Shiv Vihar tiraha.

Rajesh Vashisht, the pandit overseeing the Maha Shakti Hanuman Mandir in Prem Vihar across the road from Shiv Vihar, which witnessed some of the worst arson and vandalism, said the predominantly Hindu population of the area came and stood guard outside its gate as “information” about the rioting began surfacing.

“Not only local residents, but people from neighbouring areas also came to stand guard outside the temple to secure it,” he said. The Shri Pracheen Hanuman Mandir, located at the Shiv Vihar Tiraha, also saw mobilisation by Hindu residents.

“Pandit Sewa Ram, who oversees the temple, was hit on the forehead with a brick while he was on his way here. Thankfully no one else got hurt,” Pandit Munna Lal, who is also associated with the temple, said.

At Shiv Vihar across the road, however, damage to the wall reportedly due to stone pelting, according to local residents staying near the Shri Gauri Shankar Mandir, was evidence that temples in north-east Delhi were targets during the recent communal violence.

“Our temple bore most of the brunt of the stone pelting from across the road because of its location – all the three small bridges connecting this area to the main Karawal Nagar road – were blocked by rioters from the other [Muslim] side leaving us with no option but to stay put. Some of them working in pairs – with one using a torch to distract passersby and the other firing from a gun,” claimed Shivam Mishra, whose father Pandit Ranjit Mishra, oversees the Gauri Shankar Mandir.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/g5ipx9/article31077420.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE15TEMPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/in-communal-flare-ups-rumours-have-tactical-use/article31077421.ece
305,2020/03/16,Plea to extend Metro Rail till Patancheru,"Forum to Improve Things submits memorandum to HMR Managing Director N.V.S. Reddy

Forum to Improve Things (FIT), a citizens group lobbying for extending the Hyderabad Metro Rail upto Patancheru in the proposed second phase, has met the HMR Managing Director N.V.S. Reddy and handed over a memorandum making a case for the elevated mass transit line to be extended up to their area on Monday.

The organisation representatives regretted that the detailed project report on the second phase submitted to the TS government has not considered Patancheru even though lakhs of citizens live in and around Madinaguda, Chandanagar, BHEL, RC Puram, Ameenpur, Beerumguda and so on.

While appreciating the efforts of the State government and HMR in successful completion and operationalising (69 km) of Metro Phase-I and for more than four lakh passengers utilising the green public commute, the citizens group wanted the proposed extension of metro rail from from Miyapur to BHEL to be further moved ahead till Patancheru or about six kilometres more.

“Patancheru has Outer Ring Road (ORR) connectivity; hence can be a very good starting point for metro commuters and has good commercial viability too,” they maintained and recalled Municipal Administration & IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao’s stance during the separate State agitation where he had questioned the rationale of starting the project from Miyapur when the traffic actually originated from Patancheru.

“KTR also promised to extend the metro rail service to Patancheru and this was affirmed by Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao during the 2018 election campaign as well,” they said. The group also managed to collect about 7,000 signatures from the citizens in these areas in support of their campaign urging the government to do a re-think in the second phase of the project as it would benefit people of all walks of life — students, employees and businesspersons, as around 30 lakh reside in the fast growing suburb, the memorandum added.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/plea-to-extend-metro-rail-till-patancheru/article31085453.ece

307,2020/03/16,Steer to safety with ‘Women on Wheels’,"The cab service ‘Women on Wheels’ is set to provide a safe ride for women in the city

Excited, nervous and eager — the four women cab drivers of Women on Wheels (WoW) cannot wait to begin work. Hyderabad’s first venture, WoW is a ‘women for women’ cab service. Dressed in their uniform — pista-green kurta and purple chudidar — the first batch of four women drivers who are currently undergoing GPS training finish their breakfast and sit to chat. The smiles on their faces reflect their eagerness to start work. This being the first phase, WoW started by Jyotsna Angara, founder of YoDee Foundation, targets to roll out 100 women cab drivers by March 2021.

Dhanalakshmi V D, Sharada T, Sharada D and Sowjanya M — all aged between 28 and 40 years — made a choice to take up driving for their financial independence much against the approval of their family.

As we begin our conversation, Sharada D gets teary-eyed. She is an instructor with Maruti Driving school and is a single parent. She wants to be an example to her daughters. “My husband left me and I have been taking care of my daughters. I want them to grow up strong, confident and economically independent. The only support I had when I decided to take up driving was Jyotsna madam. She literally hand-held us through our tough times,” said Sharada D.

To begin with, WoW will ply cabs in and around Hitec City, Madhapur and Gachibowli, only during the day time. They will work five days a week. “As we move ahead and add more drivers, more areas will be covered and timings will be extended. The cab services can be booked online through EasyCommute App. The women drivers, besides driving, were trained in confidence building, road etiquette and self-defence. They were also given orientation in concept of ‘atithi devo bhava’ (the guest is god). Training in first aid, small repairs, basic English and communication skills, topography of the city, Google Maps-literacy were also part of their training,” says Jyotsna.

Jyotsna added that the vehicles are financed by the Women and Child Welfare Department and subsidised to the extent of 35% and the government even provided 10% margin money required.

Sharing that it was her sheer need to strengthen their financial status that made her take up this career, Dhanalakshmi V says, “My husband’s earning as an electrician isn’t sufficient to foot the medical bills of my elder son. He has a hole in his heart and needs medical attention quite often.” What’s the difficulty that she faced?

“To be behind the wheels is a confident feeling but the most difficult part for me was to cross the bigger speed breakers smoothly,” she laughs. T Sharada joins, “Also the slope climbing. Hand brake and accelerator trick,” she smiles.

While T Sharada’s husband who is also a driver didn’t think much of her driving until one day when their daughter forced him to hand over the steering to her mother. “We are returning from our village. It was getting dark and my husband was tired. Even then he insisted he would drive. As night fell, my daughter sternly told her father to hand over the steering wheel to me and said she would feel much safer if I drove us all back home. My husband had no choice but to switch seats. After that day, he never taunted me about my choice,” smiles Sharada.

Women on Wheels is supported by Government of Telangana, Department of Women Development and Child Welfare. TSRTC, Transport Department, Police, Sultan-Ul-Uloom Education Society, Radisson Blu, We Connect, Area 9 Ladies Circle of Round Table India and a few others.

“YoDee, means Stree Shakthi. The objective of WoW is not for profit entities. It is to unite women and ideas to support their personal and professional life,” informs Pinky Singh of YoDee. Talking about future plans, Jyotsna shares that Sh(e) Autos are on the anvil. These electrical autos again will be by women for women. “The details of the same are being worked out and the same will be shared as soon as we are ready to roll out. To start with, we will roll out 100 autos,” adds Jyotsna.

Did the ladies face any mishaps — small or big — while learning? “No,” Sharada says with pride. “None of our cars got even a minor scratch. That is also because we learnt in the simulator first. That gave us an idea of the steering wheel angles, distance to be maintained, U-turns etc,” adds Sowjanya. “We took a lot of time to master reverse parking,” laughs Dhanalakshmi.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/im6yog/article31082585.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Hy17Women-on-wheels,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/yodee-wow-women-on-wheels-hyderabads-women-for-women-cab-service/article31082587.ece
308,2020/03/16,SCR commissions 12.2 km double line,"Built at an estimated cost of ₹200 crore with automatic signalling, this is likely to improve punctuality

South Central Railway (SCR) has completed a long-pending infrastructure project, by opening the first four lines, with two new double line electrified stretch from Moula Ali to Ghatkesar, successfully commissioned a few days ago after the go ahead by the Commissioner of Railway Safety.

More trains likely

The 12.2-km double line, built at an estimated cost of ₹200 crore with automatic signalling, is likely to improve the punctuality of passenger trains heading towards Secunderabad station to some extent as with this, more trains can be run simultaneously, including freight ones.

Passenger complaints of trains halting in the outer can be minimised but the bottleneck could be reaching up to Secunderabad station platforms because the plan to provide more lines between the 10-km Moula Ali-Secunderabad is yet to be finalised.

It is a double line currently, informed senior officials, pleading anonymity.

SCR has been taking up many works on doubling and tripling along with electrification in the suburbs ostensibly for the ongoing MMTS Phase II project and to aid its capacity to run long distance as well as freight trains more imaginatively.

If this ‘critical section’ misses the eye of the top brass, the issue of getting permission from the local military authorities for the four kilometre stretch between Moula Ali and Sanatnagar is yet to be sorted out despite clearance from the Defence ministry.

Senior officials claim that “70% of work of the 25-km doubling and electrification between Moula Ali and Sanatnagar has been done and finishing touches are being given for the five stations en route including Moula Ali HB Colony, Suchitra Centre, Bhoodevinagar, Neredmet and Ferozeguda.”

This line has always been used to move freight, so it did not have any stations in between but these are being built for the MMTS Phase II suburban trains, senior officials explained.

Seven freight trains and now passenger trains are being run in the newly-opened Moula Ali-Ghatkesar section as it connects Secunderabad, Kazipet, Nadikudi (Guntur) and Sanatnagar.

Two lines will be used to operate train services from Moula Ali to Ghatkesar parallely and the other two, for running trains from Ghatkesar to Moula Ali. Two additional platforms each were constructed at Charlapalli and Ghatkesar together with station buildings at Moula Ali C cabin, Cherlapalli and Ghatkesar, informed senior officials.

Other works being carried out by Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) for the MMTS Phase Two project are doubling and electrification between Falaknuma – Umdanagar of 12 km. It has already completed new rail line works between Telapur - Ramachandrapuram of 5.5 km, electrification and doubling between Bolarum - Medchal of 18 km.

Reaching out

MMTS Phase I runs 121 services between Falaknuma - Secunderabad - Hyderabad - Lingampalli - Ramachandrapuram. MMTS Phase II is proposed for distance of 84 km to connect suburbs with State Government and SCR sharing the cost at the two-third ratio.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/27deme/article31077110.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy15SCR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/scr-commissions-122-km-double-line/article31077105.ece

311,2020/03/16,"Cinemas down shutters, pubs call off concerts after State govt. directive","Entertainment industry likely to suffer big losses, say observers

Film theatres were closed and malls witnessed low footfall on Sunday. Several events, including music concerts, in pubs were cancelled.

In an effort to contain the spread of COVID-19, the State government on Saturday barred public gatherings, and ordered closure of educational institutions, cinema halls, sports activities and exhibitions.

Aggressive Tendencies, an initiative to promote rock music, scheduled for March 15 in The Moonshine Project, a resto-pub in Filmnagar, was cancelled. The concert was to feature at least three rock bands and its shelving came as a let down for many music lovers.

Those in events and sound engineering business pointed out that while there has been a dip in the number of concerts and performances in the city on account of the coronavirus scare, the government’s instructions have brought revenues to a complete halt.

According to Oswin from Hangar 18, an event and sound rental company, while the directives can have an impact on revenues, he opined that it is better to take precautionary measures now than have regrets later.

“As it is, the number of live gigs went down at least by half in the past fortnight because of the coronavirus scare. The closure of pubs for the next few days has led to cancellation of several events, including that at a well known pub-restaurant in the city. But if this closure continues for, say, 60 days, this could have a massive impact on us,” Mr Oswin said.

While several malls remained open, multiplexes within them remained shut. Case in point is Prasads, which downed shutters of its box office on Sunday. The closure, observers said, is likely to affect revenues of several movies running in cinemas.

Muthyala Ramdoss, vice-president, Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce, said while the closure was certain to affect the industry, several movies are released during festivals such as Sankranthi and Dasara. “This is somewhat of a dry season. There aren’t many films releasing immediately,” he said.

312,2020/03/16,Districts asked to rise to the occasion,"‘Ensure availability of hand sanitisers, make provision for safe drinking water at govt. offices’

The State government on Sunday passed on a slew of advisories to officials in all 33 districts to implement the decisions taken by the Cabinet the previous day to tackle COVID-19.

Among the orders issued were a mandate to all the district officers to ensure availability of hand sanitisers at fair-price shops, anganwadi centres, civil supplies godowns, citizen service centres, MeeSeva centres and locations where people are expected to visit in large numbers.

District-level officers were also asked to plan for provision of safe and clean drinking water for visitors at government offices in the next three to four days. It should be ensured that the water is served or made available on self-service basis in hygienic conditions. It was advised that the offices use clay pots which were properly cleaned and topped with a cover. The planning for drinking water should also extend to highways, bus stands and crowded places.

Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar issued an order asking Collectors, Superintendents and Commissioners of Police, District Disaster Management Authorities and competent authorities of institutions, organisations and facilities that came under scanner of the Cabinet to ensure strict implementation of the instructions without any deviation. They should take all steps under Disaster Management Act, 2005, and Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, to check the spread of COVID-19.

Special Chief Secretary of Health A. Santhi Kumar issued a memo separately asking authorities of residential schools, colleges and hostels, both in government and private sector, to strictly follow social distance practices. All the frequently-touched surfaces and objects such as door and window handles, railings and desk tops should be cleaned with detergent water frequently.

313,2020/03/16,Universities order students out of hostels to prevent spread,"OU administration plans to cut off water, power supply to ensure compliance; UoH to limit mess facility

Universities seem to be working in different directions after the State government suspended academic and class work till March 31 as a precaution against spread of COVID-19.

The University of Hyderabad (UoH) has suspended class work but decided to keep hostels open with limited mess facility. UoH authorities said a majority of students who come from different parts of the country are reluctant to leave, particularly those from Kerala where the virus outbreak is more.

The English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU) has given time to students till March 18 to vacate hostels. The mess facility will also be closed. A high level meeting of varsity officials on Sunday was presided over by EFLU Vice-Chancellor Suresh Kumar.

Osmania University, on the other hand, has asked students to vacate the hostels, and the mess facility will be closed by lunch on Monday. Unlike UoH and EFLU, the OU hostels are porous and it is difficult to prevent students from staying. “If students don’t vacate, the administration will cut off water and power supply,” an official said.

However, all the universities are persuading the students to vacate the hostels asking them to realise the gravity of the situation.

Online classes

Mr. Suresh Kumar said classes for regular courses will be held online from March 19 and students should check the university website regularly for further information. Separate instructions will be issued to foreign students.

In case of courses with more than 50 students, the teacher will divide the class into two groups and intimate the students accordingly. Internal assessment shall also be conducted online. Ph.D course work/ guidance shall be offered online. Teaching and non-teaching staff, however, will have to attend duties.

Exam schedule

OU administration said that all the semester exams that are already scheduled and under way will be held. All the hostels, mess facilities, and libraries will also be closed with immediate effect, officials said.

UoH Vice-Chancellor P. Appa Rao Podile said for students who insist on continuing to stay on campus, limited hostel services will be provided.

The academic council meeting of the university scheduled for March 20 will also be deferred. The V-C, however, assured that necessary steps will be taken to approve and implement all admissions-related proposals in time for the notification to be issued for the next academic year.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/universities-order-students-out-of-hostels-to-prevent-spread/article31077013.ece

315,2020/03/16,Asymptomatic air passengers from seven countries to be quarantined,"Two quarantine centres are on the city outskirts

Moderate and low-risk category air passengers from seven COVID-19-affected countries arriving at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) at Shamshabad would be quarantined for 14 days at two facilities on the outskirts of Hyderabad.

If a passenger from any of the seven countries — China, Democratic Republic of Korea, France, Italy, Iran, Germany, Spain — shows symptoms, he/she will be admitted to isolation wards and samples will be collected for tests. However, if the passengers are asymptomatic, they will be quarantined at Haritha Valley view resort in Ananthagiri Hills, Vikarabad, and the Telangana State Forest Academy, Dulapally, said Health officials.

One more facility is being considered for the purpose.

Currently, the daily volume of passengers from the seven countries is low.

Category B (moderate risk) category passengers are those who come from the seven countries, are asymptomatic, are elderly (over 60 years of age) and have conditions like hypertension, diabetes and asthma.

Category C (low risk) passengers are those who come from the seven countries and are asymptomatic.

“If any of them develops symptoms during the 14-day quarantine period, they will be taken to isolation wards in government hospitals, and samples will be taken for tests,” said an official from Health department.

The official said samples are not collected from all air passengers as viral load will be less when a person does not have any symptoms. “So, the chances of detecting the virus will be low,” the official said.Health Minister Eatala Rajender said the facility at Vikarabad will not be used to provide treatment to people who have the virus. “Treatment would be provided only at Gandhi Hospital and Chest Hospital,” he said.

The Health Minister spoke to Special Chief Secretary A. Santhi Kumari and other senior officials about taking stock of the situation.

He directed them to ensure that the Gandhi Hospital, Fever Hospital and Osmania General Hospital are prepared to face any emergency situation akin to the ongoing one.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/asymptomatic-air-passengers-from-seven-countries-to-be-quarantined/article31076964.ece
316,2020/03/16,How Pendilbury’s ‘Arithmetic for Standards’ became the standard for teachers in Karnataka,"A look at Ganita Bodhini, the Kannada translation of Charles Pendilbury’s book which was first printed in 1899

Ganita Bodhini is the Kannada translation of ‘Arithmetic for the Standards (Canarese) Part 1’ written by Charles Pendilbury. The name of the Kannada translator is not mentioned in the book which is a first edition and was printed in 1899. This book was printed by S.P.C.K. Press, Veperi and was published by Seymour Hale of Mumbai. Five thousand copies were printed in the first edition and it contains 264 pages. However, its price is not mentioned.

Pendilbury who was born in London in 1864, was a renowned mathematician of his times. He also held the post of Secretary of The Mathematical Association, London for 50 years from 1886 to 1936. Numerous novel evolutions and creative concepts in methodologies about mathematical teaching were formulated by the Association during his Secretaryship. Pendilbury also penned many books on mathematics.

Kannada has a rich tradition in literature pertaining to mathematics. Rajadithya, Kannada poet in 1190 BC, wrote the Vyavahara Ganita, Kshetra Ganita (geometry), Vyavahara Ratna, Llilavati and Gnanaganita Sutradhikodaharana. Vyavahara Ganita and Lilavati were edited and published by Vidwan M.Mariyappa Bhat in 1950.

Prof.Padmavathamma published Vyavahara Ganita in 2013. Unfortunately, not much is known about Kannada mathematician and writer, Timmarasa. After the printing technology came into existence a plethora of books about and on mathematics were published in Kannada. Various books about theory, application, dictionaries, research and teaching methodologies in Mathematics in the branches of arithmetic, algebra, geometry and trigonometry were copiously published.

Another novel feature of Kannada is its own independent numeric system like the Arabic and Roman numerals. Rev B Rice brought out Ganita Vidyeyu (Canarese Arithmetic) in Kannada in 1846 using only Kannada numerals, which is amazing. Ganita Pustaka Purananka (1833 – litho print) is the first ever printed mathematics book written by the Committee of Native Mathematicians headed by Walter Eliot. It is very interesting to note that more native mathematics authours wrote in Kannada — there are more than hundred titles from 1833-1900.

Anka Lipi (1871) by Balakrishna Venkatesha Abbigeri is about Kannada numerals, revealing their novelty and inherently independent attitude of the Kannada language and culture in academics. Venkata Rango Katti, a renowned authour and social reformer, was also a mathematician who wrote Bayilekkagala Pustakavu in 1872.

Apoornanka (1835 – litho print) by Balasastri Jambhekara, Sulabha Bayi Lekkagalu (1850) by Chennaveera Phakeerappa, Rekha Ganita (1866) by B.Rama Rao, Ankaganita (1868) by Gurappa Martadi, Ganitanyaya (1870) by Ziegler, Ankaganitavu (1873) by Channabasavappa Basavalingappa Dharawadakara, Ankaganita (1875) by Ranu Devji More, Koshtakavu(1876) by Mishralal Ramprasad Misara, Anka Ganita (1876, second edition, 10,000 copies) by the Department of Public Instruction, Bangalore), Chikka Hudugarigoskara (1877) by Hari Sawant Bhikaji, Ganitarnava (1878) by Laksmipataiah, Ganita Sandgraha (1881) by Krishnaji Ananta Jakati, Ganitalayavu (1883) by Hanamanta Venkatesa Yaragatti, Ankaganita (1889) by Virupaksha Chinnappa Huli, Chikka Balakara Saluvagi Koshtakagalu (1891) by the Village Officer Printing Press in Bijapur, Beejaganitada Mulatatwagalu (1897) by Ramachandra Hanamanta Deshpande and Akruthi (1900) by Ra Narasimhacharya, are some of the mathematics books of yesteryears in Kannada.

Ganita Bodhini narrates how teachers should teach arithmetics in an interesting manner. It served as a text for primary school teacher trainees for decades. Instructions to teachers, numerals, recitation of numerals, addition, subtraction, recitation of multiplication tables from 1 to 20, exhibition of numerals, multiplication, division, transformation, weights and measures, concept of Time, measurements of length, squares, cubes, measurement of grains — these are the 14 classified chapters of the book.

In the appendix, Currency and Coins of India and England, Weighing systems of India and England, Measurement systems of Princely Mysore State, India and England, Weighing and measurement systems of Liquids and Solids in Mysore, India and England are given in tabular form. The book gives an insight to the social systems, economy, political attitudes of the Colonial Period as well as how colonial states were reacting to the British Kingdom.

In the chapter, Instructions to Teachers, the author instructs trainees on the importance of materials to be used to teach numbers from 1-100. He says that slates with coloured beads of ten each and bundles of sticks of hundreds and tens would be very useful. Till recently, this system was in use in Indian primary schools. A teacher should recite with children the numbers from 1-9 several times so the child learns counting by heart. While giving examples, the teacher should choose articles which are at hand in the classroom such as books, pencils, erasers and the like. Children should be involved in the learning process. For example, students could be instructed to use the black board, while others used their slates.

In actuality, these are the basic principles of teaching and is relevant at all times. The book narrates the methodology of teaching to trainiees, such as making the students solve given arithemetical problems in the classroom by discussing them with neighbouring students. This may be done by dividing the children into groups of five each. In the chapter Numerals, the author explains about the number 9373. The number should be read from left to right. However, while analysing it, it goes from right to left. That is, the first 3 in the extreme right is in the decimal place and it indicates numeral 3. The second 7 indicates 7 tens, the third 3 represents 3 hundreds and the fourth 9 indicates 9 thousands. That is why 9373 is known as nine thousand three hundred and seventy three. Thus, this book has adopted a simple way of communicating complex problems in a simple way. This book which preaches methodology of teaching arithmetics to teacher trainees in a simple and effective manner is a significant contributiton to mathematics literature in Kannada.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/rggndy/article31081828.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13bgfrpage3scan1,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/how-pendilburys-arithmetic-for-standards-became-the-standard-for-teachers-in-karnataka/article31081832.ece
317,2020/03/16,A look at Bellave Venkatanaranappa’s efforts in restoring the city’s ruins,"A towering personality: Mallikarjuna Swamy Temple behind Bull Temple in Bugle Rock park in Bengaluru is a classic example of Venkatanaranappa’s efforts in restoring a ruin

The present generation of Bengaluru residents will thankfully remember early morning risers for the remarkable services rendered by them in the days of yore with regard to the city we are living in today. One of such Good Samaritan is Bellave Venkatanaranappa. He was lean and tall, could be seen even in the midst of a thick crowd. But taller than his physique, were his concern and passion to preserve the past of the city.

In Basavanagudi of South Bengaluru, heritage landmarks like Bugle Rock Park, the temples in and around the Rock Graden, Kannada Sahitya Parishat building, Basavanagudi Union and Service Club and many more such iconic structures owe their existence to the untiring efforts of men like Bellave Venkatanaranappa. He was popularly known in literary, social, and educational circles as BeVem. He also stands as a role model for the present generation as a reminder that it is their primary duty to preserve the history, culture and monument of their residential area. Thus, the tall man is also remembered as a towering personality of the city.

Mallikarjuna Swamy Temple behind Bull Temple in Bugle Rock park stands as a classic example for his committed efforts in bringing a ruined temple to life. In fact, at the premises of the temple there is an information board which gives its historical background. Jnana Deepti English Medium School of Girinagr donated the plaque, while N S Sridhara Murthi, a well known journalist and Kannada film historian has provided the content. It’s a welcome effort and many such plaques are to be established in hundreds of historically significant spots of the city, to preserve the glory of old Bengaluru for to the common man. This move is extremely essential to preserve the rich history of the city.

According to the information given on the plaque, during the rule of Mysore kings, Achyuta Raya, one of the three officers appointed by Mysore king to manage the city administration, built a Mallikarjuna Swamy Temple here around 1709. But, after the Third Anglo Mysore War fought in Bengaluru in 1791, this place was deserted and the temple also turned into ruin.

By 1900, new extensions like Charmrajapete, Basavanagudi, Malleswaram had been formed to decongest the old Bengaluru areas. Due to the existence of the Big Bull, the South Bengaluru extension was named after the temple. Presence of a rock garden, greenery, serene atmosphere, huge lakes all around, and a systematic planning of the extension, Basavanagudi was the favoured choice for intellectuals, bureaucrats and legal luminaries to settle down. BeVem had built his house in the corner at the junction of the present day Police Station road and DVG Main Road. His house still stands in its original form.

He was also planning to build a Shiva temple in this area. As if providence had fulfilled his wish, he stumbled upon a Shiva Linga and a ruined temple close to the waterhole formed by Vrushabhavati that originated as an underground stream from the Bull temple. After ascertaining the history of the temple through records, he decided to revive the same.

At that time, Bengaluru was on an expansion spree. The ruined portions of the stone fort near City Market were pulled down and the stone blocks were sold through bidding. BeVem procured them and built the temple. He was so involved in the task, that many a time, he himself would place the stone and plaster the wall. By 1903, the completed temple was open to the public.

The temple was an inseparable part of BeVem’s routine. His involvement and commitment was such that, he would not miss a single day without a visit, even if it was late night. Every year, during the month of Kartika (usually November) he would whitewash and get the lamps and other materials from his house for worship.

From the beginning, BeVem was keen to bring the temple under government protectionas it would protect the temple’s interests.

In 1905, for the Festival of Lights during Kartika, he invited Dewan V.P Madhava Rao. The path from the main road up to the temple was well decorated and the Dewan was traditionally welcomed with Veda mantras by scholars Bellave Narahari Shastri and Shivarama Shastri . The surprised Dewan asked BeVem the reason for the celebration. With humility, he said, “I had taken a oath that I would offer thousand lights to Lord Shiva and distribute sweets when the new Dewan assumes the office. Now the time has come to fulfil my vow”

Realizing his passion to protect the temple, the Dewan turned to the accompanying Deputy Commisioner and ordered, ‘Today is Monday, by Thursday orders to this effect should be handed over to BeVem.’ He also told BeVem to remind him if he failed to get the order on the same day. When the government letter reached his hand, he was extremely happy that the temple was protected. With the same zeal, commitment and devotion he served the temple for about four decades.

He was equally concerned about the conservation of Bugle Rock Park. He knew each rock and boulder in the place and was concerned about its flora and fauna. If he found anyone disturbing the place, the offender would be subjected to his intense ire. For DVG, BeVem and many others, the Basavanagudi park was a favorite place to sit and talk about literature, politics and other topics.

In recognition of his invaluable contribution towards preserving the park, the entrance from Police Station Road was named Belave Venkatanaranappa Dwara.

The black and white photo of the temple was captured by a veteran photographer Dr. G. Thomas several decades back with academic interest.

318,2020/03/16,S Settar was a one-man army unravelling the various facets of the Kannada language,"Kannada, Kannada Nudi and Kannadanadu

The passing of Professor S. Settar on February 28 marked the end of an era of historical research of classical Kannada literature. Though short lived, this era can aptly be described as one man’s mission to unravel the history of the Kannada language — its development and transformation through time — and its relation with other classical languages such as Prakrit, Tamil and Sanskrit. Settar found them to be unfathomable storehouses of historical information necessitating a study in a manner hitherto not attempted by his predecessors either in the disciplines of history or Kannada literature.

The hall mark of Settar’s investigations was an understanding of Kannada literature in all genres with all its ramifications. He would identify the historical significance of each and every word, collating them to fit into innovative uses and arrive at provocative rather than conclusive statements.

Following his passing, many of his well wishers, admirers and ardent readers of his writings paid tribute to his contributions in developing the field of new history of Kannadanadu and its people. His works were introduced by eminent scholars including historians, archaeologists, literary critics and linguists, who did not hide their admiration of his in-depth knowledge of the sources he was consulting, the innovative methods he was devising for each one of the historical themes he dealt with and his concern for authentic sources.

Based on these, Settar stood on firm ground, building a superstructure not so easy to demolish. He was thoroughly informed of the secondary sources that led him to primary sources and reread them. His works at once commanded respect and took many a contemporary by surprise and left them wondering why they were not able to move in similar directions. He has been admired for his eclectic approach and for his interdisciplinary framework of research. He dealt with a diverse variety of themes and focussed on the rank and file of society. For him, the subject matter of death was as important as life. He appreciated art in all forms, from all time periods — for him, the creators of art were as important as the patrons of art.

He was bilingual in the true sense of the term, writing in English and Kannada with equal dexterity and command. He expressed himself in the most intelligible manner, enriching our understanding of the history and culture of Kannada-speaking people. While tracing the antiquity of the Kannada language and its script, he mastered the Prakrit language and its script. As a result, he emerged as a trilingualist — a rare combination in a history scholar. His last publication titled Early Buddhist Artisans and Their Architectural Vocabulary (to be released posthumously) bears ample testimony of his prowess.

Settar was always eager to hear from his critics to improve upon the theoretical frameworks of his investigations. In all humility, he would always end his notes with, ‘My findings are not conclusions, but pathways for future research either to refute or to subscribe to my findings’. Though he did not have a concluding statement, he preferred to end his seminal publications with concluding remarks. He was a holistic historian of Kannada, Kannada Nudi and Kannada Nadu, a polymath par excellence.

Though he passed away at the ripe age of 85 and had been ailing for some time, he desired to live for at least two more years. He mentioned this to be me during his last but one, discharge from the hospital. Unfortunately, he was not destined to see the completion of his ongoing works. To a few of his close associates he had said, “In order to facilitate an easy reading of Halagannada Kavyas I have prepared a glossary. I need to revisit this glossary. My work on Kavirajamarga (the earliest known Kannada text) and editing is half done. My study of the inscriptions of the first millennium is progressing well, its glossary has been completed but needs to be scientifically presented in a bilingual format. My plans for further research on these and other aspects are of Himalayan proportion, I would like to explore the darker areas of Kannada literature, write in Kannada, and incorporate new ideas and themes into Kannada history and live to complete them.”

Perhaps he had a premonition of insufficient time. He had given final shape to the 8-volume Kannada Inscriptions of the First Millennium, each of which is 500 pages long. While the first volume is ready for strike order, the rest are in various stages of completion, will be ready in the next couple of months.

Besides all this, Settar also wrote plays for radio narrations, limericks, short stories, satires and left behind an incomplete autobiography. His obsession with Ashoka the Mauryan Emperor is reflected in his pen name Devanampriya, his first child Priydarshini, and his historical research centring on Ashoka and his edicts. His family’s trust in N. Ravikumar of Abhinava and me will not be in vain. These works will surely see the light of day.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/gtlsl4/article31081430.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SETTAR2,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/s-settar-was-a-one-man-army-unravelling-the-various-facets-of-the-kannada-language/article31081432.ece
319,2020/03/16,Why the belief that some men have advanced stages of being still persists,"Kotla’s mast qalandar: The belief that some some men have advanced stages of being still persists, though there may be a logical explanation

In the ruins of the Kotla lived a Mast Qalandar. Every day he would walk down to the tomb of Bhure Shah in the vicinity of the Red Fort and pray to the “saint with the fiery temper”. A big-built man with a barrel of a chest and a shaggy beard, his prayers were not the silent outpourings of a heart, but the mutterings of one who had lost contact with his surroundings. He would walk up to the shrine of Hare-Bhare and beat his chimta (iron tongs) to announce his arrival. Like Zanoni, from the 1842 book of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, who had the gift of immortality, he was likened to an order of mystics who thrive for centuries.

Sufi Rafiq Khan had this tale to tell about the Mast Qalandar. When Firoze Shah Tughlak took the reins of government into his hands after the sudden death of Mohammad bin Tughkal in Sindh, he was reminded by a young fakir that the emperor had died not because of the after-effects of a dish of bad fish, but because of cruelty to his subjects. So it was Firoze’s lot to undo the harm done by his cousin. The new Sultan was impressed by the words of the fakir and brought him along to Delhi. And when he built his Kotla, a special place was marked in it as the fakir’s abode.

Firoze Shah died after a very long reign. Taimur came and devastated Delhi. The Tughlaks were ousted by the Sayyids, who in turn lost their kingdom to the Lodhis. Next came the Moghuls and the British, but the fakir was still around. In 1857, during the revolt, he was at Kashmiri Gate, encouraging the bhistis (water carriers) to carry water to the sick and wounded.

The Qalandar was seen right up to 1947, but after the riots, he just disappeared. Some said that he had migrated to Pakistan and others that he had decided to make himself scare because of the disgusting events. Nobody could imagine that he might have been killed – such was the aura that surrounded him.

Abdul Hai, a man who kept track of goings on in Delhi, and whose religious and other beliefs were tinged more by logic and reason than blind faith, had a more plausible story to offer. The Mast Qalandar was a member of an order of dervishes who lived in secluded areas, and what was better than the ruins of the Kotla? Even if one came and another passed on, we’d never know the difference.

You can still find them visiting the Jama Masjid area, especially during the Ajmer Urs, when some of them strike strident poses at the grave of Hare-Bhare, shouting ‘Maula Bhej, Bhej’ meaning, ‘Send money to visit Ajmer or I’ll break this shrine’. To supplement their threat they either lift up their chimta or pick up a huge stone. But somebody or the other always fulfils their wish and so the ‘threat’ is warded off.

It is generally assumed that the order of Mast Qalandars originated in Iran, where before the advent of Islam it was almost unknown. It came to India with the Arab invasion of Sind and its adherents spread as far as Bengal. Mast Qalandars entered South India too sometime in the 13th century, but in Delhi they have existed since the time of the Slave dynasty. Some, however, claim that the order was mostly of Afghan origin.

One remembers a Mast Qalandar who used to stand in front of the sweets shop of Haji Kalan in Jama Masjid and beat his back with a chimta from time to time. He wore a huge black shirt and was quite wild in his habits, but people were somehow attracted to him though he hardly seemed to care, and the more alms he got the wilder he became. He used to come all the way from Basti Nizamuddin on foot and lived in one of the ruined dargahs. But he is long dead.

320,2020/03/16,Music producer Kumaran Sivamani releases his debut single,"For his debut single ‘Teasing Me’, Kumaran, son of Drums Sivamani, lets up heavy rhythm for a smooth pop sound

Kumaran Sivamani has always been fascinated by percussion and rhythm. Given that his father is Drums Sivamani — the iconic percussionist who plays everything from drums and darbuka to ghatam and kanjira — this does not come as a surprise.

However after three years in the Tamil music industry as a producer, for his first single, ‘Teasing Me’, he has let up heavy rhythm for a smooth pop vibe. A song made for the Valentine mood, he explains; the track was released late February.

‘Teasing Me’ employs catchy beats with repeated finger snaps — that blue-eyed boy of global pop music since around 2016. Keeping the intro simple, Kumaran gives plenty of space for Simona Gilbert’s smooth vocals to take centrestage, while AGabus’ rap section bridges the chorus and verses together.

“I met AGabus about four years ago. I graduated from Muzik Lounge (A school for sound engineering and audio technology in Vadapalani) and went back there to meet my teachers. There, during a freshers’ programme, I heard AGabus rapping. I was like, wow this is a new sound, and I asked if he would like to collaborate with me,” recalls Kumaran.

The collab with Simona however is much more recent. About two months ago, as Kumaran was watching his cousin’s Instagram stories, he saw Simona playing at an open mic in the city. Taken by her voice, he dropped her a text on the ‘Gram, and soon enough the trio started jamming regularly. It was during one of these jam sessions, that they came up with this song.

“I had created the beats for ‘Teasing Me’ a while ago, and they were just lying there in my computer. I played it to the two of them, and both of them were interested in making a song out of it,” he says, adding that Simona and AGabus wrote the lyrics for it.

Though he has not been in the music industry for all that long, Kumaran has an impressive track record already. He has worked on movies like Mersal, Bigil, Darbar, Petta, and 2.0 — the latter being his first film. He started out as a rhythm producer, before producing full songs and background scores.

Through these three years, he has worked a lot under AR Rahman who he lists as his main influence. “Working with AR Rahman changed my sound. What I used to produce before was very different. I learned a lot from him about arranging instruments: what tone should I put first, what should be the sub, where to use an echo or reverb, how to keep vocals crystal clear, how to make a song catchy... basically everything about mixing.”

Rahman was the first person to hear his track: “I took it to him after the first master. He said it had an international tone to it.”

Currently in and out of studios working on Vikram’s upcoming Cobra and Ponniyin Selvan, his next single, coming out in two weeks, will be a dance electronica. Producing career aside, he now wants to do more live shows and collaborate with Chennai’s hip hop, trap and rap artistes.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/78c9tl/article31083298.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPSivamanijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/music-producer-kumaran-sivamani-releases-his-debut-single/article31083299.ece

Yet, despite the age gap, each of these three Chennai-bred indie acts have created a sound they can call their own. More recently, they have also been sharing a bassist and a drummer between them — Jitesh and Ritesh Dharmaraj respectively.

The two have been in the music circuit since 2000, and have helped create popular English, Tamil and Malayalam tracks like Junkyard Groove’s ‘Folk you’ and Tails on Fire’s ‘Happiness Is A Headshot’. But after creating original music for nearly 20 years, their work has now branched out in an unexpected direction — towards Hindi language and towards covers. Since late last year, their new band Akaash focusses on belting out creative takes on popular Bollywood songs. We ask Jitesh why and his answer is sobering.

Expanding horizons

To put it simply, the duo have woken up to the massive market there is for Hindi film songs around the country. “It is at least twice that of English songs. From the industry to private and corporate shows, everyone wants to hear Hindi songs,” he says, adding, “Things have gone full circle as far as English [music in India] is concerned. There is a massive requirement for Hindi music. When we first started playing in 2000-2001, before there was access to broadband and streaming platforms, our market was extremely narrow — just the indie music scene. That was what we catered to; that was who we played to.”

Now, there is a slightly different kind of catering to do, and the band of four seem to be doing it well. In a sharp contrast to the energetic, electric riffs of Tails on Fire and the deep yet laidback tunes of Junkyard, Akaash produces music that is light, bluesy, and very pop. Vocalist Akash Kumar, who looks like someone straight out of an Indian boyband from the 1990s, is at the forefront as the dapper lead vocalist. Vijay Krishnan does backup vocals in addition to playing the lead guitar. Jitesh retains his role as bassist while Ritesh trades in the drumkit for the cajón. The covers they bring out are soothing, to say the least; sometimes even more so than the originally soothing numbers like ‘Jab koi baat bigar jaye’. Each of their renditions are calm and understated, even those of party songs like ‘Sooraj dooba hai’.

It seems to work in their favour: videos are raking in views by the hundreds per week. Which is exactly what they are supposed to do, thus creating a foothold for the band’s originals to gradually make their way up. Released last December, ‘Kahani’ is soft but with a comparatively heavy riff. It is your regular song of aspirations and the journey of life complete with a millennial whoop but manages to make itself felt. The story behind it is interesting. Though it is a Hindi song, it was written in Tamil, says Jitesh. “My Hindi is not great. So I wrote it my own way and Akash translated it with the help of a friend. Ritesh set it to music. Abin Pushpakaran of BLU Academy does our audio mixes and mastering,” he adds.

The song’s success level seems to be in keeping with Akaash’s covers — no more, no less. There are more to come, says Jitesh, and the band is waiting for the right moment to drop them. “You realise that people from across the world have access to you. You realise that there are many more languages that you could play in that there is a massive requirement for.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/fd80yl/article31082428.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPAKAASH2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/why-experienced-chennai-musicians-are-turning-to-bollywood-covers/article31082430.ece
322,2020/03/16,Pettah Metro service from April first week,"Safety inspection on Thykoodam-Pettah viaduct on March 25, 26

With the work getting over on the Kochi Metro’s Thykoodam-Pettah viaduct, the stretch is most likely to be opened for service in the first week of April, official sources said.

The Commissioner for Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) would inspect the stretch on March 25 and 26. The 1.50-km stretch will be opened for metro traffic based on the outcome of the inspection.

The State government has made it clear that there will not be any official function in connection with extension of metro services to Pettah, due to curbs on public gatherings in view of COVID-19 precautions. The Government is also against opening the corridor before March 31, metro sources said.

The CMRS inspection will be followed by service trials. Once services begin in April, trains will operate at 25 kmph speed for a month on the stretch. This will be followed by trains touching the regular speed of up to 74 kmph as in rest of the metro corridor. Entry and exit on both sides of the station building at Pettah are ready. The only work pending is covering the station building using panels. There is space to park up to 40 cars near the Pettah station.

Champakkara overbridge

Work on the two-lane Champakkara overbridge on the stretch too is nearing completion. Two lanes of the bridge were opened to traffic in 2019. Two more lanes will be opened in June or July. The pending portion of the old bridge will be dismantled after pipelines and cables atop it are relocated.

The bridge built by the DMRC is unique since it borrows the bow-string girder design. In this, 1-metre-thick beams are sufficient, as compared to the conventional 2.2-metre-thick beams. This is because the bow-string structure provides additional reinforcement to the structure. This technology also lessened its length, saving on cost, sources said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pettah-metro-service-from-april-first-week/article31085141.ece

329,2020/03/16,‘Link’ workers for COVID-19 prevention awareness,"The National Health Mission has recently trained a group of 11 migrant workers to disseminate health-related awareness messages among migrant workers in Ernakulam district. The training has come in handy almost immediately, with the “link” workers are now creating awareness among migrants about methods to contain the spread of the coronavirus infection (COVID-19).

Rajendra Naik, who works in a plywood company in Perumbavoor, was trained in January to be one such “migrant link worker”. Both in his neighbourhood and in the companies nearby, he has been informing people of the need to wash hands regularly, seek help in case of fever and avoid large gatherings. “It is necessary to warn them of such infections since workers tend to brush aside fever or small illnesses and choose to self-medicate,” said Mr. Naik, who hails from Kandhamal, Odisha.

“Such link workers can help bridge the communication gap with migrant workers,” said Akhil Manuel, nodal officer of the Atithi Devo Bhava project in the district. Launched over a year ago, the project is targeted towards screening and addressing health concerns among migrant workers. The link workers, who were identified based on their fluency in Malayalam and leadership abilities, will also assist the Labour and Excise departments at the ground level.

Supriya Debnath, another link worker from Odisha who is a government school teacher near Aluva, said that when she met construction workers in the area, some of them had panicked over the virus and wanted to return to their home states. “We had to inform them that it was best to avoid travelling in crowded train compartments, particularly with small children,” she said.

The link workers were not being sent out actively to create awareness during the outbreak, but were encouraged to circulate WhatsApp audio messages and inform those in their vicinity, Dr. Manuel said.

Since the audio messages circulated by the NHM in Assamese, Bengali, Hindi and other languages were confined to those with access to smartphones, awareness by word of mouth was essential, said Benoy Peter, director, Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/link-workers-for-covid-19-prevention-awareness/article31077325.ece
330,2020/03/16,Collector asks hotels to maintain vigil,"87 new persons brought under observation for suspected COVID-19 in district

The District Collector has directed hotels to report the numbers of foreign nationals and their travel details to the Health Department.

A list of dos and don’ts have been laid out on how to maintain cleanliness and how to disinfect vehicles in which a suspected COVID-19 patient may have travelled.

Employees have been asked to take proper personal protection care while interacting with guests at the hotel. The instructions also include avoiding air-conditioned vehicles, avoiding shaking hands and keeping a social distance of about one metre. Hands should be washed with soap and water at frequent intervals.

On Sunday, 87 new people were brought under observation for suspected COVID-19, of which 77 are under home quarantine and 10 taken to the isolation ward at Government Medical College, Ernakulam.

Observation complete

Twenty-two people who have completed the observation period were removed from quarantine.

At the medical college hospital, four were discharged, bringing the number under observation at the institute to 25.

For the district administration, it was a race against time on Sunday to stop the Emirates flight bound for Dubai, which was to carry a UK national, who tested positive for COVID-19.

According to the district administration, the news of the British national being at the Cochin International Airport was received by District Collector S. Suhas only 15 minutes before the flight was to take off. Swift action followed to ensure that the tourist was isolated and others at risk evacuated.

By the time instructions were issued to hold the flight, all the crew had boarded the plane, but the race was won in time to ensure that a crisis-like situation was avoided.

The Idukki district administration informed the collector here by 8.45 a.m. that the tourist, who was under surveillance in Munnar, had reached the Kochi airport. He was bound for Dubai by the flight scheduled to take off at 9 a.m. The Ernakulam District Collector then initiated steps to ensure that the flight did not take off. It was a rare occasion and an unprecedented step for the district administration.

Instructions were issued initially to evacuate all the 270 passengers on board the flight and to subject them to preliminary check. . They were evacuated.

The tourist and his wife were directly escorted to an ambulance ready at the airport and taken to the isolation ward of the Ernakulam Government Medical College Hospital. Minister for Agriculture V.S. Sunilkumar arrived at the airport to attend to the situation and consultation was held with the Chief Minister and Health Minister before the other travellers were allowed to fly by 12.47 p.m.

332,2020/03/16,"Hotels, tourists feel the quarantine challenge","Industry uncertain about providing rooms for guests

The government directive to quarantine all persons reaching the city from other countries for 14 days has become a challenge for both hoteliers as well as tourists.

“Many of them come here for two weeks’ holiday,” said the manager of a nine-room resort in Fort Kochi, which has only two foreign guests now. “We have been sending mails to all guests indicating cancellation of accommodation. Many have cancelled on their own too.”

Off the radar

But, there could be some who are touring around, having escaped the Health officials’ radar in various parts of the country, said the resort manager. However, such people would find it difficult to get accommodation anywhere as the hoteliers are fully aware of the situation and would demand certification that they are COVID-19-free from them.

A Belgian tourist, who was here for over a month on the last leg of his tour, wanted to go to Munnar, before leaving the country. But the Munnar hotelier did not confirm the tourist’s accommodation. “On our advice, he hastened his journey to his home country,” said the manager.

Uncertainty prevails in the hotel industry on whether to provide a room for a guest or not in the wake of COVID-19 spread, he added.

The travel visas of foreigners got cancelled on March 13, but there are those who had arrived here in the city earlier.

Yet another hotel with 73 rooms had over 60% occupancy till Saturday. On Sunday, only 10 guests were remaining and two have been quarantined.

“We have given instructions to the guests regarding quarantine and they are following it,” said the manager of the hotel. “Ours is primarily a corporate hotel and the month is rather bleak with cancellations of many meetings and rooms,” he added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/hotels-tourists-feel-the-quarantine-challenge/article31077304.ece
333,2020/03/16,Dumping of sewage: local bodies to be held responsible,"Local bodies will be held responsible for the dumping of sewage into rivers, according to the National Green Tribunal (NGT).

“Effective governance is the need of the hour. If pollution does not stop, the industry has to be stopped. If sewage dumping does not stop, local bodies have to be made accountable and the heads of local bodies are to be prosecuted,” said an order issued by the Bench headed by NGT chief Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel in December last.

The tribunal observed that sewage is also being directly dumped in rivers, contributing to river water pollution. “We direct the Pollution Control Boards of the various States as well as the Central Pollution Control Board and various governments to place before us the data and material with respect to various rivers in the States concerned, and what steps they are taking to curb the pollution in such rivers and management as to industrial effluents, sewage, garbage, waste and air pollution, including the water management,” it said.

It is essential to ensure that the domestic and industrial effluents are not allowed to be discharged into the water courses without adequate treatment as such discharges would render the water unsuitable as source of drinking water as well as for supporting marine life and for use in irrigation. Pollution of rivers and streams also caused increasing damage to the country’s economy, said the order.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/dumping-of-sewage-local-bodies-to-be-held-responsible/article31077300.ece
334,2020/03/16,New panel to prepare Periyar rejuvenation plan,"SLMC proposes joint committee comprising representatives of all local bodies located along the river

The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on solid waste management appointed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has proposed a joint committee comprising representatives of all local bodies located along the Periyar river as part of preparing a major rejuvenation plan to save the waterbody.

A meeting of representatives of the local bodies will be convened after the government lifts the restrictions on mass gatherings in view of the COVID-19 threat.

Detailed plan

“The idea is to involve all the stakeholders in the process of working out a detailed action plan for rejuvenating the river. The local bodies will be invited to attend the meeting of the district-level monitoring committee,” said SLMC chairman A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai.

The move comes close on the heels of the directive issued by the NGT to curb rampant pollution of rivers across the country. The SLMC has been given the powers to initiate measures that will ensure the lifeline of the waterbodies in the State.

The proposal to form a joint committee having representation of all local bodies emerged based on the inference that the pollution of the Periyar cannot be confined to the situation on the Eloor-Edayar stretch alone.

PCB findings

The committee has taken into consideration the findings by the State Pollution Control Board that majority of the local bodies had no scientific facility to treat effluents from industries and households located along the river. Studies found that waste from houses and slaughterhouses were released into the water. The lack of sewage treatment plants in local bodies close to the Periyar remains a problem.

The board has suggested a plan to evaluate the ‘load sources’ flowing into the Periyar. These could be COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand, the total measurement of all chemicals in water that can be oxidized) loads and nutrient loads which come from specific sources.

The SLMC is likely to ask the board to identify the sources of pollution in the Periyar after analysing the total load in the river. The local bodies will be asked to come up with specific plans to stop pollution of the river stretches and protect it from pollution and encroachment, it is learnt.

Research carried out by the School of Marine Sciences at the Cochin University of Science and Technology had found that domestic waste from Aluva and Kalamassery regions remains a major pollutant in the upstream stretches of the Periyar.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/6yr0sy/article31077284.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15KIPERIYAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/new-panel-to-prepare-periyar-rejuvenation-plan/article31077285.ece
335,2020/03/16,Land resurvey in Ernakulam continues to be at a standstill,"Exercise was called off in 2012 after boundary disputes

Residents and officials in around 49 villages of Ernakulam district continue to rely on land survey sketches that are over a century old with the land resurvey process in Ernakulam district at a standstill for years.

The process, which began in Ernakulam in 1988 with the Vengoor village in Kunnathunad taluk, is still incomplete.

75 villages completed

Of the 124 villages in the district as per the 2011 census, the resurvey has been completed in 75. The last village in the district for which resurvey records have been implemented is Thekkumbhagam in Kanayannur taluk. The resurvey for the village was conducted in 2010 and a gazette notification formalising the record was issued in 2015, according to senior officials.

The government called off the process in 2012 after disputes cropped up over boundaries while the resurvey was conducted, said R. Ashok Kumar, a surveyor who was till recently general secretary of the Survey Field Staff Association.

“But after the LDF government came to power, a decision was taken in 2018 to resume the resurvey, but nothing came of it,” he said. “The resurvey is currently progressing only in three villages in Idukki and one in Kasaragod, while the others have stopped.”

Shortage of surveyors

Mr. Kumar and other officials at the Directorate of Survey and Land Records pegged the delay in the process to a shortage of surveyors. Of the 1,678 surveyors employed across the State, 103 are posted in Ernakulam.

“Surveyors are currently being assigned other Revenue Department work like boundary disputes, land acquisition for roads and surveying Waqf land, keeping the resurvey on hold,” Mr. Kumar said.

Within the city, surveyors were also caught up with identifying encroachments on poromboke land along canals, said another official.

In the absence of a comprehensive resurvey, survey records from the early 20th century are still being used. The last settlement records were prepared between 1886 and 1911 for the erstwhile princely States of Travancore and Cochin, meticulously documenting details like the type of land and amount owed in tax, the number of areca and jackfruit trees that stood on each landholding, along with the extent of poromboke land and wetland in each village.

Land reforms

These basic tax registers and sketches from over a century ago do not reflect the changes catalysed by the State’s land reforms or changes in land use and ownership over the years.

As per these records, large tracts of land continue to lie with their original owners, though the land may have been parcelled out or would have changed hands several times, the official explained.

“If the land is being acquired and resurvey sketches are available, an individual’s land can be located quickly and precisely. In the old survey sketches, a single survey number could extend to around 25 acres. Locating the boundaries of a piece of land as it exists today, in that vast tract is nearly impossible,” Mr. Kumar said.

Suggestions were made that draftsmen could also take up the duties of surveyors to get extra hands on the field, but this never materialised, Mr. Kumar said. “Surveying a single village and handing the records over to the Revenue Department could take up to eight months and 35 surveyors,” he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/land-resurvey-in-ernakulam-continues-to-be-at-a-standstill/article31076985.ece
336,2020/03/16,Farooq Abullah calls for release of J&K detainees,"‘Shift those outside J&K to the UT’

National Conference president Farooq Abdullah on Sunday appealed to all political parties here to join hands to seek the release of the detained people in J&K and sought immediate shift of all such detainees from outside jails to J&K.

Appeal to all

“I appeal to all political leaders here to unite behind the call to the Union government to bring back all detainees from J&K in prisons outside pending their release,” Dr. Abdullah said.

He was released after over seven months of incarceration on Friday.

He and other local leaders, over 270, were arrested in a major clampdown that coincided with the Centre’s move to revoke J&K’s semi-autonomous status.

He said his family was fortunate as “I was detained at home and my family had access to me”.

“Yesterday when I went to meet my son Omar, also detained under the Public Safety Act, I had to travel a kilometre from my home to be able to see him. For families of most of the detainees meeting their loved ones is not nearly as easy. Their loved ones have been detained in jails spread across a number of States. They get two visits a month for which they have to spend large sums of money they can ill afford travelling to and staying in the vicinity of these prisons,” he said.

Lives at risk

He said at a time when people are being advised not to travel due to the COVID-19 scare, these families are being forced to put their lives at risk to meet their loved ones for a few short but very precious hours.

Dr. Abdullah said he has consciously avoided making any political statements. “While I believe a free and frank exchange of political views is essential so that we can take stock of the momentous changes J&K has seen after August 5, 2019 we are still some way away from an environment where such political discourse will be possible.”",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/2wmhcd/article31077588.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THFAROOQABDULLAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/farooq-abullah-calls-for-release-of-jk-detainees/article31077589.ece
337,2020/03/16,"Industry fights virus with ‘precaution, education, counselling’","Garments, automotive sectors in Gurugram adopt measures to contain spread of virus among workforce

Although schools, colleges and universities in Gurugram have been shut down and corporate companies, such as IT firms, have allowed their employees to work from home in view of the COVID-19 scare, hundreds of garments and automotive units across the city are at a disadvantage as their workforce live in unhygienic conditions and do not have the luxury of staying back at home.

These units are trying to fight the deadly virus with a three-pronged strategy — “precaution, education and counselling”.

CEO of Neetee Apparel LLP Animesh Saxena said a majority of their staff are staying in unhygienic conditions around the industrial area and their biggest fear is that any rumour can lead to a mass exodus as most of the workers are migrants from Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh.

Group talk

Mr. Saxena said in a bid to address this concern, 25 garment exporters came together and formed a WhatsApp group to share the best practices in the industry and the information related to the coronavirus. “This also helped us negotiate the prices to buy sanitisers and masks in bulk for the workers,” said Mr. Saxena, adding that counselling sessions on personal hygiene are being conducted daily.

Mr. Saxena said all the workers are screened for fever before entering the premises, made to wear masks and told to frequently wash their hands. “The factory floors are disinfected in the morning and the supervisors have been asked to inform us about any worker showing flu symptoms. The masks are collected after duty hours and washed every day to be used the next day. It is a huge task and has added to our financial burden,” said Mr. Saxena, who employs around 700 people at his garment manufacturing unit in Udyog Vihar Phase-I.

Manesar Industries Welfare Association vice-president Manmohan Gaind said they have issued an advisory to the members to sensitise employees about the spread of coronavirus. “We have advised the members to keep sanitisers at the reception desk from tomorrow. It was not possible earlier since sanitisers were in short supply,” said Mr. Gaind. He said that employees are allowed leave in case of illness or any ailing family member. “Though our workforce are not well-educated, they are aware because of social and mainstream media. But they have a casual approach towards hygiene,” he said.

Maruti Suzuki India Limited, with its facilities in Gurugram and Manesar, has introduced a host of measures, including regular advisories and bulletins from the Chief Medical Officers on dos and don’ts related to the disease. “Employees across plants, regional offices are being advised to extensively use teleconferencing and videoconferencing facilities. They are requested to declare their travel history if they have been overseas in the last two weeks and impose self-quarantine as per the instructions of the CMO,” said MSIL spokesperson.

338,2020/03/16,"Assam shuts schools, malls, gyms","Two Kerala-returned men in isolation for suspected COVID-19 infection

The Assam government on Sunday shut down all educational institutes, cinema halls, multiplexes, gyms and swimming pools besides suspending school annual exams “with immediate effect” up to March 29 to prevent the possibility of the outbreak of COVID-19.

The shutdown order followed the quarantining of two “symptomatic” men who returned from Kerala and the rescue of a couple from Switzerland, who locals presumed to be infected with the virus.

“There are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Assam so far. But all schools, colleges, cinema halls, gyms, swimming polls will remain closed till March 29 as a precautionary measure. All exams except those of CBSE and SEBA (State Board) have been postponed too,” the State’s Chief Secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna said.

In some districts such as Sivasagar, the authorities have banned all functions, including spiritual gatherings and periodic convergence at namghars, Vaishnavite prayer halls.

Mr. Krishna said 10,605 people have been surveyed so far, while 599 others who came in contact with COVID-19 patients were identified and kept under home surveillance. The samples of five symptomatic cases among them were found to be negative.

Those under home surveillance include a doctor couple in western Assam’s Barpeta who returned from Saudi Arabia a few days ago. Officials in Guwahati also made one person who returned after a tour of Italy, Germany and France on March 1, check into the isolation ward of a government-run hospital. The man was complaining of fever, cough, diarrhoea and body ache since March 6.

A resident of Sootea in northern Assam, suspected of being infected with COVID-19, was on Sunday morning shifted to the Tezpur Medical College and Hospital. The man had complained of respiratory problems and fever after returning from Kerala on Saturday.

He had been admitted at a government-run hospital in Biswanath district east of Tezpur soon after reaching home. “He is under observation. We are not in a position to update his health status now,” a doctor said.

Another Kerala-returned man from Raha in central Assam’s Nagaon was admitted to the Guwahati Medical College and Hospital on suspicion of being infected with the coronavirus. The man had allegedly escaped from the Guwahati railway station, about 100 km west, without any proper health check-up.

Switzerland couple

On Saturday, a couple from Switzerland put western Assam’s Dhubri town on the edge as people suspected them to be infected with the virus.

Locals almost came to blows with the priests of Jogamaya Temple, on the banks of river Brahmaputra, for letting out a room to them in an adjoining ashram.

“We managed to rescue the couple and had them checked by a medical team,” a Dhubri district police officer said.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/assam-shuts-schools-malls-gyms/article31077574.ece
339,2020/03/16,3 held after Class VI boy found hanging in Arunachal school,"He was reported to be missing after a fight among students

The police in Arunachal Pradesh’s Papum Pare district on Sunday arrested three employees of a school after a Class VI student was found dead. Two minors were also detained.

The incident happened at the Vivekananda Kendra Vidyalaya (VKV) in the Sher area near Kimin town on Friday evening.

“The autopsy report said the boy died of asphyxia. A case was registered against the three employees for abetting suicide,” the district’s Superintendent of Police Jimmy Chiram told The Hindu from district headquarters Yupia.

He said three employees of the school were arrested and two boys detained for production in a local court and Juvenile Justice Board respectively. The case against the employees was under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, and the minor boys under Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act (punishment for cruelty to child).

According to the police inquiry report, the boy was missing after a fight among a group of students at the end of the school’s games and sports period. Two students found him dead almost two hours later in the bathroom of the hostel.

Probe demanded

The district’s Child Welfare Committee (CWC) has demanded an impartial probe into the incident. CWC members from Yupia and State capital Itanagar visited the school on Saturday and recorded the statements of the teachers, students and others besides asking the school authorities to install CCTV cameras.

The VKV in Sher was in the news in 2019 after some students of lower classes were allegedly sodomised by their seniors. The same year, the school authorities had also rusticated 60 students of Classes XI and X for vandalising school and hostel property.

Kani Nada Maling, general secretary of the Arunachal Pradesh Women’s Welfare Society, also visited the school. She said most of the students were found to be too scared to report any wrongdoing.

340,2020/03/16,COVID-19: Odisha cancels annual Chaitra Jatra festival,"Tara Tarini Development Board has decided not to allow any gathering or mass feast at the foothill

The famous annual Chaitra Jatra festival scheduled to be held on March 17 at Odisha’s Tara Tarini hill shrine was cancelled as a precautionary measure against COVID-19 infection.

The administration and the Tara Tarini Development Board (TTDB) at a meeting held at Chhatrapur on Sunday decided to abide by the instructions of the government after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic.

According to TTDB, more than 1.5 lakh visitors were to arrive for the festival. Of these, around 50,000 were expected to reach the hill top to offer prayers to the deity, while the rest would have enjoyed the festival at the foothill.

The administration withdrew all public services that were to be provided for the jatra. It has been decided to not allow any congregation at the foothill from March 16. No mass feast will also be allowed. Purishottampur Block Development Officer (BDO) and tehsildar have been instructed to monitor the same.

The free bus service from the foothill to the hill top has been cancelled. The makeshift bus stand and parking facility near the shrine have been withdrawn. The administration has decided to stop the ‘mundan’ facility to dissuade visitors.

“All servitors of the temple have been asked to inform devotees and to persuade them to cancel their trips,” said the TTDB secretary. A medical team will be present at the temple to screen the small number of persons who may arrive.

‘Keep safe distance’

The devotees will be advised to keep a safe distance from among each other and their hands will be sanitised. Persons with cold and cough will not be allowed to enter the temple premises.

TTDB has also decided to make all servitors wear masks. They have been advised to wash their hands regularly and avoid touching the offerings by devotees.

The rituals will continue inside the temple which will be decorated as per plans. All the proposed cultural programmes have been cancelled.

This festival is celebrated at Tara Tarini hill shrine on Tuesdays of the Hindu month of Chaitra. The largest gatherings occur on second and third Tuesdays. March 17 happens to be second Tuesday.

Tara Tarini hill shrine, located at Kumari hill on banks of the Rushikulya river, is a major centre of Shakti worship in Odisha.

343,2020/03/16,Restrictions in bird-flu infected areas to continue,"Poultry farmers will be compensated by March 31, says Minister

Minister for Forests and Animal Husbandry K. Raju has claimed that the bird flu reported from Vengeri and Kodiyathur in Kozhikode district is under control now, but the restrictions imposed within the one-km radius of the infected areas and 10-km radius of the places under surveillance will continue.

He told the media after a review meeting here on Monday that poultry farmers whose birds had been culled as part of preventive measures would be compensated by March 31. The amount would be credited to their bank accounts.

Mr. Raju said that chicken shops within the one-km radius of the infected areas had already been closed and sale and transportation of live birds would be banned there for some more time. However, chicken shops and poultry farms within the surveillance areas could exhaust their stock. But, they cannot bring fresh stock from outside or take their existing stock outside. Sale of processed chicken was also allowed.

“Samples will be collected from these areas every two weeks for another three months and sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal. These places will be declared bird-flu free only after six samples turn negative,” Mr. Raju said.

Culling of pet birds that began on March 8 had been completed now. As many as 6,307 birds had been culled within the surveillance areas, 31,100 eggs and 517 kg of fodder had been destroyed. “Migratory birds are suspected to be the source behind the infection. More studies will have to be conducted to find it out. Their route map will be examined in detail,” Mr. Raju said.

The Minister pointed out that owners of love birds would be compensated as per their current market rate. A Central delegation that visited the infected areas had expressed satisfaction with the control measures, Mr. Raju added.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/restrictions-in-bird-flu-infected-areas-to-continue/article31082985.ece

347,2020/03/16,Preventive steps againstmonkey fever in Kasaragod,"Coordination committees to be formed in hilly areas

Even as Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, has been reported in the neighbouring Wayanad district, five dead monkeys found at Bheemanady in Kanhangad forest range recently have put the district administration and the Forest Department on guard.

According to forest officials, the bodies found on the trees and some on the ground with symptoms of monkey fever raised suspicion. However, it has not yet been ascertained and the samples have been sent for testing after post-mortem examinations, he said.

Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan, who held a meeting on Sunday, decided to form coordination committees at the panchayat-level in the hilly areas as part of the preventive measures. The Minister said that no one has been reported with monkey fever in the district. The meeting decided to prepare an action plan with an emphasis on awareness, prevention and caution at the panchayat-level. Meetings will be held under the aegis of the Grama Panchayat, Animal Husbandry Department and the Forest Department, he said.

If the monkeys are found dead, the authorities have advised people not to go near them. People living in forest areas should be careful not to send pets into the wild. If pets go out into the forests, protective lotions should be applied on their body. The Department of Animal Husbandry will make such lotions available to farmers, the Minister said.

“Since the virus from dead monkey can spread to a circumference of 100 m people should not go near it and should seek the help of the health authorities to bury it,” Mr. Chandrasekaran advised.

The check-post will have a medical team and health workers round-the-clock.

“Though Virudhunagar district does not share a territorial border with Kerala, Rajapalayam being a big town, we have planned to spray disinfectant on vehicles. Passengers would be screened by medical teams as a precautionary measure,” said Virudhunagar Collector R. Kannan.

All muffosil and town buses would be disinfected after every single trip. A big team of sanitary workers from town panchayats, municipalities and rural areas have been kept ready to take up fumigation, he added.

Isolation wards

The district administration has already geared up to create isolation wards in all the 10 Government hospitals across district. “At least 100 persons could be kept in isolation in the district,” he added.

The Collector, who chaired a meeting with health officials in the evening, said that the Block Medical Officers have been asked to provide right treatment to people complaining of fever. They should be properly screened, he added.

Medical officers and paramedical staff have been advised to take all precautions to avoid bodily contact with patients. They have been asked to wear safety gears like masks and gloves. “The hospitals have adequate stocks of sanitiser, drugs and disinfectant,” Mr. Kannan said.

Medical teams would create awareness on how COVID-19 could spread and the measures to prevent its spreading, he added.

Meanwhile, the first patient with fever has been admitted to the Government hospital at Srivilliputtur. “Since the patient had come from Kerala, she has been kept in isolation and under observation. There is no need for any panic,” the Collector said.

The Collector’s instructions on declaring holidays for schools and colleges would be intimated to all educational institutions. “We have already closed the anganwadis, along with the primary schools, in the district,” he added.

While the hotels in the district have been asked to stop fresh bookings, the Collector said that local health officials should be intimated if any guests are being provided accommodation.

350,2020/03/16,Irked Sirumalai farmers start a new market,"Contractor at Gandhi Market had been demanding more money

Expressing their protest against the contractor at Gandhi Market, a large section of farmers growing various vegetables in Sirumalai, started their own market on the Dindigul-Natham Road on Monday.

The farmers who have been growing vegetables and fruits, including oranges, beans, carrots and brinjals, had stated that they were not given ample space in the Gandhi Market.

Moreover, the contractor's men allegedly demanded more money over and above the rates fixed by the authorities. They charged for the truck and later demanded money for each bag of vegetables.

Some times, they also demanded commission on the sale of the produce.

As there was no response or action from the authorities concerned against the contractor’s men and the market too had not given space for the farmers from Sirumalai, they have started to sell their produce from a land belonging to a person on the Natham Road, near the Sri Lankan refugee camp.

Truck loads of vegetables were brought here from Sirumalai and sold to wholesale merchants from Madurai, Tiruchi, Thanjavur, Kumbakonam and Chennai.

The wholesale merchants and commission agents said that the new arrangement was advantageous to them as they need not enter the city. Moreover, the spacious land here was easy for the trucks to load and unload the goods since the new market was situated on the highway.

The Sirumalai farmers said that there were close to 4,000 farmers depending on agriculture in the region and vegetables and fruits were grown in 2,000 acres of land. The hillock situated at 1,600 metre above sea level is also famous for Sirumalai banana variety, they added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/f3nx9g/article31083916.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA17MARKETDGL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/irked-sirumalai-farmers-start-a-new-market/article31083917.ece
351,2020/03/16,COVID-19: Collectors review precautionary measures,"Tirunelveli Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish on Monday reviewed the precautionary measures taken by the official machinery over the past 10 days to check COVID-19 infection.

Chairing a meeting at the Collectorate, Ms. Shilpa said the district administration took all precautionary measures to check the spread of the virus such as disinfecting public places, hospitals and other areas where people gathered in large numbers. Sanitary workers were deployed at Nanguneri toll plaza and Gangaikondan check-post for disinfecting vehicles especially those coming from other States.

“Since the next 15 days will be crucial in the wake of COVID–19 infection in a few States, including neighbouring Kerala, we should be extremely cautious by taking all possible measures to check infection besides creating awareness among the public in a sustained fashion. We should avoid unnecessary travel and gathering, and wash hands with soap frequently,” the Collector said.

Since demand for masks had increased manifold over the past 10 days, steps had been taken to procure them from women self-help groups as they had been trained in the trade. “The masks to be marketed by SHG women will be of superior quality but available at a cheaper price than those sold in pharmacies.”

The special isolation ward in Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital (TVMCH) would have 10 beds. The testing facilities commissioned in TVMCH for blood samples collected in Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Thoothukudi and Kanniyakumari districts for COVID – 19 would provide results within four hours so that the right line of treatment could be started within the shortest possible time.

The Collector asked the officials to monitor the temporary closure of cinema halls as ordered by the State government since the gathering would provide the right ambience for COVID-19 infection.

While all cinema theatres across the district remained closed from Sunday, the supermarkets transacted business as usual.

Following a holiday declared by the State government, when students of primary classes arrived at some matriculation schools on Monday morning as usual, they were given a set of question papers and asked to submit the ‘assignment’ upon return to school on April 1.

However, anganvadis functioned as usual as the government did not issue any order in connection with its closure.

Meanwhile, a 50-year-old labourer from Adaiyakarunkulam near Ambasamudram, who had fever, cold and cough, was admitted to TVMCH’s isolation ward on Monday afternoon.

Thoothukudi

Thoothukudi Collector Sandeep Nanduri, who chaired a meeting, said people should avoid unnecessary gathering at least for the next 15 days. Petitioners could submit petitions after a fortnight if their demands were not so urgent.

The Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital, which had set up an isolation ward with 15 beds, had increased them to 40 and stocked masks in adequate quantity.

Endorsing the villagers’ plea, Minister for Adi Dravida Welfare V.M. Rajalakshmi wrote a letter in August 2018 to Minister for School Education K.A. Sengottaiyan appealing to him to sanction the primary school since the children were forced to go to Puthupatti or Thaazhaiyooththu.

353,2020/03/16,Left movement contributed the most to Tamil literature: MP,"‘It has been able to sustain its contribution till date, mainly through Semmalar magazine’

Compared to Dravidian and nationalist movements, Left movement might be small in terms of number of elected representatives. But it has contributed the most to Tamil literature, said Madurai Member of Parliament Su. Venkatesan.

Speaking at the golden jubilee celebration of Semmalar, the literary magazine of Communist party of India (Marxist), here on Sunday, he said, “Today, the contribution of Dravidian and nationalist movements towards Tamil literature has shrunk drastically when compared with the 1940s. But, the Left movement has been able to sustain its contribution till date, mainly through Semmalar magazine.”

Former CPI(M) MLA N. Nanmaran said reading Semmalar would make a person love humanity and respect women. It would make that person a better human being. S.A. Perumal, former editor of Semmalar, said the magazine helped a reader in having a better understanding of the lives of farmers and weaker sections of the society. He recalled how the magazine harshly criticised former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s government even during Emergency.

Concurring with this viewpoint, Editor of the magazine, S. Tamilselvan, said that with the country facing some of its darkest days under a repressive government in power, Semmalar provided a platform to question injustices. The magazine trained and nurtured many renowned Tamil writers, he said.

Former MLA K. Balabharathi urged the party cadre to take a pledge to increase the circulation of the magazine.

354,2020/03/16,Madurai farmers wait endlessly for more DPCs,"Agriculture Department urged to take over paddy procurement from Civil Supplies Corporation

Though rapid urbanisation has led to shrinkage of area under cultivation in Madurai district over the years, use of machines and better irrigation and cultivation techniques have resulted in increase in yield per acre.

When system rice intensification (SRI) technique was introduced about 15 years ago, it received a lukewarm response from Madurai farmers who were hesitant to switch over from their conventional methods of growing paddy. However, labour shortage and dwindling water sources forced them to adopt it. Now, a vast majority of farmers are accustomed to it.

Farmers have also become dependant on machines for tilling and harvesting instead of relying on the scarce and expensive manpower. Now the new generation farmers, wielding smart phones, have started using UzhavanApp launched by the Agriculture Department. Now they have information on weather, water management, right kind of fertilizers etc., at their fingertips.

One such tech-savvy farmer, S.R. Ramiah, 42, from Poosaripatti near Chittampatti on the Madurai-Melur highway says that during last season, when rain was forecast on the App, he advanced his paddy harvesting schedule by two days and saved the entire crop. But others in his village did not heed to his advice and lost their crop, he says.

But the farmers say there must be more direct purchase centres (DPC) for paddy in Madurai district. “What is the use of technology if we do not get a better price for our produce. The government and officials are more favourable to merchants than farmers, as our persistent demand for opening more DPCs in all the 13 blocks of Madurai district is not met,” Mr. Ramiah says.

G. Palanisami, a farmer from Palamedu in Alanganallur block, says, “Ahead of every harvest season, we put this demand with the Collector at the grievance redressal meetings. In the absence of DPCs, we are forced to sell our paddy to merchants who wait for distress sale.” Though this happens every season, officials find some excuse or other and never open more DPCs and come to our rescue,” he says

A section of farmers say Agriculture Department does a good job of disseminating every information, however small, through awareness camps and workshops. So the government should hand over paddy procurement to this department instead of the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation.

K.Vijayan of Thirumalnatham near Sholavandan in Vadipatti block says, “Only the agriculture officials know the paddy acreage in their respective areas and they are the right persons to suggest on the exact number of DPCs to be opened and not the TNCSC officials.”

However, former Additional Director of Agriculture S. Kanagaraj says opening more DPCs will mean more expenditure on infrastructure and manpower to the government.

If paddy procurement is to be handed over to the Agriculture department as per the wish of farmers, the TNCSC can just take care of storage in their open yards at Kappalur and Austinpatti and other locations, including the godowns of Agriculture Marketing Committee in the 13 blocks.

In collusion

Farmers say ruling party functionaries are against opening more DPCs as they are in collusion with paddy merchants and rice mill owners. Anthony Pitchai of Kannanendal says DPCs did not start functioning in many villages even after harvest was over and farmers had to keep paddy in the open. Only after forceful representation from farmers’ associations and intervention of the Collector, officials relented and opened the DPCs after three days.

According to a TNCSC official, 33,000 tonnes of paddy were procured this season and ₹25.06 crore will be credited to the farmers’ bank accounts. Two open yards are coming up at Tiruvadavur and Idayapatti with a capacity to store 10,000 tonnes.

However, if the yield from the more than a lakh hectares of both single and double crops are taken into account, it will reveal that only 30% of it has been procured by the government and the rest was dealt by paddy merchants.

Rice mill owners in Keerathurai have done a good business this season thanks to a good monsoon. And the farmers still nurse a hope that more DPCs will be opened, at least from the next season.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/kozo2s/article31079672.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16MATNCSC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/madurai-farmers-wait-endlessly-for-more-dpcs/article31079673.ece
355,2020/03/16,Kateel urges Ministry to bring Mangaluru Rly Area under SWR,"Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel on Thursday urged the Railway Ministry to either form a separate Mangaluru Railway Division or bring the Mangaluru Railway Area under South Western Railway (SWR) for the overall development of coastal Karnataka region.

Participating in a discussion on the demands for grants for Railway Ministry in Lok Sabha, Mr. Kateel said though train services to Mangaluru started in 1907, coastal region did not witness much progress in terms of facilities and infrastructure being under the Southern Railway (SR). As such, Mangaluru Railway Area, administered by three zones, SR, South Western Railway (SWR) and Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. (KRCL) should be brought under one administration, he said.

“We have identified Mangaluru Junction Railway Station to set up Divisional Headquarters office,” the MP said adding enough land was available in the location. If necessary, State government’s financial support may be sought to set up the division, he said.

World class station

Stating that the century-old Mangaluru Central Station was in dire need of a revamp, the MP urged the Ministry to completely overhaul the station complex.

Meanwhile, the Railways should expedite construction of two new platforms, No. 4 and 5 at Central as the present work pace was very slow. New platforms would enhance train handling capacity at Central.

Besides, the Railways should undertake doubling and electrification of Mangaluru-Bengaluru line, he said.

Mr. Kateel urged the Ministry to introduce a new train between Mangaluru and Bidar via Hassan, Chitradurga, Ballari and Mantralaya Road to offer connectivity with North Karnataka for development of tourism, education and pilgrimage. A direct service from Mangaluru to Tirupati too was needed, besides another train to Rameswaram via Palakkad, Madurai.

Besides seeking regularisation of Vijayapura-Mangaluru Special Train, Mr. Kateel demanded extending Yeshwantpur-Mangaluru Junction-Yeshwantpur tri-weekly Gomateshwara Express to Mangaluru Central.

At the same time, Mangaluru-Madgaon Intercity Express (22636/22635) should be extended to Mumbai Thane or CSMT, the MP said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/kateel-urges-ministry-to-bring-mangaluru-rly-area-under-swr/article31076934.ece

Abdul Nazeer here on Saturday.

Dissatisfied people look up for early solution to problems and move forward. ADR systems, he said, have become relevant now at it provides effective legal remedy to disputes. Mr. Nazeer said amendments were brought to the Civil Procedure Code in 1999 and Section 89 was introduced. This was introduced with an intention to ease the burden of courts. This section makes it mandatory for the courts to resolve disputes by referring parties to the ADR. While disputes related to trade, easement rights, tenancy, labour matters and matrimonial disputes can be referred to ADR, those related to fraud, disputes related to religious places and election related suits cannot be referred.

Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner and District Magistrate Sindhu B. Rupesh has ordered closure of Kulur old bridge on NH 66 on the outskirts of the city for vehicular traffic with effect from Monday to facilitate its repair work as sought by the National Highways Authority of India.

Consequently, the new bridge that presently carries one-way traffic — vehicles from Mangaluru towards Udupi — would be made to carry vehicles from both directions. However, very heavy vehicles, including containers, bullet tankers, cranes, trailer trucks, from Udupi towards Mangaluru are prohibited from plying on the new bridge and only light motor vehicles, regular passenger buses and goods vehicles up to two-axles (six-wheels) would be allowed, she said.

NHAI had sought the District Magistrate’s permission to close the bridge for vehicular traffic as it has become dilapidated. The bridge has to be closed till it is restored, NHAI said and informed the DC that it has hired J.S. Arad Construction Pvt. Ltd. for repairs.

Diversion

Ms. Rupesh said very heavy vehicles from Udupi towards Bengaluru may move via Padubidri and Karkala while those bound to Mangaluru may ply via Mulki/Haleyangadi-Kinnigol i-Bajpe-Surathkal.

She also directed NHAI to erect road median/cones on the new bridge and direction boards at Mulki, Moodbidri, Haleyangadi, Panambur etc., for the information of drivers. NHAI should also complete the ongoing road relaying work near KIOCL junction and provide sufficient illumination at the junction as well as on the new bridge, she said.

NHAI Project Director Shishu Mohan told The Hindu the repair and strengthening work should not take more than 15-20 days. Its pillars are strong enough, he said adding the repair work involves replacement of expansion joints and bearings between the pillars and girders and such other minor works.

In the meanwhile, the Nisargadhama administration would focus on improving the all-round hygiene at the facilities, including the biological park, he said. Dr. Bhandary said the process of disinfecting the pathway leading to the animal enclosure has been initiated with reports of avian flu too making rounds. The staff have been taking special care to ensure aviaries were kept clean and disinfectants sprayed to prevent flu outbreak. He said water feeder for birds was being cleaned regularly, while park veterinarians were taking extra care in treating any rescued birds outside the park.

Similarly, contractors supplying meat to animals, particularly chicken, were directed to bring live birds to the park so that the healthy skinned-out birds would be fed to animals as against the practice of sourcing skinned-out chicken. Dr. Bhandary said the park cannot risk the safety of animals as it was difficult to ascertain whether the skinned-out chicken was healthy or not.

The cut down in services is as per the direction of KSRTC Central office that wants bus services to be operated on priority.

KSRTC Mangaluru Divisional Controller S.N. Arun said the corporation has cut down 40 trips to Bengaluru. With respect to Kasaragod, it has reduced trips from 40 to 35. There is reduction in services to Mysuru and Dharmasthala also, he added.

Mr. Arun said Mangaluru division operates 350 bus services per day. Following reports of corona virus infection and directives asking people to restrict travel, he said the booking for premium, non-AC sleeper, Rajahamsa and express buses have reduced by nearly 50%.

Among the buses that has seen shortfall in booking includes the two KSRTC Flybus operating from Manipal and Kundapur to Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru.

Mr. Das urged the depositors of the troubled bank that there is no need for them to rush to withdraw their money.

“Yes Bank has enough liquidity to meet any requirement. If there is a requirement, RBI will provide necessary liquidity support to meet its requirements. So that is a comforting factor for the depositors that the RBI will support Yes Bank if liquidity is required,” he added.

362,2020/03/16,WPI inflation eases to 2.26% in Feb,"Wholesale price index (WPI) based inflation softened to 2.26% in February on the back of cheaper food items and vegetables, the government data showed on Monday.

In January, the WPI inflation stood at 3.1% and in the year-ago same period it was at 2.93%, as per the data from the commerce and industry ministry.

The WPI inflation for food articles for February 2020 came in at 7.79% as against 11.51% in the previous month.

The rate of price rise for onion and potato too came down to 162.30% and 60.73%, respectively as against 293.37% and 87.84% in January 2020.

Build up inflation rate in the current financial year so far was 1.92% compared to a build up rate of 2.75% in the year-ago period, it added.

In the fuel and power category, wholesale inflation during the month eased to 3.38% while for non-food articles it slowed to 6.82%.

For eggs, meat and fish category, the inflation went up to 6.88% and for manufactured products it was higher at 0.42%.

WPI inflation for LPG gas jumped to 21.85 per cent during the month as against 1.78% in January.

“The considerable decline in the WPI inflation in February 2020 is in line with our forecast, led primarily by food items, as well as a modest contribution of the correction in prices of crude oil and minerals, which would intensify in the ongoing month,” said Aditi Nayar, economist with ICRA.

363,2020/03/16,Coronavirus will make most global airlines go bankrupt by May: CAPA,"Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation said coordinated government and industry action is now needed “if catastrophe is to be avoided”

As 145 countries have been affected by coronavirus, most airlines in the world will go bankrupt by this May end owing to restrictions put in place to prevent its spread, said the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA), a leading aviation consulting group in a report.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

Coordinated government and industry action was needed “if catastrophe is to be avoided,” it said.

“As the impact of the coronavirus and multiple government travel reactions sweep through our world, many airlines have probably already been driven into technical bankruptcy, or are at least substantially in breach of debt covenants. Cash reserves are running down quickly as fleets are grounded and what flights there are operated much less than half full,” CAPA said.

“Forward bookings are far outweighed by cancellations and each time there is a new government recommendation it is to discourage flying. Demand is drying up in ways that are completely unprecedented. Normality is not yet on the horizon,” it added.

Also read | India's coronavirus testing rates are among the lowest in the world

Commenting on the Indian scenario, Kapil Kaul, CEO & Director, CAPA South Asia, said, “The CAPA report is in global context. Depending on the extent of the spread of Coronavirus in India, the impact on Indian airlines with weaker balance sheet will be severe.”

“More important, raising funds, if required, may be very challenging. Reducing Goods & Services Tax (GST) on Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) may be critically required but this may not be enough to compensate for a sharp demand slump. At this stage we are now not commenting on the impact in India but it is likely that risks will significantly increase,” he said.

As per CAPA, different governments are failing to cooperate with airlines to stay afloat. “At a time, while governments are grappling with the health challenges of coronavirus, it is clear that there is little instinct to act cooperatively. Messages are mixed and frequently quite different. Each nation is adopting the solution that appears best suited to it, right or wrong, without consideration of its neighbours or trading partners,” it said.

When, for example President Trump peremptorily announced the effective cancellation of airline access to most Europeans, he didn’t even advise his European government counterparts in advance, let alone consult with them. Other governments have performed little better, CAPA said.

Vodafone Idea on Monday paid ₹3354 crore to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), being the balance part of the principal amount towards adjusted gross revenue (AGR) liability, according to its self assessment of the dues.

""Thus the company has paid the full principal amount of ₹6,854 crores towards the AGR due,"" the company said in filing to the exchanges.

The company had filed its self-assessment of the AGR liabilities with the DoT on 6 March, 2020, in which AGR liability principal amount of ₹6,854 crores was determined for the period from FY 2006-07 to FY 2018-19.

Stocks dropped 9% in early trading on Monday on Wall Street as huge swaths of the economy come closer to shutting down, from airlines to restaurants. Emergency actions taken by the Federal Reserve late Sunday to prop up the economy and get financial markets running smoothly again may have raised fears even further, some investors said.

Also read: Circuit breakers temper market frenzy

Trading was halted within the first few minutes of trading, and the S&P 500’s losses deepened after trading resumed. The selling was just as aggressive in markets around the world. European stocks and crude oil were both down about 10%. The world’s brightest spot may have been Japan, where the central bank announced more stimulus for the economy, and stocks still lost 2.5%.

The spreading coronavirus is causing businesses around the world to shut their doors, which is draining away revenue. That has economists slashing their expectations for upcoming months, and JPMorgan Chase says the U.S. economy may shrink at a 2% annual rate this quarter and 3% in the April-through-June quarter. To many investors, that meets the definition of a recession, and the question is how long it will last.

Strategists at Goldman Sachs say the S&P 500 could drop as low as 2,000 in the middle of the year, which would be a 41% drop from its record set just a month ago, before rallying back to 3,200 at the end of the year.

American Airlines and United Airlines both announced steep cutbacks to flights over the weekend as customers cancel trips and the U.S. government restricts travel. Other travel companies have also seen steep drops in demand from customers. Restaurants, movie theaters and other businesses that depend on drawing crowds appear to be next.

The Federal Reserve has been trying to do what it can to help the economy, and over the weekend it slashed short-term interest rates back to their record low of nearly zero.

It also said it also will buy at least $500 billion of Treasury securities and $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities to help calm the Treasury market, which is a bedrock for the world’s financial system and influences stock and bond prices around the world. Trading in the market began to get snarled last week, with traders saying they saw disconcertingly large gaps in prices offered by buyers and sellers.

""Despite whipping out the big guns,” the Fed’s action is “falling short of being the decisive backstop for markets,” said Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank in a report. “Markets might have perceived the Fed’s response as panic, feeding into its own fears.”

The yield on the 10-year Treasury slid to 0.73%, a sign that investors are flocking into investments seen as safe.

The Fed action came as major economies expanded travel curbs and closed more public facilities, raising the cost of efforts to contain the outbreak that has infected nearly 170,000 people worldwide. China, where the coronavirus emerged in December, accounts for about half of those, but a dozen other countries have more than 1,000 cases each.

Japan’s central bank similarly expanded asset purchases to inject money into the economy and promised no-interest loans to help companies cope with the crisis.

The Bank of Japan also announced plans to provide up to ¥8 trillion ($75 billion) in no-interest, one-year loans to companies that face cash crunches.

The measures came on top of stimulus from other major authorities, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England last week.

The S&P 500 fell 9.6%, as of 10 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2,371 points, or 10.2%, to 20,814, and the Nasdaq was down 9.3%.

Volatility appears to be the new normal following a dizzying week in which the Dow twice fell by more than 2,000 points and also record its biggest point gain ever - 1,985 points on Friday. Last week’s drops also confirmed the end of the longest-ever bull market on Wall Street, which emerged from the financial crisis and ran for nearly 11 years.

The leaders of the Group of Seven developed democracies will hold a call on Monday. European finance ministers are also discussing ways to help the economy keep going through the disruption as some countries in the region unveil stimulus plans, including guarantees for businesses and even individuals’ salaries.

For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, and those with mild illness recover in about two weeks. But severe illness including pneumonia can occur, especially in the elderly and people with existing health problems, and recovery could take six weeks in such cases.

The Indian rupee plunged 45 paise to 74.20 against U.S. Dollar in early trade on Monday tracking weak opening in domestic equities and sustained foreign fund outflows.

Forex traders said investors are on tenterhooks amid mounting fears of a coronavirus-led economic slowdown, even after the Reserve Bank stepped in to maintain sufficient liquidity in the panick-stricken currency market.

The Rupee opened weak at 74.10 at the interbank forex market and then fell further to 74.20, down 45 paise over its last close. The local unit had settled at 73.75 against the U.S. Dollar on Friday.

Traders said there is a sense of anxiety among investors as they see the global economy is plunging into a deep crisis due to coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that has killed over 6,000 and sickened lakhs of people around the globe.

Meanwhile, the RBI on Friday said it is closely monitoring the current global situation and assured that it will take all steps to keep markets adequately liquid and stable.

“The RBI is closely and continuously monitoring the rapidly evolving global situation and will take all necessary measures to ensure that money, debt and forex markets remain adequately liquid and stable, and continue to function normally,” the central bank said had in a statement.

The RBI earlier also announced measures to infuse liquidity in the foreign exchange market, including the U.S. Dollar swaps worth $2 billion.

Foreign investors remained net sellers in Indian capital markets for the fifth straight day, pulling out more than ₹6,027.58 crore on Friday amid a global sell-off in equities, market data showed. Domestic bourses opened on a negative note on Monday with benchmark indices Sensex trading 1,808.68 points down at 32,294.80 and Nifty fell 521.05 points to 9,434.15.

Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, fell 2.87% to $32.88 per barrel. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, fell by 0.44% to 98.31.

371,2020/03/16,A dam of contention in Africa,"International mediation over GERD is no substitute for regional cooperation

As the July deadline draws closer for the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) on the river Nile to become functional, the dispute between Ethiopia and Egypt, with Sudan caught in between, has escalated into a diplomatic stand-off. Differences were laid bare recently when Ethiopia skipped the latest round of tripartite negotiations with Egypt and Sudan in Washington, being mediated by the U.S. and the World Bank.

The Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Abiy Ahmed, who won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, even said last October that “no force could stop Ethiopia from building a dam,” though he stressed that war was not a solution, echoing similar rhetoric from Cairo. The Arab League earlier this month underscored Egypt’s historical and civilisational links to the river region and opposed any unilateral action by Ethiopia.

The contentious issue around the GERD, Africa’s biggest hydropower project, concerns control of the flow of water in the world’s longest river among the riparian states. Ethiopia, Africa’s second-most populated country and a manufacturing hub, views the mega dam as a symbol of its sovereignty. It began construction on the Blue Nile (a tributary) in 2011 at a cost of $4 billion. The government wants to extend power supply to some 60% of the country’s population and bridge the infrastructure gap. Addis Ababa is hence impatient to fill the gigantic reservoir within six years, and generate 6,000 MW of electricity.

Cairo’s reservations

But the GERD’s storage capacity of 74 billion cubic meters of water has raised hackles in Egypt. Cairo, which relies on the Nile for 90% of its freshwater supply, is apprehensive that a rapid filling of the reservoir in upstream Ethiopia would cause a drastic reduction in supplies. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has insisted on a staggered approach to fill the reservoir, say, between 10 and 21 years, and for the release of a minimum of 40 billion cubic metres annually. No less is the risk Egypt perceives from the diversion of waters to its own High Aswan Dam.

Conversely, Addis Ababa is concerned that a long delay in filling the reservoir would jeopardise returns on its investments and hamper the prospects for overall growth. The GERD is said to have been financed almost entirely from domestic resources, in part due to the resistance mounted by Egypt against global funding for the project. There is in addition the element of national pride in the timely completion of the GERD, as Ethiopia’s recent economic resurgence has revived the old vision of Great Ethiopia. There is also a lot at stake for the government of Mr. Ahmed, who faces a difficult general election this year after the euphoria of the 2018 peace process with Eritrea has largely faded.

History and geopolitics

Cairo’s strong reservations over the GERD are also rooted in history and geopolitics. Under the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement, the two downstream riparian states Egypt and Sudan, respectively, were allocated 55.5 billion cubic metres and 18.5 billion cubic metres of Nile water annually. That settlement reduced Cairo’s control of the waters, compared to the virtual veto over utilisation it was granted under a 1929 treaty.

Ethiopia was outside the purview of the 1959 treaty, as also other upstream states including Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda. But Addis Ababa’s assertion of its rights for an equitable share of the Blue Nile flows from the Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA) signed by some of the 10 Nile Basin Initiative nations (under the initiative, Eritrea participates as an observer).

The establishment of the Nile River Basin Commission mandated by the CFA has not materialised so far. Tthe challenges for the fair utilisation of waters among the riparian states have only been compounded by the pressures of population growth and the effects of global warming. While the parties have sought international mediation from the U.S. and South Africa, that is no substitute for regional cooperation among the parties.

372,2020/03/16,Reforming power to serve people,"Political parties in India pursue power without adequate transparency and accountability

Recent events yet again highlight the need for electoral reforms. The campaign for the Delhi Assembly elections was filled with hate speeches. In Madhya Pradesh, the ruling Congress is battling defections. Last year, in November, in Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis took oath as Chief Minister early morning one day only to be replaced within days by Uddhav Thackeray from the Opposition alliance, which consists of parties that are ideologically mismatched. And before that, in Karnataka, defections from the Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress coalition to the BJP brought the government down.

Capturing power

First we need to understand why this is happening. The answer is simple: the primary goal of political parties is to capture power, and they use all the means at their disposal to obtain power. Power brings money, privileges, and control of the treasury. The total budgeted expenditure of the Central government for 2019-20 is ₹27.86 lakh crore. So, the stakes are high.

Political parties in power are supposed to deliver good governance and serve the public, but usually power becomes an end in itself. The fact that more and more freebies are being provided nowadays clearly shows that public funds are being used by those in power to lure voters, and are not necessarily being used for public service.

Let us look at a few important ways in which the power game is played out in India. In Delhi, hate speeches delivered by a few members of a political party did not help that party come to power. But that is not the issue — in another State, in another election, this tactic may work.

There are two factors that strengthen the growing deterioration in the quality of campaigns. One is the rapidly increasing criminalisation of politics. In 2019, the Lok Sabha had 43% MPs with a criminal record, up from about 23% in 2004. Political parties that give tickets to such candidates are directly responsible for this. The other factor is the widespread use of social media to spread fake news during an election campaign. Most of what is online consists of abuse of rivals and vilification of Opposition parties.

Money also fuels much of what we see today. It was money that was responsible for the defections in Karnataka in 2019, and in Madhya Pradesh recently. The practice of whisking away MLAs to distant resorts to prevent them from being lured away by the Opposition is unique to India. Who is elected or which party wins does not seem to matter any longer. In this game, those with money and the ability to engineer defections can always come to power.

Two factors contribute to this open use of money to topple governments. One is the total lack of transparency in the funding of political parties. Electoral bonds have made it even more difficult to trace the source of funds of political parties. The second is that political parties in power have complete hold over law and order. A corporate scamster is arrested when the money trail is discovered, but no effort is taken to trace the money trail during massive defections.

Good governance needs democracy. But today, hardly any political party in India is internally democratic. They are fully controlled by a small ruling clique. Finances are raised and used in a completely opaque way. The situation is ripe for a small group of enterprising persons to raise funds and capture power and then exercise it without accountability. The use of muscle and money power makes re-elections possible. Parties that try to win power based on a track record of good governance show mixed results.

Consequences

So, we have the root cause of the problem: the goal of political power without adequate transparency and accountability. Before we come to the remedies, we need to understand the consequences of the system we have today. All governments, whether Central or State, are in financial difficulty. More than 25% of the Central Budget is spent on paying interest on money borrowed by the government. Then there is deficit financing. The Central government has made efforts to bring it down, but has not been able to meet its targets. India’s fiscal deficit is among the highest in the developing world, with the IMF estimating it to be 7.5% of the GDP in 2019. State government finances are worse: a substantial amount is spent on salaries and pensions. Then we have the huge problem in the financial sector with banks, non-banking financial companies and ILFS going almost into liquidation. That means that a lot of the public’s money is either gone or is under great risk. Is there a link between the use of election funds and non-performing assets in banks? Other manifestations of these problems are an increasing number of government scams; corruption; growing fear and insecurity; average or poor governance, including public services provided by the government; and rising unemployment. How can we really expect good services for the taxes we pay if 43% of MPs have criminal cases against them?

The way forward

India needs a system that throws up parties and politicians whose primary goal is public service, not power. Mahatma Gandhi suggested a way: “Democracy is an impossible thing until power is shared by all... Even ... a labourer, who makes it possible for you to earn your living, will have his share in self-government.”

That goal of having enlightened politicians who feel answerable to the people is perhaps distant. For now, we need democratic, accountable and transparent political parties. We need to check the use of muscle and money power. Politicians in the ruling party are rarely, if ever, arrested, and old cases against them are even withdrawn. Sometimes no action is taken against those making hate speeches. Only rival politicians are targeted. This shows that the police follows the orders of their political masters. Therefore, police reforms are required. As a quick fix for misuse of money power and engineered defections, a forensic audit by an independent agency should be mandatory when MLAs defect to other parties. As the famous Watergate dictum goes, we need to “follow the money”. That alone can restore public confidence in democracy.

Above all, we need political party reforms that make parties transparent, accountable and democratic. But we are in a logjam: those who can reform the system do not want to. Voters are no doubt getting educated rapidly, but they are not in a position to bring about inner change in the electoral and political system merely through voting. Some kind of citizen action to raise awareness may be required. Otherwise things will have to get worse before they get better.

373,2020/03/16,Kanshiram’s legacy of Dalit empowerment left adrift,"In the absence of any credible sourcing of talent within the BSP, other regional units could step in and fill the vacuum

In republican India’s history, there is no politician who can match Kanshiram’s life story. No one else could have carved a niche for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and the Minorities as much as he did. He came on the Indian political scene without a resumé popping with credentials of legacy, inheritance, wealth, title, surname or party. Irrespective of all these barriers, he sculpted a solid, unremitting, electrifying Bahujan movement in India.

He hailed from an agriculturist Chamar family, but being a Sikh had no impact on caste exclusions of Dalits in the region. Kanshiram, born on March 15, 1934, was aware of this, yet not to the extent of grasping the nuances of such discrimination. He had naively thought of Brahmins as being a poor and backward community due to their low status in Jaat-dominant Punjab.

Also read | Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram — so alike, yet so different

In his later life, there was one incident in his diverse working stints that had an impact on him. In 1957, he settled for a job as a research assistant in the Ministry of Defence’s Explosives Research and Development Laboratory (also called the High Energy Materials Research Laboratory), in Pune. A colleague, a class IV employee, Dinabhana from Rajasthan’s Bhangi caste, had taken it upon himself to protest the administration’s cancellation of holidays for Ambedkar and Buddha Jayanti. As a consequence, he was fired for raising the issue. He chose to fight it in court. Looking at Dinabhana’s unrelenting struggle, Kanshiram turned towards activism to seek social justice and political freedoms.

Much of Kanshiram’s memories are lived through anecdotes and his speeches. A.R. Akela, a foremost scholar of the Bahujan movement, has compiled a series and published them in Hindi.

Political disrupter

It must be noted that Kanshiram did not leave extensive written records or archives barring the classic, The Chamcha Age (An Era of the Stooge). Dedicated to Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, The Chamcha Age was later to be the founding ground of a party that would be a disrupter in India’s casteist political spectrum — the Bahujan Samaj Party. Kanshiram started by wanting to do nothing with the tokenised, genuflecting leadership of Dalit leaders that the Poona Pact between Gandhi and Dr. Ambedkar had produced. Such a leadership was willing to be the secondary elements of the dominant Congress party.

Review of Kanshiram — Leader of the Dalits: A look back at the colourful history of a bahujan leader

Following simmering resentment against the political attitude towards Dalits, Kanshiram gathered middle class government employees who were seeking leadership that had a spine and self-pride. He recruited disgruntled intellectuals and government employees to give wheels to the caravan of the Bahujan movement.

In current times, Kanshiram’s struggle continues to be more popular and his ideas acceptable to second and third generation Dalits who are unwilling to settle for anything less than what they deserve. Educated and with a confident outlook, the young breed of Dalits are now aiming to give life to Ambedkar’s vision — of becoming a part of the ruling class of the country. Through Kanshiram they see a feasible, methodical approach to getting that throne.

Almost every student organisation, social and political outfit subscribes to the legacy of Ambedkar. The Bhim Army Ekta Mission, for instance, wants to be seen as a part of Kanshiram’s Ambedkarite legacy. The Bhim Army’s status is complicated on a national scale. Though its flamboyant leader, Chandrashekhar Azad, has an appeal across caste, religion and regional lines, the organisation’s social base has still to be firmed up. Its apolitical work such as pre-school training, having an atrocity grievance cell and cultural activism needs to be expanded. There needs to be a multi-organisational strategy.

Also read | The Bahujan movement needs to reinvent itself

There are several Bahujan organisations that work towards Dr. Ambedkar’s dream of a non-caste India. But the origins of this can be traced back to the BAMCEF, or the All India Backward (SC, ST, and OBC) and Minority Communities Employees Federation.

Along with his colleagues, Kanshiram began one of the largest unions of government employees. Through BAMCEF, he connected SC, ST, OBCs, and other minorities to fight back against atrocities and discrimination. With a structure in place, he was able to help create a strong sense of accountability towards the community. Thus, the widely popular initiative ‘Pay Back to Society’ was inaugurated in 1973. As a part of BAMCEF there were simultaneous initiatives such as the BAMCEF Datta Grahan, -Bhaichara, -Sahkarita. In 1981, the Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangharsh Samiti (DS-4) with 10 wings (students, women, etc.) was established to experiment with socio-political possibilities. Eventually the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) was formally established in 1984. Kanshiram declared that he wanted the community to become givers rather than receivers. For that to happen it required training and preparation. Cadre camps and various events filled the gap.

Instead of downplaying the importance of caste, Kanshiram opted to strengthen oppressed caste associations which was one way to weaken the structures that sustain caste. Every ‘upper’ caste had an investment in caste, which is why it transferred this into structures that catered to its needs. Kanshiram invested in the cultures of caste and cultural methods of anti-casteism. He understood well that artists and in turn their art were organic intellectuals who were a part of the grass-roots. He sought them out and trained them. It is no accident that the ‘Ambedkar Mela on Wheels’ was among the many first Dalit History Month projects that featured Ambedkar’s photographs, books, pamphlets and posters.

Also read | Mayawati, rebel leaders fight for Kanshi Ram’s legacy

Kanshiram understood that emotional appeal was a far more powerful way to use radical anger that would help tackle the oppressor. Thus, the artwork and paintings depicting atrocities on the communities played a pivotal role in his outreach initiatives. He had grasped early on that while emotions are essential, a strategy was also needed to direct people’s thoughts into producing material.

His deft editorial skills also found expression. The popular The Oppressed Indian and the Bahujan Sanghatak were his organisation’s mouthpieces. There were others that dealt with land reform, nationalisation of industries and a labour welfare regime such as Aarthik Utthan (1980) and Economic Monthly (1981) in addition to the impressive Bahujan Times (1984).

Kanshiram can be said to be the leader who introduced Periyar to villages in north, central, eastern and western India. Like Periyar, there were many unsung heroes who were given space on the canvas of the BSP. They include Nandanar, Iyothee Thass, Nangeli, Birsa Munda, Savitribai Phule and Jhalkaribai.

Growing void

In hindsight, we are yet to find similar investments by his protégés. There are certainly no intellectual research wings, as was the case earlier, which can provide guidance to the movement. There is no media that can converse with the public on a daily basis on Dalit issues; neither is there any trust-building mechanism.

Finally, moving to the present state of the BSP, it appears that the party leadership lacks a committed young cadre that can be trained to take over the reins of the leadership. Kanshiram’s legacy remains alive and kicking in the words of the BSP’s chief Mayawati. But in the absence of any credible sourcing of talent, organisations such as the Bhim Army and many BAMCEF-BSP inspired regional parties could step in and fill the vacuum.

374,2020/03/16,Needless appeal: On U.P. move against removal of ‘name and shame’ posters,"HC rap for violating citizens’ privacy through banners has had no effect on Yogi’s regime

It is regrettable that the Uttar Pradesh government has appealed against the Allahabad High Court order directing the removal of hoardings in Lucknow that displayed details of those who participated in the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act. Further, it has approved an ordinance that provides for recovery of compensation from those suspected of involvement in rioting for any damage to property. In a quick and well-reasoned response, the court curbed the administration’s gross misuse of power. Even though the Supreme Court’s vacation judges were sceptical about the legal basis of the government’s action, they referred it to a larger Bench, observing that crucial questions of law were involved. It is difficult to see what arcane legal question has arisen, considering that the High Court’s order was on the grounds that the erection of the hoardings lacked statutory backing and that it was a gross violation of citizens’ privacy. The Lucknow administration had displayed the photographs, names and addresses of those who, it claimed, owed compensation for the alleged destruction of public property during the protests. There has been no judicial finding that those named were involved in such violence; and there is no law that authorises such public “naming and shaming”. It was quite apparent that the government was humiliating the protesters and exposing them to danger from the CAA’s supporters and the government.

Once the High Court Bench, headed by Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Ramesh Sinha, took suo motu cognisance of the development, the government could not justify its action on any legal ground. All it could do was come up with weak objections to the court acting on its own motion, arguing that those featured in the banners had the capacity to seek legal redress themselves, and also questioning whether the principal seat in Allahabad could take cognisance of developments in Lucknow, which has its own Bench. At a time when the higher judiciary is seen to be passive before a powerful executive, the court’s resolve to act on its own against a case of obvious injustice and violation of fundamental rights is quite commendable. Its approach was rooted in the revivified privacy rights jurisprudence established by a nine-Judge apex court Bench in K.S. Puttaswamy. Applying the tests laid down in that verdict, the top court ruled that there was no necessity for a democratic government to disclose anyone’s identity and particulars without a legitimate purpose. And that choosing a small group among hundreds arrested in connection with the violence during the protests for the public display was a “colourable exercise” of power. That the State government went on appeal shows that the judicial order hardly had any chastening effect on the regime that has been displaying unusual stridency in its crackdown on the anti-CAA protests.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/needless-appeal-the-hindu-editorial-on-up-government-appeal-against-removal-of-name-and-shame-posters/article31076251.ece
375,2020/03/16,Way to go: On Farooq Abdullah’s release,"The Centre must do more to restore normalcy in J&K, and return it to full statehood.

The release of five-time Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Farooq Abdullah on Saturday after seven months in detention is a welcome step that could open fresh political possibilities in the troubled region. The conditions of his release, if any, are not public but it is clear that there were backchannels open between him and the Centre before the release. Taken together with other recent relaxations in J&K that was put under a lockdown last August as the Centre unilaterally ended its special constitutional status, his release could help reopen the public space in the Valley. Coinciding with his release, Prime Minister Modi assured a delegation of the newly formed Apni Party led by former People’s Democratic Party (PDP) leader Altaf Bukhari that he would work towards the restoration of statehood for J&K, which was downgraded to a Union Territory as part of last year’s restructuring. Mr. Modi also said no demographic changes would be forced in J&K. Earlier, mobile telephony was restored fully and mobile Internet partially. However, restrictions on assembly remain largely in place, and hundreds, including two former Chief Ministers, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, still remain in detention. Their staggered release could be the next step towards normalcy.

Mr. Modi’s moves have often been characterised by surprise and subterfuge, including on J&K. There could be justification for such secrecy in statecraft, but new beginnings in the Valley will require more openness as there is a considerable trust deficit between its people and New Delhi. The Centre should not try to orchestrate politics but engage with it as it organically evolves. Hard as it is, the Centre must try and undo the damage it did to mainstream parties such as the National Conference and the PDP. It must allow all opinions to be articulated. Coercive measures must be limited to combating violence. It must shun the baseless notion that communities will surrender political autonomy in return for material prosperity. Above all, it must end its perilous propensity to paint the demands for autonomy and separatism with the same brush. J&K’s instrumental status as a place for demonstrating the strength of the Indian nation in the current government’s imagination is not helpful. There is also an evolving international situation that could complicate the situation. With the long-expected U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan now imminent, Islamist forces in South Asia are feeling triumphant and are using the current communal turmoil in India to paint it as a Hindu theocracy. The Pakistani military establishment will exploit the situation to India’s disadvantage.

The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has asked passengers planning to travel in premier services such as Ambari Dream Class, Airvata Club Class, Fly Bus and other services to bring their own blankets and bedspread as it has decided to temporarily stop providing blankets to the passengers as a precautionary measure to contain spread of COVID -19.

The transport corporation is already reporting poor patronage for AC buses on intra-state and inter-state routes, resulting in losses of ₹ 3.94 crore since March 1. On Monday, the corporation cancelled 585 schedules of services, a majority of them premier services.

An official of the KSRTC said online reservation of tickets has fallen from around 23,000 to around 13,000 per day compared to the previous week. “As per our estimates, the revenue loss will increase further in the coming days. Owing to cancellation of premier services and poor ridership, the corporation has incurred a loss of ₹3.12 crore. In the interest of passengers, we have taken several measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 by fumigation and sanitizing the buses. Now, a decision has been taken not to provide blankets in premier services starting from Wednesday,” the official said.

More BMTC schedules to be cancelled

The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) too has decided to further reduce scheduled. On Saturday, the BMTC had cancelled 10% of its schedules — approximately operation of 500 to 600 buses. Now, the BMTC will cancel around 20% of schedules, which means around 1,200 buses will remain off the roads.

A senior official of the BMTC said, “The number of people travelling in public transport has reduced. We have already cancelled schedules on routes where buses are operated in high frequency.”

Namma Metro ridership hit

Namma Metro ridership too took a plunge, reducing by 50% on Sunday. Shankar A.S., Executive Director, Operations and Maintenance, BMRCL told The Hindu that on Sundays, 3.5 lakh people travel in Namma Metro on both the lines. However, this Sunday, only 1.6 lakh people travelled.

“Even on Monday, the number of people taking the metro came down. However, we have not reduced any schedules. The BMRCL has taken various measures to keep coaches and areas used by the passengers in hygienic condition.”

Owing to closure of malls, theatres and other establishments in the city, the number of people travelling in autorickshaws and taxis too have reduced. Girish, an auto driver, said, “For the last couple of days, it has become very difficult to get passengers. Even after standing for an entire day, auto drivers get one or two passengers. I am hoping that everything will be fine after a week and this situation will not continue.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/lsa7gg/article31084563.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGCORONABUSSTAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/ksrtc-to-stop-providing-blankets-to-passengers-in-ac-buses/article31084564.ece

379,2020/03/16,Water tanker strike leaves Mahadevapura parched,"Operators are protesting against an order that bans drawing of water from borewells in three villages

Several areas in Mahadevapura, including Panathur, Varthur and Bellandur, have been on tenterhooks this simmer with the Bengaluru East Private Water Suppliers’ Association going on an indefinite strike from Monday.

The residents of these areas are largely dependent on water tankers as the areas are still not serviced by the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board.

Though there are many borewells, the rise in temperature and overdrawing has resulted in many of them becoming defunct, as the groundwater levels have plummeted.

“We require at least three loads of water, supplied by tankers, every day. Over the past five days, we have had to manage with just one tanker load. We have even begun to use treated jiwater from septic tanks in the toilets,” said Suresh Kumar, a resident of an apartment complex in Kadubeesanahalli.

Satish Kumar, another resident of Kadubeesanahalli, said, “Though we have three borewells in our apartment complex, we have to bank on tankers to meet our water needs.”

OPERATORS’ DEMANDS

The association announced a strike following an order by the Hoskote Tahsildar that prohibited tankers from drawing water from borewells in three villages -- Koturu, Harohalli and Muthsandra.

“The order is politically motivated and we want it to be withdrawn immediately. We have been drawing water along the Dakshina Pinakini River for more than 10 years now. The check dams along the course of the river ensure that it does not go dry,” said R.V.N. Babu, association president.

The other demands of the association included easing of traffic regulations for tankers. “Traffic police restrict the movement of water tankers between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. This has affected our business and we want them to modify it.”

With no signs of the association withdrawing the strike, many households and apartment complexes have taken steps to conserve water and minimise wastage. Apart from rationing, residents are also minimising their consumption, even for basic necessities.

Neelam Jain, a resident of an apartment in Bellandur, said, “Water is supplied from 5 a.m. to 11 a.m., and 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. only. Even with such measures, we are not sure how long we can sustain on the water we have stocked.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/mx1f5c/article31088256.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGTANKERSTRIKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/water-tanker-strike-leaves-mahadevapura-parched/article31083723.ece
380,2020/03/16,COVID-19 | Police take steps to ensure hygiene at stations,"Alarm bell is sounded every two hours to remind personnel to wash their hands

The police, like employees in most essential services, do not have the option of working from home. And police stations cannot close their doors to the public.

In an effort to help reduce the spread of the virus causing COVID-19, wash basins and hand sanitisers have been put in place across all police stations. Several stations across the south division have also introduced a bell system, where every two hours, an alarm will be sounded to remind the staff to wash their hands.

The wash basin and buckets have been kept at the entrance of the station and sentries have been instructed to advise visitors to wash their hands before entering the station. All stations have been provided with masks to be worn by the staff while on duty. The station in charge have also been instructed to disinfect the visitors’ area and ensure cleanliness in and around the station.

These measures were introduced on Saturday after Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao instructed officers to take steps in their jurisdictions. “Staff of every police station have been sensitised on hygiene and have been provided with sanitisers and masks,” said Srinath Mahadev Joshi, DCP (south-east).

“Police personnel are the first responders to any given situation. They come in contact with people from all walks of life and they need to be fit and healthy to tackle the situation effectively.”

Earlier, in the face of pressure from some members of the public, Mr. Rao had reiterated that special drive by the traffic police would not be called off. However, the police will take extra precautionary measures. “Patrolling staff of Hoysala and Cheetah have also been provided with masks and sanitisers. They have been instructed to maintain cleanliness and follow hygienic practices through the day,” Rohini Katoch Sepat, DCP, South Division, said.

She added that teams would continue to conduct regular checks with medial shops to ensure that essential materials such as masks and sanitisers have not been hoarded and that they were being sold at MRP.

The police have also printed pamphlets as part of an awareness initiative and have asked eateries and shops and commercial establishments to display them for the benefit of customers.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/102s06/article31077609.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGPOLICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-police-take-steps-to-ensure-hygiene-at-stations/article31077610.ece

Screening will be conducted by staff nurses. An ambulance will be stationed nearby so that those with fever or other symptoms can be shifted to the closest government hospital for preliminary clinical assessment by the duty doctor.

Staff will be given two sets of N95 masks, gloves, sanitisers, soap, and drinking water, the order stated. The department will also conduct awareness programmes at bus depots in Bengaluru.

383,2020/03/16,Tailor booked for cheating 256 newly inducted police personnel of their uniform,"The Sampigehalli police have booked a cheating case against a tailor who allegedly duped as many as 256 newly inducted police personnel by promising them to supply uniforms for their graduation parade.

Gajendra N.R., Inspector in-charge of the police training school at Thanisandra, filed a complaint against the tailor, identified as Ganesh. “In his statement, he said Ganesh had been entrusted to stitch uniforms for the 256 candidates for the parade. He agreed to provide a set of uniform, a pair of shoes, belt, kamarbandh, turban, ankle belt, and straps for the candidates participating in the parade scheduled for March 11,” said a senior police officer. As part of the deal, he charged each candidate ₹3,400 for the set of uniform, and took an advance of ₹2,000 from each.

A few days before the parade, Ganesh supplied the shoes, turban, and straps to only a few of the candidates and then shut shop. The quality of the material was also later found to be sub-standard.

The officials in-charge tried to contact the tailor but he was on the run. “We managed to procure the required uniforms from other sources for the parade,” said a police officer.

384,2020/03/16,Supermarkets to remain open,"Initial drive to close a few of them triggered panic

The government’s week-long closure of malls, theatres, etc. in view of COVID-19 scare has resulted in cases of people hoarding kitchen staples. The city’s civic body and the police shut down many supermarkets on Saturday, triggering panic.

The few retail shops that remained open saw huge crowds on Sunday morning and in some cases, stocks of a few items ran out. It was afternoon before the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike woke up to the situation.

Pravir Bagrodia, a resident of Whitefield, said most of the supermarkets in the area were closed on Saturday and Sunday morning. “A few of them that were open had huge crowds. But BBMP officials came and shut them down as well. This triggered fears that there won’t be shops for the next one week. Many of us were buying large quantities of supplies, more than usual,” he said.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar ordered officials to not shut down supermarkets, following which many of the shops opened. Civic officials had earlier decided to shut down supermarkets as they are air-conditioned and attract large crowds. “But we have observed this created panic and could also lead to artificial shortage of groceries. So I directed officials to open up all supermarkets,” said Mr. Anil Kumar.

Raju S., who runs a retail grocery store at Vidyaranyapura, said his shop saw huge crowds on Saturday and Sunday and he had run out of stock of staples such as rice and a toor. “People who used to buy a kilogram of daal are now buying more than that. Everyone fears the shutdown may extend beyond a week and there will be shortage of supplies. But this has created an artificial scarcity already,” he said.

A similar trend was observed on online grocery portals as well. Closure of supermarkets seems to have driven more customers to online portals, causing a shortage there as well. “For two consecutive days, staples such as rice, toor, urad dal, rava, and jaggery were out of stock on a popular online grocery chain,” said Chaitra R.

Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, chairman, APMC Committee, FKCCI, said that though a few retail stores may have run out of stock owing to hoarding by customers, there was no shortage in the wholesale market as there was enough supplies of all foodgrains, pulses, sugar, and other commodities for at least the next month.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/supermarkets-to-remain-open/article31077520.ece
385,2020/03/16,"Plastic, chemical effluents continue to choke Vrishabhavati","BWSSB authorities say waste, including chemicals, is being surreptitiously dumped into the river at night during weekends

The new Namma Metro line runs along its bank in some parts and on the other side, apartment complexes tower over it as the Vrishabhavati snakes its way through the west of the city with mounds of garbage floating on its dark water.

The story of the Vrishabhavati has been one of deterioration that is spinning out of control, so much so that it is often referred to as Kengeri mori (drain) — a far cry from being a drinking water source a few decades ago. Today, pollutants from industries, raw sewage, plastic waste, and just about any discard that is too inconvenient to be thrown anywhere else finds its way into the Vrishabhavati, the only river that originates in Bengaluru.

According to water conservationist S. Vishwanath, the river is believed to originate near the Bull Temple in Basavanagudi, and gets its name from ‘Vrushabha’ (bull). In the 1930s, Sir M. Visvesvaraya built the Byramangala dam. It flows through Guddadahalli, Bapujinagar, Rajarajeshwarinagar, and Kengeri, among other neighbourhoods, gathering pollutants along the way before it joins the Arkavati at Kudlu.

Though many point to the establishment of the Peenya Industrial Area as the factor that led to polluting the river, Mr. Vishwanath said it had begun with the advent of the Cauvery water supply, which increased sewage load on the river. Industrial effluents got added to domestic sewage after Peenya Industrial Area came into being. “Vrishabhavati and Bellandur lake are on the same plane. Both will be revived only when we put a significant amount of investment in our sewerage network and in our industrial effluent collection and treatment. At the current investment level, it is unlikely that these two will be cleaned up. It could take close to 25 years for them to be revived,” he said.

But he said that globally this has been the position that growing economies tend to spoil their water and it is only after you reach a certain stage of development that you have the money to invest in cleaning it — known as the ‘Kuznets curve’.

Unchecked dumping

Plastic and waste segregation units appear to be one of the newer threats to the river. At many points, mounds of plastic waste can be found washed ashore the riverbank, one of them is close to the Kumbalgodu police station.

Near Kambipura, waste segregation units, which local residents allege are illegal, continue to dump plastic and burn metals and plastic. “In some parts, these units have closed in on the boundary of the river by dumping mud,” said residents.

Residents alleged that waste segregation units multiplied recently. “Initially, there was only one unit which the authorities shut down after we took it up with them. Now, there are multiple units along the bank,” said a resident.

In recent times, there have been multiple instances of trucks surreptitiously dumping waste, including chemical waste, into the river — a fact that even the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) acknowledges. “There is concern over some industries dumping chemical effluents into our manholes at night during the weekends, though our lines are only meant to manage sewage. There is a Supreme Court order that bigger industries need to have their own ETPs (effluent treatment plants), but many are not following it,” Tushar Girinath, BWSSB chairman, told The Hindu.

Contamination

In 2016, researchers of Ashoka Trust for the Environment and Ecology confirmed this through their findings from a year-long study involving monthly 24-hour sampling, according to which there was illegal discharge from industries at night. They collected water samples from three villages downstream of Byramangala tank and their analysis revealed contamination, particularly of heavy metals such as nickel, copper, chromium, lead, and manganese, which had seeped into the soil and groundwater and were also found in milk and vegetables.

The researchers pointed out how it was not only the local population at risk, but also those who ultimately consume the food.

STP network

The BWSSB promises that work is on to improve its STP network. An ETP is expected to come up at Peenya from the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), though the capacity has been downscaled.

The BWSSB chairman said Vrishabhavati was expected to get 525 to 540 MLD flow of treated water. “The STP at Mylasandra is of 75 MLD, at Kengeri 60 MLD, at Vrishabhavati the 180-MLD STP is under rehabilitation and we are constructing a new one of 150-MLD capacity — both of which will be completed by July. There are also the two-year-old 20- MLD plant and 40-MLD new plant at Doddabele,” explained Mr. Girinath.

However, with the flow from the 110 villages also joining the Vrishabhavati, there could be a shortfall in treatment. “We are adopting a flow analysis. In Kengeri, 20 MLD excess capacity is ready for operationalising whenever flow picks up,” he said.

But it is the effluents that has the water board worried, as they destroy bacteria, which in turn destroy nutrients, according to Mr. Girinath. “In Kengeri, for instance, we couldn’t operationalise the full 60 MLD as all sorts of things were coming in. Four pumps went bad. Now, we are thinking of more coarse pumps,” he added.

The BWSSB is also contemplating surveillance, mainly at night, along with the police and the KSPCB, to keep a check on the menace.

386,2020/03/16,"Apartment complexes, gated communities get proactive to contain spread of COVID-19","People who have returned from abroad told to isolate themselves

Residents’ welfare associations (RWAs), gated communities, apartment complexes, especially those in Whitefield and other areas in Mahadevapura, have initiated a slew of precautions to protect themselves from COVID-19. Apartments across the city have closed their swimming pools, gyms, club houses, and party halls. Others have cancelled planned community events.

“We asked residents not to use the swimming pool even before the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) advised apartment complexes to close them to contain the spread of COVID-19,” said a resident of an apartment complex at Koramangala.

Sanitation drivers

There has also been a marked increase in cleaning and sanitation drivers, with many ensuring that lift panels, staircase railings, and interiors of the lifts be sanitised every day as these are high-touch surfaces.

Prakash Nair, a resident of an apartment at Kasturinagar, said all the housekeeping and security staff had been directed to wear masks and gloves. “Sanitisers have been provided at the security point where any outsider entering the complex should use it,” he said.

Sadhana Sureka, a resident of Adarsh Palm Retreat Villas at Devarabeesanahalli, said in their community any one who has come back from another country, especially those reeling under the impact of the virus, have been compulsorily asked to self-quarantine for a minimum of 15 days.

“We have many expatriates living here and nobody wants to take any additional risk. We are helping people in their efforts to isolate themselves by delivering whatever they need on their doorsteps,” she said. Ms. Sureka said there was resistance to the idea at the beginning.

The hypermarket near her home was instructed to be closed by the BBMP. “Hence, they have started home/gate delivery every day between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. Fruits are vegetables are available, and meat and fish are not easily available,” she added.

‘Quick to respond’

Srikanth Narasimhan, former general secretary of Bangalore Apartments’ Federation and a resident of Brigade Paramount on Old Madras Road, said apartments were quick to respond to the fear of the spread of COVID-19. “There was a bit of resistance based on negligence at the beginning. However, now, each and everyone of us only wants to to be safe,” he said.

Jagadish Reddy of Varthur Rising said many volunteers from their association were involved in informing and educating the public, especially those in apartments and gated communities, where there is more panic. “We are trying to share only authentic and verified messages. Fake messages are pushing more people to panic,” he said.

Many families are also relying on their local kirana stores. “Supermarket customers have turned to kirana shops as many do not want to order online. Since our items are fast moving, we are benefiting quite a bit,” a kirana store owner on Devasandra main road in K.R. Puram said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nv7c99/article31079952.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13-PRISCILLA-GSO787FOF3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/apartment-complexes-gated-communities-get-proactive-to-contain-spread-of-covid-19/article31077359.ece
387,2020/03/16,Why the Kattur lake near Pulicat is a must-visit for bird-watchers,"We go North this week, to Sirulapooncheri lake on the road to Pulicat, which is filled with storks, cranes, ducks and other waders

“Why do we always go South for this column,” I wondered out loud to my colleague. Resident of Nanganallur, he is well aware of the area’s green relief: the hills of Tirusulam and Perungulathur, the lakes of Kancheepuram, the wetlands of Perumbakkam. But what lies up North?

North Chennai has made a name for itself as the city’s manufacturing hub and sure enough, a bike ride up to and past Ennore meant passing by factories by the dozen.

We ride along the coast at Ennore, to cross the Ennore Creek Flyover Bridge — where the pastoral meets the strangely dystopian. Fishermen on boats strike a pretty pose against the light of the rising sun. But the rays are mellow, for in the near distance, a mushroom cloud of smog rises from the factories, hiding the sky.

At the North Chennai Thermal Power Station, we take a left, zipping past 16-feet lorries and tempo trucks full of people standing inside them like chess pieces in a box.

Once we get on to the main road, past Minjur railway station, it is as if we have entered a different world. The Minjur Pulicat Road is lined by greenery on both sides. To its right flows the Kosasthalaiyar River and to its left, the Arani River, both emerging from Pulicat, where the sea meets the land.

Aside from palm trees, it is also occasionally flanked by freshwater lakes. One of the biggest — the Sirulapooncheri lake — is our destination for today.

While that is how it shows up on Google Maps, locals know this lake better as Kattur lake. We make a pitstop near a Shiva temple, which serves as the entry point to the lake.

Met with clear skies, fresh air and a melange of bird calls, we have almost forgotten the pollution we left behind a mere 20 minutes ago — its only evidence is the layer of dust on our shirts, eyelashes and phone screens.

Paradise for birds

Amid the water lilies that line the lake’s borders, a large white stork with black wingtips sits absolutely still. I creep in closer to get a better look, but it flies away and I regret not coming here with a birdwatcher.

Kattur lake is filled with storks, cranes, ducks and other waders. For brothers Ashok and Muthu from the village, this ecology helps sustain a seasonal career: duck cultivation.

The brothers together rear ducks and sell their meat and eggs in nearby markets —the eggs go for ₹7 apiece. “When the water is good, we let our ducks into this lake during the day, and every evening we herd them out to this enclosure,” says Muthu, pointing to one nearby. Beside it is a white makeshift tent, their home for these nights.

Ashok takes his shirt off and steps inside the waters. As he goes further in, he removes his lungi to tie around his head like a bandana. He is half-wading, and half-swimming in the lake that can go up to two metres deep in the middle, all to survey if they can let their ducks in here. “He is looking for a muddy and shallow area,” explains Muthu, who has chosen to stay on land.

Once it gets hotter and the water dries further, they will start fishing too, and post that, they will need to look for other jobs. “When the water is good, and we can feed our ducks, we do this. The eggs alone sell for ₹10,000 a month. If you count the meat too, we make about a lakh every year,” says Muthu.

As we are talking, an elderly lady calls out to Muthu. She has brought with her a group of grunting pigs, who head straight for the muddy waters. There is a thriving community that depends on the lake: however its existence may be in danger. They are worried that a proposed port expansion in Pulicat may affect this place as well.

Spread over three kilometres, in rainy months the Kattur lake is deep enough to be a major source of water, and recharge the groundwater table, according to Muthu.

Meanwhile, Ashok emerges from the lake, holding in his hand three dead ducks. “I found them floating in the water, these were probably killed by bigger birds like hawks,” he says.

Ashok jumps into the water to help his brother. As they carry the ducks to the enclosure, we leave them to their business and make our way back to the city.

The Chennai Angels (TCA) has made an additional investment of ₹2.5 crore, in a bridge round, in city-based start-up -- The Indus Valley. In 2019, TCA invested ₹1 crore in this startup.

Serial entrepreneur Chandu Nair led the investment round with business leaders in Chennai including C.K.

390,2020/03/16,"COVID-19: Madras Medical College to get testing facility in two days, says Health Minister","The State Health Department along with the police has also set up check posts in 16 districts to screen people travelling from Kerala, the Health Minister said

Madras Medical College (MMC) will soon have a testing facility for coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar on Monday said that after Tiruvarur, testing facilities for COVID-19 have been set up in Tirunelveli as well. Laboratories are also already functioning at the King Institute of Preventive Medicine, Guindy and at the Government Medical College, Theni.

“A testing facility is being set up at MMC and it will be ready in a day or two,” he said after holding a review meeting with officials on Monday.

Noting that the number of cases was increasing at the national level, the Minister said, “From 60, the number has crossed to more than 100 positive cases. As the number of positive patients keeps increasing, there is fear. So, we are further intensifying our measures in the State. The number of cases has also increased in Kerala. We need to be more cautious.”

The sole patient who tested positive for COVID-19 in the State, would be discharged from Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital this evening, he said.

Check posts in 16 districts

In 16 identified districts, the health department along with police personnel have set up check posts at entry points to screen people travelling from Kerala.

“The Kerala government is screening people travelling from Tamil Nadu. Similarly, we are screening people coming from Kerala at the entry points. We are activating all check posts, and our doctors and nurses along with police personnel are conducting checks at these points,” he said.

On behalf of the public health department, the Minister appealed to the public to avoid all non-essential travel to neighbouring States or neighbouring countries for the next 15 days. “This is the biggest help that the public can give us,” he said.

He added: “If you had already planned a trip abroad, please avoiding travelling. Avoid visiting places where there is overcrowding. Persons above the age of 70 and those with immune-compromised conditions should stay at home. Wash hands after returning home from public places.”

The Minister reiterated that the situation was under control and there was no need to panic.

As of now, 1,975 persons are under the direct surveillance of the health department, while 11 persons are under observation in hospitals across the State, he said. “We have taken 88 samples till now. We are waiting for the results of two samples,” he said.

On the scarcity of sanitisers, he said that there was no need to use hand sanitisers and the department has made it clear that washing hands with soaps was adequate. There was no need to wear masks.

If a person arrives from a COVID-19 affected country and has symptoms of cough, fever and difficulty of breathing, he/she is immediately isolated and the family is also quarantined, he said. “It is natural for people coming from an affected country to panic and seek testing. We will test if required. We have now instructed government hospitals to keep such persons under observation and provide counselling. If required, they can be tested,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/jwkn22/article31081088.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16MARTH-MMC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-madras-medical-college-to-get-testing-facility-in-two-days-says-health-minister/article31081089.ece
391,2020/03/16,Four arrested for running fake call centre in Chennai,"The suspects collected money from members of the public on the pretext of investing in insurance schemes

The Bank Fraud Prevention Wing of the Central Crime Branch (CCB) has arrested four suspects, including two women, who were part of a large network that ran fake call centres in the city and would cheat the public by collecting money on the pretext of investing in insurance schemes and later advancing loans.

The modus operandi of the gang was to engage tele-callers, by offering to arrange loans based on insurance documents. For sanctioning the loan, victims were asked to insure their life and pay an annual premium. After collecting the premium, the racketeers did not pay it towards insurance companies but instead, they transferred it into their own accounts. They then collected commissions for the loans from victims and then snapped all ties, said Selvakumar, the designated officer directly monitoring the arrests.

The persons arrested are P. Satishkumar, 30, of Walajapet, P. Prasanna, 29, of Kolathur, E. Preethi, 32, of Virugambakkam. They were the employees of main suspect Munir Hussain, who was running three fake call centres.

The suspects Satishkumar and Prasanna were working in the back office of the call centres to monitor the collection of money from cheating. Preethi was controlling the team leaders in the call centre at Prince Centre in Thousand Lights,where seven persons were arrested last week.

Police said another woman suspect, R. Kalpana, 28, of Thazhambur was arrested as she was wanted in the case of a fake call centre in Sithalapakkam. It is ascertained that Munir Hussain and his brother- in- law Javid, were trying to establish a fake call centre in remote areas other than Chennai through Kalpana.

“Raids at those call centres were closely monitored by the Additional Commissioner of Police C. Easwaramurthy, of CCB, to ensure such fraud is completely prevented. The public are requested to be more cautious while receiving and attending such fake online loan offers,” said a senior police officer.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/4xbnt3/article31080572.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16MARTH--CALLCENTRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/four-arrested-for-running-fake-call-centre-in-chennai/article31080573.ece

394,2020/03/16,State urged to drop Marina-Besant Nagar linking plan,"Residents, fishermen fear loss of houses, cite possible threat to environment

Residents of five fishing hamlets, residents of Besant Nagar and environmental activists on Saturday urged the State government to drop the idea of laying a road connecting the Marina Loop Road with Besant Nagar, as mooted.

‘Project is unviable’

Addressing a press meet, the representatives said it was legally and environmentally unviable, and pointed out that it was the AIADMK government that had dropped the proposal in 2011, after a series of protests by fishermen and residents.

R. Sundaramoorthy of Urur Olcott Kuppam, said that around 75% of the houses in five coastal villages would be lost if the government goes ahead with the project. “We will not have space for landing or drying fish and we will completely lose our livelihood,” he said.

Thiruvanmiyur Kuppam’s Chandrasekhar said the government should choose some other route for the road. Otherwise fishermen from Pulicat to Puducherry will hold a massive protest, he added.

Livelihood concerns

Valarmathi, of the Urur Olcott Kuppam’s Women’s Sangam, said they had not slept in peace for over 15 days now.

“Our lives depend on the sea. We cannot move to places like Kannagi Nagar or Semmenchery,” she said. Krithika Vishwanathan of the Kalakshetra Colony Welfare Association said the plan would only create traffic bottlenecks in places like Besant Nagar.

Yuvan of the Chennai Climate Action Group said that the Adyar estuary and its neighbouring beaches were nesting grounds for olive ridley turtles. “The road will disturb the habitat of birds and aquatic animals, apart from causing pollution and irreparable environmental damage,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/state-urged-to-drop-marina-besant-nagar-linking-plan/article31077554.ece

Divya Shalini’s eyes shine when she’s asked what got her interested in photography. “I used to see so many nice things walking home from school, and used to wish for a camera to capture them,” said the Class VII student of Navabharath Matriculation School in T. Nagar.

Photographs clicked by Ms. Divya and four other students from the school — R. Ezeikel, M. Udhaya Chandar, W. Nikitha and M. Shamvel — were displayed at a photo exhibition organised by Karpi, an initiative facilitating and encouraging children in government schools to pursue varied interests.

Akash Madhi, coordinator, Karpi, said that the photographs were all shot in and around the area where they live — Dharmapuram.

“There is a negative image attached to areas that have slums or housing board flats and we wanted to break this wrong perception. The photos here are so beautiful, vibrant and reflect the lives of the people who live there, as seen by the students,” he said.

Stray cats; a group of workers sharing a laugh over breakfast at a tiffin stall in the locality; a small child peering into a rear-view mirror; and several portraits of friends, family and neighbours were among the photos on display.

In 2017, Karpi was started by volunteers teaching theatre and mime to students. “We want children to be able to learn whatever they want, and based on their requests, we have now been teaching them dance, music and silambam, among other activities,” Mr. Akash said. The group, at present, is working with four schools in Chennai, teaching over 340 students.

396,2020/03/16,"Quality of food, poor upkeep take the sheen off Amma canteens","Staff shortage, fall in patronage unaddressed.

Starting Sunday, civic officials have been asked to carry out surface cleaning at all public buildings to prevent the spread of COVID-19. But several of the 407 canteens remain unclean due to poor maintenance.

The canteens, serving thousands of poor people, do not have adequate manpower to keep its premises clean. For example, even after the Corporation announced mass cleaning of all buildings on Sunday morning, workers failed to visit the canteen in Egmore to disinfect its surfaces.

“We do not have adequate manpower at our Amma canteen. Many workers are no longer on the rolls. There are no new appointments,” said a worker.

According to estimates, the number of workers in many Amma canteens has reduced by more than 40%. The footfall in Amma canteens continues to come down at an alarming rate. The risk of COVID-19 is expected to affect services at the Amma canteens in the coming days.

Former Chennai Corporation Councillor S. Mangala Raj said the number of people visiting the canteen on Santhome High Road had reduced by more than 50%.

Formerly popular

The canteen was the first facility to be inaugurated by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and has remained the most popular one in the city.

“The canteen used to have many beneficiaries. On Sunday, only a few people were found visiting the canteen. There has been a decline in the number of visitors,” he said.

Former Chennai Corporatiom Council Floor Leader V. Sukumar Babu said that the maintenance of Amma canteens had been poor and many of the canteens are dirty.

Canteens that reported sales of ₹8,000 a day during the tenure of Jayalalithaa have been reporting less than ₹2,000 sales now. The quality of food in the canteen has also been poor, as procurement of vegetables has reduced, he said.

“We used to get 5 kg of pumpkin, 10 kg of tomato and 15 kg of other vegetables, a few years ago, from Revenue officials. Now the Health officials, who supply the vegetables, supply us just 500 g of pumpkin and are asking us to use it for two days,” said an employee.

The decline of Amma canteens has been creating a scare among women belonging to self-help groups (SHGs).

The number of visitors to the largest Amma canteen in the city, at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, has also reduced.

The number of beneficiaries exceeded 12,000 a day in the beginning. On Sunday, less than 100 visitors were reported at the canteen.

Many of the 86 canteen workers on the rolls at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital during its launch have left.

Officials are yet to take initiatives to prevent the attrition rate of women staff, boost the morale of workers and improve the quality of food at the canteens.

Kodambakkam resident J. Madan said that the food was unpalatable in the canteen in his area. “We used to have breakfast and dinner at the Amma canteen. We have stopped visiting the canteen now,” he said.

Slum resettlement

The number of visitors to many of the Amma canteens in areas near the banks of the Cooum and the Adyar rivers has also reduced because of resettlement of slums in the area.

The turnover in these canteens is less than the daily wages paid to the workers. According to estimates, the number of beneficiaries has reduced from 3.5 lakh to less than a lakh a day in the canteens.

“We will identify such canteens and explore alternatives to revive them. Welfare measures will continue to reach the poor,” said an official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/v6ovjd/article31078711.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GHRAJIVGANDHIGOVERNMENTHOSPITALAMMACANTEENCLOSEDPUBLICT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/quality-of-food-poor-upkeep-take-the-sheen-off-amma-canteens/article31077509.ece

398,2020/03/16,Security staff hired by agencies have neither valid gun licence nor training,"Rise in ATMs has led to the challenge of finding armed security guards for cash vans

A security officer of a nationalised bank had a shocking account to recall recently upon verifying the licences of armed men from private security agencies to whom the job of cash management work is assigned.

“Most of them either did not have any valid licence or were not registered with the local police. I was shocked to learn that one of them was in possession of a weapon procured from his native village in Bihar, where they used it for opening fire in the air during celebrations. Most of these armed men working with cash management agencies or security agencies are from other States, chiefly Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Their experience in handling weapons is questionable.”

Recent challenges

With the growing number of ATMs , cash management service companies are facing a challenge in meeting the demand for armed security guards who have to be present in cash vans.

R. Suresh, a former deputy general manager with a security agency said, “There is dearth of security personnel to match the growing numbers of ATM filling vans and cash management companies.

“Nowadays, several untrained persons too have been engaged as armed men to accompany cash management vans. It is doubtful whether they can efficiently handle fire arms in the case of an emergency,” he said.

Most banks outsource ATM filling work to cash management agencies. The armed personnel attached to these agencies are most often ex-servicemen or untrained north Indians.

“Even untrained persons from other States easily receive licenses to hold guns from their States and are roaming without registering them,” said sources in the police and among security officers.

Violation of rules

Arms Rules 2016 stipulates that every applicant should be required to complete an arms and ammunition safety training course, which shall include basic arms and ammunition safety practices, including safe handling and carrying procedures.

A senior police officer said, “If any licensee changes his location for a period of more than six months, he should intimate the Police Commissionerate in his city or the district authorities in the area in which he lives. We will check and initiate action against those who violate the rules and law.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/3ysieu/article31077475.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THBANK1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/security-staff-hired-by-agencies-have-neither-valid-gun-licence-nor-training/article31077476.ece
399,2020/03/16,Police plan to rehabilitate first-time juvenile offenders,"Some seek skills training, others want loans to start business

Ramesh* was nabbed by the Tiruvallur police two years ago in connection with a bike theft case. Suresh* was picked up by the police, with two of his friends, in connection with a burglary.

Both were first-time juvenile offenders when they were nabbed. Now, both of them want to turn a new leaf.

To help such first-time juvenile offenders, the Tiruvallur district police, along with the Integrated Rural Community Development Society (IRCDS ), has initiated a rehabilitation programme.

“I used to hang out with the wrong people. Hence, I was picked up in the case. Now I don’t roam with the old gang. It was a great shame for my family. I shudder every time a police vehicle passes through our village. I just want to finish studying Class X and join some diploma course and get a job to help my family,” said Suresh.

Ramesh wants to get a job in the cargo-handling section at the airport and lead a peaceful life. It is to help such youngsters, that the police and the NGO have initiated the programme. A total of 35 first-time offenders were selected for the study.

Most of them were involved in theft cases and some in assault. Of them, 17 are living with their families, four have gone back to the world of crime, one has passed away, five have migrated to other towns and the remaining are not traceable.

Peer pressure

“We wanted to prevent them from getting into the world of crime again. We interacted with them to understand why they committed the crimes and what they would need to lead a proper life. Most of them commit the crime under the influence of drugs or due to peer pressure, and some due to unemployment,” said P. Aravindan, SP, Tiruvallur.

While some juveniles wanted skill training, most of them wanted loans to start a business.

“We will be submitting the study to the district legal services authority,” said P. Stephen, programme manager, IRCDS.

The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams will build a replica of the Tirumala temple in Chennai at an estimated cost of ₹100 crore.

The proposed temple will come up on 11.5 acres of land on the Kalaignar Karunanidhi Salai that connects the East Coast Road and the Old Mamallapuram Road in Sholinganallur, TTD chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy said after meeting Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Sunday.

“The site inspection and preliminary formalities have already been completed. The Chief Minister has agreed in principle to allot the land where we intend to construct a stone temple of the Tirumala replica with ancient architecture,” he added.

“The temple will have a Veda Patashala and facilities for annadanam and all other pujas, sevas and rituals, as being done in Tirumala. The construction of the temple will commence in two months, after the land is handed over to the devasthanams,” said TTD board member J. Sekar.

402,2020/03/16,CM seeks to cultivate a pro-farmer image,"Sections of delta farmers have bestowed the title ‘Custodian of the Cauvery’ on him

The recent sights of Chief Minister and AIADMK co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami entering a field to plant paddy and arriving at an event on a bullock cart in Tiruvarur district appear to give the impression that he is keen on projecting a pro-farmer image.

While giving an interview to a Tamil television channel in mid-January, he drove a tractor on a paddy field in his home district of Salem, and this was to reinforce his image as an agriculturist. Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu had praised him for not forgetting his roots.

In February, he got a mega event on agriculture and agri-marketing organised in Salem and used the occasion to announce that his government will bring in a law to declare the Cauvery delta a protected agricultural zone. In no time, he deputed a delegation of Ministers, officials and other representatives to New Delhi and secured the approval of the Central government.

Shortly thereafter, the Assembly adopted a legislation banning any new hazardous projects in select regions of the delta.

In Tiruvarur, sections of farmers of the Cauvery delta bestowed the title ‘Custodian of the Cauvery’ on the CM at an event where he announced ₹170-crore schemes to be implemented through the Agriculture Department and ₹6,650-crore schemes to be carried out by the Public Works Department (PWD).

“There is no reason to see any political motive behind his actions,” said S. Semmalai, a legislator from Mettur and former Minister. “All along, he has been an agriculturist. He is only reflecting the real picture of his personality, not an imaginary [one],” he said.

P.R. Pandian, president of the Tamil Nadu Federation of All Farmers’ Associations, which also took part in the Tiruvarur event to felicitate the Chief Minister, felt that unlike his predecessors like M.G. Ramachandran, M. Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa, Mr. Palaniswami was a “practising farmer”, and there was nothing wrong in his exhibiting his background. “He is not showing off as a farmer,” Mr. Pandian said.

A senior official said the Chief Minister's knowledge of matters concerning the dairy sector was ‘amazing’.

However, the Chief Minister does have critics among the farming community.

K.V. Ilankeeran, president of the Federation of Farmers’ Organisations in the Delta, was not impressed with Mr. Palaniswami’s attempts to reach out to the community. “If he is genuinely interested in our welfare, he would have gone for a loan waiver for all farmers, regardless of landholding size, as directed by the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court. But his government got the High Court order stayed by the Supreme Court,” he noted.

S. Venkatesan, general secretary of the Federation of Tamil Nadu and Pondy State Private Sugarmill Cane Growers’ Associations, wanted the Chief Minister to ensure that farmers were paid the minimum statutory price for paddy at regulated markets operated by the Commissionerate of Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business, and that sugar mills paid arrears of ₹500 crore to cane farmers. “Symbolic gestures are not enough. He should come out with substantive actions too,” Mr. Venkatesan added.

Though it is too early to determine whether Mr. Palaniswami will be able to reap any political dividend out of his outreach initiative, the steps he has taken in recent weeks have created an impression that he is assiduously seeking to win the support of the agriculturists who, in last three years, have taken part in a number of agitations over many issues.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/r7ts68/article31077393.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THEDAPPADIBULLOCKCART,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/cm-seeks-to-cultivate-a-pro-farmer-image/article31077394.ece

Restaurants are already open at several stations. More contracts were awarded in recent times. “Retailers like A2B, Chai Kings and Madras Coffee House are already functioning at some stations. Besides, we have given contracts to Sree Gupta Bhavan, Aavin, Frankie, Chaiwale and D-Lounge,” an official said.

Jahabar Sadique, co-founder and CEO of Chai Kings, said transit retail spots were a great fit for a business model, where convenience and time were essential. The reason they chose Metro stations, he said, was that it had a great footfall potential and cover all major commercial areas.

Increasing footfall

“We acquire the space based on availability as well as the potential of that particular Metro station. Our fifth Metro station outlet at Thirumangalam will be opened by the end of March. Footfall at Metro station outlets are encouraging and we are seeing an increase, month-on-month. On average, we sell about 1,100-1,200 cups per outlet, every day, apart from snacks and short eats,” he said.

R. Dilkush, managing director and CEO of Dilkush Forex Solutions Pvt Ltd, said their firm had picked up space at Nanganallur, St. Thomas Mount and Anna Nagar stations. They have a co-working space, a forex counter and a cafe at these spaces.

“With more people opting to commute by Metro, I am expecting business to go up in the coming days,” he said. Dilkush has set up a non-alcoholic bar, with a social cause, at the Anna Nagar Metro station.

“We blend syrups and juices which give you a taste of wine and whisky,” said Dilkush.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/yupwqt/article31077388.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THMETRO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/more-metro-stations-to-house-eateries-retail-outlets-soon/article31077389.ece

With thousands continuing to sit in a Shaheen Bagh-style protest at Old Washermenpet for the 31st day, the organisers have said that they will take “necessary precautions” to prevent COVID-19 infection.

Despite Muslim leaders meeting Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam over their demand that the government pass a resolution against CAA, NRC and NPR, in the State Assembly, on Saturday, there has been no solution to the issue.

Federation of Tamil Nadu Islamic and Political Organisation representative Ayub said that they had already made announcements among protesters, advising them to wear masks for protection.

Those who have recently travelled abroad have been directed not to participate in anti-CAA protests.

“We are also advising people who have a cold or flu to return home. We have also asked people to wear a mask as a precautionary measure. We will try to make sanitisers available in the coming days,” he said.

Another organiser said that they were already using disinfectants and were planning to set up medical camps to screen participants.

405,2020/03/16,Coronavirus | Preventive measures on a war footing,"Surface cleaning of over 10,000 buildings, buses and trains under way in the city

The Chennai Corporation on Sunday launched a drive to prevent the spread of COVID-19, focusing on surface cleaning of more than 10,000 buildings and all modes of public transport.

More than 20,000 workers are expected to complete work on surface cleaning of all modes of public transportation shortly. The work will be taken up at frequent intervals.

Corporation workers cleaned more than 2,000 buses and at least 1,000 bus shelters in various parts of the city.

Workers were asked to wash handrails at all public buildings. Bridges and footpaths were also cleaned on Sunday. Hundreds of vehicles have started a campaign to control the spread of the virus, creating awareness in residential areas of the city.

Corporation workers visited temples, churches, mosques and all places of worship to carry out disinfection work. Work on cleaning ATMs and banks was also be completed by Monday. The work has to be carried out three times a day. The civic body is also planning to increase manpower for surface cleaning operations, said officials.

Residents have been requested to call 1913 to report inadequate surface cleaning of public transportation facilities.

Meanwhile, the Southern Railway has been taking several preventive steps by spraying disinfectants in the interiors and exteriors of coaches and cleaning seats, toilets and pantry cars.

A senior official said that maintenance staff had been given clear instructions to undertake regular cleaning of hand rails, door handles and taps. The Railways has also removed curtains in air-conditioned coaches, with bed clothings being checked by supervisors to see that they are properly washed. They have been directed to ensure that bed clothings are supplied to passengers in sealed packings.

To create awareness among commuters, posters in three languages have been pasted on doorways of coaches and liquid soaps have been stocked in toilets.

The Railways will not be issuing woollen blankets to commuters in air-conditioned coaches. The move comes in the wake of a directive from the Railway Board. However, woollen blankets will be supplied if passengers ask for them.

406,2020/03/16,When every line in the book is violated,"The core values of education are injured by the violence that breaks out among citizens during a riot

After a violent riot, teachers of young children have a difficult time deciding what to say in their classes when children ask awkward questions. Some of these questions arise from the news that children have heard or from the scenes they have seen on television. In some cases, they ask about what they have seen with their own eyes. There are also questions reflecting the children’s desire to verify something their parents have told them. It is not difficult to imagine the bewildering array of queries that the recent communal riots in the nation’s capital have triggered in the minds of young people. How a teacher can address them is anyone’s guess. Although cities such as Mumbai and Delhi and many provincial towns of northern India have considerable experience of living through violent riots, little effort has been made to study the response of children to such occurrences and the dilemma that teachers face when classes resume after a riot.

Delhi violence | Full coverage

A violent riot is normally seen as a breakdown of law and order. That it indeed is, implying a weakening of the state’s moral authority and people’s trust in it. Within a few days, the state re-establishes its authority and state functionaries, such as the police and other officers, start to assume that the damage done to their credibility has been restored. In the context of education, however, the impact of a riot goes much deeper. Although schools are the main provider of education, their routine functioning is hardly an adequate measure of the state’s expectation from their role. As an institution of the state, a school — whether privately run or managed directly by the government — enables the young to imbibe the moral principle underlying the state’s authority. It is this moral principle that permits the state to exercise power over the lives of citizens. When a riot breaks out, schools are closed, mainly to protect children from aggression and violence. During the Delhi riots, a private school was set on fire and its property looted. Imagine the horror this school would have faced if children were inside it. When a riot has swept past, schools reopen and the resumption of their routine is usually perceived as the return of normalcy.

The real loss

This perception is erroneous because it does not take into account the school’s real loss in terms of its own authority to serve and perpetuate the state’s morality. Every core value of education is injured by the violence that breaks out among citizens during a riot. It takes years to explain to the young that relations among people and communities are guided by certain values. Even a specific topic such as respect for someone else’s property and publicly owned infrastructure takes a long time to teach in a manner that it would make sense to children. All this effort is wasted when children see with their own eyes that people are killing others and burning shops, houses and buses. In the case of Delhi, the damage done to children’s learning was greater as it included the incredible realisation that the police did nothing and merely watched when the killing and looting started. The magical significance of the phone number 100 is conveyed to children in their primary classes. Why didn’t the police stop the riot, children want to know.

Then and now

No wonder that teachers feel like Sisyphus when teaching resumes after a riot. Sisyphus was a king depicted in Greek mythology. He was condemned to a life of hard labour which involved routinely destroying its own accomplishment. Sisyphus was supposed to push a huge rock uphill, and when he reached the top, the rock rolled back down, forcing him to start all over again. This image captures the frustration a teacher must face after people are killed or wounded in a riot. In early November of 1984, riots broke out following Indira Gandhi’s assassination. Schools remained closed for many days. When they reopened, the government sent a specific instruction to schools, forbidding any discussion of the riots. Teachers faced a dilemma. They knew how deeply many children had been scarred. Not just Sikh children who had seen the brute killing of their own elders, but others too who had witnessed horror or heard about it. They all needed ways to express their disturbed minds and seek some solace from teachers.

Snuffed out by hatred: Here are 21 of the lives lost in the Delhi riots

Now, 36 years later, the city is back at the same juncture. Teachers feel bewildered as they face the task of explaining to the young why a part of Delhi burst into flames. Any explanation would necessarily involve telling children why the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 has proved controversial. A teacher attempting to discuss this subject is likely to get into trouble, both within and outside the school. A school in Bidar, Karnataka, recently faced police action for staging a play on the citizenship law. In the charged atmosphere that preceded the riots and still prevails, no critical thinking is likely to be tolerated. Although the official curriculum now proudly claims to promote critical thinking and foundational learning, these terms provide little scope for responding to what is happening in one’s own neighbourhood or the country. Like everything else in education, these wonderful sounding terms are now used for promoting hollow formal routines.

Delhi violence | Looted, burnt out homes offer little welcome to Shiv Vihar’s riot victims

The Delhi riots coincided with an official visit of the American President, Donald Trump, to India, beginning February 24. His wife, Melania Trump, was scheduled to witness how a government school transacts a so-called ‘happiness’ curriculum. It was terribly ironical that she was attending a ‘happiness’ class in south Delhi while violence and fire raged in the north-eastern part of the city. We can imagine the meaning of the happiness that curriculum designers hope to impart through this innovation. In their design, happiness is another form of cynicism, marking the capacity to stay aloof and unaffected by the fate of fellow human beings.

Sanctity of education

Textbooks, teachers and principals routinely tell children that India’s religious diversity is a matter of pride. What, then, accounts for so much hatred, children must wonder. Someone will have to explain to them why there is such a sharp contradiction between real collective life and what is conveyed to them. Many children know from watching television that Delhi’s present political ethos is full of bitterness and anger. Slogans that ask for shooting down dissent have been openly shouted. In such an ethos, the official message conveyed through post-riot parent-teacher meetings that all is well now cannot reduce cynicism. The personal trauma suffered by hundreds and the bewilderment of others who have witnessed the collapse of social order and police responsibility cannot be healed by words and promises alone. Education must deal with the deeper anxieties of the young in order to retain its own sanctity and credibility. The hatred that found open expression for some days in north-east Delhi has put a question mark on the capacity of the system of education to nurture the core values a democratic order demands.

Violent riots knock down the sanctity of public education and people’s faith in it as a resource for maintaining basic human values. In a post-conflict phase, officers and teachers must decide what they will tell the young and how. To follow the modern idiom and simply ‘move on’ (i.e. put the riots behind) is to invite the usual price that unresolved trauma incurs. Its effects go deeper. The temporary social breakdown that riots signify requires a long-term strategy to restore teachers’ morale and people’s trust in schools. Simply ignoring the damage done to the sanity of young minds is tantamount to letting democracy suffer the loss of intellectual vitality that education alone can provide.

The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation has been in a frozen state mainly on account of tensions between India and Pakistan. Regional integration is a must for its revival (Page 1, “SAARC virtual meet on COVID-19 today”, March 15). Using the coronavirus outbreak as a catalyst, India can once again push for regional cooperation that can lead to better diplomatic relations. As a platform, SAARC needs to integrate the region better.

While it is heartening that the Prime Minister has taken the lead in initiating a virtual conference, equally encouraging is the response he has received from member nations. There has to be a sharing of actions being taken to contain the pandemic. SAARC, as a regional body, has not been functioning very effectively for quite some time, but the health crisis should be used to get things back on track.

The world is fragile

A deadly pathogen, currently marching across national borders and leaving behind a trail of death and panic, has exposed the brittle foundation on which modern civilisation has erected its edifice of progress. The epidemiological Black Swan has exposed the dark belly of globalisation which was hailed as an unmixed blessing for humanity.

The irony is that the first reaction to the pandemic has not been a collaboration among nations but a frenzied shutting down of borders to protect citizens of one’s own country. COVID-19 offers two immediate lessons. One, the anthropocentric vision’s wanton disregard for biodiversity’s known and unknown complexities, especially the tampering with wildlife habitats, has hidden costs. Two, no nation however powerful it may be, has no right to treat epidemics as its internal matter. The source nation has a moral obligation, if not a legal necessity to disclose facts about the outbreak to the World Health Organization, expeditiously (Page 1, “Virus cases rise, more airlifts planned”, March 15).

Smart Chennai

The gaps in urban planning and ineffective enforcement of Smart City planning on the part of Chennai’s CMDA have been exposed on more than one occasion. Even after the devastating floods in 2015, the CMDA has not made amends. It must follow the models used in Ahmedabad and New Delhi. Without engaging the services of professional planners, the mere announcement of projects will not deliver any result (Chennai, “The tough business of building a city”, March 15).

408,2020/03/16,"Eat, work, repeat","Merak serves as a retreat for independent working professionals, who don’t mind paying a little extra for good food

It takes some getting used to the fact that Merak is within JW Marriott hotel. That is because this open-air restaurant is quite different from the rest of the hotel. It has been designed as a co-working space where book events (a discussion on stand-up comedian Papa CJ’s Naked was recently held there) are also conducted. Touted as an ‘urban oasis’, Merak has a unique ambience — the walls are have potted plants, many hanging from the ceiling as well. There is an open bar and soft music (a welcome change from the booming sound that drowns out conversations in most restaurants).

We seat ourselves at a long wooden table. It is a balmy evening, perfect for some refreshing cocktails. We try the Merak gazer, a gin-based cocktail with blue pea flower decoction, Cointreau, Martini Bianco and a splash of ginger ale, and Midnight bloom which has gin, passion fruit, white chocolate syrup, lime, egg white and edible charcoal. They not only taste good — quite a bit of thought has gone into creating them — but also look good because of how they colourful they are and that they are served in fish cocktail glasses.

The menu is quite different from what we imagined. It comprises small plates, which makes sense as you can munch on something while working or while holding a meeting. The Not The Usual Bhel is true to its name, the twist is in the inclusion of Thai herbs, chilli dressing and crispy chicken which adds different flavours: mildly spicy, sweet, sour and crunchy. The Cantonese style lobster with soy, ginger, celery and scallions, is delightful, but we would have liked more of the meat. The keema aur bun maska was served with brioche bread and parmesan, though what made this dish unique was the egg yolk, which made the keema (minced meat) succulent when it was mixed in.

The asparagus, chestnuts and broccoli dish, with a dash of bird’s eye chillies and garlic sauce, was mildly spicy and quite crunchy. The Naga chilly mushrooms wok-tossed in a spicy sauce was not as spicy as we expected it to be, but it did not disappoint. Among the finger foods, the one we enjoyed the most, was the Thai herb cigar rolls served with sweet chilli sauce. We even asked for additional helpings.

For dessert, we chose the zaffran crème brûlée and almond biscotti, which was to use a cliché, melt-in-your-mouth.

Clarifying that there was no move as yet to impose Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) in its totality in Pune district to curb the spread of COVID-19, district authorities said on Monday the police would only investigate those people under Section 144 (1) who flouted the administration’s orders.

Pune Divisional Commissioner Dr. Deepak Mhaisekar said that while the district administration was mulling imposing Section 144 in Pune, there would be no restriction on people’s movements even if this was implemented.

“We have been discussing with police authorities on the necessity of imposing certain parts of Section 144 of the CrPC in the city if the need arises. However, there will be no restriction on movement if these are imposed. Certain restrictions are already in place to check the spread of COVID-19. If needed, further restrictions will be added and action will be taken accordingly,” said Dr. Mhaisekar.

Mr. Ram said the administration had issued an advisory directing all IT companies to permit their employees to work from home.

“As a proactive step, we are enforcing all kinds of social distancing measures. We have already closed schools and colleges, gyms, malls and even museums and have appealed to all IT firms and private companies to allow their employees to work from home wherever possible as these social distancing measures are extremely important at this stage to contain the spread of the virus,” he said.

Dr. Mhaisekar said the Pune Municipal Corporation had formed 125 teams and the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation had constituted another 50 teams to conduct home surveillance on COVID-19 suspects across the twin cities. “Till date, 15,803 homes have been successfully covered and 52,714 people have been surveyed thus far,” he said.

Dr. Mhaisekar said there had been only one positive case in the two cities in the last 24 hours, and the administration had already begun tracking the contacts of the 31-year-old man who tested positive on Sunday. He had a travel history to Abu Dhabi and Tokyo.

Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad have 16 positive patients so far. “Samples of 28 people had been sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, in the past few days, of which 27 had proved to be negative. As of now, we are awaiting reports on 59 suspected cases,” he said, adding that the condition of all 16 patients was stable.

He said from now, passengers coming from Dubai, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. will also be placed under institutional quarantine in addition to those coming from the seven most affected countries showing symptoms of COVID-19.

The launch ceremony was low-key due to the State government restrictions on such mass gatherings in view of the novel coronavirus outbreak, said officials.

The vessel, built in Greece, can carry 200 cars and 1,000 passengers, and is capable of plying even during monsoon.

“It can reach a speed of 14 knots and will complete the 18-km sea journey in 45 minutes to one hour. The road distance between Mumbai and Mandwa is 110 km and can take anything between three and four hours,” an official said.

While the Mumbai Port Trust built the jetty facilities at Ferry Wharf at a cost of ₹31 crore, the Ropax jetty and terminal at Mandwa has been built by the Maharashtra Maritime Board at a cost of ₹135 crore, officials said.

In a message, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said the new service would be a milestone for the State, and announced that a similar facility was planned between Nerul and Belapur in Navi Mumbai, as well as Bhayander and Dombivali, with the latter expected to start in two years after getting the final approval.

413,2020/03/16,Testbook: An online resource for small-town job aspirants,"Testbook prepares students for various examinations; over one crore students have registered with it

There is not much craze for a government job in a city like Mumbai, but in non-metro towns and villages, it is a different story: a Central or State government job brings along with it financial and social security.

Testbook, a Mumbai-based start-up, realised this opportunity and built a platform wherein students can prepare for more than 3,000 tests by various State and Central government agencies.

The platform, which went live in 2014, has more than one crore registered students with over 60 lakh students coming on board in the past one year.

Creating awareness was one of the biggest challenges as students are usually reluctant to move from a brick-and-mortar coaching institute to a completely online platform. “Getting the first one lakh students took us 15 months,” said Ashutosh Kumar, co-founder and chief executive officer, Testbook.

The hard way up

Mr. Kumar knows what the aspirations of students in India’s towns and villages are, having gone to school in Madhubani, Bihar. His own educational journey was chequered: till Class VII, he was among the backbenchers.

Ashutosh Kumar, co-founder and chief executive officer, Testbook

What turned it around for him was the push his grandfather, a professor, gave him: not only did he arrange for home tuitions for a young Mr. Kumar, but he also dangled a carrot before him: if he would study well, he could get into the premier IIT, land himself a good job as well as get a good bride.

“The aspirations of a small-town boy are limited. All he wants is a stable job and a good girl to marry,” said Mr. Kumar. “From Class VIII, I was among the toppers of the class. I used to study so much that my parents thought I had gone mad,” said Mr. Kumar, who left for Kota in 2004 to prepare for the IIT entrance.

He cleared the entrance exam in 2005 but did not get into IIT Mumbai. Undeterred, he appeared for the exam again the next year and got into IIT Mumbai.

On his first day at IIT Mumbai, he met Narendra Agrawal, who was to become his roommate for the next three years, and later a co-founder of Testbook.

“Narendra was the technology guy while I was into teaching. I taught physics for around seven years while he used to build websites and those advertising products where one earns if a user clicks on it,” said Mr. Kumar.

By the time the two friends got into their third year at IIT, the start-up bug had bitten them. After a few failed ventures, they finally decided to do something in the education sector.

“I was already teaching but was not satisfied with the impact. At an institute, you can at best help a few hundred students, but we wanted to have a larger impact,” said Mr. Kumar. He first unveiled a platform for mentoring students but scrapped it due to limited reach.

In mid-2013, he unveiled Testbook. Itwent live in January 2014. From day one, the founders were clear that they wanted only graduates on their platform who were looking for a government job.

“If you are able to help a person get a stable job, you are helping his entire family grow. That was the impact we wanted to create. And in smaller towns and villages, all they want is a government job,” said Mr. Kumar.

Testbook has a lot of test papers on its platform for various exams like banking, insurance, Railways, staff selection, teaching, and constabulary. Apart from the test papers, it has learning modules for each of the exams.

Initially, the platform kept its content free so it could collect user data, which in turn would help with the design of course materials. “We used artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics, and almost all the available tools to know our users better. Only then could we know the strength and weakness of each of them,” said Mr. Kumar.

The venture started with test papers for exams like bank probationary officers and clerks, Life Insurance Corporation, and Institute of Banking Personal Selection.

Online challenge

The turning point for the venture came in 2016, when many government exams went online.

“We realised that the opportunity was huge, especially since most of the smaller towns did not have good teachers,” said Mr. Kumar.

But it also presented a unique challenge.

“Being a completely technology-driven platform, we couldn’t take cash payments from students. And a majority of our target users were such that they would not be comfortable using cards, especially for small transactions,” said Mr. Kumar.

The founders then hit upon then idea of giving out vouchers — like telecom companies’ pre-paid cards — and tied up with cyber cafes, bookstores and coaching institutes to reach out to their potential user base.

According to Mr. Kumar, the idea of vouchers created a huge traction as students could just go to a retail outlet and buy a voucher for as low as ₹100 and come on board Testbook. While a one-month subscription costs ₹100, the six-month and annual subscription costs have been pegged at ₹400 and ₹600, respectively.

Interestingly, more than 75% of the subscriptions on the platform are for the 12-month period that costs as low as ₹50 per month.

Free test papers

The platform has free content and test papers as well that a student can try before deciding if a subscription is worth taking.

“When you go to a mithai store, you want to taste and be assured that it’s fresh before buying, right? Similarly, we need to show our students what will they gain if they join us,” said Mr. Kumar. Around 20% content on their portal is free along with a few test papers for each exam.

More importantly, the huge back-end data analytics of the users help the start-up identify the weaknesses and strengths of each of its registered users.

“Many a time, the selection does not happen due to inefficiencies in the teaching methodology. The tutor is not able to track and guide the student properly. If you are able to solve this inefficiency with technology, improvement takes place,” said Mr. Kumar.

Simply put, based on the results of the students’ mock tests and practice sessions, Testbook is able to identify the weak points and accordingly suggests the subjects or topics in which one needs to work harder.

While the first four years of the venture focused on providing as many test papers as possible for various government exams, the coaching component was unveiled in 2018 in the form of video lectures, courses and modules that have been integrated with the test papers.

In terms of geographical reach, the venture has subscribers predominantly from the northern and eastern States like Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi. It now intends to enhance its reach in the central and southern States and has recently raised around ₹60 crore in funding.

The start-up, which claims a strike rate of nearly 35,000 selections across exams, also wants to go multilingual from the current bilingual mode as it eyes newer geographies.

Incidentally, data analytics has shown that while the all-time favourite exams continue to be the Staff Selection Commission, banking, and Railways, the past few years have seen the popularity of teaching, constabulary, and defence going up.

“Recently, there was an exam conducted by the Railways for recruitment of loco pilots (train drivers). While 1.2 lakh were selected for the final stage, around 60,000 of them had prepared on our platform,” said Mr. Kumar.

“We want it to be the number one platform that comes to mind when anyone wants a job. We want to be on the top of all Central and State government exams and after that, based on the huge data that we have, we can look at the private sector too,” he said.

414,2020/03/16,"COVID 19: Mosque, IT firm sanitised in Navi Mumbai","16 sportpersons quarantined in Panvel

After a Philippines national, who visited a Vashi mosque, and a Thane resident employed with an IT company in Airoli tested positive for COVID-19, both places were sanitised on the orders of the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC).

The mosque and the IT firm at Mindspace, Airoli, have also been asked to give a list of people who came in contact with both.

“The Philippines national had come on a 40-day tourist visa and stayed at Noor mosque from March 4 to 12. Later, he met a private doctor who referred him to Kasturba Hospital. He tested positive and has been isolated there,” Balasaheb Sonawane, chief medical officer, NMMC, said.

According to him, mosque officials said the man was unwell since the day he arrived and hence stayed in his room, not coming out even for prayers. “His six companions visited a mosque at Saat Rasta in Mumbai and we have informed health officers there. We have asked the mosque authorities to get us a list of people who would have come in contact with him during his stay,” Mr. Sonawane said.

Meanwhile, a Thane resident who worked at Mindspace in Airoli tested positive on Saturday and has been isolated. “The IT office was sanitised and we have also asked them to allow the employees to work from home for a few days. We have asked for a list of people who were in touch with him at office,” Mr. Sonawane said.

The NMMC has also launched a coronavirus epidemic control cell and asked everyone to inform them of any foreign-returned person in the city. “It is mandatory to report to us when one comes back from a travel abroad. The 14-day home quarantine is also compulsory,” Mr. Sonawane said.

All public gardens have been shut and NMMT buses were sanitised. The NMMC also organised a meeting with private doctors to control the situation.

In isolation at Kharghar

Meanwhile, Panvel City Municipal Corporation Commissioner Ganesh Deshmukh said every citizen who has returned from a foreign country is being screened at the airport, but as a double check, they are also being screened at the Panvel district hospital and quarantined if needed. “We have set up an isolation facility at Gram Vikas Bhavan in Kharghar,” he said.

Around 16 sportspersons from Panvel, who returned from Dubai in the wee hours of Sunday, were brought in a bus arranged by the PCMC and screened a second time. Even as their reports were negative, for the larger interest of the public, they were quarantined at Gram Vikas Bhavan. “More sportspersons are expected and they too will be quarantined,” Mr. Deshmukh said.

After the sportspersons were quarantined, the staff of Gram Vikas Bhavan were said to have fled out of fear of the virus. “It is wrong to have fled. On Monday, I will look into it and if the staff is found to be guilty, action will be taken,” Mr. Deshmukh said.

On Saturday, a Kamothe resident tested positive after being quarantined at his home for 12 days. “The husband-wife duo had returned from Dubai and were placed under quarantine at their home. The couple stayed in different rooms, as a result of which, despite the husband getting infected, the wife tested negative for the virus,” Mr. Deshmukh said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mosque-it-firm-sanitised-in-navi-mumbai/article31077787.ece
415,2020/03/16,"COVID-19 | As Maharashtra shuts malls to curb coronavirus spread, citizens resort to panic buying","E-tailers run out of stock; people worried about hiked prices at kiranas

Supermarkets in the the city and two other metros — Delhi and Bengaluru — were witness to dense crowds over the weekend as several people resorted to panic buying in view of the rising cases of COVID-19.

Citizens were seen rushing to stock up on essential commodities as the State government shut down malls to prevent the spread of the infection. According to retailers, the blanket ban on opening of malls, without making any alternate provisions to ensure the daily supply of these goods has added to the public’s fears.

“There has to be a uniform order from one central authority. With multiple agencies issuing orders and even local police and vigilantes clamping bans, people are confused and resorting to panic buying. This has to stop,” Kumar Rajgopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India (RAI), said. He said there was overcrowding at several supermarkets on account of panic buying.

Mr. Rajgopalan pointed out that this was the exact situation that had to be prevented. “At this time, overcrowding is dangerous. The government must ensure outlets dealing with daily use essential items need to remain open as usual and enough stock should be maintained to meet the demand,” he said, adding that all manufacturers of daily use items must maintain the supply chain.

Another factor that has contributed to the panic buying is the anxiety in people’s mind that if supermarkets remain closed, then the local kiranas will take advantage of the situation and hike their prices.

However, not all retail outlets will remain closed. Independent stores and those with separate access will be allowed to run while stores running inside malls will be shut. For example, the Big Bazaar outlet in Kandivali (East) remained open even as Growel’s 101 mall, to which it is attached, was shut as per government order. Large crowds were seen at D’Mart’s outlets in the western suburbs.

According to Big Bazaar executives, the panic buying is confined to the three affected metros and certain items only. “We have seen extra shopping in cities where there is more panic and that too is limited to some categories. Mostly staples like sugar, milk, ready to eat food or noodles, and even sanitizers are high in demand,” an official said.

However, company officials have ruled out any possibly of a run on the supermarkets. “There is no need to panic. There are enough supplies. The excess buying is confined to some pockets and the entire nation is not affected,” an executive said. “Panic buying is happening but not everywhere. Operations in the rest of the country are running smoothly,” he said.

In a tweet to the PM, the RAI said, “ Some local authorities, especially in Maharashtra and Karnataka have started acting suomoto to shut shops, restricting citizens’ access to items of daily needs. (sic)”

“@PMOindia urgent intervention is required to ensure supermarkets and kiranas be allowed to serve daily needs of consumers like food and groceries during these trying times. We need to assure daily needs supply to citizens. @CMOMaharashtra @cmo @Govt_Karnataka, (sic)” it tweeted.

Meanwhile, household grocery items like rice, wholewheat/multigrain flour, tertrapack milk, mosquito repellent refills and even bathing soaps have run out across major e-retail stores in the city. Goregaon resident Falguni Shah was among those who reluctantly stepped out of their houses to visit a supermarket.

“I visited a supermarket in a popular mall in Malad on Saturday evening. It was clear that people there were were serious about stocking up. It seemed to be an attempt to irresponsibly hoard. There was not one soul in the under 10 items queue. I would have preferred to refrain from stepping out into a crowded store, but with my grocery requirements being unavailable online, there was no option left,” Ms. Shah, whose employer has in fact allowed staff to work from home, said.

Though major e-retailers said that only packets of a certain weight were available, the supermarkets were better stocked. “They however did not have hand sanitizers,” Ms. Shah said.

416,2020/03/16,"Police cancel all domestic, foreign tours till month-end","All city tours to places like Gateway of India as well as the Mumbai Darshan tour have been put on hold till March 31 to curb the spread of COVID-19.

The Mumbai Police, in a notification on Sunday, asked tour operators not to take any groups to foreign or domestic destinations till March 31.

Defying the order will attract action under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code for disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant, the police said.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) (operations) Pranay Ashok said the measures were taken to prevent further spread of COVID-19. The order prohibits any kind of tour involving groups of people travelling together to a foreign or domestic destination, organised by private operators. “If found [violating the order], the police will take action against such groups,” he said.

There is always a likelihood of spread of virus through business or holiday tour groups travelling together, he said.

After confusing messages started doing the rounds, the police clarified the order aimed at preventing danger to life and safety and should not be confused with regular orders issued under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

“However, should anyone, including private tour operators, need to travel under exceptional circumstances, they may do so after seeking permission from the office of the Commissioner of Police,” DCP Ashok said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/police-cancel-all-domestic-foreign-tours-till-month-end/article31077760.ece
417,2020/03/16,Eicher rolls out vehicles equipped to follow new emission guidelines,"With the April 1 deadline for implementation of the new BS-VI emission norms just weeks away, Volvo Group and Eicher Motors’ joint-venture VE Commercial Vehicles (VECV) Limited recently unveiled its range of trucks and buses along with an innovative solution to strengthen the ecosystem for the upcoming shift. The solution includes an uptime centre which will provide round-the-clock remote telematics-based real time diagnostic support to Eicher trucks and buses on Indian roads.

Speaking at an event to mark the occasion at its Pithampur manufacturing facility near Indore on Tuesday, managing director and chief executive officer Vinod Aggarwal said contrary to VECVs expectations, the commercial vehicles segment had not seen any improvement in sales since September.

Mr. Aggarwal had in December last told The Hindu that he could see improvement in January-March quarter as a result of pre-buying by customers ahead of BS-VI norms kicking in.

“Pre-buying has not happened. Financiers are on the defensive. Dealers and manufacturers are worried. Pricing has taken a hit and big fleet operators are bargaining,” he said.

While truck sales were back to 2014-15 levels, Mr. Aggarwal said, there was a stagnation as far as bus sales were concerned. “School bus sales are good. There has been no drop and is similar to last year.”

The company also launched its innovative BS-VI solution, EUTECH6, which promises higher fuel-efficiency and improved productivity.

Eicher had unveiled its first BS-VI offering in June last year with introduction of new generation Pro2000 series. Offering vehicles in the 4.9-55 tonnes range, VECV is India’s third largest commercial vehicle manufacturer.

“Eicher’s new BS-VI offering takes a lead in providing the most comprehensive and innovative solution to our customers. Our BSVI engine technology is backed by over six years of experience of supplying Euro VI base engines to Volvo Group,” Mr. Aggarwal said.

Mr. Aggarwal said VECV’s new uptime solution, which is an additional support service, aimed at ensuring a differentiated aftersales experience for customers.

Eicher claimed the EUTECH6 solution would not only reduce fuel costs but would significantly improve productivity for the customers with new uptime solutions.

“Our programme for technicians in our dealer network and for drivers of our customers will ensure seamless transition to BS-VI across the country,” Mr. Aggarwal said.

The uptime centre will provide service support with a team of diagnostic experts offering remote and predictive diagnostics and specialised field support to all BS-VI Eicher vehicles, which is in addition to the round-the-clock Eicher on-road service to provide highway assistance across the country.

418,2020/03/16,"COVID-19 | After positive outcome in Jaipur, 3 patients in Mumbai put on anti-HIV drugs","Italian couple were first to be put on this combination

Three out of the nine patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 at the Mumbai’s Kasturba Hospital have been started on combination of anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir. Since the outbreak, the two antiretroviral drugs have been only used in Jaipur for an Italian couple infected with the virus. Based on the positive outcome, the Indian Council of Medical Research has published the use of this combination drugs as a treatment protocol for “restricted public health emergency use”.

Dr. Rajni Kant, director, ICMR’s Regional Medical Research Centre, told The Hindu that the initial findings of using the combination had shown a good result. “We have published the treatment protocol in the Indian Journal of Medical Research and sent it for approval from the Drug Controller General of India,” Dr. Kant said.

The two-drug combination has earlier shown effectiveness against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (CoV). “The combination treatment is approved for emergency public health use, only amongst laboratory-confirmed patients with moderate degree of severity and not designed as a controlled clinical trial. However, the treatment outcomes amongst the first few cases would be useful in providing guidance about clinical management of COVID-19 cases in future,” the IJMR paper states.

Of the nine patients admitted in Mumbai, six are senior citizens while remaining three are in the age group of 30-40. While all the senior citizens have co-morbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension, one of them is currently on oxygen support. A doctor from the hospital said that besides the anti-HIV drugs, they have also used anti-malarial drug chloroquine and anti-H1N1 drug oseltamivir for patients who were suspected with dual infection. “One of the patients has tested positive for H1N1 along with COVID-19”, the doctor said adding that all the nine patients are stable and some of them are asymptomatic.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/1rtdz4/article31077737.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BMVISITORSATKASTURBA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/after-positive-outcome-in-jaipur-3-covid-patients-in-mumbai-put-on-anti-hiv-drugs/article31077738.ece
419,2020/03/16,New technology helps amputees control limb almost naturally,"After losing a leg in an accident 15 years ago, human resource executive Paul Varghese had used two types of prosthetic limbs, including the Jaipur Foot. In December last year, he was implanted with an advanced prosthetic limb which changed his life for better.

“Earlier, I could barely walk a few hundred steps a day. The socket prosthetic led to a lot of a friction often resulting in bleeding,” said Mr. Varghese.

He now uses a prosthetic with a osseointegration technology which allows the amputee to control the limb more intuitively and almost naturally. “Now I walk up to 1,000 steps a day and sometimes I can push myself to take up to 5,000 steps,” he said.

Osseointegration is a radical procedure where a skeletal connection with prosthetics is achieved through a titanium implant in the bone of the amputee. This creates an interface that connects directly to a prosthetic limb. “The resulting bionic leg allows the amputee to control the limb more intuitively, almost naturally,” said orthopaedic surgeon Dr. Aditya Khemka, who along with German prosthetic company Ottobock launched the new technology on Wednesday in Mumbai.

The surgery can be carried out either in one go or in two stages depending on the patient’s condition. Dr. Khemka said, “On an average, the amputee rehabilitation period lasts around two to two-and-a-half months (6 to 10 weeks) after which someone is able to move around like any other abled person. This prosthetic limb will last at least 20 to 25 years. The surgery costs around ₹6 lakh to ₹7 lakh in India, and we are trying to reduce it to ₹1.5 Lakh.”

Bernard O’Keeffe, managing director and Asia Pacific president of Ottobock, said the components used in the prosthetic limb are corrosion resistant and a few of the components are water-proof as well. “This procedure eliminates the risk of suspension of the limb which was found in the older technologies; it naturally takes care of the body weight balance and has potential to create major progress in a reliable and biologically successful manner.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/new-technology-helps-amputees-control-limb-almost-naturally/article31077707.ece
420,2020/03/16,Four ex-CIDCO officials booked for forging land documents,"The manager, town services, City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO), has filed a police complaint against four retired and one current CIDCO officials for forging documents of a plot meant for building houses for corporation employees and selling it to a developer. A case was registered with the CBD Belapur police against 11 people, including the developer and the five, for causing a loss of ₹17 crore.

In 1993, around 30 staff members of the CIDCO had formed a society — Snehapushpa — and in 2002, they acquired the plot at Sector 40, Nerul. As per rules, this plot was meant only for CIDCO employees. In the same year, the plot was handed to the housing society on a 60-year lease agreement against a deposit of ₹73.79 lakh.

The complainant, Fayaz Khan, alleged that the then chairman of the society roped in a developer identified as Haresh Nagji Chheda. Later, all members — who were CIDCO employees — were replaced with non-CIDCO people. The land was later sold to Shah and Chheda Homes Private Limited, partially run by Mr. Chheda, who then constructed a building on the plot.

“A civil dispute is also going on regarding the under-construction building between Mr. Chheda and the CIDCO where both parties have claimed ownership of the land. We have registered the case which will be transferred to the Economic Offences Wing,” senior police inspector Dinkar Mohite from CBD Belapur police station said.

423,2020/03/16,Journalistic challenges in reporting COVID-19,"Reports should neither create unwarranted panic nor underplay the gravity of the situation

On March 11, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) characterised COVID-19 as a pandemic. He said: “Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly. It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death.” What are the lessons that this important declaration holds for journalism? How can journalists arrive at a tone and tenor in reporting the health crisis that neither creates unwarranted panic nor underplays the gravity of the situation?

I have been closely monitoring every report on the spread of the virus and its aftermath in this newspaper over the past three weeks. In my opinion, the language used in explainers and reports seems to work well in informing readers without generating anxiety. The explainers on March 15 — “Is the global economy headed for recession?” and “How does soap use help in tackling COVID-19?” — were carried along with news reports on the spread of the virus.

Tools to evaluate reports

The idea of this column is not to praise The Hindu’s coverage, but to seek feedback on what aspects of its reports worked, what aspects need improvement, and where the paper failed to meet the journalistic standards that I spoke of in my column, “Journalism in the time of an epidemic” (February 10). For the benefit of the readers, I would like to share some of the tools that I use to evaluate reporting on this pandemic, which started as an epidemic.

I draw extensively from New York-based First Draft’s study and tools on health misinformation. They have come up with multiple tips for reporting on COVID-19 and slowing the spread of misinformation. I follow the guidelines issued by WHO, exchange notes with fellow news ombudsmen across platforms and countries, and also try to list some of the best practices across the globe.

First Draft’s prescription for good reporting expects journalists to avoid using sensationalist language. It points out that emotional phrases such as “no end in sight”, “turmoil”, “killer” and “catastrophe” might draw clicks, but they can also lead to panic, which experts warn is the opposite of the calm that we need at a time like this. In his interview to First Draft, Karin Wahl-Jorgensen of Cardiff University, who has studied the use of emotions in journalism, said that journalists should recognise “both the nature of the threat and their responsibility to manage the emotions of the audiences, and not unduly spread fear.” The other important recommendations are: avoid speculating or asking experts to speculate about worst-case scenarios and provide readers with specific actions that they can take.

Roxanne Khamsi’s article in First Draft and an extensive report in Reuters point out the problems related to the proliferation of preprints on COVID-19 since the outbreak began. They say that these preprints are yet to be peer-reviewed and should therefore be approached with a great deal of caution. The Reuters fact sheet points out that out of the 153 studies published on COVID-19, 92 were not peer-reviewed.

Preventing the spread of rumours

First Draft asks media organisations to avoid drawing attention to rumours if they are circulating only in niche communities or have received little engagement. First Draft uses a five-question test to check whether a rumour has reached the tipping point. These questions apply to the Indian mainstream media too. They are: “How much engagement has the rumour received, and how do these numbers compare to similar content on the platform? Is the discussion around the rumour limited to one community online? Has the rumour jumped platforms? Did an influencer or verified account share the rumour? Have large media outlets covered the rumour?”

I also draw from an essay by Bill Hanage and Marc Lipsitch, professors of epidemiology at Harvard University, in Scientific American, titled “How to Report on the COVID-19 Outbreak Responsibly”. They write: “Good reporting and science have to distinguish legitimate sources of information from no end of rumors, half-truths, financially motivated promotions of snake-oil remedies and politically motivated propaganda.”

424,2020/03/16,BARF on your head,"It is my brilliant idea to tackle my worst enemy and it’s not what you think.

This week’s column comes to you from the trenches. The exam trenches. The battle is on between me and that evil, all-powerful villain — Academics! Who will emerge the victor? I or linear equations? Will algebra annihilate me? Will geography be the tsunami that submerges me? Will I learn from the past mistakes of great warriors to be the victor? Well, maybe that last one would be possible if I’d paid attention in History class.

The thing is, I can practically see victory! The tabebuia flowers have started to bloom — a sure shot sign that summer is here. I can almost taste victory! The first mangoes of the season have started to appear in our local market. I can almost feel victory! It’s so nice and warm in the morning! And all that stands in the way of me and bliss are exams!

If only there was a way to write exams without actually having to write them. Like, what if someone invented a brain scanner that scanned your brain for the information it had stored inside — like what’s an adverb and what did Emperor Ashoka do — and based on how much information was there, the brain scanner would give you a grade. Think of how much time, paper, ink and stress that would save! If you ask me, exams should be banned for environmental reasons alone.

Glitches

But, seeing how no grown up is going to ever going to agree to ban exams, I’m thinking that ideas like mine should get some money to develop a prototype. I’d call it the AutomaticExaminoMeter. Or the Student Friendly Exam Helmet. No? Too long? What’s a catchy name? BARF for Brain Automatic Rating Friend? I know that doesn’t make sense, but I really like the idea of a teacher telling me, “Put the BARF on your head now”.

All right, before I dream of being the next Steve Jobs with my revolutionary idea, I just realised that there are a couple of hitches to this idea. Sometimes my brain has this habit of swallowing information and hiding it. And then no matter how hard I try, I can never find this information again. It’s weird, because my Bio teacher keeps calling the human brain a super computer, because it can process tasks in a micro second and lets us do two things at the same time — like eat AND watch TV. But, unlike computers which store information and lets you retrieve it even if you delete the file by mistake, there’s no Restore Trash option with the human brain. So, where does all the stuff you deleted by accident (or on purpose) go? And how can you find it and put it back in your brain? So, I’m guessing my brain scanner needs to also scan the brain for lost information, and then check how much is there before handing grades out.

You know, we wouldn’t even need a BARF if exams were held about really useful information — like Marvel back stories, Pokemon powers and Green House Academy. Oh well, till that happens I’m actually going to have to remember stuff on my own. Why did the Mauryan empire decline?

425,2020/03/16,Grandma goes to school: City life,"As Choto-ma took the girls to Ranchi, they geared up to adapt to the new lifestyle.

The story so far:Choto-ma was a blessing. Grandma got a second chance at education thanks to her.

Grandpa’s uncle and aunt had no children of their own. They decided to take away the young bride and her two young sisters-in-law, Anu and Radhu, with them when they left for Ranchi, leaving just the toddlers behind. Choto-ma meant to teach the girls to read, write, sew and learn cooking and housework so that they could manage their own homes better when the time came. Most family members (they had joint families in those days) were aghast at the idea of their going so far from home. But grandpa’s father supported his brother, so everyone was forced to agree.

Grandma and her sisters-in-law were thrilled beyond words at the thought of a new life. Besides, Ranchi was supposed to be a beautiful place with the Morabadi Hills nearby and awesome waterfalls. None of them had seen such things before. They lived in a kind of trance until they actually reached Ranchi which was so different from the village.

Developing habits

“Girls,” said Choto-ma after a day of settling down, “Please understand that there will be fixed times for everything as you have a lot of new things to learn. I won’t have any slacking.”

The three girls looked up apprehensively. Were they going to have a tough life, after all?

Choto-ma laughed. “No need to worry. You will have enough time to play.”

It took Choto-ma a few days to organise books, sewing material and new clothes for them. Nothing flashy or expensive but she insisted that they should always be neatly dressed. It was something she had learned from her governess.

“I won’t have anyone looking sloppy and untidy or with tousled hair,” she announced. “So take care of your clothes, always fold them neatly and keep everything in place.”

This was a habit that grandma followed all her life. Looking back, I don’t remember ever seeing her looking untidy, even when she spent her life on a chair, unable to move. She always looked fresh, neat and impeccable. Her room was always in perfect order, even on the day she left us forever.

426,2020/03/16,Cashew exporters demand withdrawal of notification,"The Tamil Nadu Cashew Processors and Exporters Association wants a notification issued in February, making Minimum Import Price not applicable for units under Special Economic Zones and Export Oriented Units, to be withdrawn

The Tamil Nadu Cashew Processors and Exporters Association has urged the Centre to implement Minimum Import Price (MIP) on cashew kernels used in the units coming under Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and Export Oriented Units (EOUs).

In a memorandum to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, secretary of the Association, M. Ramakrishnan, said that the industry was on the path of revival when the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) had issued a notification on February 14, 2020 making MIP not applicable for units under SEZ and EOU.

The notification has come as a bolt from the blue and all measures taken by the government to safeguard the cashew industry and farmers has now suffered a setback, he said.

“The Union Commerce Ministry had earlier sought the suggestions of the Cashew Export Promotion Council regarding the need for MIP to units under SEZ and EOU. The council had unanimously passed a resolution that MIP should be continued. However, the present notification is to support a single processor in SEZ,” the memorandum said.

Indian processed cashew kernels are of premium quality and enjoy a good brand image and premium prices in the international market. In addition, India is a major market for broken cashew kernels in the world and processing in other countries would be viable only if they could find a way to sell the broken kernels in India.

However, a section of traders have been resorting to unfair trade practices to cause severe imbalance in the industry in favour of a single processor in SEZ. The present notification will again pave the way for import of finished cashew kernels at less than half the cost price in India, Mr. Ramakrishnan said.

“Already the industry is reeling under severe problems due to closure of around 60 % of units coupled with mass retrenchment of workers. This has resulted in a huge financial crunch and many of the units have been declared as Non Performing Assets. The present notification will have far reaching consequences and create a huge burden on domestic manufacturers and farmers. The Government should immediately intervene and withdraw the notification in the interest of the cashew industry,” he added.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/cashew-exporters-demand-withdrawal-of-notification/article31082133.ece
427,2020/03/16,Coronavirus | Kerala University goes ahead with exams despite apprehension,"Notwithstanding the demands to postpone examinations amidst COVID-19 concerns, the University of Kerala began its undergraduate examinations on Monday.

In the absence of a well-defined directive by the State government, some affiliated colleges were found lacking in the preparedness to prevent the spread of the disease on the first day.

With the Directorate of Collegiate Education (DCE) issuing an advisory, albeit a day late, all colleges are expected to fall in line from Tuesday onwards. College officials have been issued a set of directions including ensuring an adequate supply of hand sanitisers and reserve ‘isolation rooms’ for symptomatic students.

The risk factor

A section of the student and teaching communities had demanded the deferment of the examinations in view of the prevalent panic caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. They pointed out that the plan to go ahead with the examinations could possibly contravene the Health department’s advisory to refrain from gathering at a public place, thereby exposing the attendees to the risk of contracting the disease. Besides, many students also highlighted the difficulties caused by private hostels and paying guest (PG) accommodations closing down their facilities.

However, the government is yet to recommend a postponement of the examinations. The university also maintained that a suspension of the examinations could affect the academic calendar.

“We are left with little options but to go ahead with the examinations. The results of the fourth semester CBCSS examinations, which are under way, will have to be declared prior to that of the sixth semester examinations that will commence on March 23. Only then will we be able to publish the final-year UG results by April end and conform to the government directive to start the next academic year on June 1. The plans could go haywire if we failed to adhere to the schedule,” a senior official said, adding that the Governor, who sought a report from the university following complaints, has green-lit the existing schedule.

The university authorities also have not ruled out the possibility of holding special examinations for those who could not attend the examinations with genuine reasons pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic.

MG University

The Mahatma Gandhi University is reported to have taken a decision in this regard.

Besides directing colleges to ensure utmost cleanliness on their premises, the DCE has issued orders to set up portable wash basins and liquid soap dispensers at the entrance.

428,2020/03/16,Coronavirus | When supermarkets feel the pinch,"Mild level of panic buying over the weekend

The mild levels of panic witnessed in the city over the weekend following reports on COVID-19 cases in the district seems to have reflected on the shelves in supermarkets and other shops in the city.

While things have not escalated to ‘panic buying’ levels, there has been an increased demand for provision items with people stocking up more than the usual amount, according to supermarket managers in the city.

Less number of people

“The number of people visiting us have dwindled, but those who are visiting are buying larger quantities than usual, probably because they assume that there will be a shortage if things escalate. There is a lot of extra demand for rice, pulses, vegetables, frozen food items, perishable items and various kinds of snacks. But we have enough stock to meet the demand,” says Biju, customer care manager at the Ramachandran’s supermarket in Attakulangara.

The situation is similar at the Spencer’s supermarket at Pattom, which has also been experiencing some levels of stock shortage.

“We had a lot of customers coming in and purchasing in large quantities during the weekend. But, since Sunday afternoon, the number of customers has fallen considerably,” says an employee at the supermarket.

With quite a few people coming out on Monday, to accompany their children appearing for examinations, some of the supermarkets located near schools witnessed rush in the morning and afternoon.

At the More supermarket near the General Hospital junction, the rice and other provisional items were slowly disappearing from the shelves.

Medical stores in the city continued to experience shortage of masks and sanitisers, but owners said they were expecting stocks to come in this week.

The hand sanitisers being manufactured by the Kerala State Drugs and Pharmaceuticals (KSDP) were also expected to reach the shops soon.

“Today, we got a small load of hand sanitisers from a private company, out of which only four are left now. With the jail department expected to supply masks, even that issue will be addressed soon,” says Vallabhadas, owner of Sarada medical store, located near General Hospital.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/qjoitk/article31079438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/coronavirusjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/supermarkets-feel-covid-19-shivers/article31083688.ece

The next day, he took a flight to Delhi, reaching there at 4.25 a.m. From there, he took a Vistara flight (UK 897) to Thiruvananthapuram, arriving here at 10.20 a.m on February 27.

433,2020/03/16,Governor counters media portrayal of Ponmudi visit,"Khan tweets his interactions with officials, guides

Governor Arif Mohammed Khan on Sunday countered insinuations that he had gone on a pleasure trip to Ponmudi hill resort allegedly giving the lie to his advice that people should avoid unnecessary travel to stop the seemingly relentless march of COVID-19 infection.

Television news channels suggested that Mr Khan had set a wrong example by visiting Ponmudi, which the government had declared off-limits for visitors to prevent tourists from overcrowding the destination on weekends.

In an oblique criticism of the news reports, Mr Khan made three back-to-back tweets about his activities at the hill resort.

Mr. Khan said he had met Forest Officer K. I. Pradeep Kumar and Range Officer, Palode.

He asked them about the “welfare measures for people of the tribal settlement.”.

He also discussed the steps taken to insulate forest dwellers from outbreaks and other diseases.

It appeared that Mr Khan had a busy workday in Ponmudi.

Mr Khan and his wife, Reshma Arif, interacted with guides and guards tasked to maintain and protect the ecotourism site.

He peppered them with questions which focussed on how ecotourism initiatives benefited the forest tribes. He and Ms Arif shopped at the Vanasree counter, which specialises in forest products.

Mr Khan was also curious about the waste management system at Ponmudi.

He also tweeted pictures of his activities at the holiday destination.

435,2020/03/16,Counselling over phone to those in quarantine,"Kudumbashree counsellors to call the elderly

Following talks with health officials, Kudumbashree executive director Harikishore S. has written to the district mission coordinators on steps to be taken by Kudumbashree members to help the large number of people in home quarantine .

Kudumbashree community counsellors will provide psychological counselling over phone to those in quarantine.

Once the list of those in quarantine in each panchayat is received from the Health Department, these people must be contacted by the CDS, ADS, or neighbourhood group over phone every day. The Kudumbashree members have to impress upon the family members, especially the elderly, of those in quarantine to avoid any contact with them.

They must find out during the phone call if anyone in the family, especially the elderly, has cold or fever and if enough food and medicines or other necessities are available for them and provide necessary support through the ADS.

In case there are people with health problems, their details should be noted down.

The details received from the Health Department and those given to them should not be shared by the Kudumbashree members with anyone else.

436,2020/03/16,Kudumbashree joins fight in Vellanad,"It manages to contain panic in the area

When a COVID-19 case was confirmed from Vellanad in the district, there was an initial panic there.

The next day, two meetings of top panchayat officials were called in the presence of K.S. Sabarinadhan, MLA. Kudumbashree community development society (CDS) chairpersons were also called for the meeting.

It was decided at the meeting that Kudumbashree area development society (ADS) members would make door-to-door visits in a bid to curb the panic, reassure the people, and distribute pamphlets that underlined the need to be vigilant and take precautions against the spread of COVID-19.

Vellanad panchayat Kudumbashree community development society accountant Sajithakumari B.S. says awareness campaigns were also held among neighbourhood groups there.

The panchayat has six elderly neighbourhood groups.

With the elderly being very vulnerable to the disease, educating them was imperative.

Pensioners

As one of the elderly neighbourhood groups – a group of pensioners - was in close vicinity to the area from where the positive case was reported, homoeo doctors were roped in to make house visits to inform them of steps to contain the disease, she said.

Sajithakumari says people had heard and read so much about the disease that news of the COVID-19 positive case did make them anxious.

However, they were reassured that there was only one case in the panchayat and as the infected person had been very cautious to avoid contact with as many people as he could, there was no reason to panic.

Highlighting the infected person’s responsible behaviour also helped check any bid to ostracise the family. People were told to emulate his example and prevent the spread of the disease to others.

Shops that had been closed after a family member of the infected person visited them were reopened after conducting an awareness drive and reassuring them of no further positive cases.

Besides announcements by the panchayat on the details of the positive case and the need to stay calm, Kudumbashree community counsellors, ADS office-bearers, and ASHA workers had to a large extent helped remove any panic about the spread of COVID-19, says Sajithakumari.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/kudumbashree-joins-fight-in-vellanad/article31077161.ece
437,2020/03/16,Three-layered reusable mask launched by Railways,"Modelled like a surgical mask , it costs ₹50

As the COVID-19 global spread escalates and more cases coming up in Kerala, the citizens, government, health and other service providers are desperately running for masks and hand sanitizers.

A three-layer reusable mask to address the shortage of the protective gear has been developed in the State capital under the initiative of the Railways.

Modelled on the lines of the surgical mask, banian cloth forms the inner layer from inside, nylon fabric acts as middle layer and cotton fabric is the outer layer.

“We have got 150 masks already. It can be soaked in soap water for 20 minutes, washed, dried and reused,” Senior Divisional Commercial Manager Rajesh Chandran who is the brain behind the initiative told The Hindu.

“We needed masks for the frontline staff and it was not available in market. Search and inquiries landed me to my mentor and Professor of medicine who mooted the idea. The single layer surgical masks work only for six hours, but this with three layers act as a barrier for three months,” Dr. Chandran, a graduate in medicine, said.

Jayashree, who runs a stitching unit at Kamaleswaram in the capital, responded to the challenge of Dr. Chandran and came up with the mask in an hour.

“She was trying it for first time and she did it with ease. Getting the banian fabric is the challenge. The fabric is washed before stitching to avoid shrinking,” says Harsha Krishna, Chief Commercial Inspector, who along with the Chief Commercial Supervisor Renjan T. S. helped Dr. Chandran in the task. The mask cost ₹50. The colour will vary depending on the cotton fabric used. The dimensions have been increased to give more protection to the wearer.

Hand hygiene having been hailed as the most effective way to break the transmission of the virus causing COVID 19, the Health Department has launched a campaign to encourage public to adopt the habit of frequently washing hands or disinfecting them using a hand sanitiser.

Inaugurating the campaign, ‘Break the Chain,’ Health Minister, K. K. Shylaja said that public behaviour was largely responsible for the speedy transmission of COVID-19 and that adoption of hand hygiene and practising social distancing can to a large extent be protective against the virus.

Handwashing should be complemented by maintaining proper respiratory hygiene, avoiding touching on face unnecessarily and by doing away with social greetings like hand shakes.

To encourage the campaign, all institutions and workplaces should make available hand sanitisers at entry points to the office, which should be used by employees before and after entering workplace

Apartment complexes should establish kiosks at the entrance and encourage people to sanitise their hands before entering or exiting the place.Ms. Shylaja said that the youth organisations should carry forward the campaign and use social media to promote #break the chain.

The hand sanitisers available in the market cost anywhere between ₹150 to ₹200 for 100 ml, while the KSDP’s product is priced at ₹125 for 500 ml.

To meet the surge in demand for sanitisers, the city Corporation has also decided to produce hand sanitisers in association with the Prisons Department. The Mayor held a discussion with the Director General of Prisons Rishiraj Singh regarding steps to be taken for this.

The Corporation also got in touch with the Excise Minister T.P.Ramakrishnan to request for enough spirit for the production of sanitisers. The civic body will also procure the rest of the materials for the purpose and hand it over to the Prisons Department, which will manufacture it.

Under the stewardship of Owen Coyle, the team rose from rock bottom, outplayed the league’s most entertaining side (FC Goa) in the playoffs and was also the dominant side in the final against ATK.

Poor finishing

If not for poor finishing, Chennaiyin would have probably clinched its third title.

“We want to win but also entertain while we do so,” said Coyle, while taking charge in December 2019. His players did just that, producing some exciting football.

At the Fatorda Stadium on Saturday, right from kick off, they moved the ball with urgency, passed with accuracy and only a goalline clearance denied Chennaiyin. All of this in under 60 seconds!

The Chennai outfit registered the lion’s share of possession (62%), had 279 more touches of the ball, played 299 more passes with a lot more accuracy (75% compared to ATK’s 58%).

Owen-fresh

Coyle’s love for the game and his positivity rubbed off on the players. He always spoke about taking it one game at a time, and it worked like a charm.

The Irishman landed in the middle of the season, made minor tweaks to his predecessor John Gregory’s system and everything suddenly fell in place. A side that was struggling to string together even a few meaningful passes steamrollered its opponents and made its climb up the table.

It was not just the new manager and his philosophy, but also the hard work on the training ground that brought about this transformation.

“If you don’t take your chances, it will come back to haunt you,” said Coyle after the final. “The spoils went to ATK... so all the very best to them.”

Earning respect

There might be regret but there won’t be sleepless nights, for the players and fans. Coyle’s men overcame all hurdles, brought the fans back to the stadium and earned back lost respect.

“Chennaiyin was the one team we did not want to face in the playoffs,” said FC Goa’s Clifford Miranda, the man in charge of the most entertaining and dominant side in ISL history.

From an also-ran to being feared by the best side in the country... that is Coyle’s legacy. And Chennaiyin’s incredible run, despite the reverse in the final, will be part of Indian football folklore.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/y2oaar/article31075887.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16CFC,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/indian-super-league-coyles-men-deserve-a-round-of-applause/article31075888.ece

With the fear of COVID-19 gripping residents, many have chosen to avoid travel leading to a drop in occupancy in city and mofussil buses.

However, with the fear of the novel coronavirus outbreak spreading, many have opted to stay home or take private transport. K. Kalaivani, who works at a software company in Thuraiyur, has been asked to work from home, she says.

“I take the bus from Central bus stand every morning along with 10 other colleagues. We have been asked us to work from home for the 15 days,” she said.

For some others, workplaces have recommended that they take their own vehicles and to avoid crowds.

“We have been told not to travel outside of the city on buses or trains. We have also been asked not to gather in crowds of over 20 people,” said R. Nisha, a salesperson working for a cosmetics manufacturer in Tiruchi.

Those who are forced to travel to work are doing so with several precautions, including using face masks.

Bookings for travel outside the city have been were hit.

“Occupancy is normally high over the weekend. However, most buses were nearly empty last night,” a ticket issuer at the State Express Transport Corporation counter at the Central Bus Stand said.

Buses plying to Bengaluru and Chennai on Sunday night, which is when those hailing from Tiruchi return to the metros for work on Monday, also plied with very few passengers, they said.

Private travel operators plying to various places within and outside Tiruchi too report a drop in passengers.

“This is usually a lean season as examinations are on. Bookings peaking only around early April for the summer vacations. However, this year, the business of all travels has dwindled further, following the coronavirus scare. Those who are taking the buses are refusing blankets and pillows,” said a representative of a private operator.

Meanwhile, R. Manjunath, a conductor with the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation, said that the number of passengers coming from Bengaluru to Tiruchi on Sunday night was at an all-time high.

“Usually, the bus is only half-full. However, yesterday, we had to turn away some passengers as we ran out of seats. As many have been asked to work from home in Bengaluru, they have rushed back home to stay with their families,” he said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/w3yysa/article31083307.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY17BUS-CENTRALBUSSTAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/number-of-citizens-taking-public-buses-reduces-following-covid-19-scare/article31083308.ece
450,2020/03/16,Sluggish progress resented,"TIRUVARUR

The Department of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) indifferent attitude towards its own project aimed at improving the income of Sri Kothandaramaswamy Temple, Vaduvur, popularly known as Vaduvur Ramar temple near Mannargudi, has baffled devotees and villagers.

Six years ago, the HR&CE officials looking after the income and expenditure accounts of Vaduvur Ramar temple decided to construct a marriage hall on a piece of temple land lying vacant very near the temple with an objective to augment the annual income of the temple.

A detailed project report was prepared and sent to the headquarters at Chennai for sanction and as well as releasing of funds from the board’s fund.

As the total fund required for constructing the marriage hall with all amenities was put at ₹95 lakh, including ₹10 lakh as the Vaduvur temple’s contribution. The department granted sanction a year later.

The construction was taken up immediately and the work went on smoothly until the building was constructed. However, works such as flooring, fixing of windows, doors, electrical fittings, bathroom fittings, setting up of septic tank, the sinking of bore well construction of compound wall, vehicle parking area, and others were kept pending reportedly for ‘want of additional funds’ to the tune of around ₹50 lakh, sources said.

Regretting the inordinate delay in completing the marriage hall, Raman of Vaduvur criticised the official apathy towards the project. “After all, devotees were contributing money for the project”, he lamented and alleged that the incomplete building turned out to be safe hideout for some anti-social elements over the past three years.

Meanwhile, Gopalakrishnan of Nandivaram near Chennai, who is a frequent visitor to Vaduvur temple, said it was no wonder that such projects remain incomplete for years together.

“A similar project with an outlay of ₹1.50 crore taken up by the HR and CE Department, immediately after taking over the control of Sri Murugan Temple in Tiruporur near Chennai from the Chidambraswamigal Mutt, Tiruporur, in 2010, remained incomplete for years together. The mega project was thrown open for public use in 2019,” he said.

When contacted, a HR and CE Department representative for Sri Kothandaramaswamy temple, Vaduvur, conceded that the project required additional funds and added that the work would be completed once additional funds were released.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/bdwhb8/article31083258.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA17MARRIAGEHALLBUILDING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/sluggish-progress-resented/article31083259.ece

453,2020/03/16,Residents off Vayalur Road seek extension of underground sewer lines,"Many residents let out the sewage and domestic waste in the open

TIRUCHI

Extension of the city’s underground drainage network to Shanmuga Nagar, M.M. Nagar, Uyyakondan Thirumalai and other residential colonies off the Vayalur Road has been the long pending demand of the residents.

According to a rough estimate, more that 5,000 households are in Uyyakondan Thirumalai, Shanmuga Nagar, Shanmuga Nagar Extension, M.M. Nagar, Renga Nagar, Selva Nagar and other residential colonies from Uyyakondan River to Rettaivaical on Vayalur Road.

Of them, Uyyakondan Thirumalai is the oldest habitation and exists for several decades. Shanmuga Nagar is the first residential colony promoted about 30 years ago. Other residential colonies sprang up subsequently due to rapid urbanisation. The expansion is still taking place on Vayalur Road.

Similarly, a number of apartments have also come up on either sides off the Vayalur Road. A few more apartments are also under construction.

Though many colonies are more than 20 to 25 years old, the residents rue that they have not been brought under the UGD network. The Tiruchi Corporation, which is implementing the phase -II UGD project in different parts of the city, included the residential colonies situated in the eastern bank of Uyyakondan river in the project. However, the colonies that came up in the western bank of the river have not been included.

In the absence of underground sewer lines, except a section of residents, who have septic tank on their premises, many residents let out the sewage and domestic waste in the open. Several others discharge the sewage effluents into the Uyyakondan River.

The Rettaivaical, Kathirikaivaical and one more irrigation canal flows across Renga Nagar, which are meant for carrying water for irrigation, have been literally converted as sewage canals. Some of the flat dwellers too let sewage water into the river.

“Our areas have been neglected for so long. We have been demanding extension of the sewer lines for years. But, it is yet to become a reality,” says C. Nagappan of Selva Nagar, a long-time resident since 1991.

He said that the river and irrigation canals had completely been polluted due to indiscriminate discharge of sewage. When most of left out wards and areas of the city had been included in the phase-II and phase-III UGD projects, it was unfortunate that several colonies on Vayalur Road were omitted.

When contacted, a senior official of the Corporation said that there were difficulties in carrying sewage pipes across the Uyyakondan River. It had actually forced the Corporation to omit a few areas in the UGD project. However, all options would be explored to bring the omitted areas under the sewer network soon, the official said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/e05808/article31083137.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA17TY-SEWAGEFLOWING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/residents-off-vayalur-road-seek-extension-of-underground-sewer-lines/article31083138.ece
454,2020/03/16,COVID-19 leads to suspension of some overseas flights from Tiruchi,"TIRUCHI

Visa restrictions and drop in load factor owing to the COVID-19 outbreak have led to the cancellation of some of flights to foreign destinations from Tiruchi.

The Sri Lankan Airlines cancelled one service from Tiruchi to Colombo temporarily from Monday. The airline would be cancelling its evening flight from March 16 to 18 and the morning service from March 19 – 31. Presently, the airline operates two services on the sector — one in the morning and another in evening.

Aviation circles here say that cancellation of one flight service till this month-end was in the wake of the COVID-19 as well as due to restrictions imposed by certain West Asian countries which had affected the load factor. The airlines has direct connectivity from Colombo to several West Asian countries where a large chunk of Indians especially from the southern and central districts of Tamil Nadu work.

There has been substantial drop in the movement of international passengers of late in the wake of COVID-19 forcing the airline to cancel one service from Tiruchi to Colombo, say the sources. Information about the cancellation of one service was being conveyed to the travel agents and passengers, the sources added.

The sources further said Air Asia which operates daily flights to Kuala Lumpur from Tiruchi had already cancelled two of its flights from Tiruchi up to April 15.

The third flight was being operated as per schedule. The cancellation had come into effect from March 13 due to visa restrictions for foreigners in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. Air India Express circles here say that the drop in passenger movements in the Tiruchi - Dubai and Tiruchi - Sharjah sectors was marginal. However, the airline continues to operate its daily services to Dubai, Singarpore and Sharjah.

459,2020/03/16,Banana bunch turns out to be a crowd-puller,"A banana tree with a long bunch of hundreds of fruits is attracting people to the Panchayat Union Elementary School at Peravurani East.

Subash, a teacher of this century-old school, brought a few of the banana variety called ‘Aayiramkaachi’ from his native place Colachel in Kanniyakumari district four years ago and planted it in the school garden.

While one tree had a lengthy bunch measuring about seven feet with hundreds of bananas, another bunch of another tree also provided a visual treat to the school children and the passersby.

He has also raised greens, papaya, guava, mango, jackfruit, coconut, and sapodilla trees in the garden.

Horticulture Department officials say this type of banana is raised in Kanniyakumari district and Kerala.

460,2020/03/16,Focus on cultivation of minor millets,"Seeking to give a push to cultivation and consumption of minor millets, Agriculture Department hosted a seminar on National Food Security Mission here on Friday.

Speakers at the seminar pointed out that minor millets such as cholam, cumbu, ragi, thinai, varagu and kudiraivaali had been the staple diet of Tamil Nadu until a few decades ago.

With changes in lifestyle and eating habits, consumption of minor millets had declined.

However, in recent years, there had been an increase in awareness and awakening among people about the need for including minor millets in their regular diet.

Speaking on the occasion, P. Asokan, Joint Director of Agriculture, Tiruchi, said that the government was taking various steps to increase the acreage, yield and consumption of minor millets. They were cultivated in rain-fed areas with very little water requirement and minimal use of fertilizers and plant protection measures. With very little investment, the farmers could get a good crop and with value addition they can double their income, he said.

The primary objective of the NFSM-Nutri Cereals was to bring more area under minor millets and increase the production and productivity thereby increasing the consumption of millets, leading to a healthier younger generation.

Experts from Anbil Dharmalingam Agricultural College and Research Institute, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Sirugamani, Vagarai Maize Research Station and other institutions spoke.

An exhibition was arranged to highlight the importance of millets in the diet regime.

461,2020/03/16,Sharp curve proves to be nightmare,"A little thought into safety of road alignment at the culmination point of the four-lane road linking Gundur with Navalpattu IT Park could prevent several accidents, say residents.

At the spot where the road ends, vehicle users going towards Police Colony are required to abruptly negotiate a sharp curve, making themselves vulnerable to collision with oncoming vehicles. On an average, at least two to three accidents occur at the spot every week, the residents lament.

“Repeated petitions submitted to the authorities concerned for laying a speed breaker close to the culmination point have not been acted upon for long,” Kamaraj, a resident of Police Colony, said.

Shopkeepers in the vicinity acknowledged that the accidents occur at the spot, particularly at night when those who frequent a couple of TASMAC outlets along the Gundur-IT Park road ride their vehicles recklessly on their way back after consuming liquor.

At other times of the day also, measures for restricting the speed of vehicles is necessary considering the safety of students of a girls school in the vicinity, the residents said.

The smoothness of the wide road prompts many to feel complacent about over-speeding.

462,2020/03/16,Check dam across Maruthaiyar to be completed by April-end,"₹15-crore project taken up to harness monsoon rain flow

Construction of a check dam across the Maruthaiyar at Sundakudi in Ariyalur district has gathered pace and the structure will be completed by the end of April, according to Public Works Department sources.

Although the work started last year itself, heavy flow during monsoon last year impeded the work. Besides, eucalyptus trees near the construction site had to be removed.

The river, which originates from the eastern slopes of Pachamalai in Perambalur district, runs for a distance of about 70.40 km before joining Kollidam river at Sathampadi in Ariyalur district. Though the river gets inflow during both South West and North East monsoons, it gets more flow during the latter. The Maruthaiyar basin gets an average of 829 mm of rainfall a year and of this nearly 58% is obtained during NE monsoon. However, the water runs off into the sea through Kollidam river without benefiting agriculture.

After taking up a survey, the PWD identified the site at Sundakudi to build a check dam across the river to harness the rain flow.

The dam, estimated to cost ₹15 crore, would be 300 metres long and 1.5 metre high.

Collector D. Rathna, who inspected the construction work on Friday, later said the check dam would help stabilise irrigation to 341 acres. Another 300 acres of agricultural lands would stand to benefit indirectly through anticipated increase in the groundwater table. It can hold about 3.178 million cubic feet and through three expected fillings a year, the check dam could harvest about 9.534 million cubic feet of water.

PWD Executive Engineer D. Dakshinamurthy, and Assistant Executive Engineers Velmurugan and Akilandeswari were present during the Collector’s inspection.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/h82t6k/article31079350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15TYDELTA-MARUTHAIYAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/check-dam-across-maruthaiyar-to-be-completed-by-april-end/article31079351.ece

Andhra Pradesh State Child Rights Protection Commission Chairperson G. Hymavathi on Sunday said good personal hygiene habits were an effective way to keep COVID-19 at a safe distance.

Expressing serious concern over the rapidity with which the virus was spreading across the country, she said besides two deaths in other States, the fact that the virus had affected people in Andhra Pradesh was a matter of concern. She, however, added that there was no need to panic over the issue and people, instead, should focus on bringing about positive changes in their lifestyle.

Awareness sessions

Ms. Hymavathi said students, especially, needed to exercise caution as they spent most of their time either in schools, colleges or in hostels. Any person showing symptoms of COVID-19 should be immediately referred to hospital, she said, urging teachers to be alert to identify any such possible case. She said the commission had directed the departments concerned to organise awareness sessions in educational institutions on the virus.

468,2020/03/16,Kidney donors can continue to lead healthy lives: experts,"‘Donors can continue to lead a healthy life’

Sankar Rao, hailing from a poor family, was a happily married man till his eyesight started diminishing. A medical checkup revealed that his creatinine levels were high. Doctors then gave him the bad news: a kidney transplant was the only way out for him.

He recalled his trauma at a meeting organised by KIMS ICON Hospital at Sheelanagar.

“ When I heard the news from doctors on January 10 this year, I felt my life turning upside down,” Mr. Sankar Rao recalls.

“My mother, without a second thought, told the doctors that she would donate one of her kidneys if it matched. She gave me a second lease of life. Anyone can overcome the kidney problem, if there is family support and medical help,” Mr. Sankar said, expressing his gratitude to his mother.

A few other patients said that they were in good health after the surgery. A young woman underlined the need to motivate donors as there was no risk to the donor.

Dr. R.K. Mahesh and Dr. Krishna Prasad, renal transplant physicians of KIMS-ICON Hospitals, underlined the importance of prevention and early detection of kidney diseases.

They called for greater awareness on the safety of kidney donation. There were certain myths that donors would not be able to lead normal lives after giving one of their kidneys. Dr. Mahesh said a young unmarried man has agreed to donate his kidney to his sister, who needs a transplant. The transplant was planned to be conducted by the end of this month.

While donors can lead normal lives after surgery, they should get their blood pressure, blood sugar and creatinine levels tested once in three months, and inform their doctor of their kidney donation, if they are prescribed painkillers, doctors said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/kidney-donors-can-continue-to-lead-healthy-lives-experts/article31079258.ece
469,2020/03/16,"Vessels enter Paradip harbour after 20 years, thanks to DCIL","Dredging completed in a record 45 days, say officials

Fishing vessels can now safely enter the Paradip fishing harbour after a gap of two decades thanks to dredging works undertaken by the Dredging Corporation of India Ltd. at the Mahanadi rivermouth near Paradip in Odisha.

The dredging, completed by a trailing suction hopper dredger in record time, has won DCIL accolades from senior officials of the Paradip Port Trust (PPT).

The channel is now finally open and the woes of the fishing community have ended after two decades, said local officials. Some dredging companies had attempted to clear the channel but had failed due to breakdowns. The job was finally entrusted to DCIL in December 2019.

A senior DCIL official told The Hindu that the task was completed amid a lot of risk. “The designed depth achieved was of five metres. The area was also known for heavy wind with big swirls. It involved a lot of risk due to threat of running aground on account of shallow waters,” the official said.

The harbour was constructed by PPT to avoid eventualities inside the commercial harbour during shipping operations.

The fishery harbour’s construction was completed in 1995 and commissioned in 1998. Subsequently, it was handed over to the Odisha government on September 27, 2011.

The harbour is located at Paradip on the right bank of the Mahanadi, about a km upstream of the river mouth having a width of 100 m, for which maintenance dredging was required at regular intervals.

This type of feat was never attempted before by any dredging company due to the restricted draft in the assigned area.

The project was closely monitored with daily production, survey charts and with impeccable execution instructions to the vessel about the dredging plan. The unique project was completed successfully in 45 days, the official said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/loqo20/article31079256.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16VJVISKPAHEDREDGING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/vessels-enter-paradip-harbour-after-20-years-thanks-to-dcil/article31079257.ece
470,2020/03/16,International expert meets Chennai’s bonsai community,"Chennai’s active, creative bonsai community often ropes in experts from other cities and countries, to learn, share and hone their art

Casuarina, pomegranate, cherry, bougainvillea, ficus. When you think of them, you think of trees, magnificently standing their ground, rooted deep in the earth. But all these and many more can be grown as bonsai.

Dr Yogesh Bhuvanashwar, President of Bodhi, The Chennai Bonsai Association, calls bonsai an ‘exercise in imagination’: “Bonsai is a wonderful mix of horticulture and creativity. You need to study your environment and the plant, to see how best to grow it. But once you have the basics right, the tree speaks to you,” he elaborates, as he imagines what a casual Casuarina could become, pruning its delicate leaves. His masterpiece will be inspected and improved by Moshe Emergui, a visiting Israeli bonsai artist, at a workshop organised by Bodhi.

The hall at the Green Meadows Farm on East Coast Road is enveloped by a salty breeze, as visitors admire bonsai of different ages, botanical families and in different styles.

“At Bodhi, we are constantly looking at new ways of growing healthy bonsai in our local environment. The Chennai climate is a big factor while choosing what kinds of plants to prune. While pines are popular in Japan, we have to look at tropical plants like casuarina and ficus, that seem to enjoy the warmth,” adds Yogesh.

Know your basics

Even as he says this, over 50 bonsai enthusiasts deftly snip branches, wrap wire, and bend them ever so gently, tinkering with Nature, with deep respect. “People often ask us, isn’t it cruel to wrap branches with wires? The wire is merely to shape the branches, we must be careful that they do not ever cut the plant,” states Suseela Vergis, who has painstakingly created over 300 bonsai over four decades. She enumerates simple tips to protect them, “In Chennai, we have a few common insects that disturb the peace. We see caterpillars, but let them munch on leaves like they would in Nature. The ones to watch out for, are the aphids and mealybugs. For the former, you introduce ladybugs into the space, while the latter can be sprayed with a natural fix-three Gs — green chilli, ginger and garlic, ground to a paste, strained and made into a solution with some neem oil.”

Yogesh, who has hundreds of bonsai in his home garden, spends at least three to four hours over the weekend, with his plant companions. “In Chennai, we find any tree that grows well in local conditions, can be grown in miniature form. The trick is to imitate the trees found in Nature, and soil conditions.”

The Chennai heat and salinity in the water, have to be factored in as well, when choosing bonsai. “Salt deposits in water cause browning of leaves. On ECR, the sandy soil helps filter the salt out, so the trees thrive there, while over OMR, we notice that we have to pour water in a bucket and let the dissolved salt settle. We also use aluminium compounds to neutralise its effect,” states Maria Vivish, who picked up her love for all things green while tending to her mother’s fruit trees in gardens at army postings, all over the country.

She elaborates, “Bonsai need sunlight but not the scorching heat we get in summer, so we use shaded nets to protect the bonsai. We also need to mist leaves, and water the plants twice a day during the hottest months. This lets roots absorb water, transferring nutrients to the branches.”

Suseela, who has a bonsai as old as her middle-aged son, shares some advice on manure, especially suited to the city. “When we conduct our monthly meetings at Bodhi, or even organise workshops like these, we answer questions, share successes and failures. Simple things, like using organic manure, which combines cow dung and other natural compounds, help the bonsai flourish.” Bodhi members seem to share one sentiment in common: bonsai is an art, and plants often become members of the family, when you spend time and energy watching them grow. They sometimes outlive you, a testimony to the craft and the sturdiness of the microcosm of life in a container.

Here and there

The community is a lively one, and often takes in expert advice from other cities like their recent workshop which featured Jyoti and Nikunj Parekh, veterans in the field and co-authors of Tropical Bonsai, that was published way back in 1977. The duo, who had shared expertise on ceramic rock making and arrangements in a miniature landscape, have plenty more to tell. “Earlier, we would procure materials from abroad, which is prohibitively expensive. Now, we create our own rock and pottery in Mumbai, and it enlivens the craft, giving it a local flavour,” says Jyoti.

“We like to create miniature forests. When we learn to love the micro environment, we learn to appreciate the macro milieu as well,” adds Nikunj, as he rhapsodizes on the parallels between botany and philosophy. “Strong roots, give you strong trees, much like the foundations of a good family.”

Dr Sujata Bhat, Director of Bonsai Clubs International, Mumbai adds, “Bonsai is about aesthetic temperament as well. The visible root system, the topiary, the canopy or crown on top or a cascade of branches, even the age of the tree is important. It’s all about asymmetry, trying to recreate what we observe in Nature, but with a deep mystery and magic. It’s meditative.”",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/asaqqv/article31082355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16MPBONSAI,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/international-expert-meets-chennais-bonsai-community/article31082360.ece
471,2020/03/16,"Conservation starts at the grassroots, say National Geographic explorers Sandesh Kadur and Krithi Karanth","Calling ordinary folk for an extraordinary task

There is a growing awareness of the peril our planet is in. There is also a romantic misconception that only those who wear pith helmets are entrusted with the mission of saving the Earth.

Sandesh Kadur is a wildlife filmmaker and storyteller, Krithi Karanth is a scientist and conservationist. They firmly believe that the more people sign up to preserve our world, the better a chance it really stands of survival. The duo, who have been associated with National Geographic for more than a decade, had a lot to say about a layman’s contribution towards this cause.

On the occasion of World Wildlife Day, National Geographic announced the commencement of a global report on the 50 most endangered species on the planet. “This is a campaign to draw attention to 50 species around the world that are deeply threatened. We hope to get people interested enough to start on concrete measures to save these extraordinary animals,” says Krithi about the programme that will run for 50 days till April 22.

“The species captured on film are really a showcase, meant to educate and inspire people to want to care about the wilderness and its animals. The concept is built around #savetogether to draw people in,” says Sandesh.

“As filmmakers and storytellers, we work a lot with researchers who have the data and facts that make for a good story. There is a lot of synergy in the different things we do. It is only when they all come together, can we achieve a tangible conservation movement,” he says.

While it is true the ‘exotic’ species get more attention than others, the lesser known species are no less deserving and certainly need far more engagement by a wider set of people for them to survive.

So how does the regular city dweller do his bit for the planet? “Look up a species you like or find a place you care about. Find out who are the people on the ground level who are working to save these animals and support them. Volunteer your time or use your skills to fund raise for them. There are a million ways to support this cause,” says Krithi.

“Over the last 25-30 years, we have taken about 7,000 people as volunteers to the forest to set up camera traps, walk line transects and do village surveys with us. There is nothing like actually experiencing conservation efforts first-hand — that is what gets people passionate about it,” says Krithi.

People will not act if they don’t care and this report is a great way to get people to care. “Not everybody may like a particular species, but I’m sure in that list of 50, there will be at least one that gets somebody’s attention. It is our hope the report gives people a chance to understand how incredibly diverse the planet is,” says Krithi.

While everyone can’t be Greta Thunberg, everyone can certainly chip in. Even a seemingly simple step like signing an online petition to save a blue whale in distress or a sinking polar bear helps Earth warriors gain the traction they need. It carries a lot of weight when there are a lot of signatures on something,” says Krithi, and Sandesh adds, “Again, it is a numbers game. A lot of people voicing their concern rack up numbers, and that triggers action.”

Sandesh talks about the programme he just finished for National Geographic. Called Wild Cats of India, it is a three-part documentary series that highlights India’s incredible feline diversity. “India has more species of cats than any other country in the world. We have 15 species here.”

Sandesh has been with National Geographic since 2008 and his first documentary with them was Secrets of the King Cobra. In 2011, he filmed Krithi for her 10,000 grant award as an emerging explorer with National Geographic. He was awarded the same grant in 2013.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/7hed84/article31080693.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SANDESHKRITI,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/conservation-starts-at-the-grassroots-say-national-geographic-explorers-sandesh-kadur-and-kriti-karanth/article31080694.ece
472,2020/03/16,"Lt Cdr P Swathi, one of the six members of the all-woman team to circumnavigate the globe, looks back on her voyage aboard INSV Tarini","Lt Cdr P Swathi, one of the six members of the all-woman team to circumnavigate the globe, looks back on her voyage aboard INSV Tarini

Theirs is a story that never gets stale. It is going to be two years since Indian Navy’s six gutsy women officers circumnavigated the globe in 254 days on board INSV Tarini. They returned on May 21, 2018, but the story of their courage still goes around the world.

In the last 20-odd months, the members individually and collectively, have shared their experience more than 300 times at multiple forums and to standing ovations. And here in the city too, at a meeting recently organised by the All Ladies League-Madurai, it was no different when Lieutenant Commander P Swathi shared nuggets from her journey with five fellow sailors. She held the audience spell-bound with her narration and Power Point presentation on how the women — all in their early to mid-20s — braved rough seas, freezing cold and scorching temperatures, roaring winds and life-threatening storms to circumnavigate the globe successfully.

That they are the first-ever all women team to do so, is a cause for celebration wherever they go now. “We all got a second life and fear is a word that no longer exists in our dictionary,” says Swathi, taking a few questions in between her next talk and the endless selfie sessions with all those who came to hear her. Soon, she informs us, their story is going to be on the silver screen with a Bollywood production house planning a movie on their adventures. Actor Priyanka Chopra has apparently agreed while the search is on for rest of the cast.

But Lt Cdr Vartika Joshi, who was the captain of the team, and Lt Cdr Pratibha Jamwal, Lt Cdr Aishwarya Boddapati, Lt S Vijaya Devi, Lt Payal Gupta along with Swathi are already celebrities for breaking gender barriers and smashing glass ceilings. Sadly, their men officers did not believe that their team would complete the voyage. “We did so many other things that they challenged us to do, like baking cakes and making fluffy chapatis on board,” laughs Swathi. “On Diwali when the Prime Minister called us, we even made eco-friendly diyas with atta, used surgical cotton and ghee to light them, and set them afloat in the ocean,” she says.

Their three years of training after they were selected in 2014 from 40 applicants out of 500 women naval officers in the country, played a crucial role. Many candidates dropped out after their families denied them permission out of fear. “All along our intensive training under Captain Dilip Dhonde (first Indian Naval Officer to complete a solo, unassisted circumnavigation of the globe under sail), we were constantly reminded to not think about our gender when we sailed out on Tarini. Our mothers’ courage and confidence in us enabled us to undertake this journey,” says Swathi who grew up seeing the sea in Visakhapatnam. “I was not fond of water, but my mother encouraged me to learn sailing,” she says. But unlike her, the others in the team are all from the hills; they had never seen or been near the sea until the expedition named Navika Sagar Parikrama came along.

The day they returned, the Defence Minister, the Navy Chief and several senior officials were waiting at the INS Mandovi, Goa to receive them. “But,” says Swathi, we all first rushed into our mothers’ arms and embraced them tightly as every other VIP looked on!” She says everything they did epitomised ‘naari shakti’ and narrates an incident that delayed the commencement of their expedition by five days.

“We were all set to leave on September 5, 2017, but a call from the PMO asked us to wait. That was because Nirmala Sitharaman was appointed as the Defence Minister and the government thought it appropriate that she should flag us off. Finally, with her blessings, we set sail on September 10.”

Swathi believes the sailboat carried and protected them like a mother throughout the voyage. “We considered our boat as the first crew member because we were told if you look after the boat, the boat will look after you,” says Swathi and adds, how the team was involved from the scratch in the construction of Tarini. “From a log of wood, we saw it transform into a powerful 55-feet mid-sized vessel.”

Chosen from different cadres in the service, the women were trained to be electricians, plumbers, engineers, doctors, chefs, navigators and just about everything. Says Swathi, “It is easy to romanticise the sky, sea and the stars when you are on land. But it is different when you are surrounded by water for days at stretch; here, you are your own caretaker and therefore, you have to be a multi-tasker.”

When they were caught in a storm in the Pacific for 32 hours with nine metre high waves crashing on the boat and on another occasion, when the steering came off, they wondered if they would ever return to their families. But when they sighted dolphins, sperm whales, killer whales, sharks and albatross, they felt jubilant about life. They encountered floating rain clouds that gave them a chance to take an open sky shower, and had a baby albatross on board for two days. “We carried books, movies and songs and celebrated our birthdays and the New Year to keep ourselves motivated,” says Swathi.

The most important takeaways from the expedition are, she says, team strength, humility, and that nothing is impossible when you accept everything in life. Had it not been for the inspiration of Vice Admiral Awati (awarded the Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vir Chakra) who wanted to witness a circumnavigation of the globe by an all-woman team on an Indian-built sailboat, Tarini would not have been born.

“While we were sailing, the 88-year-old man fell ill and was hospitalised a few times, but he held on. When we returned, he said, ‘Now I can die’, and passed away three days later.”

The Serendipitious Six:

Sailed 21,600 nautical miles on board Tarini named after the Tara Tarini Temple in Ganjam district of Odisha, that is worshipped as the breast shrine and manifestation of Adi Shakti.

Crossed seven oceans, the Equator twice and all longitudes.

They survived the three treacherous capes — Cape Leeuwin, Cape Horn and Cape of Good Hope.

Suffered temperatures ranging from 40° and plus to -5° Celsius

Withstood wind speeds up to 140 kmph and nine metres high waves

The voyage that lasted eight months made only four port calls in Freemantle, Australia; Lyttelton, New Zealand; Port Stanley, Falklands and Cape Town, South Africa besides a forced technical halt at Port Louis, Mauritius

Tarini showcased the Make in India initiative of the government and harnessed only wind energy for its movement.

During their journey, the crew collated meteorological data, reported marine life and monitored marine pollution levels.

473,2020/03/16,"And now, dance moves to help wash your hands properly","All over the world, dance routines and pop songs are re-teaching people basic hygiene

Over the weekend, guests at the lobby of GRT Grand Chennai were treated to a flashmob by the staff showing steps to wash hands as they sang ‘We can get no corona infection.”

Even as COVID-19 disrupts numerous plans and the economy, Governments and artistes world over are using music, song and dance to drive home the importance of washing hands..

Classical singer Kavalam Shreekumar from Kerala recently released a three-minute plus song to teach listeners how to avoid corona. The song is mellow and “follows a marching tune,” says Kavalam, adding, “It follows the Thrisra rhythm (beat of three).”

The lyrics, sent to him by Sunil G Cherukoduvu, a police inspector from Thiruvananthapuram, advise people to stay away from crowded places and not withhold information about their travel history. “I recorded it in one day and added the rhythm and background. It had to be done immediately, as it is relevant today,” he says.

One of the earliest music videos that came up on YouTube was the animated ‘Ghen Cô Vy’ (the hand washing song) by the Vietnamese Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health, in collaboration with musicians Khac Hung, Min, and Erik. (It translates into English as the ‘Jealous Coronavirus’ song.)

Vietnamese dancer Quang Dang choreographed a series of moves to go with the catchy song. This, then set off a series of TikTok dance challenges with people showing the right way to wash hands. There are even tutorial videos breaking down each step for you: now, there’s an idea to work on while you practise social distancing for the next few weeks.

The Department of Health of Philippines also put out a dance video of three of its officials demonstrating how to wash hands, maintain a metre distance, adapt cough etiquette and avoid touching their faces. Think: ‘Bole Chudiya’ but for hygiene.

For more classical tunes, hit up Iranian actor Danial Kheirikhah’s Instagram to see him theatrically displaying a hand wash regime, as he goes tough with the space between the fingers, often overlooked by the shortcut handwashers.

In an attempt to teach children, and adults, how to scrub their hands for 20 seconds, we were told to sing ‘Happy birthday’ in our heads twice. But if that is getting tedious, turn to American singer Gloria Gaynor, best known for the disco era hit “I Will Survive.” She has launched an #IWillSurviveChallenge, singing the song while determinedly washing her hands in a TikTok video, with the caption, “It takes only 20 seconds to survive.”

Or listen to Dr Palaniappan Manickam in the US, who in a bid to keep hygiene interesting, has released a now-popular video on social media. Inspired by actor Dhanush, he suggests a colourful alternative: Sing ‘Why this Kolaveri, Kolaveri, Kolaveri Di’ thrice while washing your hands.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/92oxll/article31082711.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17MPDang2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/and-now-dance-moves-to-help-wash-your-hands-properly/article31082712.ece
474,2020/03/16,‘A brand-new world’,"Says author Sarah J Maas for her latest series featuring yet another awesome protagonist

After two YA fantasy series, Throne of Glass and A Court of Thorns and Roses, Sarah J Maas makes her début in adult fantasy with the Crescent City series. The first book of the series, House of Earth and Blood (Bloomsbury) was released on March 3.

The 800-page tome, like Maas’s other books, moves at warp speed following the adventures of Bryce Quinlan. The part-fae, part-human Bryce is a party girl, whose world comes crashing down when her best friend is brutally murdered. In uncovering the truth behind her friend’s death, Bryce unearths a bunch of unsavoury truths and monsters. There is also the dishy fallen angel, Hunt Athalar, to keep Bryce company as she plunges into the various circles of hell or hel as the book spells it.

When asked about the pros and cons of writing a series, the 34-year-old author writes in an email, “The pros are getting to know the characters and the world really well and exploring everything to my heart’s content. The cons are having to keep track of all those things!”

Though Bryce like Celaena Sardothien from the Throne of Glass books, is part fae, Sarah says, The House of Earth and Blood does not inhabit the same universe. “It is a brand-new world,” says the Pennsylvania-based author.

In interviews Sarah has said the Throne of Glass series is a retelling of the Cinderella story (what if Cinderella were an assassin). A Court of Thorns and Roses is said to be a re-imaging of Beauty and the Beast. Sarah says House of Earth and Blood isn’t a retelling of any particular story. “Creatures from various mythologies do make their way into this world.”

The title Sarah says, “Relates to the city the book takes place in, and the four houses the people of their world are divided into.” Envisaged as a trilogy, Sarah says, “There definitely might be room for more.”

The switch to adult fantasy Sarah says is because, “The story called to me, with a protagonist that fit into the adult age range.” Sarah picks Bryce as her favourite character in the series. “She was the character who inspired this series, and is very close to my heart. She still keeps surprising me, which is my favourite kind of character to write.”

Computers and cellphones coexist with the fae, angels and nasty demons in Crescent City. “Again, this was just the world that called to me and appeared in my mind. I can’t quite explain where the ideas come from — it often feels like magic. When Bryce and her world popped into my head, this was how it all appeared.”

The climax of House of Earth and Blood has all the ingredients of a blockbuster — hideous demons pouring out the gates of hell, frenimies taking the last stand and Bryce digging into reserves of strength she did not know she had.

“It was easy in the sense that I had been waiting for years to finally be able to write all of these scenes that had been in my head for so long, and I was super excited to finally do so,” Sarah says. “It was difficult to make sure I was keeping track of everyone and what they were doing, since the characters were all in different places and doing different things.”

With fantasy a great favourite on streaming platforms, Sarah says though the series has not yet been optioned, “I am hoping it will be. I think it would work really well as a television show.”",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/g5vdka/article31082235.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11bgmHouseofearthjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/sarah-j-maas-on-her-latest-series/article31082237.ece
475,2020/03/16,How hardships of early years can shape later life,"Difficult life events have a profound effect on our physical and mental wellbeing in later life, says a study published in the Journal of Public Health.

From being raised by an emotionally cold mother to experiencing violence, war and bereavement, difficult life events have a profound effect on our physical and mental wellbeing in later life, says a study.

The findings, published in the Journal of Public Health, showed how a range of life inequalities and hardships are linked to physical and mental health inequalities in later life.

According to the researchers, these stressful and often heart-breaking life inequalities included having emotionally cold parents, poor educational opportunities, losing an unborn child, financial hardship, involvement in conflict, violence and experiencing a natural disaster.

“We looked at the life history of each participant and compared it to their quality of life and how well they can perform activities like dressing themselves, bathing, preparing hot meals, doing gardening and money management,” said study lead researcher Oby Enwo from University of East Anglia in the U.K.

“We found that people who had suffered many difficult life events were significantly less likely to experience a good quality of life than those who had lived easier lives,” Ms. Enwo said.

“They were three-times more likely to suffer psychiatric problems, twice as likely to be detached from social networks, and twice as likely to have long-standing illness,” she added.

For the findings, the research team studied data taken from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) — a longitudinal study of adults over 50 living in England.

Participants were invited to answer a life history questionnaire. The research team took into account responses from 7,555 participants to questions that represented broad topics in life history.

The researchers grouped the participants to four main groups — those who reported few life events, those with an emotionally cold mother, those who had experienced violence in combat and those who had experienced a number of difficult life events.

Some of these questions were around their upbringing — such as whether a parent had been emotionally cold and the estimated number of books in their home at 10 years old.

Identifying patterns

Other questions focussed on events in adult life — such as whether they had fought in a war or lost an unborn child.

The researchers analysed the responses to identify patterns of life events, and also took into account factors such as age, ethnicity, sex and socioeconomic status.

The research team found that people who experienced the greatest levels of hardship, stress and personal loss were five times more likely to experience a lower quality of life, with significantly more health and physical difficulties in later life.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/iycfxb/article31084545.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-joining-hands,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/how-hardships-of-early-years-can-shape-later-life/article31084546.ece
476,2020/03/16,COVID-19: Immunity boosters you can make at home,"Doctors of traditional medicine like Ayurveda and Siddha suggest immunity-boosting recipes made from commonly found plants

When comic Vir Das put up a Twitter thread asking people about the different ways they are boosting their immunity against coronavirus, one answer got a lot of traction: Chyawanprash. Not a surprise, considering how he pokes fun at Indians’ blind faith in the Ayurvedic health supplement, in his latest Netflix special, Vir Das: For India.

But with cases of COVID-19 on the rise in India, and WHO declaring it a pandemic there is no doubt we need to safeguard ourselves against infections. For this, it’s best to wash hands with soap and water regularly and avoid crowds. In addition, here are some home remedies traditional medicine practitioners recommend, to boost your immunity.

What Ayurveda says

Valsala Varier, chief medical officer at Arya Vaidya Sala Kottakkal, Coimbatore, recommends three immunity-boosting drinks:

Boil a litre of water with 1 tablespoon of dried ginger, 4 teaspoons of coriander seeds and a fistful of fresh tulsi leaves. Strain it and drink

Mix one glass of milk with four glasses of water and add three cloves of garlic in it. Boil it till it is reduced to one glass. Strain it and and drink this instead of tea/coffee.

Add 1 teaspoon each of turmeric powder, asafoetida powder, fenugreek and fennel seeds with a few curry leaves to 500 ml of butter milk and warm it for five minutes. Drink twice or thrice daily.

A glass mug full of hot ginger tea. Isolated on white.

Metabolism also plays an important role in our immunity, adds Varier. “Space your meals in such a way that the first one is completely digested by the time you have your second. Also make your dinner light, like a bowl of salad.” Another important measure is to get enough sleep and prepare the body for the next day. She suggests oil baths twice a week. “Add 100 gm of fenugreek seeds to a litre of oil and bring it to a boil. Once cooled, apply it all over your body and head. Let it soak into the skin for an hour before you bathe.”

Chaithrika GK, who practises Ayurveda at the Institute of Trans-Disciplinary Health Sciences and Technology, recommends this decoction:

Take 10-15 leaves of tulsi, 4-5 of parijata, 4-5 of neem, 6 of bael, and raw turmeric. Crush and boil the paste in one glass, or 250 ml of water, and reduce the solution to half. Add jaggery and cumin powder. Chaithrika recommends that you drink this after breakfast or lunch, and not on an empty stomach. “Having this decoction once a day for a week is enough. Don’t have it for long periods as it may be a burden on the liver.”

Siddha support

Some of the easiest immunity boosters for internal use that Siddha suggests are also the quickest to make. For instance, J Jeyavenkatesh of Kokila Siddha Hospital & Research Centre, Madurai recommends that you heat four to five black pepper corns and one large betel leaf in one litre of water, until it boils. Filter it and drink it through the day. Or tweak your regular glass of butter milk by mixing the paste of 10 curry leaves in it.

The four most commonly available ingredients in any of our kitchens — ginger, garlic, turmeric and small onions — can be added to bolster immunity. Add these to your chutneys, upma or rice.

Naturopathy talk

Rukamani Nair, Bapu Nature Cure Hospital and Yogashram, suggests harvesting half a foot of giloy leaves and boiling it in two glasses of water until this reduces to one. Cool and drink a glass daily.

Eat seasonal fruits and vegetables from your region, as these are packed with the nutrients necessary for the weather.

Lemon juice is packed with vitamin C, but instead of overloading it with sugar, which diminishes immunity over a period, add a teaspoon of honey. If you have diabetes, add cinnamon.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/j6pm3q/article31083335.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16mpjuice,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/immunity-boosters-you-can-make-at-home/article31083337.ece
477,2020/03/16,How people with diabetes can develop diabulimia,"Preoccupied with their physical appearance and need to look thin, some people with diabetes limit or skip insulin doses, developing diabulimia

When someone who has diabetes restricts insulin and binges too, they’re diagnosed with a condition called diabulimia. Though uncommon in our country, this is usually seen in those with type 1 diabetes. Being insulin-dependent, they tweak their prescribed drug dosage to lose weight.

Weight gain is a natural side-effect of insulin, as the constant focus of treating diabetes is on diet and adjustments in insulin levels. Under peer pressure, adolescents and people in their 20s, mostly girls and women preoccupied with their physical appearance and need to look thin, tend to limit or skip insulin doses. This develops diabulimia in them.

The publicity given to the struggles of celebrities (Princess Diana, Britney Spears, Jane Fonda, Lady Gaga) with eating disorder bulimia — where people binge on food and then purge it out either with laxatives or vomiting to control weight — has people more clued into it. But diabulimia is less talked about and under-recognised.

“It finds no mention in medical textbooks,” says Dr Anoop Misra, chairman of Fortis CDOC Hospital for Diabetes and Allied Sciences, Delhi. “People with diabetes cannot use their body sugar for energy. Their increased blood sugars are released in excess in the urine. The insulin injection helps their cells to absorb sugar from the food and maintain a healthy glucose level,” he explains.

“When there is no or less insulin injected, the glucose from the food remains unutilised, forcing the body to break down its fat reserves and cause weight loss,” explains Dr Sudhir R, a diabetologist based in Madurai.

Physicians are often unable to flag those with diabulimia because they do not look unhealthy and also hide the fact that they’re omitting insulin, says Dr Misra. He says diabulimia can render diabetes complications (blindness, amputations) serious, cause ketoacidosis (body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones) and lead to life-threatening situations.

The American Diabetes Association states that 40% of women in the 15-to-30-year age group with diabetes type 1 develop diabulimia.

“Social relationships are important in recovery and those with diabulimia have to be reminded they are not alone. We have to identify what is driving their behaviour and help them to correct themselves,” says Madurai-based psychiatrist, Dr Dheep T.

Anju Sood, a dietician from Bengaluru, says in her career of 25 years, she has seen three cases of bulimia so far and none for diabulimia. She says a collaborative approach to the care of both is needed. “Combining psychological counselling and supervision, proper medical education about insulin, a nutrition plan with right food choices and family support helps in effective treatment.”

478,2020/03/16,Do Indian workplaces need to be more neurodiverse?,"Provided with the right workplace environment, people with cognitive conditions like dyslexia and autism can be an asset to the company, claim neurodiversity advocates

“There’s one type of diversity we’ve spent less time considering: diversity of thought.”

Universal Music UK CEO David Joseph’s words find place in the company’s Creative Differences handbook. Brought out early this year, it sought to address the need to make workplaces more ‘neurodiverse’, kick-starting a conversation around the phrase.

So what is neurodiversity? A growing movement in socio-political and mental health advocacy, it refers to the notion that seemingly ‘impaired’ cognitive features, characteristic of developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, fall into normal human behavioural variations.

What it means

The movement pushes forward the idea that along with autism, other cognitive conditions such as Asperger’s, dyslexia, and dyspraxia among others, are not always impairments or diseases that need to be corrected.

“The term neurodiversity is used by the autism community to distinguish persons with autism from the neurologically typical,” says Merry Barua, Director, Action For Autism (AFA) and the National Centre for Autism in New Delhi. So those falling outside the spectrum become neuro-typical, and not the so-called ‘normal’. “It is based on the understanding that people are neurologically diverse versus being ‘lesser’ or ‘abnormal’.”

Instead, if people with these conditions work in an environment favourable to their personalities, their condition could prove an advantage.

For instance, research has shown that people with autism often outperform others in auditory and visual tasks, and do better on non-verbal tests of intelligence. A study by University of Montreal found that in a test that involved completing a visual pattern, people with autism finished 40% faster than those without the condition.

“Ideally, they would be employed in fields that don’t require constant group meetings, like programming, software developing, scientific research work or music,” says Ritika Aggarwal, consultant psychologist at Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre.

What neurodiverse persons may lack in social skills, they can make up for with other talents such as attention to detail, the ability to stick to a routine, and to recognise patterns. A person with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), for example, can bring in creativity and innovation, and not get tired easily.

“When you bring in these other perspectives to the organisation, your company is more likely to succeed,” she says. It is a way to innovate, and that requires fresh perspectives.

How workplaces can help

The Universal Music UK’s handbook advises making these changes to the workplace environment: use of light background memos that make it easier for people with dyslexia to read, accepting a person’s incapability to be extroverted at social gatherings, and so on.

“For companies to be accommodating of neurodiversity, they can make accommodations in their job interviews. Such as having the job applicant with autism demonstrate work skills that she is being interviewed for, rather than asking her where she sees herself 10 years later (something that might be difficult for someone on the spectrum to answer),” says Merry.

Other accommodations such as providing flexible work hours, and giving instructions in writing over email or voice recording can also help. “Managers need to have frank conversations with their employees about their expectations. Sarcasm and passive hints could be hard to understand for them,” adds Aggarwal.

She further says that there are NGOs who work in tie-ups with certain companies to train neurodiverse people for hiring. The hospitality sector in India has seen many such employees.

Ruby Singh’s Assisted Living For Autistic Adults in Bengaluru has been helping people with autism get hired in workplaces for over a decade now. In her experience, Ruby finds that people with autism get disturbed with sensory overload. That could mean maintaining a low-noise and fragrance-free environment. “Offices can allow neurodiverse employees to play light music, or use headphones while working. They can build corners where employees can go when they need to calm down.”

But perhaps the most important of all is educating other neuro-typical employees of the needs of the neurodiverse ones. Aggarwal recalls one of her clients who had to deal with corporate jealousy, and allegations of favouritism. “He needed to wear headphones to concentrate, but as a principle, the others did not. So one of his colleagues complained to their manager, and the manager had to explain the situation to him.”

You could even employ a buddy system, explains Aggarwal, “It would help someone who gets too involved in their work, and forgets to take breaks. Their buddy could call this person along if he is going to have coffee. Basically make the person feel like he is part of the group.”

The very question whether a neurodiverse person is too low functioning for a job comes from the kind of prism through which neurodiverse people are viewed, believes Merry. “I would do terribly if I were placed in a job in the IT sector. No one would presume that therefore women, or Bengalis, or Indians are not suited to IT. All of which I am,” she says. “We have to first get rid of our assumptions about neurodiversity, and find the right person for the right job based on individual strengths and interests.”",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/o4i0hp/article31083210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16mplead1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/do-indian-workplaces-need-to-be-more-neurodiverse/article31083213.ece
479,2020/03/16,"Coronavirus | Testing is the easiest thing to do, says community health expert Gagandeep Kang","Early detection will reduce number needing intensive care, the director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute says.

Gagandeep Kang, Director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, who has extensive experience in working on community health and played a key role in developing an indigenous rotavirus vaccine, says India should be testing many more persons for symptoms of COVID-19 than it is now.

Is India testing for community transmission as aggressively as it should?

No. As a first step, India has been tracing importations (cases with a travel history from abroad). We are now beginning to test for influenza-like illnesses through the influenza surveillance network.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

We are told that about 150-250 samples were tested in February by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) and in the coming week they are going to be doing moreof that testing. Singapore went about finding cases and tracking them. Finding contacts and tracing was the best step. South Korea expanded drive-through testing. After a while people started to present themselves for testing. It was made easy for people to get tested. We are in a situation now that if you land up at a private hospital with what absolutely fits the case definition, you will be referred to a government hospital. There are media reports that some in Tamil Nadu are being turned away even if they have symptoms and a travel history.

Is it that Indian authorities would like to do much more community testing, but cannot? Or is it part of a larger strategy to wait and gradually ramp up testing?

Newspaper reports suggest that the health ministry says it has done a risk assessment and the testing strategy in place follows from this assessment. Now what that assessment is, we don't know. We don't know, for instance, if there's a plan that once we reach an 'x' number of positive cases there will be a different approach to testing. We are today at over a 100 cases. What we can do is be rational and test as many as we can. What is wrong with testing? Why would you not test? If a person know what's causing their fever and cough, you can do something about it. You are now in a situation where people worry, they don't know if they are positive. They wait till they get really severe. Then they eventually go to a public hospital and get tested. You are expanding your timeline and decreasing your chances of picking up cases early. In a best case scenario, all this testing is unnecessary and what you are doing now is perfect. But even then, what have you lost by doing additional testing? You've wasted some money on kits, you've wasted some people's time but you've bought reassurance that the virus isn't there. If it's there, then you have to do something about it. You can do contact tracing and then recommend quarantining or isolation or whatever's appropriate for that person.

Also read: Comment | India needs all hands on deck

But the fact remains that we have only 63 diagnostic centres...

Detection requires a real-time PCR. We have thousands of real time PCR setups in the country. ( A PCR or polymerase chain reaction test is DNA-based and allows can quickly tell if someone harbours the virus) We have several microbiology labs and several accredited medical testing laboratories in the country, Most of them have real-time PCRs and quality systems in place. In the H1N1 outbreak of 2009-10, the government called in private labs. It trained them, evaluated them and said, 'Ok, now go ahead and test.' Dr. Dang's laboratories went through the H1N1 training process as a private laboratory and they certainly have the capacity and infrastructure to test for coronavirus. And there are several other labs.

Also read: How is India containing COVID-19?

Is it a matter of government policy today that private labs aren't allowed to test for coronavirus?

Yes. But what’s this policy based on —voluntary risk assessment or information on the lack of quality in the private health care system?

This is the first pandemic in a post-Whatsapp world. Information and mis-information travels rapidly. Has the availability of information improved trust, or only whetted panic? Have government communication systems improved?

The panic is greater, yes. (compared to H1N1). People don't know who to trust and, in such situations, information can almost be dangerous. If you think that gaumutra or gobar (cow urine and cow dung) baths are going to help you, you are going to be falsely confident of being protected.

We must ponder, for instance, why isn't Hongkong or Singapore panicking? Maybe they had with SARS (in 2002-03) and now have learnt their lessons. Those were two cities worst affected by SARS and South Korea has seen a MERS outbreak and handled it well. Is it because of the smaller settings, or that governments have learned how to communicate, Is it because they are East Asian and therefore more accustomed to doing what government says? Many countries have learnt that governments have a key role, and do, and that they can be proactive. South Korea's initiative of drive-through testing (of people driving up to mobile testing centres) is remarkably innovative. Imagine, if we could offer the same in India, or like we now administer polio drops, the kind of confidence in government that would build? Our government got the airport screening off the ground, and is using media and communications to reassure and direct people, but there is a lot more we can do.

Why don't we do that? Are these diagnostic tests expensive, or too costly to rapidly scale up?

Yes, they are expensive. However it’s a matter of scale. Once you say that we need millions of these tests, the costs will come down and any company that must test for a million,or even a billion people, will offer them at rock-bottom prices.

Why isn't it happening?

There is a lot of evidence to show that, in general, we test way below what we should be doing. There are less than 10,000 tests being done on our population of 1.3 billion. If your strategy for testing is to approach only a tiny fraction of the population how do you know when we are moving to the next stage? Maybe it’s in the strategy that I don’t yet know about. Given that i have some experience in public health, I would expand testing to much beyond the influenza network. I would do more of what South Korea and Singapore are doing. If a clinician thinks, that a test is required, do the test. Screen everybody on the case definition. Test all patients with pneumonias. Test patients who come to primary care centres with influenza-like illnesses. Maybe it won’t help. As I said earlier, if it’s all negative that’s fantastic.

Countries have been able to rapidly prepare diagnostic tests based on isolating gene sequences and through depositing it in global databases. But are we closer to shortening vaccine-development times, or developing newer effective drugs compared to a decade ago?

We have made great progress in developing new products, new modelling techniques, high-throughput screening (approaches to determine what chemical compounds may be effective against certain viruses or bacteria), using artificial intelligence. That's definitely improved in the last 10 years. What's not changed is the regulatory system and the system of testing these products in human beings. How do we convince regulators, who are responsible for safety and efficacy of potential drugs and vaccines, to take more risk? They are doing their job, which is to protect populations. They don't want to get stuff out that doesn't work and is unsafe. But we need to relook processes and allow concurrent testing instead of phased testing. You shouldn't wait to finish one study to move to the next study. Is it possible to combine steps? Could you embed regulators in product development teams? There could be all kinds of issues (eg conflict of interest) however if we want rapid response—the technology is available—it's the clinical and regulatory process that needs to look at how we can design studies, so that they are the safest kind possible.

Will quickly escalating diagnostic testing lead to lot more cases being detected and overwhelm our health care network? Would it be reasonable to spend funds instead on increasing ventilators, having more beds because health care systems in the United States, Italy appear overwhelmed by insufficient resources?

First, it’s impossible to quickly train people to run those ventilators. Testing is the easiest thing to do.

The aim is to decrease overall numbers and testing will help with that and decrease the overall number that will require ICU care because you will identify cases early. The bulk of cases are not going to hospitals but many of them are wandering around in communities and spreading disease, if you can test and get them out of the system by quarantining them and trace contacts, you will decrease the overall burden on the health care system. That’s the so called ‘flattening of the curve’ that everybody’s talking about. You are decreasing transmission by removing the opportunities to transmit.

There’s an impression gaining currency that India is seeing fewer cases because the average Indian is exposed to an array of viruses and infectious agents on a regular basis and we may have developed some level of immunity?

There’s a study, in Cell, this week that looked at SARS and SARS Cov-2 (the virus responsible for the current pandemic) and suggests based on studies in mice, that antibodies produced during SARS may protect against SARS Cov-2.

So it’s plausible?

Well it’s based on evidence but you’ll need lot more studies to establish any link. However the larger story about Indians being resistant because they are exposed to a lot more bugs, is just not right. Indians have a lot of antibodies against seasonal coronaviruses (that cause the common cold). There are four coronaviruses that circulate in India all the time. But it's possible to be reinfected by those same viruses frequently and clearly those antibodies aren't protecting.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/e11ezd/article31075740.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15GAGANDEEP,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-testing-is-the-easiest-thing-to-do-gagandeep-kang/article31075741.ece
