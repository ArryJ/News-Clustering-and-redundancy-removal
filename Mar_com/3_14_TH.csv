World champion P.V. Sindhu was on Friday ousted from the All England Championship after being outlasted by a determined Nozomi Okuhara of Japan who rallied her way to a thrilling three-game win in the quarterfinals.

The 24-year-old Indian squandered a sparkling start as Okuhara produced a rearguard action to overcome Sindhu 12-21, 21-15, 21-13 in a 68-minute last-eight encounter at the Arena Birmingham. Sindhu’s defeat ended India’s campaign at the Super 1000 tournament.

Sindhu had come into the match with a 9-7 head-to-head record against Okuhara, having demolished the Japanese in the finals of the 2019 World Championships.

The Indian began the contest with the same intensity, quickly moving to a 3-0 lead and swelling the advantage to 7-2 with a precise shot at the backline.

The Japanese narrowed the gap to 5-8 before Sindhu unleashed a shot at the back and grabbed another point when Okuhara found the net.

Sindhu entered the break with a five-point cushion. The Indian continued to dominate the proceedings after the breather, putting her opponent under pressure and gathering points at will.

Pulling ahead

Okuhara won a few points with her straight and cross-court smashes, but those were too few as Sindhu zoomed to 18-9.

With Okuhara’s weak returns going to the net, Sindhu had a massive 20-11 advantage. The Indian quickly sealed the opening game when Okuhara erred again.

After the change of sides, Okuhara showed more intent, employing a low service and tried to put Sindhu on the back foot. It worked as she took a 5-2 lead. The Japanese engaged Sindhu in fierce rallies and forced her to make errors to lead 7-3.

A couple of unforced errors from Okuhara helped Sindhu to narrow the gap. A cross-court shot and return of serve helped Sindhu keep it to 8-10 before Okuhara entered the mid-game interval with a three-point lead.

Okuhara didn’t let the momentum slip after the break as Sindhu failed to keep pace in the rallies. The result was that the Japanese jumped to a 16-9 lead in no time.

With Sindhu going long twice, Okuhara led 18-10 and soon roared back into the contest when the Indian found the net after saving three game points.

In the decider, Okuhara continued to dictate the pace of the rallies, leading 5-2 early on. The Japanese didn’t allow Sindhu to attack, reducing the Indian to playing the retrieving game.

Stunning return

A stunning return to Sindhu’s forehand gave Okuhara an 8-3 lead. The lightning-quick Okuhara left Sindhu frustrated with her speed and placement as she grabbed an 11-5 advantage at the interval.

Errors continued to pile up for the Indian as Okuhara pulled away to a 16-7 lead. Sindhu missed the lines and found the net too often, allowing Okuhara to move to 19-11. The Japanese sealed the match when Sindhu committed another error.

On Thursday, Sindhu had cruised into the quarterfinals with a 21-19, 21-15 win over Sung Ji Hyun of Korea.

In women’s doubles second round, Ashwini Ponnappa and N. Sikki Reddy came up short against Japan’s Matsutomo and Ayaka Takahashi, losing 13-21, 14-21.

2,2020/03/14,How to clean the bundle of germs that is on your phone,"Tests done by scientists show that the virus can live for two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cleaning all “high-touch” surfaces daily, including phones, keyboards and tablet computers.

You’re washing your hands countless times a day to try to ward off the coronavirus.

You should also wash that extension of your hand and breeding ground for germs - your phone. Tests done by scientists show that the virus can live for two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cleaning all “high-touch” surfaces daily, including phones, keyboards and tablet computers.

But cleaning your phone improperly can damage it. You want to avoid getting moisture inside it or scratching the surface. Don’t spray cleaners directly on the phone, don’t dunk it in cleaning solutions, don’t spray it with compressed-air devices used to clean keyboards and avoid rubbing it with abrasive materials.

Instead, start by turning off the phone and unplugging all cables. Your phone shouldn’t be charging as you clean.

You can use Clorox wipes or wipes with 70% alcohol, which you can get at the drugstore, to wipe down your phone. Apple, which has cautioned against using household cleaners on its phones, says to do that “gently.” AT&T has further recommended wringing out disinfectant wipes before using them on a phone.

You can also use soft cloths to clean the phone, like a microfiber cleaning cloth or the cloths used to clean camera lenses or your glasses. Google says you can dip the cloth in soap and water, as long as you’re careful not to get moisture in the phone. AT&T says paper towels work, too. You can spray them with disinfectant. Again, don’t spray the phone itself.

Samsung, the world’s biggest phone manufacturer, says it’s offering a free phone-sanitizing service involving UV light inside U.S. Samsung stores and service centers. It will expand to other countries in the next few weeks.

The phone-cleaning step is one of many measures public-health authorities are recommending to try to slow the spread of the virus, which has infected 137,000 people worldwide. More than 5,000 have died. Most patients have only mild or moderate symptoms, but the elderly and people with existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/yhmrte/article31068273.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THSMARTPHONE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/how-to-clean-the-bundle-of-germs-that-is-on-your-phone/article31068274.ece

After White House officials took the unprecedented step of checking the temperatures of journalists entering the briefing room, Mr. Trump told reporters he took a test for the virus on Friday night and that he expects the results in “a day or two days.” He met with a Brazilian delegation last week, at least one member of which has since tested positive.

The top U.S. infectious diseases expert, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, said the country has recorded 20,226 cases of COVID-19, but has not yet reached the peak of the outbreak.

“This will get worse before it gets better,” Surgeon General Jerome Adams said at the briefing.

Several Iraqi air defence servicemen were critically wounded on Saturday as multiple rockets hit a military base which houses U.S.-led coalition troops, in the second such strike in a week, the Iraqi military said. The U.S.-led coalition said three of its troops and two Iraqi soldiers were wounded in the attack.

Iraq’s Joint Operations Command said 33 Katyusha rockets were launched near a section of the Taji base which houses coalition troops. It said the military found seven rocket launchers and 24 unused rockets in the nearby Abu Izam area.

The military said it would arrest those responsible. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack which, unlike recent similar attacks, took place in daylight hours.

A similar rocket attack on Wednesday on Taji, 20 km north of Baghdad, killed two U.S. troops and a British soldier, prompting Washington to launch retaliatory air strikes on Thursday which killed six Iraqis.

7,2020/03/14,"A year later, New Zealand Muslims still feel unsafe","Rhetoric of hate is on the rise again, say community members in Christchurch

Aliya Danzeisen rises before dawn every day to hear the news so she can prepare her school-age daughters for any harassment they may face for being Muslim.

“We don’t feel any safer,” the Muslim community leader says, reflecting on the 12 months since the Christchurch mosque attacks, in which a self-declared white supremacist killed 51 Muslims at Friday prayers.

The abuse experienced prior to the attacks on March 15 last year died down immediately after the killings, Ms. Danzeisen said, adding: “It felt the entire New Zealand population was rallying behind us.” But she says it is now on the rise again, a year on from the killings. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern — who received widespread praise for her handling of the aftermath of the massacre — admitted Friday there was “much more” her country could do to tackle white supremacists.

Anjum Rahman, co-founder of the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand said there was an “undercurrent or rhetoric of hate... it isn’t just our community, we see it a lot in online hate (towards) the transgender community. “I wouldn't say it’s specifically just us, but we’re feeling it.”

Ms. Danzeisen, a former corporate lawyer in the U.S. who moved to New Zealand 14 years ago, said she believes the support shown to Muslims in the immediate aftermath of the shooting “surprised those in the fringe supremacist movements”.

“As a result it’s made them more defensive and more vitriolic, they’ve become louder,” she said. The impact spreads beyond New Zealand. At the Al Noor mosque, Jabara Akhter Juti said her family in Bangladesh remain “very concerned about me” since she moved to Christchurch last year with her husband.

The imam at Al Noor, Gamal Fouda, wanted the broader impact of extremism addressed and not just confined to Muslims.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday declared a national emergency and announced a $50 billion package, with similar measures being taken by governments from Austria to Canada on Saturday. The President’s 30-day ban on travellers from Europe also came into effect on Saturday.

European nations, meanwhile, ramped up border controls on Saturday, with foreigners forbidden from crossing into Russia from Norway and Poland. Denmark and the Czech Republic also announced stringent restrictions.

Squares and streets from Milan to Madrid were deserted on Saturday as government calls to stay at home were heeded by most — some Italians took to singing to each other from their windows to beat the social isolation, others organised rounds of applause.

14,2020/03/14,Virus poses new challenges to New Delhi’s U.S. policy,"Outbreak has weakened Trump, whom India is betting on

The outbreak of COVID-19 across the U.S., taking the administration of President Donald Trump by complete surprise, could inflict the ongoing campaign for the presidential election scheduled for November. This could also have an impact on India-U.S. ties, if the crisis cuts short the Trump presidency to a single term.

The crisis has put the focus sharply on issues that animate politics in the U.S. It exposed the vulnerabilities of the country’s healthcare system that is dependent on its profiteering private sector; its extremely ruthless employment conditions that make it difficult for people to take sick leave; and a wider range of questions regarding the globally distributed manufacturing models that undercut American workers.

How deeply susceptible is the superpower to unpredictable global events beyond its control, and how the country’s political and economic model might exacerbate this weakness have been part of America’s public discourse through the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis. The current public health crisis could influence the debate further.

One has to see how this alters the complexion of the Democratic primary contest between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, and the winner’s face-off with Mr. Trump in November. Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders offer two distinctively different critiques of globalisation — the former wants a mercantilist global order, while the latter advocates a dismantling of the trade system that exploits American workers and wants the creation of a social security system for the country. Mr. Biden is the torch-bearer of the neoliberal global order.

Lack of grip

Mr. Trump appeared invincible until a fortnight ago as the economy was looking up and the stock market was on a sustained upward climb. His approval ratings were high. After the public display of his lack of grip over administrative matters, and the stock market thrown into a tail spin, the President’s characteristic ability to blow his own trumpet is now merely jarring. Trump loyalists have figured that the virus is politically life-threatening for them, and have already launched their response — targeting China and topping up their nationalist rhetoric.

Mr. Biden has raced far ahead of Mr. Sanders by uniting establishment Democrats, but the latter will certainly repackage his democratic socialism against the backdrop of the current crisis and give a final push for his candidacy. Either of them will be a credible challenge to Mr. Trump.

If a Democrat wins the White House, India’s U.S. policy, which is now riding on the presumption of Mr. Trump’s invincibility, will be thrown into disarray as much as his rise did in 2016.

The two Democrats in the field have widely diverging viewpoints about the world order, but both share a distaste for India’s Hindutva nationalism. If it is Mr. Biden who wins the nomination, he will have to accommodate a substantial part of Mr. Sanders’s platform ahead of the general election.

The Indian government’s unsophisticated confrontation with the Democrats and the carping of U.S.-based Hindutva groups against them could come back to bite in the event of a change of guard in the White House.

In any case, teetering on the brink of senility, Mr. Biden as President will merely echo the Democratic playbook on South Asia, human rights and communalism in India.

After 24-hour-long talks between the two sides failed to reach an understanding, both leaders went ahead holding separate swearing-in ceremonies, to the dismay of many Afghans who have seen a sharp rise in violence in the country’s conflict in recent years. Five months after conducting the presidential elections that saw a record law turnout amid threats of violence, the Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan announced results last month, saying Mr. Ghani won 50.64% of the vote, or 9,23,592 ballots, while Mr. Abdullah received 39.52%, or 7,20,841 votes. Mr. Abdullah rejected the results and declared himself the real winner.

Many Afghans fear that this political deadlock could affect the already delayed intra-Afghan peace talks with the Taliban and add to the growing political instability.

On February 29, the U.S. signed a deal with the Taliban that will provide for the withdrawal of foreign troops. The deal also seeks intra-Afghan talks between the Taliban and the government in Kabul. “This two-government ceremony is very worrying,” shared a 45-year-old property dealer in Kabul, who identified himself as Homayun. “I am sitting here and watching it closely and I am scared for the future of our country,” he said from his office in west Kabul that has not seen much business in recent years. “The economy is in its worst shape, violence is increasing.”

For many others, the dispute was reminiscent of the 2014 crisis, when the same leaders clashed over the election results. The deadlock was resolved after the then U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, brokered a power-sharing deal between the two. Mr. Ghani became the President of a unity government and Mr. Abdullah its Chief Executive under the agreement. “I cannot accept either as the President after this show two ceremonies,” said Mohammad Rashid, a 29-year-old butcher from Kabul. “They both had the opportunity to work together in the last five years and they achieved nothing.”

The U.S. has condemned the parallel government. Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S.’s special envoy to Afghanistan who had been negotiating between the two Afghan rivals, attended President Ghani’s inauguration ceremony. “We strongly oppose any action to establish a parallel government and any use of force to resolve political differences,” Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, said in a statement the same day. “The U.S.-Taliban Agreement and the U.S.-Afghanistan Joint Declaration create a historic opportunity. Prioritising an inclusive government and unified Afghanistan is paramount for the future of the country and particularly for the cause of peace.”

No compromise

However, neither of the parties is willing to compromise this time. “According to our Constitution, the President is elected based on securing more than 50% votes, which our State Builder team (President Ghani’s team) received and he was declared winner by election authorities,” said Basir Mohammadi, a close aide of Vice-President Amrullah Saleh, and a member of Mr. Saleh’s Green Trend party.

“The former Chief Executive’s claim of fraud is totally baseless, because the electoral officers at IEC (Independent Election Commission) and the ECC (Election Complaints Commission) were selected by all 18 presidential candidates, including Mr. Abdullah. He is claiming fraud against the officials he himself appointed,” argued Mr. Mohammadi.

Despite the formation of parallel governments, both sides continue to talk to resolve the crisis. “President Ghani’s team is negotiating and wants to accommodate him [Abdullah] and his allies,” Mr. Mohammadi confirmed, adding that the eventual settlement between the two will not be be a power-sharing deal or another national unity government. “Our team is trying to accommodate him somewhere because we want to have a unified voice at the negotiation table with the Taliban,” he said.

Meanwhile, Afghans remain deeply concerned over the future of their country. “Aside from them [Ghani and Abdullah], the Taliban also claims to be the leaders of this country, so why should they talk to any of them,” said Mr. Rashid, the butcher from Kabul.

16,2020/03/14,Abe’s political legacy is at stake,"An impending economic crisis and the possibility of Olympics being cancelled are staring at the PM

Everyone is familiar with road rage but in Japan these days it is unmasked coughing-provoked rage that is grabbing the headlines. As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to grow, there have been several incidents on usually quiescent Tokyo trains of commuters getting incensed with unmasked coughers. Brawls have ensued and in one case, the emergency button of a train was pushed, bringing it to a halt and causing a delay of three minutes — which in Japan is the equivalent of social collapse.

Japan has had a seesaw relationship with the novel coronavirus. After weeks of being criticised for botching up the quarantine of the Diamond Princess, a cruise-ship with hundreds of infected passengers on board, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sprang into action in late February, announcing a surprise nationwide school closure. He has since rushed through legislation that will allow him to declare a state of emergency, if needed. This would enable the government to order residents to stay indoors, close public facilities, expropriate land and buildings for medical facilities and request or order emergency transport of goods.

Although Mr. Abe has stressed that he will only declare an emergency as a last resort, the school closure already has parents across the archipelago scrambling to balance childcare with work commitments.

Japan’s work culture stresses face time and long hours. Many companies are not equipped mentally to re-envisage these patterns by incorporating teleworking or flexi-time. The school closure has predictably hit women, who shoulder the majority of responsibility for children, the hardest. The decision has met push-back from critics, including those accusing it of inherent gender bias. “The government has no idea what it’s like to raise children,” one mother complained. Mr. Abe’s 20-member Cabinet only has two women in it. Mr. Abe has announced an emergency spending package to ease the burden on irate employees who must take time off from work to look after their children. Small businesses that introduce telecommuting will also receive a subsidy, according to the plan. Details of the package and of the manner of its disbursement are, however, still awaited.

The actual numbers in Japan are not explosive. There were just over 400 cases reported, excluding the cases from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. However, it is widely acknowledged that the actual numbers are probably much higher. Although the Japanese government has said it has the capacity to carry out 3,800 tests a day, only about 21,000 tests had been conducted as of March 10, according to the Health Ministry. In contrast, neighbouring South Korea had conducted over 2,10,000 tests by the same date.

A strong foe

Despite Mr. Abe’s belated muscularity in confronting COVID-19, the virus is proving a strong foe. A state visit by China’s President, Xi Jinping, which was to have been a crowning achievement of Mr. Abe’s geopolitical strategy by helping stabilise Tokyo’s rocky relationship with Beijing, has been postponed.

Worse, the Olympic Games that Tokyo is to host in the summer might be postponed or even cancelled. The Olympics were a chance for Japan to wow the world with a counter-stereotype image of an open and increasingly multicultural society. They have also been very expensive to prepare for. A report by SMBC Nikko Securities estimates that a cancellation of the Games would reduce Japan’s annual GDP by 1.4%.

Even if the Games are only postponed, Japan is in economic hot water, not least because of its reliance on Chinese tourism. Last year, the country hosted 31.9 million foreign visitors, about 9.5 million of whom were big-spending Chinese. Visitors from China accounted for more than 37% of tourist spending, according to Japan Tourism Agency data. But Mr. Abe, belatedly according to critics, has instituted border controls that effectively ban tourists from China and South Korea through the end of March by invalidating millions of visas.

While it is unclear how effective Mr. Abe’s measures, like the school closure, will prove in containing the spread of COVID-19, what is more clear is the Prime Minister’s motivation in acting tough: his political legacy is at stake.

The Japanese Prime Minister is in the last lap of his premiership and he does not want to go down as the leader who presided over a pandemic, cancelled Olympic Games and economic recession — all of which are possibilities under present circumstances.

17,2020/03/14,"Venezuela on menu, COVID-19 in the air","An aide of the Brazil President present at the Bolsonaro-Trump summit has tested positive

It was supposed to be a meeting of minds of two clans — directed at a common enemy. The groundwork had been done well. Before flying to Florida on March 6 for a dinner with Donald Trump, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro had called back all his diplomatic staff from Venezuela. His government had also told Venezuelan diplomats on its soil to go back to Caracas. A few hours later, the U.S. President was talking excitedly about the meeting at his resort. “Let’s have dinner in Mar-a-Lago. He wanted to have dinner in Florida,” Mr. Trump said.

Full coverage on COVID-19

The dinner was a perfect photo-op for Mr. Trump and Mr. Bolsonaro, a self-declared fan of “my friend Trump”, to show their bromance by sitting next to each other, hugging and shaking hands many times. Also present on the table, besides top aides, were Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka and Brazilian Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, the third son of Brazilian President, who is widely seen as de facto Foreign Minister of the country. On the menu, besides the lavish spread, was Venezuela as the two leaders discussed the ways to topple Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The photos coming out of Mar-a-Lago on a barrage of tweets last Saturday projected two leaders standing for “freedom” in this hemisphere. On Wednesday, when Mr. Bolsonaro returned home after becoming the first Brazilian President to visit the U.S. Southern Command, he declared his trip a huge success. Mr. Trump did the same. Both leaders, facing political challenges at home, projected a joint front against a common enemy — Venezuela.

Things went off script within hours of Mr. Bolsonaro landing back in Brasilia as Fábio Wajngarten, the President’s Communications Secretary who was present at the Mar-a-Lago dinner, was suspected of having COVID-19. “Three other members of the delegation to Mr. Trump’s resort have flu-like symptoms,” said an official on Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity. On Thursday, as Mr. Wajngarten, who had denied having the virus, tested positive at a Sao Paulo hospital, panic set in Brasilia. Mr. Wajngarten was not only present at the Trump dinner, he had been snapped standing next to the U.S. President.

A period of extreme difficulty

On his return from the U.S., when Mr. Bolsonaro was asked about the growing number of COVID-19 patients in Brazil (so far 98 confirmed cases), he responded by calling it a “fantasy” propagated by the media. This Trump-like response, who had also called the virus a “hoax” two weeks back, set the alarm bells ringing in the medical community.

On Wednesday night, Brazil’s Health Minister Luiz Mandetta was begging with the Congress to release $1 billion to fight the disease. “We can face a period of extreme difficulty as Brazilians are still playing with the virus, treating it like a joke,” the Minister said in exasperation.

The joke turned surreal on Thursday when it was announced that Mr. Bolsonaro himself would be tested for the virus. On Friday noon, the local media reported that the President had “tested positive”. Then Fox News confirmed that the Brazilian leader had indeed tested positive. A few hours later, Mr. Bolsonaro appeared on his social media, claiming he had tested negative and that the media was “spreading fake news”. This sparked an unlikely war of words between Fox and the Bolsonaro clan. “After telling @FoxNews that his father had a preliminary POSITIVE test for coronavirus, Eduardo Bolsonaro now tells @FoxNews the test was NEGATIVE. Bolsonaro says has been in touch with the White House,” tweeted John Roberts, Fox’s White House correspondent.

With the President making light of the whole situation with his tweets, the country’s doctors are in a state of shock. “As per our prediction, more than 45,000 people can be infected with the virus in four months in the metropolitan region of São Paulo. We may need 10,000 beds in ICU. We are losing precious time in mindless jokes,” said a top physician at the Albert Einstein Hospital, Sao Paulo. “We are stressed with such small number of cases. If the number jumps, we are not prepared.”

There are warnings from medical officials that the number of infected people will spike in the coming weeks. On Friday night, a Senator and Brazil’s Charge d’Affairs in Washington, who both had dinner with Mr. Trump and Mr. Bolsonaro, tested positive for the virus. Later, it was reported that Brazil’s Health Minister has asked Mr. Bolsonaro to take a third test in the next few days to confirm if he was infected or not. Mr. Bolsonaro — and probably Mr. Trump — would be holding their breath till the result comes back.

18,2020/03/14,Coronavirus: Sri Lanka bans public events as cases rises to 8,"Director General of Health Services Dr Anil Jasinghe said two more cases of COVID-19 were identified on Saturday

Sri Lanka on Saturday cancelled all public events and gatherings for two weeks as the number of coronavirus cases in the country rose to eight, the health minister said.

Director General of Health Services Dr Anil Jasinghe said two more cases of COVID-19 were identified on Saturday.

Health Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi said that all public events stand cancelled for a period of two weeks as a measure to help the authorities with curbing the spread of the virus.

“We have decided to cancel all public events and gatherings for two weeks,” Ms. Wanniarachchi said.

The ministry of culture said all cinemas would remain shut until further notice.

On Friday, the Sri Lankan government announced that travellers from a number of European capitals would not be allowed to enter the country in view of the growing threat.

“They will not be allowed if they had visited the designated countries during the last two weeks,” a senior Colombo international airport official said.

France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, the Netherlands and Austria are included in the list.

At least four Polish nationals, who had arrived at the airport to leave the country, were taken to hospital for observations, authorities said.

The prison authorities said that all inmates will be limited to one visitor during the visit hours. The schools and universities remain closed.

Rwanda has confirmed its first case of coronavirus, an Indian citizen who arrived in the East African nation from Mumbai on March 8, the Health Ministry said on Saturday.

He had no symptoms on arrival but presented himself to a health facility on March 13, the ministry said. Rwanda is the 19th African nation to report the presence of coronavirus.

“He is currently under treatment in stable condition, isolated from other patients,” the ministry said. “The tracing of all contacts has been conducted for further management.”

RwandAir, Rwanda’s national airline, announced it was suspending all flights to India until April 30 and would refund customers.

Africa had until now largely been spared the rapid spread of COVID-19, which has infected at least 127,000 people and killed 4,700 worldwide.

Mayors of Metro Manila's 16 cities announced nighttime curfews on Saturday and urged shopping malls to close for one month, in a bid to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, as the Philippines reported its eighth death.

The Philippines' health department on Saturday confirmed three new fatalities, including a patient in southern Philippines, bringing the total number of deaths to eight.

President Rodrigo Duterte has raised the country's health emergency status to the highest level and issued quarantine measures in the capital, home to at least 12 million people.

All the measures in the Philippine capital, if implemented fully, would be among the strictest in place in Asia, and come as European countries and the United States battle to contain a pandemic that has killed more than 5,000 worldwide.

“To limit the spread of the virus, we need to limit the movement of people. We are slowing down the movement of people in Metro Manila,” Jose Arturo Garcia, general manager of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, told a news conference.

Some of the capital's residents flocked to bus stations and airports ahead of the travel ban that will start Sunday.

The president on Thursday issued land and air travel restrictions to and from the capital that will take effect on March 15, and extended school closures to April 12.

The nighttime curfew will take effect on March 15 to April 14, but some employees will be exempt, Garcia said, adding that violators will not be reprimanded and not arrested.

Mayors will issue local ordinances for the temporary closure of malls and establishments, exempting shops offering essential services like groceries, banks and pharmacies. The capital is home to sprawling shopping malls, some of which are among the largest in the world.

21,2020/03/14,Coronavirus | Guterrres orders all non essential UN HQ staff to telecommute,"The telecommunication directive will come into force on Monday and be in effect for four weeks till April 12 and after three weeks the UN will asses the need for continuing it, he said in a note to correspondents.

A day after a UN diplomat was reported positive for the coronavirus, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has ordered all staff at the headquarters to telecommute unless their presence was required for essential services, according to his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric.

He said that Mr. Guterres took the decision “to step up precautionary measures at UN Headquarters to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus”.

The telecommunication directive will come into force on Monday and be in effect for four weeks till April 12 and after three weeks the UN will asses the need for continuing it, he said in a note to correspondents.

“It is essential that we reduce social contact to a minimum and follow the clear instructions of the World Health Organisation to minimize the risks of transmitting the infection,” he said.

The Philippines mission to the UN had reported that one of its diplomats had tested positive for COVID-19.

The diplomat had visited the UN headquarters on Monday for a meeting.

Two teachers at the UN International School, which is located at a different location, have also tested positive for coronavirus and the parents of the children there had been asked by the UN to telecommute for two weeks, Mr. Dujarric said earlier at his daily briefing.

Mr. Dujarric had said that if the UN headquarters were to scale back staff presence, “what is important and to remember is that the UN’s work will continue. We will continue to support peacekeeping operations. We will continue to support our humanitarian operations”.

Earlier this week, Mr. Guterres ordered all but the charter-mandated meetings of the UN at the headquarters cancelled till the end of April and also asked countries to drop their side events.

The Security Council and the General Assembly will have to make their own decision on whether to meet physically or use some form of a cyber—meeting.

If they need to hold meetings, “we will support them in whatever way we can”, Mr. Dujarric said.

“Critical meetings of the Security Council to renew mandates, critical meetings of the Budget Committee to approve budgets” will have to be held,” he added.

The Security Council held a test of a cybermeeting on Monday as a backup should the UN building be entirely shut down.

China’s Permanent Representative Zhang Jun, who is the Security Council President for this month, said that its 15 delegations have been asked to “scale down” participation by reducing the number of those attending the meeting.

The UN is taking several steps to be prepared if the headquarters complex has to be shut down and provisions have been made for key staff to operate remotely, Mr. Dujarric said.

He had said that he was himself equipped to run the daily briefings from his living room.

But at the Friday briefing he said: “We have raised this issue to make sure that resident correspondents are considered critical personnel,” to have access to the building.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ddc42a/article30887672.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANTONIOGUTERRES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-guterrres-orders-all-non-essential-un-hq-staff-to-telecommute/article31067652.ece
22,2020/03/14,COVID-19: Australia vs New Zealand series called off,"According to a report in ‘ESPNCricinfo’, a three-match T20 International series that was scheduled in New Zealand after the ODI series in Australia also stands cancelled at the moment.

The two remaining games of the Chappell-Hadlee ODI series between Australia and New Zealand were on Saturday cancelled as the visiting will have to hurry back home to avoid a new set of travel restrictions owing to the novel coronavirus pandemic.

According to a report in ‘ESPNCricinfo’, a three-match T20 International series that was scheduled in New Zealand after the ODI series in Australia also stands cancelled at the moment.

“On Saturday afternoon, the New Zealand government tightened border restrictions saying those entering the country from Australia would be subjected to a mandatory 14-day self-isolation period,” the website reported.

This new restrictions, which come into from Sunday midnight, would have led to the New Zealand team being quarantined if it stayed back to complete the assignment.

The first ODI of the series had taken place without spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

New Zealand Cricket has revealed that pacer Lockie Ferguson was isolated from his team-mates and undertook a precautionary COVID-19 test after reporting a sore throat.

The results are still awaited.

23,2020/03/14,Coronavirus | U.S. summons Chinese envoy over Beijing’s coronavirus comments,"David Stillwell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, delivered a very “stern representation” to China's ambassador Cui Tiankai, a State Department official said, adding that Beijing's envoy was “very defensive.”

The U.S. State Department summoned the Chinese ambassador to the United States on Friday to protest against comments by Beijing suggesting the U.S. military might have brought the coronavirus to Wuhan, as tensions between the two global powers over the outbreak intensified.

David Stillwell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, delivered a very “stern representation” to China's ambassador Cui Tiankai, a State Department official said, adding that Beijing's envoy was “very defensive.”

The State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said China was seeking to deflect criticism of its role in “starting a global pandemic and not telling the world.”

“Spreading conspiracy theories is dangerous and ridiculous. We wanted to put the government on notice we won't tolerate it for the good of the Chinese people and the world.”

Defense Department Spokeswoman Alyssa Farah wrote on Twitter on Friday that “the Communist Party of China has chosen to promulgate false & absurd conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 blaming U.S. service members. #ChinaPropaganda”

The virus, also called COVID-19, has infected 138,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,000.

China's embassy did not respond to requests for comment.

Despite the signs of tension, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Beijing on Friday for its “data sharing”.

Asked by a reporter during a White House news conference about “odd narratives” being offered by some Chinese officials, Mr. Trump appeared to brush off any concern, saying he had read one article on the subject, but that he did not think it was representative of his discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Mr. Trump, who in a national address this week called the outbreak a “foreign virus” that started in China, added: “They know where it came from, we all know where it came from.”

Tensions escalated after Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian took to Twitter on Thursday.

“When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” Mr. Zhao tweeted in English.

The episode is the latest in an increasing war of words between Washington and Beijing, whose already strained ties over issues including trade, intellectual property rights and press freedom have further been tested by the virus outbreak.

The coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, has spread around the world, pummeling financial markets, halting industry, bringing some flights to a standstill, closing schools and forcing the postponement of sports events and concerts.

Mr. Zhao's comments came days after Robert O'Brien, the U.S. national security adviser, said China had reacted slowly to the coronavirus, probably costing the world two months when it could have been preparing.

Wuhan was ground zero for the outbreak, which the World Health Organization this week labeled a pandemic. It has infected more than 127,000 people worldwide, including nearly 81,000 in mainland China, and killed more than 5,000 people.

Beijing was criticized for initially attempting to censor some Chinese doctors who sounded an alarm over the virus. Since January, it has imposed draconian containment measures, effectively locking down Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, home to 60 million people.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has complained that the U.S. response had been hindered by what he called imperfect data from Beijing.

He and several other U.S. politicians have angered Beijing by referring to the “Wuhan virus.” In a national address on Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the outbreak a “foreign virus” that started in China.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ufwfc2/article30444933.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMP-XI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-summons-chinese-envoy-over-beijings-coronavirus-comments/article31067150.ece
24,2020/03/14,"Netanyahu requested PM Modi to allow export of masks, pharmaceuticals to Israel: report","Israel’s Channel 13 on Friday reported that Netanyahu made the request after India decided to stop the export of these items to meet its own domestic requirements in view of the rapid spread of coronavirus.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu requested Narendra Modi to approve and allow the export of masks and pharmaceutical raw materials to Israel during his telephonic conversation with his Indian counterpart this week, according to a media report.

Israel’s Channel 13 on Friday reported that Netanyahu made the request after India decided to stop the export of these items to meet its own domestic requirements in view of the rapid spread of coronavirus.

The leading news channel also put out a promotional tweet ahead of its broadcast during its main evening bullettin.

At a press conference on Wednesday, the Israeli Prime Minister had mentioned about reaching out to Mr. Modi, among other leaders, hinting at Israeli efforts to maintain and stabilise “supply lines” of essential materials in view of the massive disruption caused by COVID-19.

“I also spoke to the Prime Minister of India, my friend Narendra Modi. We are dependent on supply lines from various countries. We are looking into it all the time,” Mr. Netanyahu told reporters on Wednesday evening.

His remarks came during joint statements with the finance minister, the economy and industry minister, the Bank of Israel’s governor and the finance ministry director general on dealing with the economic implications of the coronavirus.

Mr. Netanyahu, however, did not share any specific details of his discussions with his Indian counterpart during the press conference.

The Israeli leader on Friday sought to reassure his countrymen that a series of restrictions imposed by the administration to try and stem the spread of coronavirus would not affect the food supply, saying there was “no reason to storm supermarkets”.

“We are investing considerable means right now to increase the pace of testing, to reduce the infection rate and — of course — to reinforce, strengthen and safeguard the medical teams, as well as many other things,” Mr. Netanyahu said.

“You have no reason to storm supermarkets. There will be enough food in general and for the [upcoming Passover] holiday,” he stressed.

Some Israelis have been stocking up on supplies, fearing extended periods of quarantine, lockdown orders, or shortages.

Some 35,000 Israelis are said to be in quarantine, almost 1,000 of them doctors and over 600 nurses. Three Israelis are said to be seriously ill with the virus, and almost 150 have tested positive. Nobody has died from coronavirus in Israel.

The deadly novel coronavirus that first originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year has claimed over 5,000 lives and infected more than 134,000 people across 110 countries and territories, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) describing the outbreak a pandemic on Wednesday.

Israel has taken tough measures in its preparations to fight with the coronavirus closing down schools, sports activities, and imposing restrictions on gatherings and workplaces.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a “great” friend and it was an incredible two days in India, U.S. President Donald Trump said on his last month visit to the country.

Mr. Trump was on his maiden official visit to India from February 24 to 25. He was accompanied by First Lady Melania and a high-powered delegation comprising senior US administration officials, including National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien.

They visited Ahmedabad, Agra and New Delhi before leaving for Washington.

“We had a great time in India. It was an incredible two days and he (Modi) is a great friend of mine”, Mr. Trump told reporters at a White House news conference.

“He’s a friend of his people because he was greeted incredibly warmly as was I in that stadium. That was an incredible event. And I loved being with him”, Mr. Trump said.

“We talked about everything. We talked about far more than just borders”, said the President in response to a question.

28,2020/03/14,Donald Trump says ‘likely’ to be tested for coronavirus soon,"Mr. Trump was pressed repeatedly during a White House news conference on whether he should be tested after coming into contact with a Brazilian official now known to have COVID-19

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he would “likely” be tested soon for the novel coronavirus, although he stressed he is “displaying no symptoms.”

Mr. Trump was pressed repeatedly during a White House news conference on whether he should be tested after coming into contact with a Brazilian official now known to have COVID-19.

The president initially shut down the question, saying that per the advice of White House doctors, “I don’t have any of the symptoms.” “And we don’t want people without symptoms to go and do the test,” he told reporters.

But when grilled by reporters about his encounter with the official at his Florida resort, he changed tack, saying: “I didn’t say I wasn’t going to be tested” and that he “most likely” would be, “fairly soon.” “Not for that reason but because I think I will do it anyway,” Mr. Trump said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/thxje0/article30796881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11-SRIRAM-LAKGOR73SA2O3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/donald-trump-says-likely-to-be-tested-for-coronavirus-soon/article31065526.ece

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday declared a national emergency over the fast spreading coronavirus to free up $50 billion in federal aid and said he would “most likely” be tested for the virus himself soon after facing possible exposure.

Mr. Trump made the announcement at a Rose Garden news conference as he battled to show Americans he is aggressively addressing the health crisis after facing criticism that he was slow to react and played down the threat until the number of cases rose.

Mr. Trump cautioned that Americans will have to make sacrifices and change their daily practices, a stark difference from two weeks ago when he said people should use common sense but otherwise not change their routines.

“It could get worse. The next eight weeks will be critical,” he said.

The president appeared on stage with members of his coronavirus task force and business executives after meeting them inside the White House over how to accelerate testing of Americans for the virus to better track the contagion's spread.

Shaking hands freely with the gathered business executives, the 73-year-old Mr. Trump later acknowledged he expected to be tested for the virus. He had come into contact with a Brazilian official last Saturday who later tested positive for coronavirus.

“Most likely, yeah, most likely. Not for that reason but because I think I will do it anyway,” Mr. Trump said. “Fairly soon. We're working out a schedule.”

“We have no symptoms whatsoever,” he said to a question about whether he should get a test.

Mr. Trump said Walmart Inc Chief Executive Doug McMillon had agreed to set up drive-thru testing at store parking lots across the country and that Alphabet Inc's Google will create a website to help determine whether individuals need a coronavirus test.

Mr. Trump shrugged off a question about whether he was responsible for what many experts have said was slow progress toward expansion of tests to track the virus.

“I don't take responsibility at all,” he said, blaming rules and regulations he inherited for the inability to mass produce the testing kits.

Mr. Trump said his declaration of a national emergency will ”unleash the full power of the federal government” to help states and territories in the fight.

US House passes coronavirus bill funding free tests, sick leave

The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a coronavirus aid package early on Saturday that would provide free testing and paid sick leave, in a bid to limit the economic damage from a pandemic that has shuttered schools, sports arenas and offices.

By a bipartisan vote of 363 to 40, the Democratic-controlled House passed a multi-billion dollar effort that would expand safety-net programs to help those who could be thrown out of work in the weeks to come.

President Donald Trump said he supported the package, raising the likelihood that it will pass the Republican-controlled Senate next week.

The 110-page bill is the product of extensive negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, President Donald Trump's point person on the issue. Mnuchin has pressed for tax cuts, while Pelosi had pushed to expand safety-net spending. It does not include the $1 trillion payroll tax cut that Trump had called for.

The bill would provide two weeks of paid sick and family leave for those affected by the virus. Businesses would get a tax credit to help cover the expense.

Workers would also be able to take up to three months of unpaid leave if they are quarantined or need to take care of sick family members.

It would expand safety-net programs that help people weather economic downturns, including home-bound seniors and low-income schoolchildren who risk losing access to free breakfast and lunch if their schools are shuttered.

It would bolster unemployment aid, and the “food stamps” program that helps 34 million low-income people buy groceries.

Significantly, it would suspend a new Trump administration restriction, due to kick in on April 1, that would cut off food-stamp benefits for 700,000 childless adults who are not working.

Federal support for Medicaid would also be increased, giving states a cushion to fund the low-income health insurance program that Trump has repeatedly tried to scale back.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/71hfud/article31064606.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Trumpjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-donald-trump-declares-national-emergency/article31064584.ece

The World Health Organization said Friday that Europe was now the “epicentre” for the global coronavirus pandemic — and warned it was impossible to know when the outbreak would peak.

The continent had now “more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China”, said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

“Europe has now become the epicentre of the pandemic,” he said.

Mr. Tedros was speaking at news conference held virtually to avoid any potential spread of the virus among journalists.

“More cases are now being reported every day than were reported in China at the height of its epidemic,” he said, referring to the global numbers.

The virus, which first surfaced in China in December, has now killed more than 5,000 people, with cases around the world topping 134,000, according to an AFP tally.

The death toll passing 5,000 was “a tragic milestone”, said Mr. Tedros.

Maria Van Kerkhove, who heads the WHO's emerging diseases unit, meanwhile warned it was “impossible for us to say when this will peak globally.”

“We hope that it is sooner rather than later.”

Their comments came as countries in Europe and beyond introduced dramatic measures to halt the spread of the virus, including closing schools and restricting public events.

Mr. Tedros said that while such so-called social distancing measures could help, countries needed to take “a comprehensive approach”.

“Not testing alone. Not contact tracing alone. Not quarantine alone. Not social distancing alone. Do it all,” he said.

'Deadly mistake'

“You can't fight a virus if you don't know where it is,” said Mr. Tedros, calling on countries to “find, isolate, test and treat every case, to break the chains of transmission.”

“Do not just let this fire burn,” he said.

“Any country that looks at the experience of other countries with large epidemics and thinks 'that won't happen to us' is making a deadly mistake.”

Michael Ryan, who heads the WHO's emergencies programme, stressed that measures like banning public gatherings “are not a panacea”.

“Social distancing measures are not going to stop this pandemic,” he said, though some could have “a positive impact”, he added.

The most important thing, he said, was to act.

“The greatest error is not to move. The greatest error is to be paralysed by the fear of failure,” he said.

The World Health Organization also announced the creation of a new fund, targeted at drawing donations from companies, organisations and individuals toward helping fight the pandemic.

The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, which will be run by the U.N. Foundation in the United States and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation, kicked off Friday with a range of multi-million-dollar donations from Facebook, Google and others.

“We need all hands on deck,” U.N. fund chief Elizabeth Cousens told reporters.

“It is not too late, so no matter where you live we need your help to fight this virus for all of our communities.”

The WHO initially estimated that efforts to rein in the virus would cost $750 million for the first three months alone.

Scott Pendergast, the WHO's head of emergencies, strategy, programmes and partnerships, however told reporters on Thursday that as the situation evolved, it was likely the true cost through the end of this year would require “at least a 10-fold increase in that ask”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tfgj03/article31063819.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINA-HEALTHWHO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/europe-now-epicentre-of-covid-19-pandemic-who/article31063820.ece
31,2020/03/14,Neha Dhupia defends her opinion on ‘MTV Roadies Revolution’: ‘I’ve been misinterpreted’,"The actor also also spoke about how trolls have affected her family members, after reacting to her controversial comments during the ongoing season of the show

After being heavily trolled for her comment that seemed like she was defending a girl for cheating in a relationship on the show MTV Roadies Revolution, actress Neha Dhupia on Saturday took to social media to defend herself. She posted a lengthy statement, declaring she has been misinterpreted.

The controversy started after a recent episode of the ongoing season of the show, wherein Neha, who is a gang leader, reprimanded a male contestant for slapping a girl, for allegedly cheating on him with five other boys. She also defended the girl saying as far as cheating goes, “it’s her choice”.

Neha’s attitude, however, did not find favour with netizens, with many users alleging she was a “fake feminist”.

Responding to the trolls, Neha wrote: “Roadies is a show that I have been a part of for five years and enjoyed every bit of it. It takes me all over India and gives me the opportunity to team up with absolute rock stars from all parts of the country. What I do not like or accept is what is happening for more than two weeks now! Recently during one of the episodes that aired, I took a stand against violence.""

She went on, “A guy talked about his partner who cheated on him (allegedly) and in retaliation, he hit her by his own admission. What the girl did is a choice she made which is a moral choice regardless of someone, man or woman... adultery is a moral choice. Cheating is not something I stand for, and it is unfortunate that I have been misrepresented for the same... but what I do stand for is women’s safety.”

She also stated how trolls have affected her family members.

“Sadly, as a reaction to my opinion, I have been subjected to weeks of vitriol. One of my posts had over 56k comments! Yet I was silent but now people close to me who have nothing to do with this — my family, my friends, my co-workers and even my dad’s personal WhatsApp are being flooded with abuses and harassment. My daughter’s page is nothing less than a barrage of abuses and this is not acceptable to me,” Neha added.

“What a man or a woman does in a relationship is their choice and moral choices are always ambiguous. But no matter what they are, they cannot lead to physical abuse. I stand by the fact that NO MATTER WHAT ... physical abuse or assault is not acceptable. Obviously, a man’s physical strength is a lot more than a girl's, and gender-based violence against women is a huge problem in our country and across the world... I urge people, whether a man or woman, to educate themselves about domestic violence... If you’re a victim of abuse, please stand up for yourself. You are not alone,” she concluded.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/6m8r9p/article31069338.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/neha,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/neha-dhupia-defends-her-opinion-on-mtv-roadies-revolution-ive-been-misinterpreted/article31069339.ece
32,2020/03/14,The smells of foreign,"After ecstatically inhaling the aromas from our American cousins’ suitcases, we are now happier breathing in jasmine, coriander and neem soap

Those were smells we used to call foreign smells. The suitcase wheeled in from the airport late at night held a treasure of these smells. From chocolates and shower gels. From ziplock bags of deodorants and face creams. From the smell of clothes washed and tumble-dried in washing machines.

While Hamam soap and Sunsilk shampoo were the usual smells in our homes, and the clothes dried on our terrace smelt of the sun, these new smells filled our heads with a new and exotic excitement. The cousins from America had arrived.

They slept till late, they spoke with a twang. They ate chips from colourful plastic bags. They brought cans of soup and other processed food and guarded this stash fiercely. The one-month visit was discussed at length before they arrived, menus carefully planned.

But the cousins always seemed to yearn for the stuff hidden in their suitcases. Their mothers looked like ours, except for the accent on some particular words. They giggled with your mother and aunts and made jokes about the old times in the kitchen. They ate with their hands like you. And when it was time to go back to the U.S., they always cried the most. The children never did. The children were the ones we had to contend with. They introduced the word ‘space’ to us. Knock before you enter, don’t run into your own room if they are there. They might need ‘space’.

The foreign smells lingered all month.

The cousins played with you. Though your idea of playing was hanging out on the terrace shooting the breeze or reading an Amar Chitra Katha or Tinkle, theirs involved video games and fancy magazines. And they always seemed to get bored quite easily. A feeling you didn’t know back then. They dressed differently from you. The girls had colour preferences: they dressed in mauve one year, there was a denim phase another year, miniskirts the next. The clothes you wore were normally fashion choices made by your mother. Your hair was in two braids or one, this was the extent of hair styling. But the cousins had more choices with everything. They brought their music in a Walkman and what you heard from their headphones probably shaped your musical sensibility for a while.

The cousins from America filled you with pride one day and a total sense of inadequacy the next. But you were always polite. You took the bars of chocolate, the Hubba Bubba, the ziplock bag of assorted candy that had your name scrawled on it with a marker, which you rationed and ate carefully so they lasted longer.

Enter Coca-Cola

The years passed and the city changed a little like you. The cousins came back as teenagers, you were older, bolder. Your fashion sense had evolved and Indo-western was your thing. They admired your long hair and Indigo kurtas paired with jeans. The Marina beach had more than peanuts and thenga-manga-pattani-sundal to offer. Dollops ice cream and Coca-Cola had made an entry. You drove them to Mahabalipuram now that you could drive. Now we could talk about boys. They had gone further bases than you but there was much to talk about and giggle. The foreign experiences now mixed with the foreign smells.

Then a time came during college when America started calling everyone everywhere. Everyone you knew was clambering to write the SATs and TOEFLs. Learning long and tough English words and colouring in choices. Young adults waited eagerly for the postman. Some families bade goodbye to a son or a daughter, some to a boyfriend, girlfriend or a best friend. Tearful goodbyes took place at airports where we looked on as they ventured out into the unfamiliar world of those very same foreign smells of our childhood.

The best friend or boyfriend would soon become a voice on the telephone, the words arriving a little delayed, too early in the day for romance, too hurried to say anything meaningful, no time for pauses. The relationships seldom survived the distance.

A letter may sometimes arrive many weeks later with all the words that couldn’t be spoken on the telephone. The languid summers usually lulled the pain. And life went on.

Love to hate

American mappilais (sons-in-law) made an entry after college. He was everything a girl was supposed to have dreamt of. We lost a few friends to those. The migration taking with it memory. They returned after a few years carrying a lot of prejudices. They shopped at dollar stores for their Indian relatives: in their defence, there were many relatives and big expectations. The same person who shared all your joys and pains came back a little changed, a touch of envy in their voice that you have house help to clean and cook. The nostalgia that made them love the city and hate it. Perhaps they needed to love it to keep coming back and to hate it and judge it so they could be happy where they lived.

Brand is here

Now we are swamped with malls. Every foreign brand has a store here. There are sales everywhere, a word I had only heard from the cousins before, always mentioned with a light in their eyes.

Today we are covered in brands from head to toe. Our children have access to every possible chocolate and candy from every part of the world. There’s a McDonald’s in every corner and a Starbucks serving an extra-large take-away cup of coffee, the kind they carry around on Wall Street I think.

Now, it’s our children who are bored easily and who want space. They struggle to speak in their mother tongues. They remind us of our cousins from America. We, on the other hand, have come full circle from loving the foreign smells to loving familiar smells. Hamam soap and filter coffee, jasmine and fresh coriander and rain on earth. We try to get the children to love them too. Patiently.

The cousins don’t come around so often any more. Work, children, school, commitments. Facebook keeps us connected. But when they do return, their suitcases are still filled with goodies for everyone. But the foreign smells have gone.

33,2020/03/14,Another Louie lament,"Somebody spiked the punch at the club’s Saturday night duplicate and the players were bidding a little wildly. Hard Luck Louie was feeling his oats when he bid to slam, but the contract had decent play.

The opening heart lead went to dummy’s queen, East’s king, and Louie’s ace. Louie ran the queen of spades at trick two and was quickly down one. East won with his king and returned a heart. “Both kings offside,” said Louie. “Darn my luck!”

Lucky Larry was also feeling the joys, and he arrived in the same contract with the same opening lead. He also covered with dummy’s queen and captured East’s king with the ace. He led the queen of spades, just like Louie had done, but when West followed low, Larry rose with dummy’s ace. He cashed the ace and king of diamonds and was a bit surprised when West showed out but didn’t ruff. Larry ruffed a diamond, cashed the ace of clubs, and ruffed a club in dummy. Another diamond ruff, another club ruff, and Larry discarded his losing heart on one of dummy’s established diamonds — making six!

Larry’s line of play was far superior to Louie’s. The king of spades might have fallen under the ace, or the diamonds might have split 3-2 with the king of spades in the hand with three diamonds. There are other layouts, in addition to this one, where Larry’s line would have also worked.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/2aiurw/article31060023.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SM15BRIDGE,https://www.thehindu.com/society/another-louie-lament/article31060024.ece
34,2020/03/14,Palliative care in Kerala: a success story,"Kerala’s community-based model of palliative care has made remarkable strides

There’s a feeling of ambient purpose and cheerful energy as you walk down the corridors of the Institute of Palliative Medicine, Kozhikode. Nestled in a leafy campus near the chest hospital, the place is bustling with people who have come to lend a hand, or learn how to, at the training classes held regularly at the Institute.

Prakash Mathew, 44, a designer, has for the past four years spent much of his free time helping out at the Institute and at similar initiatives such as Compassionate Kozhikode, training volunteers.

It’s the interactions with patients and their families that inspire him to keep going — how he can bring a little happiness to their lives; how his words can be of some comfort.

Each day, at least 500 volunteers like Mathew, most of them students from more than 70 colleges in Kozhikode district, are available to help care for the patients, in addition to some 38 staff members, including doctors and nurses.

In January, many of them also pitched in to hold a three-day fundraising carnival that featured art, literature, music and food, with handicrafts and dishes made by patients. It was quite a success, with some 30,000 people attending, says P.C. Sreekumar, a volunteer himself, and vice-chairman of the Pain and Palliative Care Society (PPCS), which runs the Institute.

The volunteers’ work isn’t limited to the Institute; most patients are based at home, and visits — some being night-time home visits as part of emergency services co-ordinated by the city administration — are a major part of the job, made possible by hundreds of volunteer drivers. Some volunteers have personal stories of caring for a friend or relative which motivated them to sign up, but others simply work because they see it as a community initiative.

Inspiring progress

PPCS is an inspiring example of what civil society can do, and it’s far from unique in Kerala, which now has 1,550 palliative care units, 450 of which are run by community-based organisations and NGOs. But Kozhikode is where it all started in 1993, when doctors at the Government Medical College led by M.R. Rajagopal and Suresh Kumar — now Director, WHO Collaborating Centre for Communitry Participation in Palliative care and Long Term Care — founded PPCS.

Starting out with a focus on cancer — and just ₹1,500 as capital funds — it was recognised by the World Health Organization in 1995 and has expanded its remit over time. But the real turning point, says Dr. Kumar — who was recently in Arunachal Pradesh and Puducherry to help set up similar initiatives and train volunteers — came in 1999-2000 when they started Neighbourhood Networks in Palliative Care, an approach that emphasised local, community-based care rather than an institutional, hospital-based approach led by doctors.

Over the years, they have trained tens of thousands of volunteers, a number of whom went on to start independent palliative care organisations in their own communities. Their efforts have even extended abroad, working with groups in countries such as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Thailand, with plans to initiate work in Myanmar as well.

The Government of Kerala has been integrating palliative care with healthcare policy at all levels in a three-tier system. A 2008 policy, updated last year, specifies neighbourhood networks — co-ordinated with NGOs — with trained staff who can identify patients’ needs and provide home care at the primary (panchayat/ municipality/ corporation) level.

The next two tiers are community health centres providing in-patient care, taluk hospitals with staff trained to deal with emergencies; then a division of palliative medicine at all medical colleges and general and district hospitals.

Way forward

Since 2017, palliative medicine, once an obscure discipline, has been part of the M.B.B.S. curriculum; it has also been offered as an M.D. programme at institutions elsewhere in the country, including AIIMS-Delhi and the Gujarat Cancer Research Institute.

On the other hand, it remains an unglamorous path for doctors and a far-from-lucrative prospect for businesses, with the result that there are only a few small units at private hospitals. While Kerala and, in recent years, other southern States, have made much advance, much remains to be done elsewhere in the country. Just 2% of people who need palliative care in India have access to it, far below the global average of 14%. The figure for Kerala stands above 26%.

What has Kerala done right? Dr. Kumar says, “There’s a difference in the models. In Kerala, there’s so much involvement from the public, from civil society. In States like Tamil Nadu and Telangana, they have services based at a cancer centre or hospital, just as we did when we started out, but there are limitations to that model — not just in terms of numbers, but also quality of care and social support. You can’t keep patients in hospital forever. You can’t treat terminal illnesses or dying stages as an exclusively medical issue. The community-based model, with institutions playing a supporting role, that we are promoting is the only way forward.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/3vuebn/article31059332.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15SM1CARNIVAL,https://www.thehindu.com/society/palliative-care-in-kerala-a-success-story/article31059335.ece
35,2020/03/14,Covid-19 hurts textile exporters,"Supply chain disruption, export drop take toll; yarn exports fall 30% in Jan.-Feb.

Textile and clothing exporters have started feeling the impact of Covid-19 because of supply chain disruptions, fall in exports and cancellation of international events.

According to the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (Texprocil), 11 countries buy 41% of India’s cotton yarn exports and these countries have reported Covid-19 cases.

Yarn exports are down 30% in value terms in January-February compared with a year earlier. There is a sharp fall in cotton yarn exports to China, Iran, Korea and Vietnam.

Exporters are unable to get appointments from buyers for Market Week 2020 to be held in New York later this month, pointed out Siddhartha Rajagopal, executive director of the council. In the case of home textiles, the biggest markets include France, Germany and the U.S.

“We need to wait and watch (the market situation in) these countries. China is the largest supplier and India can tap opportunities for specific products,” he said.

Texprocil has also called off Ind-Texpo 2020, its flagship event which is a reverse buyer-seller meet, to have been held in Coimbatore between March 17 and 19.

The Apparel Export Promotion Council had asked garment exporters who depend on China largely for their import requirements to explore other sources.

In a communique to members, the council listed suppliers from Japan for woven fabric made out of artificial filament yarn, slide fasteners and parts, sewing machines, furniture, bases and covers, and sewing machine needles.

“AEPC has made a preliminary study on the possible impact of disruptions of supply of raw materials from China,” said A. Sakthivel, chairman, AEPC.

38,2020/03/14,‘It’s wrong to presume that mergers will solve banks’ woes’,"Customers may find banking with a ‘stranger’ entity difficult

Mergers of nationalised banks will lead to closure of certain branches and doubling or trebling of depositors. It would be a big challenge for the bank with limited staff to serve them as before, says All India Bank Employees Association general secretary C.H. Venkatachalam. Besides, the recovery of NPAs would take a back seat as witnessed in the case of SBI. Excerpts from an interview:

Do you foresee hurdles in the proposed merger of nationalised banks?

The main hurdle will be to the smooth process of integration. In our country, all our banks have their own importance in terms of origin, growth, expansion and geographical [focus], and have been contributing to economic development in their own way. When banks were nationalised in 1969, they were small.

In the last 50 years, all of them have grown in terms of branch network, business volume and customer reach. Merger of banks will take away their identity and customers will find it difficult to deal with the new bank. Secondly, branch rationalisation and branch closures are bound to happen on account of mergers.

What challenges would investors and depositors face?

By merging branches in a certain locality, the number of customers to be taken care of by the merged branch will double or treble. Hence, customer attention and quality of customer service are bound to be affected adversely. When every customer wants better service, the branch will face a big hurdle in this regard.

Borrowers also are used to a particular branch servicing their requirements. They will now be compelled to deal with a new branch. The branch staff too will not be aware of the borrower’s history.

Investors have made their savings in various banks based on preference, convenience, etc. There are customers dealing with such banks for years and for a few generations.

Banking is no simple commercial transaction, but one accompanied by personal experiences and relationship with a particular bank. Now, in the name of mergers, they will be forced to bank with a lender not of their choice.

What would be the status of employee unions as some banks have more than one?

All banks in India are covered by a common and uniform industry-level settlement covering their wages and service conditions. In this regard, the unions will not face any problem, because even after the mergers, employees will continue to have the same wages and service conditions. But, the policies pertaining to transfers and promotions are different in each bank, governed by each bank-level settlement.

Mergers of banks will create a lot of problems for employees in inter-se seniority, transfers to their place of choice, etc. This will pose a challenge to the unions dealing with these problems.

Further, there are many welfare schemes, fringe benefits and other schemes that vary from bank to bank. Mergers will impact these benefits and schemes and unionists have to address these issues to harmonise these benefits.

Further, due to rationalisation and closure of branches, employees may be displaced and deployed to other centres, which will be an important problem to be addressed by the unions.

Will recovery of bad debts take a back seat?

Mergers will totally divert the attention of the banks from loan recovery and it is bound to take a back seat.

The new entity bank will not know the background of the defaulters and borrowers. The volume of borrowal accounts in a branch will rise This is one reason why we are opposing mergers. After merger of six associate banks with SBI, non-performing assets went up. Hence, it is also a wrong presumption that the proposed move [to merge] will resolve problems faced by the banks.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/2cn1q9/article31070278.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THBUVENKAT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/its-wrong-to-presume-that-mergers-will-solve-banks-woes/article31070279.ece

“At one point of time, we were talking to four pharma companies. Unfortunately, we lost Orchid Pharma,” Manish Choube, global chief executive officer, Accord Pharma, said.

Accord Pharma recently bid for debt-ridden Orchid Pharma under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process and went to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal seeking that its revised bid should be considered, against the National Company Law Tribunal-approved bid by Dhanuka Laboratories. However, it was turned down.

On the status of the remaining three firms, he said the second one too was dropped. It would take some more time to conclude the due diligence of remaining firms.

So far, the company has invested around ₹600 crore in Oragadam facility and plans to invest around ₹1,500 crore by March 2022, for R&D, acquisitions and others.

Mr. Choube said initially the company would focus on R&D, manufacturing and supply of sterile and non-sterile formulation products and API across countries. It has one unit in Oragadam and second one was coming up at Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu.

As a first step, Accord Group is venturing into the domestic market with the introduction of two key therapies oncology and nephrology. The products deals with treatment during blood cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, hemodialysis, kidney transplant and renal medicines, said Sateesh Singh, senior vice president, sales and marketing, Accord Pharma domestic business.

Asserting that they are planning to invest ₹2,000 crore over the next two years, Mr. Choube said they would be focusing more on the export market. During the first year of operations FY21, the company hopes to earn a revenue of ₹50 crore and ₹150 crore on the next year, he said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/accord-pharma-scouts-for-acquisitions/article31070225.ece

44,2020/03/14,Centre to reimburse tax to exporters,"A decision to approve the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme was taken at a Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi here

The government on Friday approved a scheme for reimbursement of taxes and duties, which were not refunded previously, to exporters with a view to give boost to the country’s dwindling outbound shipments.

A decision to approve the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme was taken at a Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi here.

The reimbursement of taxes such as duty on power charges and VAT on fuel in transportation and farm sector captive power generation; mandi tax; stamp duty on export documents; CGST and compensation cess on coal in power production; central excise duty on fuel used in transportation would make Indian products competitive in global markets, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal told reporters.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in September last year had said this scheme will incentivise exporters at an estimated cost of Rs 50,000 crore to the exchequer.

These measures are compliant with the WTO (World Trade Organisation) norms. India is a member of WTO, which frames norms for global trade, since 1995.

Goyal also said sectors and products under RoDTEP scheme will be notified in a phased manner and the MEIS benefits for those sectors and items will be withdrawn.

This scheme was announced by Sitharaman in her Budget speech on February 1.

Goyal said with the rolling out of this new scheme, the Merchandise Export Incentive Scheme (MEIS) will be “phased out“.

It is proposed to digitally refund to exporters, duties and taxes levied at the Centre, State and local levels.

Goyal said duties/taxes/levies not refunded in any other scheme will be refunded under this new scheme, which will be rolled out soon by the Department of Revenue.

The move assumes significance as a WTO dispute resolution panel has ruled that MEIS was not in compliance with the global trade norms.

Under the WTO rules, certain duties like state taxes on power, oil, water, and education cess are allowed to be refunded.

Further, the commerce minister said as India has graduated from the category of the least developed countries, it cannot give subsidies for exports.

So far, exporters have been getting refund under duty drawback and GST paid on raw materials or intermediates.

The scheme, he said, will help in providing a level playing field to domestic exporters in the international markets.

The ministry will hold a detailed consultations with stakeholders concerned for inclusion of products, which would avail refund.

The Department of Revenue will priorities and soon fix RoDTEP rates for different goods/sector and will notify in a phased manner and accordingly MEIS will be rolled back for those items.

“It will be given to exporters through transferable scrips. All the process will be online to minimise human interface,” he said.

“Stakeholders meeting will be held for fixing the rates. We will take data and see what all cost they bear,” Goyal said adding “We will use the next 6-8 months to talk to the industry, work out the input taxes which do not get refunded“.

A monitoring and auditing mechanism will be put in place.

The country’s exports contracted for a sixth month in a row by 1.66 per cent in January to $25.97 billion.

During April-January 2019-20, exports slipped 1.93 per cent to $265.26 billion, while imports declined 8.12 per cent to $398.53 billion, leaving a trade deficit of $133.27 billion.

Undet thr scheme, a mechanism would be created for reimbursement of taxes/ duties/ levies, at the central, state and local level, which are currently not being refunded under any other mechanism, but which are incurred in the process of manufacture and distribution of exported products.

An official statement said that an inter-ministerial Committee will determine the rates and items for which the reimbursement of taxes and duties would be provided.

Transferable duty credit/electronic scrip will be issued as part of refund to the exporters, which will be maintained in an electronic ledger.

“The refunds under the RoDTEP scheme would be a step towards ‘zero-rating’ of exports, along with refunds such as Drawback and IGST,” it said.

It added that at present, GST taxes and import/customs duties for inputs required to manufacture exported products are either exempted or refunded.

However, certain taxes/duties/levies are outside GST, and are not refunded for exports.

“The sequence of introduction of the scheme across sectors, prioritization of the sectors to be covered, degree of benefit to be given on various items within the rates set by the Committee will be decided and notified by the Department of Commerce ,” it said.

The rebate would be claimed as a percentage of the Freight On Board (FOB) value of exports.

A monitoring and audit mechanism, with an Information Technology based Risk Management System (RMS), would be put in to physically verify the records of the exporters.

“As and when the rates under the RoDTEP Scheme are announced for a tariff line/ item, the MEIS benefits on such tariff line/item will be discontinued,” it said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/centre-to-reimburse-tax-to-exporters/article31065130.ece
45,2020/03/14,Congress may put off its crucial plenary,"Plan was to decide on new leadership

A combination of factors such as the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the increasing spread of COVID-19 may force the Congress to put on hold its plan to organise a plenary session, a source said on Saturday.

Though the party had never officially announced it, it was planning to hold a plenary session in Jaipur to decide on the leadership question soon after the Budget session of Parliament that is scheduled to end on April 3.

“I think everything has been put on hold as the time is not appropriate now,” said a senior leader who also added that Rahul Gandhi’s reluctance to take over the reins of the party once again is also a factor in the delay.

On August 10 last year, more than two months after Mr. Gandhi stepped down owning moral responsibility for the party’s defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, his mother, Sonia Gandhi, took charge as the interim president.

It was seen as a stop-gap arrangement as she was said to be unable to manage a punishing schedule of a full-time party president because of health concerns.

Several leaders, including Shashi Tharoor and Sandeep Dikshit, have suggested that the party either hold an election or formalise a procedure to settle the leadership question.

In an interview with The Hindu, Mr. Dikshit blamed the senior leadership for the uncertainty.

“We are all very ready to become Rajya Sabha members, we are all very ready to become Chief Ministers. We all want to become Finance Ministers. Right? Do we not have the capability of being Congress president? My thing is, you have failed us,” he said without taking anybody’s name.

The young versus old narrative has only resurfaced with Mr. Scindia’s exit.

Rajasthan scene

Amid reports that the BJP could now target the Congress government in Rajasthan where Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot shares a frosty relationship with Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Mr. Pilot sent a cryptic tweet on Wednesday.

“Unfortunate to see @JM_Scindia parting ways with @INCIndia. I wish things could have been resolved collaboratively within the party,” he said in a tweet, indicating that the ‘collaborative’ effort was missing.

Many believe Mr. Pilot’s tweet was a signal to the high command that seems to have ignored signs of trouble between the Rajasthan CM and his deputy.

Calling the current phase a “defining moment”, Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev said a day later: “If anyone is feeling alienated pls don’t, just get involved post or no post. Young vs old narrative is a hollow one, we need everyone.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3n8hw4/article31070565.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THSUSHMITADEV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-may-put-off-its-crucial-plenary/article31070566.ece
46,2020/03/14,Coronavirus: Travellers left in the lurch after COVID-19 advisory,"Passengers are forced to reschedule their flights at higher prices

Travellers forced to cancel flights after the government’s advisory against non-essential travel amid COVID-19, have been left in the lurch as most airlines have offered full refund only for travel to countries for which there is an outright ban.

In many cases while airlines have waived re-booking fees, travel agents and aggregators have either failed to pass on the benefit to passengers or such travellers are forced to reschedule flights at a higher price.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

On Wednesday, the government cancelled visas for all foreign citizens and mandated quarantine for Indians returning from China, Italy, Iran, Spain, Germany and Republic of Korea and advised all Indians against non-essential travel, adding that they could be quarantined for 14 days on their return.

Twenty-two year old Anandita Abhay Bhalerao was scheduled to fly to Paris for a backpacking trip from Mumbai on Friday by Kuwait Airways.

However, her flight was cancelled after Kuwait banned the entry of nationals from several countries, including India. Despite the cancellation by the airline, the Mumbai-based writer was offered only a free date change.

Coronavirus updates | March 14, 2020 | Central and State helpline numbers

Determined to join her friends, Ms Bhalerao then booked a ticket on Gulf Air for ₹39,000 which she was forced to cancel following the government’s advisory and received only half the fare as a refund.

“I booked both my tickets through Make My Trip (MMT). When Kuwait Airways cancelled the ticket, MMT said they were helpless and I will have to contact the airline. The airline offered only a date change, but that is not an option for me as I was travelling to celebrate my sister’s birthday and also because there is no clarity on how long the COVID-19 infection will continue,” Ms. Bhalerao told The Hindu over the phone.

A communications professional, Durga Nandini, was booked for travel to Vietnam on Malaysia Airlines between April 2 to 12.

Following the government’s advisory, the mother of a four-year-old is apprehensive about travelling. Though the airline allows her to change the date of her travel for free unlimited times until December 31, according to Make My Trip's website Ms. Durga will have to cough up ₹5,220 per ticket as penalty for rebooking. Alternatively, she will have to cancel her travel and bear the entire loss.

Coronavirus | Masks, sanitisers declared essential commodities

“I am a mother of a four-year-old and travelling for me is not an option because of the fear about COVID-19. Medical experts have argued that it may take upto 18 months to develop a vaccine and, therefore, I don't want to take the risk of travelling in the next eight months but my airline allows me to reschedule only until the end of the year,” says Ms. Durga.

“For regions where airlines have cancelled existing and new flights, we are offering 100% refund to our customers. Additionally, we are working in tandem with our airline partners to offer an option to change travel dates with no-fee charge; and are passing full fee waiver benefits rolled out by our partners to travellers,” Make My Trip said in an email response to queries.

Another family of two, who didn't want to be identified, was scheduled to travel to UK on Etihad Airways next week but seek to now reschedule their travel, which comes at a higher cost.

""We are being waived a penalty fee of ₹10,000 but we will have to spend additional ₹20,000 per ticket if I had to book my travel to UK in June through Etihad. The airline doesn't allow us to reschedule beyond June,"" the passenger said.

A senior DGCA official told The Hindu that the regulatory body had met with several international carriers, including Malaysia Airlines on Friday, and advised them to waive cancellation and rescheduling charges.

“We have also received many complaints about travel aggregators and we have asked airlines to ensure that their third party vendors implement waivers offered in toto,” the official said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nbejt9/article31070545.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14PATNAAIRPORT2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-travellers-left-in-the-lurch-after-covid-19-advisory/article31070546.ece
47,2020/03/14,"Coronavirus: Group hosts ‘cow urine party’, says COVID-19 due to meat-eaters","‘Global leaders should import the liquid from India’

People lined up for their share of cow urine being poured from kettles into ‘kulhads’, at a ‘gaumutra party’ (cow urine party) here organised by Swami Chakrapani, the president of the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha.

The event began with a ‘yagna’ and prayers to the cow and the virus itself, asking it to leave peacefully and not kill any more people. A large poster in the backdrop depicted an avatar of Hindu god Narsingh as the virus.

At the event, Chakrapani claimed that COVID-19 is an “avatar” that has “come to punish those who eat non-vegetarian food.”

Asking for forgiveness from the virus on behalf of meat eaters, he pledged that Indians will never eat meat again. “Coronavirus has come because of the people who kill and eat animals. When you kill an animal, it creates a sort of energy that causes destruction in that place,” said Chakprapani at the event.

“They (global leaders) should get cow urine imported from India because the almighty resides only in the Indian cow and not in any foreign breed,” he said.

His comments came even as the Centre has asked people not to pay attention to “false rumours” that the COVID-19 was spreading through non-vegetarian food like eggs, chicken, mutton and seafood.

Coronavirus updates | March 14, 2020 | Central and State helpline numbers

Union Fisheries, Dairying and Animal Husbandry Minister Giriraj Singh told reporters on March 6 the World Organisation for Animal Health as well as Indian food safety regulator FSSAI have said there was no scientific evidence to prove transmission of coronavirus from animals to humans.

“The false rumour has hit thousands of farmers engaged in this business. The livelihood of farmers and the people engaged in the entire value chain have been affected. I humbly request people not to fall prey to such rumours,” the minister had said.

While medical practitioners across the world have said there is no cure as such for coronavirus, Chakrapani claimed that cow urine is the “only cure” for COVID-19 and requested global leaders to consume the “miracle liquid” and lead by example in the fight against the contagious viral disease.

“All our leaders and officials consume ‘gaumutra’ But they do so behind closed doors and when they are sick. It doesn’t work like that,” he said, insisting that cow urine should be consumed on a daily basis to keep diseases at bay.

“They (leaders) are ashamed of the gift gods have given us. Cow urine is pure elixir. Every person should drink it.”

The event began with a ‘yagna’ and prayers to the cow and the virus itself, asking it to leave peacefully and not kill any more people. A large poster in the backdrop depicted an avatar of Hindu god Narsingh as coronavirus.

Chakrapani emphasised that global leaders should import ‘gau mutra’ from India as the cow giving the “miracle elixir” must be of an Indian breed only.

“I request all the presidents and prime ministers of the world to take cow urine on a daily basis. You have all these scientists who don’t know the cure, we have the cure given to us by the gods,” he claimed.

Kriti Bhushan, former DG of Directorate General of Health Services, told PTI there is no scientific evidence behind claims that cow urine can cure coronavirus. “In medical science, we only call something a cure after testing it on a 100 people or more. This is a unilateral claim and has no basis to it. In fact, currently there’s no cure available for coronavirus. A lot of scientists are continuously working to find a solution,” he said.

Rajesh Sharma, a volunteer at the event, vouched for its “miraculous” properties while offering the drink to others around him.

“You have just one glass today and by tomorrow morning you will know the difference. Gaumutra can cure all diseases, I can give it to you in writing,” Sharma claimed.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to Twitter to share the Health Ministry’s guidelines on home quarantine even as officials announced that the Padma Award ceremonies, scheduled to be held on March 26 and April 3, have been postponed in view of the outbreak.

According to the Ministry guidelines, those quarantined at home should stay in a well-ventilated, room, preferably with an attached or separate toilet. If another family member needs to stay in the same room, it’s advisable to maintain a distance of at least a metre between the two. Quarantined individuals must stay away from the elderly, pregnant women, children and persons with co-morbidities within the household as their immunity may be low.

The Health Ministry has now also said that people under moderate risk which includes “asymptomatic passengers coming from China, Democratic Republic of Korea, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Iran and are elderly (above 60 years) who are hypertensive, diabetic, asthmatic, are to be shifted by State governments to a dedicated quarantine facility and monitored daily by State governments for next 14 days.

Among the important matters which have been listed for hearing are anticipatory bail pleas of civil rights activists Gautam Navlakha and Anand Teltumbde, accused in the 2018 Bhima Koregaon case, and a petition by a Nirbhaya case convict.

The apex court, which had on March 13 announced that only six of the 15 benches will be sitting to hear only urgent matters, on Saturday issued instructions for the staff, including thermal screening of all employees and closure of cafeterias, as part of precautionary measures.

On March 6, the top court had extended till March 16 the protection from arrest granted to civil rights activists Navlakha and Teltumbde, while hearing the appeal against the last month’s order of the Bombay High Court rejecting their anticipatory bail pleas. The matter will be taken up on Monday.

The top court will also hear the plea of Mukesh Singh, one of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case who has sought restoration of all his legal remedies, alleging that his lawyers had misled him.

The plea, filed through advocate ML Sharma, has sought a CBI probe into alleged “criminal conspiracy” and “fraud” by the Centre, Delhi government and advocate Vrinda Grover, who is the amicus curiae in the case.

The top court Cause list said that the six benches will first take up hearings in only six matters and then judges will take a break for half an hour and then resume hearing for another six matters.

The judges will be sitting in court numbers 2, 3, 6, 8, 11 and 14 to avoid overcrowding of court corridors. On Monday and Friday of every week, the apex court usually functions with 15 benches and takes up mostly miscellaneous matters.

In a notice issued on Saturday, the top court said that the mentioning officer will be available on the premises from 2.30 pm to 5 pm for listing of any urgent matters on March 16. The officer will also be available from 10.30am to 5pm on March 15.

The circular requested all the staff members to not to crowd at any particular place in the Supreme Court premises, except where their presence is officially required.

The apex court has been mulling over the issue in its meetings held at the residence of Chief Justice of India S A Bobde on March 12 and 13, as it took note of the Centre’s March 5 advisory cautioning against mass gatherings and the World Health Organization declaring COVID-19 a ‘pandemic’

The apex court’s notification, issued by its secretary general Sanjeev S Kalgaonkar, had said it had been decided that its functioning would be restricted to urgent matters.

“It is hereby notified that no persons, except the lawyers who are going to act in the matter that is either for argument or for making oral submissions or to assist along with one litigant only, shall be permitted in the courtroom,” it had said, adding that the mentioning of matters for urgent hearing would be made only before the mentioning officer.

The apex court has sought cooperation in this regard considering the importance of safety measures to maintain public health.

India reported its second casualty due to coronavirus on Friday after a 68-year-old woman, whose son with a travel history abroad had tested positive, died in Delhi.

Several states across India went into battle mode to contain the spread of COVID-19, shutting down schools, theatres and colleges, and many public events, including the IPL, were postponed.

50,2020/03/14,SAARC | PM Modi to convene videoconference meet today,"The conference will include leaders of seven countries including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.

Two days after he made the surprise offer, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will convene a meeting of SAARC leaders on the coronavirus pandemic over a video conference on Sunday evening.

The conference, which will include leaders of seven countries including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka and the special adviser (Health) to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, will discuss the number of coronavirus cases in the subcontinent, different measures taken to stop the spread of the virus, and treatment methods.

Full coverage on COVID-19

“Coming together for common good,” tweeted MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, making the announcement of the video-conference, which will begin at 5p.m. IST on Sunday.

The SAARC leaders’ conference will come a day ahead of a similar “virtual conference” convened by France for members of the G-7 countries — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States — which will be held on Monday.

On Friday, after Mr. Modi proposed that the “leadership of SAARC nations chalk out a strong strategy to fight coronavirus”, which the leaders of most of the SAARC countries had welcomed, Pakistan’s government also put out a statement accepting the proposal.

“The threat of COVID-19 requires coordinated efforts at global and regional level. We have communicated that Special Advisor to Prime Minister on Health will be available to participate in the video conference of #SAARC member countries on the issue,” Pakistan foreign ministry spokesperson Aisha Farooqui tweeted, indicating that Mr. Khan would not join the meeting.

Pakistan PM Imran Khan has deputed his special adviser to the meeting.

When asked if India was amenable to including an official from Pakistan rather than its Prime Minister or President, an MEA official said this is “not an issue”, as the aim of the conference is to discuss a “strong strategy” for the region to deal with the coronavirus, that has claimed nearly 5,000 lives globally in the last few weeks. “What is important is that all [SAARC] countries will be represented at the meeting,” the official said.

Also read: Nepal pitches for informal SAARC summit

The Ministry of External Affairs is coordinating India’s response to the virus through a “special cell” headed by Additional Secretary Dammu Ravi and assisted by four officers and other staff, who will brief the Prime Minister during the video-conference. The MEA says it has set up helplines in all its missions to respond to queries and help the Indian community around the world dealing with the pandemic.

The government has paid particular attention to helping SAARC member countries with their response as well, the MEA highlighted in a note released on Saturday. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar had announced on February 7 that India was prepared to airlift stranded citizens from all neighbouring countries, and special Air India and Indian Air Force planes to China, Japan, Iran and Italy have airlifted more than 1,000 people, including about 30 from neighbouring countries including Bangladesh, Myanmar, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.

On Saturday, Indian High Commissioner to Male Sanjay Sudhir also handed over a consignment of medicine supplies for three months to the Maldives. Appreciating the gesture, Maldivian Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid said, “This will be a tremendous help as we combat the COVID-19. One country alone cannot face this pandemic. Together, we shall prevail.”

Officials said Mr. Modi’s purpose in arranging the video-conference was to keep the citizens of South Asia “healthy”. “[PM Modi] had highlighted that SAARC leaders can together set an example to the world and contribute to a healthier planet”.

SAARC reset?

The PM’s video-conference will be one of the unique occasions in more than four years when Mr. Modi will take part in a SAARC event, since he declined to attend the summit in Islamabad in 2016. After the Uri attack in September 2016, other SAARC countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Bhutan had also pulled out of the summit in protest against cross-border terrorism from Pakistan. After the government’s decision to abrogate Article 370 with regard to Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, Pakistan had also boycotted India’s participation at SAARC meetings, and both Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers boycotted each other’s speeches at a SAARC meet on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly last September.

However, in the last few months, many leaders in the neighbourhood have counselled both sides to resume their engagement with the grouping. Nepal Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli had even offered to mediate between India and Pakistan in an effort to restart the South Asian engagement, which at present is limited to other groupings like BIMSTEC, which includes Thailand and Myanmar but doesn’t include Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Maldives.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8490lk/article31062775.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-NarendraModi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/saarc-pm-modi-to-convene-videoconference-meet-today/article31070389.ece
51,2020/03/14,Madhya Pradesh Speaker accepts resignation of six rebels,"BJP says government in minority, urges Governor to ensure early floor test; Congress issues three-line whip for budget session

Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha Speaker N.P. Prajapati on Saturday accepted the resignations of six rebel MLAs, who are in Bengaluru, after they failed to appear before him to attest to their resignations even after being given time to do so on two days.

“The news given by them relating to this in electronic media is also raising questions marks,” Mr. Prajapati wrote in his order, accepting the resignations submitted by BJP leaders on March 10. “This way, their conduct seems to be astounding and they are not fit to be members of the Vidhan Sabha,” he added. The six members whose resignations have been accepted were ministers in the State government and supporters of Jyotiraditya Scindia, who crossed over to the BJP. Governor Lalji Tandon had on Friday approved Chief Minister Kamal Nath’s recommendation to remove them from the cabinet.

Meanwhile, Mr. Nath wrote to the Union Home minister exhorting him to ensure the release of 22 rebel MLAs held in “captivity” in Bengaluru so that they could attend the session from Monday. “There is no point in the demand for a floor test if 22 of my MLAs are held hostage outside,” he wrote. On Friday, Mr. Tandon had asked Mr. Nath to provide cover of the central paramilitary forces for those MLAs asked to appear before the Speaker. “I assure you that if Karnataka police ensures their release, I’ll provide them with the highest security arrangements here,” he wrote.

Earlier, a day after the ruling Congress had asked the Governor to hold a floor test in the forthcoming budget session starting from Monday, the Opposition BJP on Saturday urged him to hold the test even earlier, claiming that the government was in a minority and attempting to stall the trust vote.

Also Read Scindia has embraced RSS ideology, says Rahul

A BJP delegation that included the Leader of the Opposition Gopal Bhargava and former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan submitted a letter to Mr. Tandon at the Raj Bhavan urging him to use his powers under Article 175 (2) of the Constitution — relating to sending messages to Houses — and issue orders to conduct the test. They also demanded that no other issue ought to be taken up during the session.

Mr. Chouhan claimed that the 22 rebel MLAs, currently in Bengaluru, had made it clear in videos released by them that they had resigned. “The Kamal Nath-led government is in minority now, and doesn’t have the right to take decisions... it doesn’t have the constitutional right to govern,” he told reporters.

There was no point to a budget session or the Governor’s address, he contended, given the minority nature of the government. “We request it also because several divisive elements inspired by the government are giving inducements to and pressuring [MLAs], threatening relatives and opening new cases against them,” the former chief minister said.

In addition, the delegation had requested the Governor to accord Central paramilitary security-cover to BJP MLAs. “They are not willing to return without adequate security,” said Mr. Chouhan.

In the letter, they requested for a test not by a voice vote but by division of votes and asked that the proceedings be videographed by an official authorised by the Governor.

“We also request you to ensure that the minority government doesn’t postpone the date of the floor test using any excuse,” the leaders exhorted Mr. Tandon.

Former Minister Narottam Mishra, part of the delegation, pointed out that both parties wanted a floor test now. “Yet, they are flagging the coronavirus threat to postpone the session. Well, the Lok Sabha session is underway, and there is no platform above it. The threat is not so much here as in Delhi. This is delaying tactics which we will not allow to succeed.”

Meanwhile, Congress Chief Whip Govind Singh issued a three-line whip to the party’s MLAs to be present during the session on all days, remain in Bhopal and vote compulsorily in favour of the government.

“All the honourable MLAs are requested to be present mandatorily in Bhopal during the fifth session of the Vidhan Sabha on all working days, that is from March 16 to April 13, and in the House during all the proceedings, ensure their attendance at all times and in every condition vote compulsorily in favour of the government,” the whip said.

Separately, the Bhopal police have registered a case against 35 unidentified persons after BJP leaders staged a dharna here on Friday night demanding an FIR against alleged Congress workers showing black flags and obstructing the passage of the vehicles of the BJP’s Mr. Scindia and his supporters.

“We have booked 30-35 persons for obstructing the road,” said Shailendra Chouhan, Superintendent of Police, North Bhopal. The case had been registered under sections 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and 147 (punishment for rioting) of the Indian Penal Code.

“There is no law and order left in the State,” asserted Mr. Chouhan. In a reference to Mr. Scindia, he also alleged that there had been an “attempt to kill” a former Union Minister who is “BJP’s senior leader” and a Rajya Sabha candidate. “They tried to stop his [Mr. Scindia’s] vehicle and pelted stones. The driver somehow saved his life by driving through,” he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5ckenw/article31070308.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BJP-Leaders,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/madhya-pradesh-speaker-accepts-resignation-of-six-rebels/article31070309.ece
52,2020/03/14,COVID-19: Centre withdraws order on ex-gratia within hours of notification,"Relief to families of victims and cost of hospitalisation removed in new order.

Hours after it issued a notification that an ex-gratia of ₹4 lakh will be paid to the families of those who die of COVID-19 infection, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) withdrew the order.

In an order issued on Saturday, the MHA said it has decided to treat COVID-19 as a “notified disaster” for the purpose of providing assistance under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

The SDRF is the primary fund available with the State governments for responses to notified disasters to meet expenditure for providing immediate relief to the victims. The Centre contributes 75% of the SDRF allocation for general category States and Union Territories and 90% for special category States (northeast, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir).

Under the old notification, the MHA listed ex-gratia relief to families of deceased persons and “cost of hospitalisation for managing COVID-19 patients at rates fixed by the State government” among the items for assistance from the SDRF pool.

No explanation was given by the MHA officials for the modified notification.

53,2020/03/14,"Visited Abdullah in February as a well-wisher, says former RAW chief","I did not meet him on government’s behalf: Dulat

Former R&AW chief A.S Dulat said on Saturday that he did not meet former J&K Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah on behalf of the government when the latter was in detention.

Dr. Abdullah was released by the J&K administration on Friday by revoking his detention under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA). He was in detention for more than seven months.

Asked if his February 12 meeting with Dr. Abdullah could have triggered the release of the National Conference president on Friday, Mr. Dulat said: “I have no idea why he has been released now.”

Mr. Dulat asserted that it was his personal visit. “Obviously I couldn’t have met him without government clearance but nobody [in the government] helped and I did not go on somebody’s behalf. I just went as a well-wisher to enquire about his health,” Mr. Dulat told The Hindu.

‘Best news’

Earlier on Friday, Mr. Dulat said the decision to free Dr. Abdullah was “the best news he had heard”. “I hope this means the government has decided to rethink about the future of Jammu and Kashmir, and I hope the release of Dr. Abdullah is a sign of other measures of leniency in the state,” he had told The Hindu.

Last month, in the first sign that the government had softened its position, Mr. Dulat, who had worked closely with the former Chief Minister during his tenure, was granted permission to meet with Dr. Abdullah in custody at his home in Srinagar. Mr. Dulat denied reports that he carried any messages from the Central government to Dr. Abdullah, but said the permission to meet him came after months of the government refusing his requests.

However, according in an interview given to senior journalist Karan Thapar for The Wire, Mr. Dulat said that on February 9 he received a phone call from the Home Ministry saying he was free to go to Kashmir.

Mr. Dulat says this phone call would have happened with the knowledge and concurrence of NSA Ajit Doval and this means the NSA was fully in the loop, a statement issued by Mr. Thapar said.

“He [Dulat] revealed that the Intelligence Bureau in Srinagar provided transport to take him from the Srinagar airport to Abdullah’s residence at Gupkar Road and back to the airport.... Shortly after his return, he was rung by the Home Ministry to find out how the trip had gone,” the statement said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bxdjly/article31070300.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ASDULAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/visited-abdullah-in-february-as-a-well-wisher-says-former-raw-chief/article31070209.ece
54,2020/03/14,Sidhu launches YouTube channel,"Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, who quit the Punjab Cabinet last year and went into a self imposed political exile, announced the launch of his YouTube channel on Saturday.

The channel has been named “Jittega Punjab” and it has invited all like minded people for discussions and interviews. “It is a platform to propel Punjab towards revival and renaissance,” said Mr. Sidhu in a statement.

“After nine months of contemplation and self-renewal, the former Minister, four-term Member of Parliament and MLA, Amritsar East, will be vocal on the burning issues of Punjab and strive to carve out a concrete road-map for the resurrection of Punjab as a welfare state,” the statement said.

The channel, it said, was inspired by the path of universal brotherhood, tolerance, love and peace shown by Baba Nanak.

Mr. Sidhu, who had been at loggerheads with Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in New Delhi last month. He said he had apprised both leaders of the prevailing situation in Punjab.

55,2020/03/14,MPs’ panel concerned at Defence fund shortfall,"Falling allocation impacting modernisation and tri-service organisations, it says

The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defence has expressed concern at the widening gap between projections and allocations in the defence budget impacting modernisation and has recommended a dedicated fund for committed liabilities and procurements. The shortfall in allocation has also effected setting up of three tri-service organisations and the operational readiness of the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), the committee noted.

Also read: Budget 2020 | Meagre defence hike threatens military modernisation

“From the information submitted by the Ministry, the Committee notes that since 2015-16, none of the three Services has been given the matching allocation as per the projection.”

The gap in capital allocation for the Army, which was ₹4,596 crore in 2015-16, has increased to ₹17,911.22 crore in 2020-21 (14% to 36%). In case of the Navy, the difference was ₹1,264.89 crore in 2014-15, which has increased to ₹18,580 crore in 2020-21 (5% to 41%) and for the Air Force, the gap of ₹12,505.21 crore in 2015-16 has increased to ₹22,925.38 crore in 2020-21 (27% to 35%).

“The Committee opines that such situation is not conducive for preparation of country to modern-day warfare, where possession of capital intensive modern machines are pre-requisite for not only tilting the result of war in our favour but also having a credible deterrence,” the report stated.

The Committee noted the considerable shortage in the allocation in the Capital Head, which is 35% less than the projection. “The Committee observes that Navy’s fighting capabilities depend on the high value platforms like aircraft carrier, submarines, destroyers and frigate but the allocation of Capital Budget for Navy [percentage-wise] has the sharpest decline.”

Also read: Should military spending be increased?

On the committed liabilities, which are payments anticipated during a financial year for contracts concluded in previous years, the Committee noted that they constitute a significant part of the Capital Head. Inadequate allocation would definitely lead to ‘default situation’ on contractual obligations, the committee said. “Therefore, the Committee has no option but to recommend that a dedicated fund should be earmarked for committed liabilities and new schemes, invariably from next Budget onwards.”

Both the Navy and the IAF have a situation where their committed liabilities are more than their share of the capital allocation in the Budget. To offset this, the Services have been forced to defer payment of committed liabilities of the Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSU) among other measures.

In the allocation for Joint Staff, the projection under miscellaneous expenditure was ₹660.94 crore while allotment is ₹294.00 crore and the standing committee was informed that the carry forward burden from previous year is ₹32.14 crore. Hence, the net availability is ₹261.86 crore and the net shortfall is ₹399.08 crore.

“The implications of shortfall in miscellaneous expenditure include inability to operationalisation of Defence Space Agency (DSA), Defence Cyber Agency (DCYA) and Armed Forces Special Operations Division (AFSOD). Other implications are lower operational readiness of Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC) ships due to impact on annual refit plans, maintenance of SIGINT (Signal Intelligence) equipment and administration of training institutes and operational units.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5dw4ea/article31069725.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KALRAJMISHRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/defence-house-panel-recommends-dedicated-fund-for-committed-liabilities-new-schemes/article31069726.ece
56,2020/03/14,"Only 420 FIRs for 920 sewer deaths in three decades, says activist","'FIR has to be mandatorily filed'

Almost 420 first information reports ( FIRs) have been lodged in connection with around 920 deaths inside sewers in the country between 1993 and January 31, 2020, as per the data tabled in the Lok Sabha by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. The numbers, given in response to a question by Chandra Prakash Joshi, also show a huge disparity in the number of deaths and the registering of FIRs among States.

For instance, Tamil Nadu which registered 206 deaths between 1993 and January 2020, recorded only 28 FIRs, while Gujarat which had 161 deaths recorded 125 FIRs in the same period. States which have seemingly fared better in registering FIRs are Karnataka, where 66 FIRs were lodged for 78 deaths, and Andhra Pradesh where 23 deaths were reported and 22 FIRs lodged. In certain States like West Bengal where 19 deaths have been reported not a single FIR has been filed.

“These figures clearly point out the disparity in the filing of FIRs,” Bezwada Wilson, national convener of Safai Karmachari Andolan told The Hindu.

Also read|110 deaths by cleaning sewers, septic tanks in 2019

Mr. Wilson explained that in cases where multiple deaths take place in a single incident, a single FIR may have been registered, thereby accounting for the relatively fewer FIRs. However, he said in many cases the FIRs have not been lodged at all.

Referring to a Supreme Court judgment of March 27, 2014 and the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, Mr. Wilson said in every case of death while cleaning sewers, FIR has to be mandatorily filed.

“Our experience tells that in most of cases of sewer deaths, where the workers are engaged by a municipality either directly or through a contractor, the FIRs are filled; but in cases of deaths while cleaning septic tanks, there is hardly any filing of FIRs.” Mr. Wilson said what is more important than filing FIRs is the need to ascertain how many chargesheets have been filed or whether anyone has been held guilty or not.

Ashif Shaikh, national convener of the Raashtriya Garima Abhiyaan ((National Campaign for Dignity), said their organisation did a study of almost 200 cases across 10 States and found that not many family members had any idea of the police complaints after people in their family died while cleaning sewers.

Also read|Sewer deaths: Centre calls for quick response units

“We did the survey in 2018 and got different kinds of response as far as filing FIR is concerned. Some said no FIR was lodged. Some families said they have heard of a complaint being lodged but they do not have papers and some could produce documents,” he said.

Mr. Shaikh said the data of sewer deaths and the FIRs are mostly sent from State governments or district authorities to the National Safai Karmacharis Finance and Development Corporation and in certain cases the authorities report such cases only for compensation. The activist added that there would be only a handful cases in the country where arrests for sewer deaths in the country could have taken place.

The data reveals that of the 920 deaths in 558 cases (60%), compensation of ₹10 lakh has been awarded. In 161 cases (17.5%) compensation of less than ₹10 lakh was awarded. Mr. Wilson asked why despite a Supreme Court order compensation of less than ₹10 lakh was given. In 164 cases (17.8 %) no payment of compensation has not been confirmed. Gujarat has recorded 32 cases of non-payment of compensation and in 30 cases the data states that the legal heir for paying compensation could not be traced. In Tamil Nadu out of nine cases where compensation has not been given in six cases legal heir has not been traced.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4ex0cd/article31069208.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/sewerjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/only-420-firs-for-920-sewer-deaths-in-three-decades-says-activist/article31069156.ece

The Congress alleged on Saturday that the government was lacking in its preparedness to combat COVID-19, with senior leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury demanding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the nation on containment measures taken so far.

Congress’ senior spokesperson Ajay Maken claimed the government’s preparations to tackle coronavirus were not visible.

Asked about BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya’s reported remarks that there were several gods and goddesses in the country and therefore coronavirus can’t cause harm here, Maken said he would not like to comment on it as everyone has their own faith and beliefs, but there were questions over the government’s preparedness in dealing with the spread of the disease.

“Like Rahul (Gandhi) ji has repeatedly said the government’s preparedness is not visible,” Maken told reporters, adding if the government is ready, then the gods and goddesses will also help us, but if it is not, then no help will come.

60,2020/03/14,Congress asks govt. to pass on benefit of fall in crude oil prices to consumers,"Party attacks Modi govt for increasing excise duty on petrol and diesel

The Congress on Saturday demanded that the benefit of a sharp fall in international crude oil prices should be passed on to consumers immediately and attacked the Narendra Modi government for increasing excise duty on petrol and diesel to ensure that retail prices did not come down.

Senior Congress leader Ajay Maken told reporters at a press conference that the government should reduce the rates of petrol, diesel, and LPG by at least 35-40%.

Also read: News Analysis | Why oil prices are crashing

“The Modi-Shah government has looted the people by increasing excise duties and huge taxes on petroleum products and did not bring this under GST despite the consistent demand of Congress,” Mr Maken said after the Centre hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel by a steep ₹3 per litre each, which will fetch an additional revenue ₹39,000 crore.

The Congress leader said that the party will democratically protest both inside and outside Parliament as the government had repeated its 2014-15 act of not passing on the gains arising from slump in crude prices.

Mr Maken said the total incidence of excise duty on petrol had risen to ₹22.98 per litre and that on diesel to ₹18.83.

61,2020/03/14,"‘Hunger for power’ more important for some, says Digvijaya Singh on Scindia joining BJP","Former M.P. CM says he admires RSS for its commitment to ideology

Alluding to Jyotiraditya Scindia joining the BJP after quitting the Congress, former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh on Saturday said “hunger for power” was more important for some than credibility and ideology, the very essence of a healthy democracy.

“I don’t agree to Sangh [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]/BJP at all but admire their commitment to their ideology,” he wrote on Twitter, a day after filing nomination for the Rajya Sabha election. Even after 22 Congress MLAs submitted resignations as legislators, the party, with a reduced 92 seats, has decided to contest two of the three Rajya Sabha seats up for grabs from the State later this month.

But then Hunger of Power is more important to some than Credibility and Ideology the very essence of a Healthy Democracy. I don't agree to Sangh/BJP at all but admire their commitment to their Ideology. — digvijaya singh (@digvijaya_28) March 14, 2020

Also read | Jyotiraditya Scindia has embraced RSS ideology, says Rahul Gandhi

Stating that it was incredulous Mr. Scindia had crossed over, Mr. Singh wrote: “I never expected Maharaj (Sorry as I myself come from a feudal background I don’t address him as Jyotiraditya) to cross over and ditch Congress and Gandhi Family and for what? Rajya Sabha and Cabinet berth under ModiShah? Sad never expected this from him.”

“I am no admirer of Narendra Modi,” he wrote, “and one of his most bitterest critics but then admire his courage of conviction and uncompromising effort to polarise the country on every possible issue and every opportunity”.

Also read | Analysis: Scindia’s rising discontentment in Madhya Pradesh was obvious

Mr. Singh alleged Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not realise the damage he was doing to the country by “destroying the social fabric of the country the very idea of India, the very ethos of Sanatan Dharm and Hinduism”.

Mr. Scindia’s supporters have alleged he was given the short shrift by the Congress, more recently in the selection as a Rajya Sabha election nominee. In contrast, Mr. Singh, speaking about himself, clarified though he stayed out of power for a decade, he was offered posts which he declined, as for him “credibility and ideology is more important which unfortunately has disappeared from Indian political scene. Sad”.

“I stayed out of power and worked for Congress party from 2004 to 2014, in spite of the fact that I was offered to join the Cabinet and get into Rajya Sabha,” he wrote. “But I politely declined.”

Mr. Singh claimed he could have easily come to the Lok Sabha from Rajgarh, his home constituency, but declined and let another candidate win.

Pointing out that the RSS had waited from 1925 to the 1990s to come to power in Delhi without wavering from their ultimate goal “Hindu Rashtra”, he wrote, “They have successfully fooled socialists and particularly JP [Jayaprakash Narayan] and now Nitish [Kumar] to achieve their ultimate goal of a RSS pracharak as PM [Prime Minister] of India.”

Earlier, RSS activists devoted their whole life and left their family to work for the Sangh, he added, but now the new pracharaks had changed. “Narendra Modi is the most glaring example of this new breed of RSS Pracharaks,” he wrote.

In 1970, wrote Mr. Singh, Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia, Mr. Jyotiraditya’s grandmother, wanted him to join Jan Sangh while he was the president of the Raghogarh Nagar Palia, but he refused after reading ‘Bunch of Thoughts’ by M. S. Golwalkar and interacting with RSS leaders.

Explaining that he was brought up by an atheist father and a religious mother, he wrote that to him “Sanatan Dharm and my belief is that of Universal Brotherhood not sectarian belief of Hindutva”.

He added that the belief was further strengthened after meeting Jagadguru Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand, “the most respected and senior most Shankaracharya in India in 1981. And I took “Diksha” from him. To me, my religion is humanism “Insaniyat” which is totally opposite of Hindutva”.

To him, power was to achieve the objective of service to humanity and not power by itself, he wrote.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nybn1d/article31048293.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12DIGVIJAYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hunger-for-power-more-important-for-some-says-digvijaya-singh-on-scindia-joining-bjp/article31067596.ece
62,2020/03/14,Aligarh violence: anti-CAA protester succumbs to gunshot injuries,"Former BJYM leader has been arrested

A 22-year-old who was critically injured on February 23, when an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protest in Aligarh turned violent, succumbed to gunshot injuries on Friday night. A former leader of the Bharatiya Janta Yuva Morcha (BJYM) — the youth wing of the BJP — has been arrested in this regard, while two other accused are on the run.

Mohd. Tariq Munawwar was on ventilator support since March 10. “Tariq had developed multiple complications. The bullet had pierced through his liver, damaged the portal vein and was lodged in the spinal chord. As a result, the lower half of his body was already paralysed,” said Haris Khan, Medical Superintendent, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical Hospital and College. “The body was taken away by the police and the post-mortem was carried out in the government hospital. The bullet could be retrieved now,” he told The Hindu.

Munawwar’s relatives demanded immediate arrest of the other two accused and compensation from the State government.

Earlier, the district administration had announced a compensation of ₹3 lakh to Munawwar.

Local sources said Aligarh remained tense of Friday as the market in the Babri Mandi area, where the incident happened, remained shut.

Abhishek, Superintendent of Police (City), Aligarh, said post-mortem has been done but refused to share any details. “Sector scheme has been imposed in the city, as a precationary measure. In a couple of areas, the situation is tense but under control.” He said Vinay Varshney, a former office-bearer of BJYM, has already been arrested in this case. “The other two, Sunder and Triloki, will also be arrested on the basis of evidence.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/n17rl/article31067331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDRAF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aligarh-violence-anti-caa-protester-succumbs-to-gunshot-injuries/article31067332.ece
63,2020/03/14,Moratorium on Yes Bank to be lifted on March 18,"Government has notified the reconstruction scheme for the crisis-hit bank

The government has notified the reconstruction scheme for crisis-hit Yes Bank, according to which the restrictions on withdrawals from its accounts will be lifted in “three working days” or on March 18.

The Union Cabinet on Friday approved the reconstruction scheme for the bank as proposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), under which the State Bank of India (SBI) will acquire 49% stake in the ailing bank. Four private sector lenders, including ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, will also be picking up stake in the bank.

Watch | Yes Bank crisis explained

Prior to this, on March 5, the RBI placed Yes Bank under a moratorium, restricting withdrawals to ₹50,000 per depositor till April 3. It had also superseded the board and placed it under an administrator, Prashant Kumar, former deputy managing director and CFO of SBI.

“The order of moratorium on the reconstructed bank issued by the Government of India...shall cease to have effect on the third working day at 18:00 hours from the date of commencement of this Scheme,” the notification, issued late on Friday night said, adding that the ‘Yes Bank Reconstruction Scheme 2020’ will come into force on March 13, 2020.

Under the scheme, Mr Kumar has been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of the Bank, with Sunil Mehta, former Non-Executive Chairman of Punjab National Bank as Non Executive Chairman, and Mahesh Krishnamurthy and Atul Bheda as Non-Executive Director. The new board will be formed within seven days from cessation of the moratorium.

Explained: Why did Yes Bank have to be bailed out?

Additionally, SBI will nominate two officers as Directors and the RBI may also appoint one or more persons as additional directors.

The notification states that all employees of the reconstructed bank will continue working with the same remuneration and on the same terms and conditions of service “for a minimum period of one year...provided that the Board of Directors...shall, for reasons to be recorded in writing and after following the due procedure, discontinue the services of the key managerial personnel at any time as it deems necessary.”

It also adds that existing shareholders holding over 100 shares in Yes Bank are subject to a three-year ‘lock-in’ for 75% of their investment. “There shall be a lock-in period of three years from the commencement of this Scheme to the extent of seventy-five per cent in respect of–– (a) shares held by existing shareholders on the date of such commencement; (b) shares allotted to the investors under this Scheme: Provided that the said lock-in period shall not apply to any shareholder holding less than one hundred shares.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/eixgfo/article31067239.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDYESBANK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/moratorium-on-yes-bank-to-be-lifted-on-march-18/article31067240.ece
64,2020/03/14,"Govt raises excise duty on petrol, diesel by ₹3 per litre","Centre looks to mop up gains arising from fall in international oil prices.

Excise duty on petrol and diesel was on Saturday hiked by ₹3 per litre as the government looked to mop up gains arising from fall in international oil prices.

Special excise duty on petrol was hiked by ₹2 to ₹8 per litre and ₹4 in the case of diesel, an official notification said.

News Analysis | Why oil prices are crashing

Additionally, road cess on petrol was raised by ₹1 per litre each on petrol and diesel to ₹10.

The increase in excise duty would in normal course result in a hike in petrol and diesel prices but most of it would be adjusted against the fall in rates that would have necessitated because of slump in international oil prices.

The oil price war from a geopolitical perspective | The Hindu In Focus Podcast

Increase in revenues

Officials said the increase in excise duty will result in annual increase of government revenues by about ₹39,000 crore. The gains during the remaining three weeks of the current fiscal would be less than ₹2,000 crore.

Petrol and diesel prices, which are changed on a daily basis, were cut by 13 paise and 16 paise respectively as oil companies adjusted the excise duty hike against the drop in prices that warrants from international rates slumping the most since the Gulf war.

Petrol now cost ₹69.87 a litre in Delhi and a litre of diesel comes for ₹62.58.

The government had between November 2014 and January 2016 raised excise duty on petrol and diesel on nine occasions to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices.

In all, duty on petrol rate was hiked by ₹1.77 per litre and that on diesel by 13.47 a litre in those 15 months that helped government’s excise mop up more than double to ₹2,42,000 crore in 2016-17 from ₹99,000 crore in 2014-15.

It cut excise duty by R₹2 in October 2017 and by ₹1.50 a year later. But it raised excise duty by ₹2 per litre in July 2019.

Government sources said that while the benefit of reduction of crude prices in the first quarter of this year has significantly gone to the consumer, the Centre has taken this step of increasing duty to raise some revenue in view of a tight fiscal situation. This would help in generating the resources for development of infrastructure and other developmental items of expenditure, they said.

Benchmark crude oil prices have halved since January to USD 32 per barrel. In sync with this, the prices of petrol and diesel have also come down by more than ₹ 6 per litre (from ₹ 76.01 a litre on January 11, 2020 to ₹69.87 a litre on March 14 for petrol, and from ₹69.17 to ₹ 62.58 for diesel during the same period in Delhi.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/wch32o/article30964657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-PETROLAVD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-raises-excise-duty-on-petrol-diesel-by-3-per-litre/article31067184.ece
65,2020/03/14,MPs slam budget outlay for weaker sections,"Urge count of OBCs in forthcoming census

Opposition members in Lok Sabha on Friday targeted the Centre for not providing adequate allocation for Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST)and Other Backward Classes (OBC) in the 2020-21 Budget.

Lok Sabha members, taking part in the discussion on Demands for Grants of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, asked that the upcoming population census should also undertake a count of the OBCs.

Initiating the debate, Congress’ K. Suresh said the government has applied “dubious and clever method” for allocation of resources to SC/STs in the Budget.

“The government has been ignoring SC/ST in a systematic manner... This is not a pro- SC/ST budget; this is a assault on their existence,” the MP from Mavelikara said and alleged that the BJP government has been trying to dilute the reservation norms.

The BJP’s Pritam Gopinath Munde demanded that allocation for the OBCs should be hiked as they constitute a substantial portion of the population.

Amol Kolhe of the NCP said in the next census there should be a separate column for OBCs so that there is a population count.

BJP’s Ganesh Singh countered the Opposition charge by claiming that the Modi government has been hiking allocation for SC/STs and OBCs every year while the previous Congress government did not do so.

Mr Singh also asserted that the concept of creamy layer should not be there till all the vacant seats meant for reserved candidates are filled.

DMK’s T. Sumathy said the government should take steps for implementation of 33% reservation for women in Parliament. “We are still fighting for this. Reservation is our birth right,” she said.

She also alleged injustice has been done to OBC students by the Medical Council of India as they are not properly implementing the 27% for these students.

Union Minister for Environment Prakash Javadekar said on Friday his Ministry has asked for city-level plans for the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) as these problems need to be dealt with at the local level. He was replying to a question in the Lok Sabha.

“Every city has different pollutants and the sources also vary,” Mr. Javadekar said. Replying to another question, he said water bodies in the country are polluted because 70% of sewage goes untreated.

Sewage in Ganga

“People used to say ‘Ganga maile ho gayi papiyon ke paap dhote dhote (the Ganga has become dirty washing off the sins of sinners)’. But this not true,” the Minister said, stating that it was untreated sewage and not the misdeeds of pilgrims that the was a major source of pollution.

He added that in the past the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) was built and operated by different entities which created problems. “Now, we have decided that those who build and operate the sewage treatment plants are the same. They will operate the plant for 10 years,” he said.

Answering questions on polluting industries, he said that 342 out of 700 industries inspected by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) have been found violating environmental norms and causing pollution in the last four years.

68,2020/03/14,Pehlu case: minors to go to special home,"Six persons accused of having led the attack were acquitted by a Sessions Court last year

Two minors convicted of participating in the 2017 murder of dairy farmer Pehlu Khan as members of a mob were on Friday sentenced to three years stay in a special home by Alwar’s Juvenile Justice Board (JJB).

Six persons accused of having led the attack were acquitted by a Sessions Court last year.

The convicts, who were minors below the age of 16 when they committed the crime, are now aged between 18 and 21. They are likely to be shifted to the special home on the premises of the Central Jail in Jaipur.

The JJB had last week held the two minors guilty under Sections 302 (murder), 147 (rioting), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 341 (wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code. The JJB relied on video footage of the crime scene to reach its judgment.

The JJB had relied on the video footage of the crime scene, which showed the presence of the two minors in the mob, as well as other evidence, as the basis for reaching its judgment. Another juvenile, who was older than 16 in 2017, is facing trial as a regular accused in a court in Alwar, where his case was transferred since the offences for which he is being tried are covered in the category of ‘heinous’ crimes.

Khan, 55, a dairy farmer from Haryana’s Nuh district, his two sons and a few others were waylaid by self-styled cow vigilantes near Behror on the Jaipur-Delhi National Highway on April 1, 2017, and assaulted grievously on the purported suspicion that they were smuggling cows for slaughter. Khan succumbed to his injuries two days later in a hospital.

The sentence was handed down under Section 18(1)(g) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, providing that a child found to be in conflict with law may be sent to a special home for a maximum period of three years for getting reformative services, including education, skill development, counselling, behaviour modification therapy, and psychiatric support.

The Alwar sessions court had acquitted six accused in the case on August 14, 2019, giving them the benefit of doubt on the basis of the police probe. Those let off by the court were Vipin Yadav, Kalu Ram, Dayanand, Ravindra Kumar, Yogesh Kumar and Bheem Rathi.

The State government filed an appeal in the Rajasthan High Court against the sessions court’s verdict after a Special Investigation Team pointed out loopholes in the probe conducted earlier by four investigating officers.

The High Court had earlier quashed the case of illegal transport of cattle for slaughter against Khan, his sons and the owner of the pick-up truck in which they were travelling. The court had ruled that Khan had purchased the animals for dairy and not slaughter.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pehlu-case-minors-to-go-to-special-home/article31065087.ece
69,2020/03/14,‘No party can keep MLAs under lock and key’,"BJP leader says that when Jyotiraditya Scindia deserted Congress, the rest of the MLAs followed suit

The BJP’s Madhya Pradesh party in-charge, Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, says the Congress must introspect on why it could not retain a leader of Jyotiraditya Scindia’s stature

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath met Governor Lalji Tandon today and has accused the BJP of keeping 21 Congress MLAs under duress. How do you react to that charge?

It is childish to say the least. No political party can really keep MLAs, adult grown-ups, under lock and key.

It is obvious that all of them owe their allegiance to Shri Jyotiraditya Scindia, and since Mr. Scindia had deserted the Congress, the rest of the MLAs followed suit. It is as clear as that. Where is the question of spiriting them away?

Also read: Kamal Nath government will survive BJP machinations: Bhupesh Baghel

What about a floor test for the Madhya Pradesh government?

Whichever way, the Chief Minister cannot escape a test of strength in any scenario. For example, if the Governor asks for a test of strength, he cannot avoid it.

Even if the Governor does not ask him, the Opposition can move some motion that will ensure that the government is a lameduck government. It doesn’t have the requisite majority in the House. Either way, the government will have to face a test of strength and if they are so confident of their numbers as they are stating, if not the government should resign.

Also read: Analysis: Scindia’s rising discontentment in Madhya Pradesh was obvious

The Congress has been making a charge on moral grounds that whenever the BJP is denied an electoral majority, it engineers one.

There is absolutely no question of engineering a majority, at least in this case. Everybody knows the standing of Jyotiraditya Scindia in the Congress; he is not just a leader of Madhya Pradesh but he has a national stature as well.

Unfortunately, the Congress, for its own reasons, could not keep him in good humour and he also saw that it was purposeless to remain in the Congress — all issues that the Congress had to address.

If the Congress-led government falls, who will be the BJP’s Chief Minister?

In politics and especially when things are in such a flux, it is a gradual unfolding of scenarios.

Therefore, everything will be taken care of in due course of time. I wouldn’t want to comment on this issue because it may, unnecessarily, create a misunderstanding one way or the other.

I asked this question because it’s being said that instead of former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the choice may fall on Union Minister Narendra Tomar.

Which is why I said there is a progressive unfolding, let things mature and everyone will come to know in due course.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fdfgcl/article31063075.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14TH-SA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-party-can-keep-mlas-under-lock-and-key/article31063076.ece
70,2020/03/14,Yet another case against Yes Bank’s Rana Kapoor,"Alleged illegal gratification of ₹307 cr. for concessions in loan repayments to Avantha Group companies

The Central Bureau of Investigation on Friday conducted searches in another case against Rana Kapoor, the then Yes Bank promoter director, his wife Bindu and others in connection with alleged illegal gratification of ₹307 crore for concessions in loan repayments and more credit facilities to Avantha Group (AG) companies.

The amount was paid allegedly through sale of a Lutyens’ Delhi bungalow on Amrita Shergill Marg, against a declared value of ₹685 crore, for only ₹378 crore to Bliss Abode Private Limited, in which Ms. Kapoor was a director.

The CBI alleges that in January, the total outstanding against various loans from Yes Bank to the AG entities stood at ₹1,900 crore. “Searches were carried out in the National Capital Region and Mumbai, on the premises of Mr. Kapoor, his wife, office of Avantha Realty Limited (ARL), Bliss Abode and another private company,” said an official.

Thapar named

In the second FIR, Gautam Thapar, promoter of the Avantha Group of companies, has also been named as an accused, apart from ARL and Bliss Abode.

The agency alleges that as part of the conspiracy, a loan of ₹400 crore was sanctioned to ARL in March 2016 for 10 years, despite its poor financial condition. Yes Bank had already extended credit facilities of about ₹2,500 crore to various group entities prior to the ₹400 crore loan, which was used to clear the dues of ICICI Bank and Development Credit Bank for loans to Avantha Holding, a group entity.

The Lutyens’ property, used as a collateral, was earlier evaluated in ICICI Bank’s report as worth ₹550 crore in March 2016. Yes Bank report had priced it at ₹500 crore. Mr. Kapoor then headed the bank’s management credit committee, which cleared the loan and also allowed the release of property for repayment.

On the pretext of repaying the loan, the property was allegedly sold to Bliss Abode after the bank, under Mr. Kapoor, issued a no-objection certificate to it in September 2017.

Yes Bank did not press for sale of any other asset of AG group companies for recovering dues, even when other loan accounts had turned non-performing assets. The bank rather extended more credits of ₹515 crore to Oyster Buildwell and ₹650 crore to Solaris Chemtech Industries, the agency alleges.

According to the FIR, Bliss Abode had already got ₹90 crore in loan from India Bulls Housing Finance Limited (IBHFL) on July 13, 2017, allegedly against the Amrita Shergill Marg property.

71,2020/03/14,"BJP wants population control law, Devanagiri promotion","Harnath Singh Yadav calls for a stringent two-child policy

Stringent population control laws with punitive measures to curb population growth and writing of all 22 official languages in Devanagari script were some of the suggestions made by BJP members in the Rajya Sabha on Friday.

BJP MPs from Uttar Pradesh, Harnath Singh Yadav and Shiv Pratap Shukla, made these recommendations while speaking during Zero Hour.

Mr. Shukla said regional languages were keepers of Indian tradition and heritage but they remain hidden as the larger populace had no access to it. “Out of all languages, Hindi is spoken and understood in every corner of the country. So I suggest that all 22 official languages must be written in Devanagari script,” Mr. Shukla said, speaking in Hindi.

He argued that if the languages were available in Devanagari script then it could be understood by not only parliamentarians but also by everyone.

His comments were met with loud protests from MDMK member Vaiko.

Speaking on the need for a population control law, Mr. Yadav said that as per the 1951 census, India’s population was 36 crore, by 2011 it grew to 121 crore and by 2025 it was expected to be 150 crore. He blamed the population explosion for unemployment, food scarcity, malnutrition, poverty, agrarian crisis, and water scarcity. “We will not have water to drink. Currently each Indian has 1,525 cubic metres of water available, by 2025 this will be down to 1,060,” Mr. Yadav said.

For a ‘golden future’ of the country, the BJP MP said it was essential to rise above political, religious and casteist differences to bring in a strong law for population control. He said there should be a stringent two-child policy.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/u0m9cy/article31062927.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THSHIVPRATAPSHUKLA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-wants-population-control-law-devanagiri-promotion/article31062928.ece

73,2020/03/14,Fully geared to ensure peaceful conduct of elections: DGP,"He urges people to use Nigha App or ‘Dial 100’ to report poll code violations

The police department is fully geared to ensure peaceful conduct of the local body elections in the State, Director General of Police D. Gautam Sawang has said.

The elections are scheduled to be conducted from March 21 to 31 in the State.

Addressing the media at the A.P. Police Headquarters at Mangalagiri near here on Saturday, Mr. Gautam Sawang said that steps had been taken to check distribution of liquor and money to influence the voters. “Vigil has been heightened at all border check-posts,” the DGP said.

Tight security

About one lakh police personnel, who included APSP, CRPF and forces from the neighbouring States, would be deployed to ensure smooth conduct of the elections. Satellite phones, VHF-based handsets and body-worn cameras would be used. Remote Area Communication Enforcement (RACE) vehicles would also be pressed into service to identify black spots, the DGP said.

Aerial survey would be conducted using helicopters and drones in the Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-affected areas. If necessary, helicopters would be used to shift the police forces and ballot boxes, Mr. Gautam Sawang said.

“In all, 389 border check-posts have been set up to prevent the entry of criminals and check the transport of liquor and money from the neighbouring States. Senior police officers of the rank of SP, DIG and IGP will be posted in each district to prevent any untoward incidents,” the DGP added.

“For the first time, the Nigha App has been introduced to check flow of money and liquor during the elections. Candidates caught distributing liquor and cash in violation of the model code of conduct will be imprisoned for two years. People are requested to alert the police over ‘Dial 100’, 112, or the Nigha App in this regard,” he said.

Of the 18,133 MTPC/ZPTC booths, 1,915 were identified as hypersensitive and 2,849 as sensitive. Similarly, of the 3,711 municipal booths, 476 were identified as hypersensitive and 709 as sensitive. In the gram panchayats, out of 27,735 booths, 3,053 were hypersensitive and 4,399 sensitive.

Striking forces, special striking forces, strongrooms and mobile striking forces would also be deployed at all the booths, the DGP added.

74,2020/03/14,"Conduct local body polls under ECI watch, demands Kanna","‘SEC and State police have turned mute spectators to YSRCP’s wrongdoings’

BJP State president Kanna Lakshminarayana has demanded that the Election Commission of India (ECI) conduct the local body elections in the State with the support of the Central police forces.

This was essential as both the State Election Commission (SEC) and the State police were playing the role of a spectator even as the YSRCP cadres went on the rampage, Mr. Lakshminarayana said while addressing the ‘Meet the Press’ programme organised by the A.P. Working Journalists’ Federation here on Saturday.

The State BJP would make a representation to the ECI in this regard, he said.

Ideal choice

The SEC was practically non-existent as the government usurped its powers, he observed, and asserted that the BJP-JSP alliance was the ideal choice for the voters as both the YSRCP and the TDP cheated the people. The TDP did not conduct elections to the local bodies during its term, he added.

Mr. Lakshminarayana said people had paid the price for electing the TDP in 2014 elections, and there was nothing much to write about the YSRCP as it had been implementing a slew of welfare schemes at the cost of development.

‘Naidu betrayed BJP’

The people had voted for the TDP-BJP-JSP combine in 2014. But after coming to power, TDP president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had damaged the image of BJP by making false accusations that the Central government reneged on its promises to develop the State despite receiving substantial financial and institutional support from it.

More than the BJP, it was the TDP that suffered a major electoral loss in 2019 as people gave the YSRCP a chance.

After trouncing Mr. Naidu, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy showed his true colours and his government’s policies put the State on the backtrack, Mr. Lakshminarayana said.

He observed that the attacks on the candidates of the TDP, the BJP and other parties in the run-up to the elections revealed Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s feeling of insecurity.

“The proposal to have three capitals has impacted development of the State. Law and order has collapsed. Corruption has became rampant. The increase in electricity charges, RTC bus fare, and prices of petrol and diesel far outweighed the benefits given under welfare schemes. The YSRCP should, therefore, be sent packing,” he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/mja9f8/article31070900.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15VJPG4-KANNA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/conduct-local-body-polls-under-eci-watch-demands-kanna/article31070901.ece
75,2020/03/14,Ensuring reservation for trans persons is her primary goal,"Madhuri becomes first transgender woman to contest for the post of corporator

The time has come for society to lend an ear to the voice of the transgender persons, says K. Madhuri, the first trans woman who is contesting as corporator in the State.

Ms. Madhuri filed her nomination papers as YSRCP candidate from the 10th ward of Nandikotkur on Friday.

“In 2014, I had contested as an independent as no party gave me ticket. This time, the YSRCP has accepted my candidature,” she said.

Ms. Madhuri hit the headlines a couple of years ago when she became the first trans person in the State to enrol herself for a PG course in Rayalaseema University. Prior to that she had been advocating for transgender rights.

“Ensuring reservation for transgender persons is my main goal. On the lines of reservation being extended to various castes, we too need reservation to make sure that our voices are heard,” Ms. Madhuri said. “Even one percent reservation will make a lot of difference,” she added.

“How long should we be oppressed? Should we confine ourselves to begging?” she questioned.

‘Separate corporation needed’

Talking about her long-term goal, Ms. Madhuri said she would work for setting up a corporation for transgenders on the lines of the ones that existed for the BCs, SCs and STs.

“The corporation will help transgender persons gain access to loans for education or starting businesses. It will empower and help us follow our dreams,” she added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ensuring-reservation-for-trans-persons-is-her-primary-goal/article31070890.ece
76,2020/03/14,Will BJP-JSP alliance halt YSRCP march?,"Sounding sceptical, senior leaders say it will instead harm TDP more

In 2014, Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena Party (JSP) had supported the BJP-TDP alliance, and helped it come to power in the State by defeating the YSRCP by a slender margin in the overall vote percentage.

After three years, the JSP withdrew its support to the alliance. In 2019, the JSP made its electoral debut by entering into an alliance with the Left parties.

It, however, suffered a severe drubbing in the elections as it could win just one Assembly seat and drew a blank as far as the Lok Sabha seats are concerned. Mr. Pawan Kalyan himself could not win from the two Assembly constituencies he was in the fray.

For the local body elections, the JSP has tied up with the BJP. The alliance looks good on paper.

Challenging task

Given the short campaign period of seven days, it is facing a challenge in making its stand clear on local issues as well as on the government’s decision to make Visakhapatnam the Executive capital, as in principle both the parties are opposed to it.

Senior leaders in the alliance, however, are sceptical about the outcome for which both the parties have joined hands – to scuttle the YSRCP march. A few leaders are of the view that the JSP-BJP alliance may harm the TDP more as its votes may be split, benefiting the YSRCP the most.

“In 2014, when the TDP won, its vote share over the YSRCP was slender, and the difference was due to the JSP’s support. In 2019, the TDP had lost the elections. The withdrawal of support by the JSP had an impact on the TDP’s vote share. In the local body elections, the alliance is likely to cause more harm to the TDP than the YSRCP,” observed a senior JSP leader.

In 2007 when election was conducted for the 72-ward Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation, the total electorate was close to 12 lakh. The Congress had won majority of the wards then. This time round, the number of wards has gone up to 98, and the electorate is close to 18 lakh.

With the chances of the Congress regaining ground not bright, the fight is between the TDP, the YSRC and BJP-JSP combine.

“In any triangular contest, one party gains from the loss of the other parties. In this case, the YSRCP may be at an advantage,” said a senior BJP leader.

‘Target 2024’

But what is to be read from the alliance is its experimental value. In 2014, the BJP-JSP combine worked well for TDP. Keeping that in mind, the BJP, which is keen on getting a foothold in the State, is experimenting by tying up with the JSP.

“Our target is not the local polls. Our aim is to win the 2024 general elections,” said a senior JSP leader.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/will-bjp-jsp-alliance-halt-ysrcp-march/article31070875.ece
77,2020/03/14,India not a sanctuary for illegal immigrants: Bitta,"CAA, NRC are required, says AIATF chairman

All India Anti-Terrorist Front (AIATF) chairman Maninderjit Singh Bitta said that the country is not a ‘dharamshala’ (sanctuary) for illegal immigrants.

“India is not a ‘dharamshala’ for outsiders to sneak in unlawfully and claim the rights that are extended to citizens. It is unfortunate that illegal immigrants from neighboring countries of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are bent on securing rights that are only offered to native citizens by securing false identity papers. This should not be allowed to happen,” Mr. Bitta said.

“The country has always belonged to Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians, and will continue to remain so. It is only the native residents who can claim the right over the land irrespective of the religion they belong to, and not outsiders who are gaining illegal entry into the country,” he said.

Speaking to the media on Saturday, Mr. Bitta said that the Constitutional (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Registry of Citizens are required in the larger interests of the country. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi deserves credit for this,” Mr. Bitta said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/india-not-a-sanctuary-for-illegal-immigrants-bitta/article31070392.ece
78,2020/03/14,Election after 18 years enthuses denizens,"Renewing UGD network need of the hour in Tirupati Municipal Corporation

It is heartening to see denizens preparing to exercise their franchise in the elections to the Municipal Corporation of Tirupati (MCT) after a gap of 18 years.

The town was formed in 1886 and upgraded as selection grade municipality in 1998. As the Tirupati Municipal Council (TMC), it last went to polls in 2002 and the elected panel led by TDP’s K. Sankar Reddy stepped down in 2007 after completing its term.

Though upgraded into a municipal corporation immediately, the temple city never went for polls till date, with hurdles in the form of claims, counter-claims and, eventually, litigations. An entire generation of voters has been denied the chance of choosing its local rulers, leaving the entire process to the discretion of the official machinery. In the absence of politically-elected mayoral candidate, the bureaucrats ‘gave their solutions’ rather than listening to the people’s woes.

The silver lining, of course, was the absence of political interference for nearly two decades that ensured smooth completion of projects as per deadline, without deviation or jeopardy.

Drainage system

The city’s population was 3,74,260 as per 2011 Census, but the inclusion of major abutting villages almost doubles the number today. Tirupati pioneered the underground drainage (UGD) system and brought almost the entire city under its network today, barring some outlying colonies. However, failure in planning is glaring in the form of insufficient forecast for at least three decades, with most of the drains in the heart of the city getting choked frequently.

As the town transformed into a city, single floor houses became multi-storeyed complexes or apartments and larger premises metamorphosed into shopping malls, more so in the city’s core area. The smaller pipelines laid nearly two decades back is insufficient to meet the flow of sewage water, making pipe leakage a regular affair. ""We often find water seepage and the manholes are kept open frequently, especially in the smaller lanes,"" points out Sunkara Balasaraswathi, a resident of Chintakayala Street.

There is a vocal demand to dig out the old, smaller pipelines and re-lay the entire network suitable to meet the growing demand.

The city administrators have successfully covered most of the open drains, diverted sewer lines and ensured shifting of solid waste to its vermicompost away from the city. As the brick-based storm water drains were found to be worn out, the civic body took up their replacement with concrete walls across the city. The process is cleared in most of the arterial roads as and when funds were sanctioned, while the internal roads await action.

Similarly, most of the old borewells, dug long back and numbering nearly a dozen in each of the 50 divisions, are in a state of disuse. As the scorching summer has set in, the MCT is focussing more on distribution of water through tankers or encouraging Telugu Ganga connection to every household.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/7qx5ld/article31070321.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/223380052col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/election-after-18-years-enthuses-denizens/article31070322.ece
79,2020/03/14,Vizag thirsting for solutions,"An ever-widening gulf between demand and supply of water is poised to take a toll on the city’s growth

Visakhapatnam city is desperate for a lasting solution to its water problems.

With all its major sources of water located outside the city, and with no perennial river to bank on, the city finds itself in the throes of an acute water scarcity every summer.

In a worrying trend for the past decade or so, the water scarcity is now being felt not just in the summer but for most part of the year, say residents.

Areas like Yendada and Madhurawada, which were once sparsely populated, have now become bustling residential areas. Other suburbs like Pendurthi and Sujathanagar too are witnessing a construction boom.

The YSRCP Government’s announcement of making Visakhapatnam the State’s Executive capital has spurred development even in far-flung outskirts. However, the issue of water scarcity is expected to be a huge stumbling block.

Against a demand of 90 to 95 MGD of water, 75 MGD is being supplied to meet domestic needs. In the last summer, the supply further dipped to 65 MGD. With groundwater levels also plummeting in some areas, residents were forced to opt for water tankers.

Polavaram hopes fade

Commencement of work on the Polavaram project by the erstwhile Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy Government came as a ray of hope for the city, which was supposed to get 23 TMC of water for its industrial and domestic needs. Storage reservoirs on the city outskirts were also on the cards. However, the plans never materialised.

The city witnessed one of its worst water crises in 2010, after which it was proposed to lay a pipeline from the Yeleru reservoir to the city, a distance of 150 km. However, this too did not work out.

Meanwhile, after the bifurcation of the State, work began in full swing on the Polavaram project and a pumping scheme on its Left Main Canal at Purushotapatnam was completed by the Chandrababu Naidu Government.

Despite both the monsoons failing last year, the GVMC has been able to supply water to major parts of the city owing to pumping of water from the Godavari to the Yeleru reservoir. However, some parts still suffered as the transmissions mains are not in place to pump surplus water to needy areas. As a result, wards 1 to 6 comprising Arilova, Yendada and Madhurawada suffered acute shortage of water last year.

Way out

The only solution to meet the growing needs is to construct storage reservoirs for water to be available from Polavaram Left Main Canal or to go in for a pipeline. Initially, storage reservoirs for 5 TMC had been proposed and locations identified but the plans never took off. ""It is difficult to build storage reservoirs as it is interlinked with agriculture and requires land acquisition,"" said a senior engineer.

With the drinking water demand for Visakhapatnam projected at 135.75 MGD and that of municipalities and villages en route at 191 MGD by 2050, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy mooted a pipeline from the Polavaram project to bring water.

The 210-km pipeline is estimated to cost ₹3,100 crore. The pipeline is intended to meet the needs of municipalities and villages en route too. Laying the pipeline abutting the Polavaram canal is preferred as it does not involve land acquisition.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/5jigcd/article31070285.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/213552533col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vizag-thirsting-for-solutions/article31070286.ece
80,2020/03/14,"Too many Mayors, not enough growth in Vijayawada","Vijayawada has seen 11 Mayors over the years, but is still beset by a lack of basic facilities

The city of Vijayawada, a selection grade municipality for several decades, was upgraded to a municipal corporation 39 years ago.

The Left parties won the first municipal elections in the city in 1981, with three of its leaders getting elected to the office of the Mayor for five years.

In subsequent years, all major political parties such as the Congress, Telugu Desam Party and CPI and CPI(M) ruled the city for at least nine years each till 2019. In all, 11 Mayors were at the helm though elections were conducted only for six terms, thanks to alliances and power-sharing pacts between parties.

While all political parties claim to have played a key role in the city’s development, a walk through its thoroughfares leaves one with little doubt that the city is still deprived of basic urban infrastructure.

Also Read Vizag thirsting for solutions

Open drains, encroached or non-existent footpaths, dysfunctional traffic signals, narrow roads, and a lack of amenities such as bus shelters, parks and flyovers have left the city struggling to cope with the rising population.

Town planning has taken a backseat with officials focusing solely on revenue collection on which the city is dependent. Successive State governments meanwhile have done little for the sustainability of the civic body.

Only recently, the government sanctioned ₹150 crore for developing roads in the city. The previous government removed the burden of paying salaries to the VMC employees of the civic body by ensuring the release of salaries through the State treasury.

At present, several projects are pending on paper and on the ground-level for years. Some projects are learnt to be pending for over a decade.

The Kanakadurga Flyover, on which work began in November 2015, is still under construction even as two State Governments changed and missed nearly a dozen deadlines. Similarly, the Central government-sponsored stormwater drainage project whose works began in November 2016 is still under construction, posing severe hardships to the public.

One project that managed to see the light of day recently was the Benz Circle Flyover which was part of the Vijayawada-Machilipatnam highway expansion project. Work began on the 2.3 km-long flyover in 2016 and was completed recently.

On the other hand, the city suburbs are still deprived of infrastructure such as underground drainage, proper drinking water facility, roads and others though they became part of the corporation long ago.

Gunadala, Bhavanipuram, Payakapuram, Patamata and Kundavari Kandrika were merged into the corporation in 1985 and recently, Jakkampudi was also merged into the corporation.

Outdated infra

However, barring Patamata and Bhavanipuram, the other areas are still far from being developed. Also, new colonies coming up in Ajith Singh Nagar, Gunadala and other areas are lacking basic facilities.

The city has underground drainage lines that are over 50 years old in some areas. In contrast, there are many areas which are not even connected to the drainage network.

Also Read Election after 18 years enthuses denizens

The Gunadala flyover project pending for a decade was revisited by the new Government and orders have been given to resume the project, but nothing has materialised yet. Completion of the flyover would spur development in Carmel Nagar and adjacent areas which are close to the city but are separated by a railway track and two canals.

Meanwhile, underground drainage has been the biggest concern for the public as well as the civic body as overflowing drains are a regular sight in many areas. Indicating the same, complaints against UGD top the grievances registered with the corporation every day.

The city is struggling to have a proper signalling system for over a decade due to the lack of funds and coordination between the police and town planning wing of the corporation.

For the same reason, encroachment on the city roads has become a common sight and encroachers even have the support of the local politicians. In some cases, even properties of bureaucrats have occupied footpaths forcing pedestrians to walk on the roads despite the availability of pavements.

One aspect of development that was constant in the city was the expansion of major roads and improvement of sanitation in important areas and busy roads due to initiatives like Swachh Bharath and others. Yet road congestion is a major cause of concern in many areas like Governorpet, One Town, Patamata which reflect a lack of vision and poor urban planning by the previously elected bodies.

No political party was able to provide proper spaces for the city youth to play sports and games and the Indira Gandhi Municipal Corporation Stadium has been misused for political meetings by all the parties.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sacyqc/article31070262.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/223339772col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/too-many-mayors-not-enough-growth/article31070263.ece

Under the programme, students will be given kits comprising three pairs of uniform cloth, textbooks, set of notebooks, a pair of shoes and two pairs of socks, a belt and a school bag.

Panel constituted

A high-level committee has been constituted to prepare, evaluate and approve the tender and procure the material through e-procurement process with reverse tendering.

The State Election Commission has restrained the government from carrying out all housing-related activities, including the scheduled distribution of house site title deeds on Ugadi, till the completion of the process of elections to local bodies keeping the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) in view.

State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar stated in a press release that the code came into force on March 7 and the announcement of new schemes or implementation of the existing ones in a manner that would have a bearing on the outcome of elections amounts to violating the code.

Besides, the distribution of house site pattas during the elections was challenged in the High Court. The government should, therefore, suspend the housing programmes forthwith, Mr. Ramesh Kumar directed.

Mr. Kumar clarified that tenders for construction of houses should not be invited, tokens should not be given to the beneficiaries and officers and staff of revenue and other line departments should not be entrusted with any work related to the housing schemes.

Directive to officials

District Collectors, election officers, and observers have to keep a close watch on such programmes to ensure that the code was adhered to.

86,2020/03/14,Rebels in no mood to relent in Vizianagaram,"97 independents may mar fortunes of many candidates in civic polls

Multi-corner contest is likely in almost all the 50 wards of the Vizianagaram Municipal Corporation as rebels seem to be not willing to withdraw their nominations in spite of the efforts of top leaders of the YSRCP and the Telugu Desam Party. Between the two, the YSRCP is feeling the rebel heat more as official candidates are facing competition from 22 of their own party leaders who filed nominations as independents in various wards.

As many as 413 nominations were filed for the 50 wards – 104 from YSRCP, 152 from TDP, 27 from BJP, 17 from Congress, 4 from BSP and 2 from CPI(M).

The contest by 97 independents assumes significance in the corporation elections as slender margins could change the fortunes of the candidates. Twenty-two independents who entered the fray with the support of former Municipal Chairperson Avanapu Suribabu’s family are drawing the attention of many, since a majority of them have a good following in their respective divisions.

Suribabu’s wife Avanapu Chinnammalu, son Vikram and daughter-in-law Bhavana have already filed their nominations as independents with much fanfare after they were denied tickets by the YSRCP, with which they have a long association.

YSRCP general secretary and a relative of Avanapu family Kalla Gowri Sankar said that the independents would not withdraw their nominations since they had enough winning chances.

Kolagatla confident

Meanwhile, MLA Kolagatla Veerabhadra Swamy ruled out any significant impact by the rebel candidates on the party’s winning chances. He said people were keen to extend their wholehearted support to the ruling party due to the effective implementation of various welfare schemes by the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy government.

TDP Vizianagaram unit in charge Aditi Gajapathi Raju, who issued B-forms to the candidates on Saturday evening, said that the party’s strength remained intact in all the 50 wards because of the developmental activities taken up by the Chandrababu Naidu government during 2014-19 in the municipal limits.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rebels-in-no-mood-to-relent-in-vizianagaram/article31069882.ece
87,2020/03/14,Social distancing measures are key to limit spread of COVID-19: expert,"‘Avoid large public gatherings, follow personal hygiene practices’

Social distancing measures are the only way to limit spread of COVID-19, said GITAM Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (GIMSR) Hospital Respiratory Medicine Department Associate Professor K. Venkateswara Rao here on Saturday. He was delivering a special talk on COVID-19 during the GITAM Research Forum meeting.

He said that social distancing involves minimising exposure to infected individuals by avoiding large public gathering venues, adhering to spacing requirements in the workplace and following proper personal hygiene practices.

“For an individual, it refers to maintaining enough distance between yourself and another person (at least two metres) to reduce the risk of breathing in droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. People should also avoid handshakes,” he said. He narrated the origin of COVID-19 and its spread throughout the world.

92,2020/03/14,BJP complains against YSRCP’s ‘excesses’,"Party leaders urge Election Observer to hold re-election for seats where there is no contest

Complaints of ‘high-handedness’ and physical assault by activists of the ruling YSR Congress Party were made to the Chittoor district Election Observer Siddharth Jain here on Friday.

A delegation of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders led by its State general secretary G. Bhanuprakash Reddy met Mr. Jain at the MCT office and submitted a representation stating how the candidates of the BJP and its ally the Jana Sena were physically assaulted, their nomination papers torn and their four-wheelers and motorcycles menacingly attacked by unruly mobs.

Two incidents

The party mentioned two incidents – in Sodam and Thottambedu mandals of the district – in which their members were manhandled. The party also lodged complaints on a section of officials for playing second fiddle to the ruling party and staying indifferent to the goings-on right in front of their eyes. Mr. Bhanuprakash Reddy demanded that the results on seats declared ‘without contest’ be stalled and re-election held so as to undo the damage.

Former MLA ‘insulted’

Similarly, members of the YSR Congress Party allegedly insulted former legislator M. Sugunamma when she tried to reach the Tirupati municipal corporation office building.

The ruling party activists allegedly closed down the gates, barred candidates of rival parties from entering the premises, leave alone file their nominations, it was alleged.

Ms. Sugunamma had to return home fuming.

93,2020/03/14,TDP defections may give YSRCP an edge in Prakasam,"385 file papers for ZPTCs, 3,806 for MPTCs

The YSR Congress Party seems to have an upper hand in the elections to the urban and rural local bodies in Prakasam district following the exit of key leaders from the Opposition Telugu Desam Party, including Chirala MLA Karanam Balarama Krishnamurthy and MLC Pothula Sunitha on the poll eve.

A team of YSRCP leaders led by Energy Minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy hand-picked the nominees for the 50 divisions in Ongole Municipal Corporation as also for 55 ZPTCs and 742 MPTCs which go to polls as prestige is at stake for the ruling party.

The TDP leaders could tilt the balance in favour of the ruling party in the local body elections in several of the Assembly segments including Chirala, Parchur, Addanki, S.N.Padu, Darsi and Kandukur.

Ms. Gangada Sujatha and Ms. K. Kamala, aspirants for the post of Mayor, were among the over 270 candidates who filed their papers in the 50 Divisions. TDP city unit president K. Nageswara Rao has also thrown his hat in the ring. Others in the fray from the YSRCP include former muncipal councillors E. Suresh Babu, E. Madhava Rao, Ch. Gopi, O. Seshaiah and S. Ananda Rao. Former TDP councillors who are testing their electoral fortunes include B. Murali and D. Venkata Ramanaiah.

Meanwhile, former TDP Minister Sidda Raghava Rao denied media reports that he was quitting the party.

As many as 385 candidates, including 176 from the YSRCP and 99 from the TDP, have filed their papers for the ZPTC seats and 3,806 candidates, including 1,937 YSRCP nominees and 1,334 TDP candidates, are in the fray for the MPTC seats.

94,2020/03/14,Jolt to YSRCP as rebels enter poll fray in Vizianagaram,"Former municipal Chairperson’s supporters file nominations in 22 divisions

The YSR Congress Party has received a big jolt ahead of the municipal elections with 22 candidates filing nominations as independents out of 50 divisions, following denial of tickets to former municipal Chairperson Avanapu Suribabu’s family.

Suribabu’s wife Avanapu Chinnammalu, son Avanapu Vikram and daughter-in-law Avanapu Bhavana submitted their nominations on Friday afternoon.

Suribabu’s family was said to be instrumental in organising Odarpu Yatra of Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy in 2010 and strengthening the party from the grassroot level for the past 10 years in the district headquarters. After the death of Suribabu in 2012, the family members continued to serve the party. They were hopeful of getting the Mayor’s post but could not get tickets to contest as corporators. They alleged that only loyalists of MLA Kolagatla Veerabhadra Swamy could secure the tickets.

Pressure from supporters

Though they thought of remaining out of poll fray following the reported advice of Minister Botcha Satyanarayana and the party high command, with the mounting pressure from supporters, they have decided to show their strength in the local body elections, it is said.

YSRCP district general secretary and a close relative of Avanapu family Kalla Gowri Sankar told the media that they were left with no option except to contest as independents to protect their political career and that of their supporters.

Many of their followers reached municipal corporation to express their solidarity.

On the other hand, Kolagatla’s loyalists argued that Avanapu family had not supported them during the 2014 and 2019 elections and that the selection of candidates was done purely on merit and their hard work during general elections. They are hopeful that the party high command would make all rebels to withdraw their nominations in a couple of days.

TDP hopes soar

The TDP, meanwhile, is hoping to gain from the infighting in the YSRCP. TDP leaders think that the division of votes between the YSRCP candidates and rebels would make it easy for them to bag the Mayor post.

The municipal corporation office was buzzing with activity as many candidates filed their nominations on Friday, the last date for submission of nominations.

In a video message relayed to the media, Dr. Reddy said the State had recorded its first positive case in Nellore. A student who had returned from Italy has been found to be positive for COVID-19. Both the preliminary tests and confirmatory tests done at SVIMS, Tirupati, had indicated that he had tested positive.

“We have begun a containment plan as per the protocol of Ministry of Health, Government of India. We have started cluster demarcation in the area where we have identified suspect cases. There are over 20,000 persons under active surveillance and 11 persons have been advised home isolation for a minimum period of 14 days. In the case related to Nellore, we have isolated the family members and also the family of domestic help in the house of infected person. We also have the travel history of those who had travelled to COVID-19 hotspot countries such as China and Italy and we are in touch with them. There is no need to panic,” said Dr. Jawahar Reddy.

The Health Department is closely monitoring the situation and has created social media groups in each district updating the condition of the suspected persons.

Thermal screening

Dr. Reddy said that thermal screening had begun in Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tirupati, Kadapa airports and at Gangavaram, Kakinada, Krishnapatnam seaports. A control room with phone no 0866-2410978 had been set up which would function round the clock and 104 helpline has also been activated.

Two Corona testing labs — one at Vijayawada and the other at Tirupati — had been set up and another lab would be set up in Kakinada. So far, 56 isolation wards had been set up in government and in private hospitals, 428 special beds had been set up and 13 rapid response teams formed.

A 500-bed quarantine facility at Tirupati had also been activated and a 200-bed quarantine facility would be activated at Visakhapatnam.

“So far, we have sent 55 samples for testing to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, of which 47 were negative. We are waiting for the results of seven samples. We have set a target of screening 1.4 crore people through household survey, of which we covered 89,000 households, including 3,000 who had returned from foreign countries since February 10.

96,2020/03/14,COVID-19: two quarantine facilities being set up in Vizag,"Together they will have 300 beds, says official

Officials from the Medical and Health Department are setting up two quarantine facilities to isolate persons coming from other countries to the city. The department is creating the quarantine facility at Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) and another at Hudhud Colony. While the VIMS facility would accommodate nearly 250 beds, Hudhud Colony facility will house nearly 50 beds.

According to the District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) S. Tirupathi Rao, as per the guidelines of the Union Health Ministry, any passenger who are coming from abroad should be placed under quarantine. The health department officials need to observe if the passenger develops any symptoms of COVID-19 in a given period of time.

“People coming from abroad would be placed under quarantine for a period of 14 to 28 days either at VIMS or Hudhud Colony. We would observe their health condition daily and report. If they do not report any symptoms, they will be given clear report and sent home,” said Mr. Tirupathi Rao.

The DMHO said that staff from the Health Department and a few specialist doctors from King George Hospital (KGH), who are checking the suspect COVID-19 persons and even the persons who are under house isolation, have been trained by the health ministry officials. While checking the suspect COVID-19 cases and collecting samples from them, our staff are using protective gear and taking all precautions, he said.

A senior official from the Health Department said, “Till now, we have isolation wards at King George Hospital (KGH), Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases (GHCCD), where persons who are found with COVID-19 symptoms are placed.”

“Quarantine facility is where we keep persons who come from abroad just to observe their health condition. There will be beds, drinking water facility, washrooms and other facilities for the persons. Couple of nurses, a specialist doctor would be appointed there. There is no need for huge staff, since they are just suspect cases who need just clinical monitoring,” the official said.

The officials also said that adequate number of safety gear for staff is also in stock.

According to the health department officials, till date, Visakhapatnam reported 18 suspected COVID-19 cases. Reports of 17 persons have been resulted negative, while the report of another person is yet to be received.

99,2020/03/14,Absence of key Maoist leaders in AOB worries police,"High morale of the security forces and tribal support will prevent any misadventure: experts

An eerie silence prevails in the Visakha Agency, including Maoist-stronghold mandals such as Pedabayalu and G. Madugula, and this is worrying the security forces, as the local body polls for MPTC, ZPTC and sarpanch posts are about a week away.

Apart from the unusual lull, the conspicuous absence of key leaders such as Akkiraju Haragopal alias Ramakrishna alias RK and Chalapathi from the cut-off area on the Andhra Odisha Border, is another reason that is compelling the security forces to keep their fingers crossed.

Both RK and Chalapathi, who were leading the Maoist operations in AOB region, have been away for quite some time. Sources say they may be in Chhattisgarh to attend a high-profile strategic meeting of the Maoist top leardeship.

Whenever, there was a lull and top leaders went missing, something big followed.

The Maoist had gone silent after the October 2016 Ramaguda encounter, in which over 30 cadres were killed in one single encounter with the Greyhounds. But they struck back in September 2018 by killing Araku MLA Kidari Sarveswara Rao and former MLA Siveri Soma. “Similarly, the Balimela ambush in June 2018, in which 38 police personnel were killed by Maoists, was preceded by an unusual lull for a few months,” said a senior police officer.

Elections

Election is the time when the Maoists try to bounce back through violence, especially during the local body polls. All the 300 polling booths in the 11 mandals have been identified as affected or critical or hyper-critical.

Local body polls are different from general elections. And in the past it is seen that the Maoists had held considerable sway and had indulged in violence, including triggering landmines, snatching ballot boxes and even killing candidates.

Morale high

But this time the morale of the security forces is high and many officers feel that this will keep the Maoists at bay. As per the initial assessment by the security experts, the presence of ‘boots on ground’ is not only on the higher side, but the forces have made deep forays in the LWE-affected areas.

“The coming up of four armed out posts in the recent times, especially the two in the Maoist strongholds of Rudakota and Nuramati, have increased our visible presence in the region, including in hostile pockets such as Injari and Gummarevula,” said Superintendent of Police, Visakhapatnam, Attada Babujee.

The surrender of any many senior cadres, including one divisional committee member and five area committee members in the last one year and many militias, has also weakened the organisation in the region.

Apart from area domination by the forces, the recent strikes deep into the Maoist pockets, have boosted the morale of the forces and have hit the Maoist hard. “The killing of five top Maoist cadres in Gummarevula panchayat in GK Veedhi in September last, and at least four close encounters for their top leaders including Gajarla Ravi alias Uday, Aruna and RK, in the last one year, has put them on the backfoot and pushed them to the 1,500-sq km area in the cut-off region. But we have kept our eyes and ears open,” said a senior officer from the intelligence wing.

Tribal base

The officers are confident that the Maoists may not be able to do something big, as their tribal base is also dwindling. They feel that the tribal people are now welcoming the government schemes, as it is reaching them now, and development has put Maoist ideology in the back burner.

They are hoping that tribal support and area domination by the forces would prevent the Maoists from any misadventure.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/3i4c40/article31064382.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14VJPG4-MAOISTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/absence-of-key-maoist-leaders-in-aob-worries-police/article31064383.ece

The ancient Vontimitta temple was chosen by the State government for the State-sponsored Sita Rama Kalyanam, as the erstwhile Bhadrachalam temple went to Telangana post-bifurcation. The TTD had offered to pump in ₹100 crore in phases for developing amenities at the temple abutting the Kadapa-Tirupati highway, about 50 km from here. The ceremonial wedding that coincides with Sri Rama Navami attracts over a lakh people from across the State.

Though the TTD has set the arrangements for the mega event in motion, officials are learnt to be worried over the congregation, in view of the COVID-19 scare this year.

Highly placed sources said that the TTD would consult the State government on whether to conduct the event in the first place, or seek guidelines on the means to adopt and precautions to follow, in view of the possibility of the virus spreading due to the congregation.

While the annual Brahmotsavams are expected to pass off as a low-key event, the virus is feared to cast a shadow only on the celestial wedding that is tagged at the end of the main event.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/virus-may-impact-vontimitta-kalyanam/article31063992.ece
104,2020/03/14,State mulls renewable energy export policy,"Idea is to tap the vast potential in wind and solar power sectors

The government is contemplating a renewable energy export policy to promote renewable energy power projects on a large scale and export power without any obligation to the power distribution companies (Discoms).

The idea is to promote solar power projects in uncultivable lands in areas that are prone to frequent droughts in a big way as agencies such as the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) are keen on taking up renewable energy projects, according to a draft proposal.

PSP projects

To implement the plan, it is proposed to promote Pumped Storage Power (PSP) projects (both on and off river) at feasible locations to generate power that can balance the variable renewable energy power and help meet the peak energy demand in the State.

Taking the move forward, 30 sites have been identified in the preliminary phase based on data collected from the Andhra Pradesh Water Resources Information & Management System (APWRIMS) website, and the PSP date mapped by the Australian National University. Of the 30 locations, four are on river and 26 are off river sites.

The task of preparing the techno-commercial feasibility reports for the project has been awarded to M/s WAPCOS Ltd (23 sites) and M/s Tata Consulting Engineers (seven sites). One site, however, has been found to be non-feasible due to logistics issues.

According to a draft report prepared for the remaining 29 sites, the total estimated potential for PSP projects is 33,240 MW (30,140 MW at off river sites and 3,100 MW at on river sites).

Representatives of WAPCOS and TCE made a detailed presentation to the officials of the AP-Transco, AP-Genco and the New and Renewable Energy Development Corporation of Andhra Pradesh (NREDCAP) on Friday.

Secretary, Energy Department, N. Srikanth, Vice-Chairman and Managing Director, NREDCAP, Ramana Reddy, and others were present.

The final report will be submitted in a fortnight after a feedback from the GENCO and the NREDCAP.

“The government is keen on tapping the vast potential in wind and solar power sectors and it is proposed to rope in private developers for implementation of some of these projects,” said Mr. Srikanth.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/state-mulls-renewable-energy-export-policy/article31063968.ece

To choose the right career path, students should have in place a detailed plan from the beginning of their course. This is essential to make oneself industry-ready by the time one walks out of the portals of the institute, said D. Prasanna Kumar, from KL Business School, on Friday.

Speaking at a seminar on “Careers in Management Sector”, jointly organised by The Hindu Future India Club and KL Business School, Mr. Kumar said students should dream big and work hard to achieve them. The seminar was attended by students of NRI Institute of Technology at Visadala of Medikonduru mandal in Guntur district.

He said there were three levels in the job market — Executive, Manager and Leader — and urged the students to aim for being a leader rather than retiring as an executive or as a manager.

He said sound skill was the mantra for entry into the corporate sector. He said companies would not mind paying handsome salaries if they found suitable candidates. He also doled out a few important tips on how to crack interviews.

NRIIT Principal YVSSS Prasada Rao suggested that students seeking a career in the management sector not stop with under-graduation and go ahead and pursue a post-graduation also.

Referring to the vast scope, he said there were verticals like tourism, hospitality and hospital administration among others to explore.

Citing a clause related to the affiliation bye-laws, Mr. Tripathi said “the Board does not allow non-affiliated schools to present the candidates to the Board’s examination”.

He said the parents should check the school status, including up to what class affiliation was given by the Board. They should visit the CBSE affiliation website www.cbseaff.nic.in which displays region-wise and state-wise lists of affiliated schools.

Mr. Mani was active in his profession until the end and died in a music hall.

“Mani was in perfect health when he entered Rama Lalitha Kala Mandira in Banashankari, where he was about to witness the Pallavi demonstrations.

113,2020/03/14,Maize price plummets as poultry farmers face reduced demand,"It has come down by 35% in 15 days; 50% of the produce still at farmers’ disposal

Rumours and apprehensions regarding COVID-19, which resulted in the slump in the price of chicken, has had a cascading effect on the price of maize, the key ingredient in poultry feed.

In the span of 15 days, the price of maize that is cultivated on more than 10 lakh hectares of land in Karnataka has plummeted by 35%. The price of fine-quality maize, which was ₹1,700 a quintal in Davangere and Shivamogga markets on February 28, has come down to ₹1,100 now.

‘No orders’

Shivakumar, a maize merchant from Shikaripur, told The Hindu that a significant chunk of the maize cultivated in central Karnataka districts is purchased by firms engaged in the production of feeds for poultries in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu. Owing to COVID-19 fear, the number of livestocks in many of the large poultry farms has been reduced to mitigate the loss, owing to which the demand for feed has come down. “There are no orders for maize from feed producers owing to which we have also reduced the purchase at the local market, he said.

Santhosh, a maize cultivator from Channagiri, said that around 50% of the produce was still at the disposal of farmers.

H.R. Basavarajappa, honorary president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, told The Hindu that in 2019–20, maize growers suffered loss owing to fall armyworm infestation and decline in the yield owing to drought. Though the yield was good this time owing to sufficient rain, the slump in the price has come as a blot from the blue for growers. In some markets of Davangere, Chitradurga, Haveri, and Shivamogga districts, traders have stopped purchase of maize from the past two days.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/wbxd59/article31070865.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGMAIZE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/maize-price-plummets-as-poultry-farmers-face-reduced-demand/article31070866.ece

121,2020/03/14,"COVID-19: Don’t step out of homes unless necessary, says Kalaburagi DC","Number of people under isolation jumps from 46 on Friday to 71 on Saturday

Deputy Commissioner of Kalaburagi district B. Sharat, who had put the district administration on high alert on Friday after India’s first COVID-19 death was reported from Kalaburagi city, went a step ahead and advised residents not to come out of their houses unless it was absolutely necessary.

“There is a good chance that the virus has spread to many people. There is a possibility of coming across infected people. I strongly advise the residents to confine themselves in their homes. A family member can go and buy necessary commodities taking adequate care. We are not declaring curfew, but advising people to self-restrict their mobility. We are going to close down all non-essential shops. Only those that sell essential commodities will remain open,” Mr. Sharat said at a media conference on Saturday.

The number of people who are in isolation and are being monitored jumped from 46 on Friday to 71 on Saturday. Only four people developed symptoms, including a staff nurse who treated the victim and a five-year-old child. The officer also expressed helplessness as the victim’s family members were not cooperating to trace the people who had come in direct contact with the victim.

In addition to restrictions on all government events, the Deputy Commissioner imposed restrictions on private events such as wedding s and birthday parties.

“People need to get permission from the authorities for conducting the events. We will give permission only to events that will be attended by family members. We are also reducing the frequency of public transport buses. Students staying in hostels have been advised not to return to their native places, but to remain at their hostels only.

“Further, since the monuments in Hampi have been recognised as a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO, there is a heavy footfall of foreign and local tourists, many of whom arrive at location without undergoing 14-day compulsory quarantine, causing problems in screening as well as control of spread via contact in case of infection,” Mr. Nakul said in the preamble to the order.

Addressing a media conference on Saturday, he said that all cinema halls in the the district would remain closed for a week from Sunday.

“The people concerned should ensure that less number of people gather in shopping malls, theatre performance, pubs, night clubs, stadiums, swimming pools, religious carnivals and other events that normally attract a heavy crowd. There is no need to panic. The administration would take stringent action against those who spread false news and rumours that might cause panic among the public,” he said.

127,2020/03/14,COVID-19 impact: stakeholders in tourism sector want tax waiver,"They face big fall in revenue because of mass cancellation of tours

The travel and tourism sector in the city has taken a crippling blow due to the onset of COVID-19 disease. It is reeling under mass cancellation of tickets and tours, forcing the operators to resort to drastic measures to minimise loss.

Tourism is the mainstay of the economy of Mysuru and generates nearly 80,000 direct jobs. The city receives nearly 3.5 million tourists annually and the turnover is reckoned to be around ₹2,000 crore.

While the hospitality sector comprising hotels and restaurants is reeling under massive decline in the number of in-bound tourists, travel agencies and tour operators are facing the heat of mass cancellations of tours by the outbound travellers from the city.

With the State government ordering a closure of hotels, restaurants and pubs for a week as a measure to counter the spread of the virus, many hotels and restaurants have given holidays to their staff. Mysuru has 200 vegetarian restaurants, 130 non-vegetarian restaurants, and 75 bars and restaurants all of which will have to comply with the government directives.

Similar measures are being adopted by travel agencies in the city who have advised their staff to take a pay cut and work for 15 days in a month till the situation eases and normality is restored.

The Mysuru Travel Agents’ Association has urged the State government to waive the quarterly tax and provide 3 months’ grace period in repayment of bank EMIs on loan taken to purchase commercial tourist vehicles.

B. Prashanth, president of the Association, said there is a drastic fall in travel and related business, including large-scale cancellation of confirmed bookings. Besides, there are restrictions placed by the government to combat the spread of the virus which includes a ban on in-bound foreign tourists.

He said it is becoming difficult to run the business in the present situation as the industry is completely dependent on income from travel and tourism. As a result even payment of EMI was becoming difficult and hence they were seeking the waiver.

According to sources in a leading IT company in the city, all outbound international travels have been banned. The campus tour for visitors has also been cancelled since the last few weeks and the multiplex has been shut as a temporary measure to avoid gathering of people in any enclosure.

Mysuru Hotel Owners Association president C. Narayana Gowda said Mysuru has nearly 400 hotels with around 9,500 rooms and the cascading impact of the fall in tourists will affect their livelihood.

A few stakeholders in the sector said though owners will make efforts to pay them regular wages despite the severity of the virus-induced downturn, the economics of running the business may force them to resort to more drastic measures if the situation did not ease within the next one month.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-impact-stakeholders-in-tourism-sector-want-tax-waiver/article31068251.ece
128,2020/03/14,Two arrested for spreading false news on virus,"Two persons were arrested by the Chamarajanagar police on Friday for spreading false news about COVID-19 on social media platforms.

Lokesh from Chamarajanagar and Nagendra from Nanjangud had spread false information that a girl from Nanjangud had tested positive for the virus.

Soon after the post, which had the girl’s image morphed on a private television channel, was shared on social media platforms, the girl turned up at the Nanjangud town police station to clarify that she was healthy and the post was false.

Subsequently, the post was traced to the accused duo. When they were questioned, it turned out that they had resorted to spreading false information about the girl on account of certain personal reasons, the police said.

When the matter was brought to the notice of Chamarajanagar Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi, he directed the District Health Officer to lodge a complaint. Based on the complaint, the Chamarajanagar town police arrested Nagendra and Lokesh.

Meanwhile, the Mysuru district administration has advised media personnel against photographing or videographing suspected COVID-19 patients.

“We are facing great difficulties in tracing the people whom the victim had met directly as the family members are not providing correct and all necessary information about the movements of the victim and the people he met after his return from abroad. But we continued the interrogation and got some information based on which we have kept 25 more people under home-isolation. We will supply the food kits to them in the same manner we normally do during a flood situation,” Mr. Sharat said.

No mass gathering

In addition to the restrictions on all the government events that would attract people, the Deputy Commissioner imposed curbs on private events such as wedding ceremonies and birthday celebrations.

134,2020/03/14,Mysuru rail museum inauguration today,"It has been renovated at a cost of ₹9 crore

Take a trip back in time to savour the era when India made its transition from the age of bullock cart to the age of machines in public transportation. Catch a glimpse of the first three locomotives Sahib, Sindh, and Sultan when they pulled out of Bori Bunder to Thane on April 16, 1853 to signal the emergence of railways in India.

Get an immersive experience of the steam locomotives that used to billow smoke and emit steam as they puffed across the subcontinent breaking distance and cultural barrier as they knit the country together. Or walk into the metre-gauge coach that has been converted to a cafeteria to savour snacks or immerse yourself in railway literature in one of the kiosks and take home a souvenir.

Welcome to the Rail Museum of Mysuru which has been completely renovated and expanded at a cost of ₹9 crore and set for inauguration on Saturday after being closed for a year. Established in 1978, this is the first major renovation of the museum which has a rich collection of railway artefacts, including steam locomotives on display.

Jamuna Bai, who is one of the oldest surviving retired railway employees, will inaugurate the Sriranga Gallery, while Ashwath, who used to sell tickets at the rail museum, will inaugurate the renovated rail museum.

The redesigned museum with contemporary architecture and design blends with the railway heritage embellishing the exhibits that have been completely restored by experts.

Identifying themselves as the “pained loyal MLAs of the BJP”, they accused Mr. Vijayendra of acting like a “super CM”. They alleged that the family members had taken advantage of the old age of Mr. Yediyurappa and formed a parallel team to run the government.

136,2020/03/14,House committee to probe ‘fixed deposit scam’ in RDPR Department,"₹686 cr. meant for drinking water schemes was illegally kept in FDs by officials

The State government announced setting up of a House committee in the Legislative Council to probe and suggest action against those involved in the fixed deposit (FD) scam that rocked the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (RDPR) in 2015. About ₹686 crore meant to be used for crucial drinking water schemes in rural areas was illegally kept in fixed deposits by officials.

The announcement from RDPR Minister K.S. Eshwarappa on Friday came after members cutting across all parties alleged that attempts were being made to cover up the scam, with officials charged with irregularities getting away from law.

Raising the issue, BJP member Raghunath Rao Malkapure, quoting the written answer provided by the Minister, said officials had been let off, and there was no accountability for misusing the money meant for providing water. Quoting from the written reply of the Minister, he said, “The police have filed a ‘B’ report with respect to retired KAS officer P. Bore Gowda; B.S. Rayageri, who has now retired, was reinstated, and suspension of Ramakrishna has been revoked as chargesheet was not issued. The police have filed a ‘B’ report even in the case of Ramakrishna.”

Replying to Mr. Malkapure, the Minister said the 2015 report filed by IFS officer P. Sridhar had confirmed that the State and Central funds that came to the Rural Drinking Water and Sanitation Department under the NRDW projects had been kept in other 106 accounts to a tune of ₹685.99 crore, which was later taken back and spent on drinking water projects. “Except for two accounts, all other accounts have been closed,” the Minister’s written reply stated. A committee headed by S.B Shivarudrappa was in the process of re-appropriation of accounts, it stated.

Though Mr. Eshwarappa said the government was ready to investigate the matter and place the two probe reports in the House, members said there was no need to investigate again since two committees had done it already. They said that since no action could be initiated nor the losses could be recovered from officials four years after their retirement, the matter required urgent attention.

Yielding to the members’ demand, the Minister announced setting up of the House committee.

‘Dummy account’

“You cannot find an account like this in the world,” Mr. Eshwarappa said on Friday, referring to a bank account opened in the name of “dummy”.

“There was no proposer before the account was opened in SyndicateBank. A sum of ₹496 crore was kept in the account and that too without approval,” he said. Further, Mr. Eshwarappa said that while the government was to have received ₹285 crore as interest on about ₹686 crore kept in fixed deposits, the bank is now offering only ₹84 crore. “The Finance Department has been asked to hold discussion with the bank to sort out the matter,” the Minister said.

₹2,000 crore in FDs

While the fixed deposit (FD) scam had come in the Rural Drinking Water and Sanitation Department earlier, ₹2,008.59 crore is currently kept in FD by various agencies in the RDPR Department. While the Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development Ltd. has kept ₹1,255.55 crore, the Karnataka Rural Road Development Agency has FD of ₹721.26 crore.

137,2020/03/14,Kannadigas in Goa being harassed: Horatti,"I’ll discuss the issue of sending State delegation with Chief Minister, says Poojary

Alleging that Kannadigas in Goa are being harassed to leave the State through a campaign called ‘Pogo Andolan’, Janata Dal (Secular) leader Basavaraj Horatti on Friday urged the State government to send a delegation to sort out the matter immediately.

Raising the issue during Zero Hour in the Legislative Council, he said the move by Goans in the last months had led to insecurity and fear among Kannadigas who have made Goa their home for several decades. “There are four lakh Kannadigas in Goa. In the name of protecting Goa, Pogo Andolan has been started by stating that Goans are only those who were in Goa before 1961, and that all others should be declared as migrants,” he added.

The andolan, Mr. Horatti said, had been seeking all government jobs be reserved for Goans and a lion’s share in private sector jobs be provided to locals. He said, “They are demanding that migrants should not be given voter’s ID card and should not be allowed to register property or vehicle. Many Kannadigas have been part of Goa Vimochana struggle too.”

Later, speaking to reporters, he said that several families from Gadag, who were forced to come back owing to harassment, had met him recently. “Many families from Vijayapura, Gadag, Haveri, Bagalkot, and Belagavi will be affected. Of the 13.5 lakh living in Goa, four lakh are Kannadigas,” he added.

Responding to the plea to send a delegation to Goa, Leader of the House and Minister for Muzrai Kota Srinivas Poojary said he would discuss the matter with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and take a decision. “We will announce the decision on Monday,” he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/r8ehky/article31064711.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGHORATTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kannadigas-in-goa-being-harassed-horatti/article31064712.ece

They have been opened in bus stands in the taluk headquarters and at four railway stations at Karwar, Gokarna, Murdeshwar and Bhatkal.

In addition, two help desks have been opened at the tourist spots of Gokarna and Murdeshwar, which are frequented by foreign tourists, the Deputy Commissioner said in a communique. These desks will educate people on COVID-19, collect self-declaration forms from those who have returned from foreign countries and carry out thermal scanning of suspected commuters.

The details of all foreign tourists who have been staying in Uttara Kannada are being collected through schools as an extra measure to counter-check their presence in the district, Mr. Kumar said.

The details of all patients who have visited medical practitioners (both government and private) are being collected daily by the Health Department.

The standard operating procedure is being followed in suspected cases.

Government buildings have been identified for quarantine facilities. In addition, two private hospitals have been identified along with the Naval base health facilities for isolation centres and hospital facilities, Mr. Kumar said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/q11c9i/article31064688.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14MNHELPDESK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/uttara-kannada-administrationsets-up-covid-19-help-desks/article31064689.ece
139,2020/03/14,A low-key 198th car festival amid country’s first COVID-19 death,"Devotees asked to disperse immediately after the rathotsava in Kalaburagi

For the first time in history, the annual car festival of the famed Sharnabasaveshwara temple, which is held in the evening every year, was pre-poned a few hours from schedule this year amid the country’s first death reported in Kalaburagi due to COVID-19.

The Sharanabasaveshwar Samsthan, meanwhile, decided to keep the car festival a low-key affair this year keeping in mind the safety of the devotees participating in the car festival.

The devotees were asked to disperse immediately after the rathotsava and return to their native places.

However, the scare of COVID-19 and the death of a septuagenarian due to the novel coronavirus in the city did not deter the devotees from participating in the car festival. All the rituals of the rathotsava began a few hours before the usual time.

At 4 p.m., Poojya Dr. Sharanabasavappa Appa, the eighth peetathipati of the Sharanabasaveshwar Samsthan, signalled the beginning of the annual car festival and the fortnight-long annual fair by displaying the holy silver bowl (Prasada Battalu) and the Linga Sajjike (the cover used for keeping the Linga) made up of Sandalwood and used by Saint Sharanabasaveshwar.

The devotees pulled the decorated temple car around the temple complex and flung bananas tied with dry dates at the temple car.

The number of devotees that turned up for the rathotsava to commemorate the 198th death anniversary of the 18th Century social reformer Sharanabasaveshwar was very low-key in comparison with the crowds in the previous years.

The rathotsava also marked the ascension of the holy order (Peetarohana) of the eighth Peetathipathi of the Samsthan Dr. Appa.

Though right from the morning people from different parts of the district and neighbouring States thronged the temple premises, there were no long queues this year.

The Health Department has directed those concerned to take precautionary measures, besides deputing adequate staff, doctors and medical assistants.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/6y7hrx/article31064653.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGSHARANABASAVESHWARA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a-low-key-198th-car-festival-amid-countrys-first-covid-19-death/article31064654.ece
140,2020/03/14,RSS to activate 15 lakh members through social programmes,"It has done a survey to know their areas of interest

In a bid to harness the potential of its members, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has conducted a national survey of nearly 15 lakh members to know their areas of interest as well as skills.

“We have conducted the survey of members aged above 30. Depending upon their area of interest, we will take up social programmes to involve them to bring about positive changes in society,” said RSS Akhil Bharatiya Prachar Pramukh Arun Kumar.

Briefing mediapersons here on Friday about the three-day conclave of the sangh’s highest decision-making body, Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha, which is set to be held at Channenahalli on the outskirts of Bengaluru from March 15, he said the ways and means of utilising the services of these members would be discussed at the conclave.

“We will draw up programmes that have a social thrust to utilise the services of our members,” he said. The idea is to use their services in their neighbourhood, he noted.

Meanwhile, sources in the RSS said that the survey had obtained information from members on various aspects such as areas of their interest and specialisation; whether they want to involve themselves in building the organisation or take up social service. The survey had asked them to specify the quantum of time they could dedicate for social work in a day/week or month, sources said.

The month-long survey, which was completed in December 2019, was taken up as there was an increase in the number of members joining the RSS in the last few years, sources said.

Referring to the three-day national conclave which would be held once a year, Mr. Arun Kumar said around 1,500 elected representatives of the RSS and associated organisations, including women representatives, would take part in the event.

The conclave would not only review the implementation of plans and programmes finalised in the previous year, but would also share experiences related to their implementation by different regions. The meeting would also set the agenda for the sangh’s work for the coming year and finalise the tour programme of its national office-bearers, he explained.

RSS top leaders, including national president Mohan Bhagwat, would lead the conclave, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/rss-to-activate-15-lakh-members-through-social-programmes/article31064285.ece
141,2020/03/14,Government wants private firms to give 80% jobs to locals: Shettar,"‘Companies keen on investing in tier II, tier III cities will get concession’

The State government has insisted that private companies, small or big, provide 80% reservation in jobs for locals (Kannada-speaking people) in all categories, said Minister for Major and Medium Industries Jagadish Shettar on Friday.

In his reply to questions of N.A. Haris (Congress) and Harish Poonja (BJP) in the Legislative Assembly, Mr. Shettar said the government had been speaking to private firms on reservation. The government amended the Karnataka Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Rules, 1961, to provide 100% reservation in group ‘C’ and group ‘D’ jobs for locals in the private sector, he said. The government last year amended the rules to allow this.

However, the notification had drawn the ire of activists since it only asks industrial establishments to give priority to Kannadigas, but neither makes it mandatory nor states any punitive measures if the establishments fail to do so.

A month ago, about 100 Kannada outfits had done a day-long shutdown in Karnataka under a common banner, seeking more jobs for Kannadigas in State-run enterprises and job reservation for locals in the private sector.

In tier II, tier III cities

Mr. Shettar said it was decided to provide concession in the form of tax rebate to private firms keen on investing in tier II and tier III cities in the State. Memorandums amounting ₹73,000 crore were signed during the investment summit held in Hubballi last month. It was decided to de-congest Bengaluru city, which has been facing problems such as traffic and high cost of land, he said. It was proposed that investment summits be held in Mangaluru, Belagavi, Kalaburagi, Mysuru, and other places to attract investment in tier II and tier III cities and provide infrastructure for investment. He said a draft of the new industrial policy (2019–24) was ready and it had sent for the Finance Department’s approval.

Mr. Shettar said medium-scale industries invested ₹3,30,424 lakh and provided jobs to 23,409 people between 2016–17 and 2019–20. Three districts — Chamarajanagar, Kodagu, and Gadag — had zero investment during the three years, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/rrtfe1/article31064251.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGSHETTAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/government-wants-private-firms-to-give-80-jobs-to-locals-shettar/article31064252.ece
142,2020/03/14,COVID-19: Kalaburagi district put on high alert,"Even as the 76-year old man who died on Tuesday night tested positive for COVID-19 late on Thursday night, Kalaburagi district was put on high alert.

As the lab report reached the district headquarters, Deputy Commissioner B. Sharat held an emergency meeting of top officials from different departments and discussed the precautionary measures to be taken to prevent spread of the disease.

As day broke on Friday, the district administration swung into action and began shifting all the 31 people who had been in direct contact with the elderly man, before and after his death, to the special quarantine ward established at the State-run ESIC medical complex. They are considered high-risk patients and each one of them has been provided one medical officer. Four medical professionals who had treated the patient before his death at a private hospital in the city are also among the high-risk suspects.

Fifteen more people who had been in contact with the dead man in one way or the other and were considered ‘low-risk’ patients have been quarantined.

Throat swabs and blood samples of four high-risk patients who developed some COVID-19 symptoms — one developed cold and the other three cough — were collected and dispatched to the National Institute of Virology in Bengaluru in a special vehicle.

Ward No. 30 in Kalaburagi Municipal Corporation area, where the COVID-19-infected patient lived, was declared a containment area for intense monitoring. Mr. Sharat also alerted the Telangana administration as the patient had visited Hyderabad for treatment.

Annual jatra

Soon after the midnight meeting with officials, Mr. Sharat called on Sharanabasavappa Appa, the head of Sharana Basaveshwara Samstan, and appealed to him to cancel the Sharana Basaveshwara Jatra, an annual carnival, that was scheduled to begin on Friday. The latter agreed to celebrate the Jatra only with his family members to avoid the huge mass gathering that the Jatra would attract every year.

Since the message did not reach all the people owing to paucity of time, thousands arrived for the event on Friday morning. Police and Health Department teams were deployed to convince them to go back. Teams were also deployed at all taluk borders to prevent people from coming to Kalaburagi for the jatra.

Mr. Sharat, along with other officers, addressed an emergency press conference to explain the precautionary measures in place.

Exercising powers conferred under Section 133 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the DC has declared a holiday for all anganwadis, schools, colleges and other educational institutions, except those conducting examinations, for a week. He has also ordered the closure of multiplexes, cinema halls, shopping malls and public gardens, as well as the cancellation of all government functions that will attract a crowd.

143,2020/03/14,PM’s chopper search case: Tribunal declines to interfere with EC decision on IAS officer Mohsin,"It asks Karnataka govt. to get his explanation first to decide on the need to hold disciplinary inquiry

The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) has declined to interfere with the decision of the Election Commission of India (ECI), which had asked the State government to initiate a disciplinary action against Mohammed Mohsin, an IAS officer of Karnataka cadre, for allegedly violating instructions related to the Special Protection Group (SPG) protectees in searching the helicopter used by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the Lok Sabha election campaign in Odisha last year.

However, the tribunal’s Bengaluru Bench has directed the State government to seek an explanation from Mr. Mohsin in the first instance before issuing a formal chargesheet under the rules for conducting disciplinary inquiry. The tribunal, in its March 4 order, also directed the government to appoint a retired Chief Secretary of Karnataka cadre to conduct the disciplinary inquiry if the government decided to hold the inquiry after due and unbiased examination of the explanation to be given by the officer.

The ECI, the tribunal said, had applied its mind in passing the order against Mr. Mohsin as the Deputy Election Commissioner had looked into the matter, taken evidence and then reported the issue to the commission.

As Mr. Mohsin, who was appointed as general observer for Sambalpur Parliamentary constituency in Odisha for the Lok Sabha elections, contended that he had not ordered searching of the helicopter, the tribunal said, “This matter, without any doubt, can and should be decided only in the inquiry by only the disciplinary authority without extraneous juncture.”

The ECI acted after a complaint made by the SPG on violation of instructions related to SPG protectees. The ECI had initially suspended Mr. Mohsin and the CAT had stayed the suspension. Subsequently, the ECI on April 25, 2019 revoked his suspension, debarred him from election duty, and recommended the State government to initiate disciplinary action on the basis of the factual report of the commission.

Mr. Mohsin had moved the tribunal challenging the ECI’s April 25, 2019 decision while also seeking a direction to the State and Union governments not to take any action against him based on the ECI’s decision.

The tribunal has said that there was nothing wrong on the part of the State government in taking action as their fundamental duty was to comply with the recommendation made by the ECI.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pms-chopper-search-case-tribunal-declines-to-interfere-with-ec-decision-on-ias-officer-mohsin/article31064044.ece

145,2020/03/14,"‘Ambari’ arrives in Mysuru, but launch depends on COVID-19 situation","‘Ambari’, a specially-built double-decker bus for open-roof bus tours, has arrived in Mysuru. The bus, an initiative of Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC), is being launched as a tourist attraction.

Though it has arrived, tourists have to wait for its launch as it needs to be fine-tuned in certain aspects, including the audio-visual experience. More importantly, tree branches along the designated route of the tour need to pruned to facilitate smooth movement of the bus. The Forest Department has been requested to prune the branches.

The Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation has also been requested to raise its overhead electrical lines for the movement of the bus, and these works are expected to be done in the next 10-15 days, or before March 31. KSTDC managing director Kumar Pushkar, who was in Mysuru on Friday, told The Hindu that the launch would depend on the COVID-19 situation. “If the situation is normal, Ambari will be launched after March 31,” he said.

Ambari is a hop-on, hop-off initiative for tourists to experience the palaces and heritage buildings of Mysuru. Tourists will get an audio guide the moment the bus reaches the tourist sites identified on the route. The audio will be available in two languages in the beginning — Kannada and English. Later, foreign languages will be added, Mr. Pushkar said.

The body wrapping of the bus has been done keeping in view the State’s artforms, culture and diversity, wildlife, and tourist destinations.

147,2020/03/14,Forest fires are back in South Karnataka,"With the onset of summer, sporadic incidents have been reported in the last 24 hours

The scorching summer heat has brought to the fore the scourge of forest fire and sporadic incidents have been reported from South Karnataka during the last 24 hours.

Fires have been reported in Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary, MM Hills territorial division, and on the outskirts of Bandipur with officials engaged in dousing it.

A fire in Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary destroyed around 15 hectares of forest near Netkal village, Malavalli, of Mandya district late on Thursday.

However, sources in the Forest Department said the actual extent of damage was yet to be ascertained and it could be more.

The flames have destroyed several hundreds of trees, shrubs and dry vegetation and a survey would be conducted to ascertain the damage, sources said. The Fire and Emergency Services personnel successfully prevented the fire from spreading to Hanur and Sathanur ranges. It is suspected that an explosion/spark from an electricity transformer in the area may have caused the fire.

Meanwhile, in the adjoining MM Hills, the authorities are grappling with the local superstitious beliefs of the community that lighting fire helps ward off their misery. The villagers during their visit to the shrine at MM Hills tend to light a small fire along the pedestrian path. This can result in a major conflagration if not checked.

“Hence, we have deployed most of our fire watchers in the territorial division of MM Hills forests,” said Deputy Conservator of Forests V. Yedukondalu.

However, there has been no fire as on date in the MM Hills Wildlife Sanctuary.

Bandipur Tiger Reserve, which witnessed large-scale devastation last year and bore the brunt of the fire season, saw a minor conflagration at the forest edge on Friday and it was put out within half an hour of being reported.

T. Balachandra, Director, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, said they have deployed nearly 1,000 staff, including daily wagers, recruited for the fire season that lasts from January till the onset of southwest monsoon. “We are preoccupied in putting out fires that are lit by farmers on private farmland — as part of their agricultural activity — along the forest periphery. But this tends to spread and consume large swathes of forests and more than 95% of the fire reported in Bandipur is started by burning of weeds and agricultural residue,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hw252s/article31063721.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGFORESTFIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/forest-fires-are-back-in-south-karnataka/article31063722.ece
148,2020/03/14,Central varsity’s executive council refuses to approve candidates’ list,"The executive council (EC) of Central University of Karnataka (CUK), Kalaburagi, has refused to approve the list of candidates selected for the posts of professors and associate professors in various departments.

This comes after media reports of alleged irregularities in the process of appointments at CUK and two letters – one by an activist to President of India and another by parliamentarian Umesh Jadhav to Union Minister of Human Resources Development – demanding an enquiry into the irregularities. It was first reported in The Hindu on March 3.

When the list of candidates was placed at the meeting seeking EC’s approval on Friday, some of the EC members cited the media reports and letters and sought clarification from H.M. Maheshwaraiah, Vice-Chancellor of the university and head of selection committee. The Vice-Chancellor, in his response, claimed to have followed all norms and guidelines set by the University Grants Commission in the selection process and sought the EC’s approval for the list of candidates. The members then put a condition that the Vice-Chancellor should sign an undertaking specifically taking responsibility for any violations, if found, in the selection process before approving the list. However, the Vice-Chancellor turned down the demand. Following this, the EC refused to approve the list.

Before the meeting commenced, a few activists led by Mahesh Rathod, a leader of the Communist Party of India, met the Vice-Chancellor and demanded cancellation of the entire recruitment process and issue of a fresh notification. The Vice-Chancellor turned down the demand, which led to a heated argument disrupting the meeting for a while.

M.B. Sajjan, general secretary, All-India University Employees’ Confederation, on March 5, wrote to the President of India, and Umesh Jadhav, Lok Sabha member from Kalaburagi constituency, on March 12, wrote to the Minister of Human Resources Development, demanding an enquiry into the alleged irregularities and cancellation of the entire recruitment process.

A day after Janadhipathya Kerala Congress (JKC) chairman Francis George announced the organisation’s merger with the Kerala Congress (M) faction led by P.J. Joseph, a State committee meeting convened by the rival faction here on Saturday appointed K.C. Joseph the new chairman of the organisation.

The meeting, attended by senior leaders such as K.C. Joseph and Antony Raju, also decided to report the desertion by Mr. George to the Election Commission of India. Senior party leader P.C. Joseph was appointed party working chairman while senior Antony Raju would continue as vice chairman.

According to JKC leaders, as many as eight State general secretaries, six district presidents, and 174 of the 240 party State committee members attended the meeting.

To convene meet

Soon after assuming office, the newly appointed chairman convened a meeting of district presidents, State functionaries, and office-bearers of the feeder organisations. It was decided to convene the district committees from March 16 to 24.

Two days ago, a parallel State committee meeting convened by Francis George at Muvattupuzha approved a resolution to disband the party. This was followed by a formal announcement of its merger with the KC(M) group led by P.J.Joseph at a function at the residence of Mr. Joseph at Thodupuzha.

The merger makes Mr.George the second prominent KC leader after Johny Nelloor to realign with the Joseph group, which has been on an expansion spree of late.

The faction that merged with the KC(M) group also comprised a few senior JKC leaders, including former Parliament Member Vakkachan Mattathil, general secretary (office charge) M.P. Poly, and Thomas Kunnappally, among others.

A few Kerala Congress leaders led by Francis George, K.C. Joseph, Antony Raju, and P.C. Joseph quit KC(M) in 2016 to form the Janadhipathya Kerala Congress following differences with the then party supremo K.M. Mani.

Students staying in hostels and those hailing from faraway places seem a worried lot as Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU) examination schedules remain unchanged amid COVID-19 scare. The exams will begin on Monday.

Several students had e-mailed to the varsity authorities after COVID-19 scare spread in Ernakulam district over the past one week. However, the sixth and fourth semester exams, beginning on Monday and Tuesday respectively, will be held as scheduled, according to university officials.

Incidentally, students living in hostels and who were not able to travel on a daily basis from their native places on examination days, were permitted to stay back in hostels despite the government’s decision to close down colleges in view of the COVID-19 situation. “Many students had left for home anticipating that the varsity may postpone exams.

However, those staying in faraway places chose to stay back at hostels considering the logistical hurdles in commuting during exam time,” said some students.

Various college managements have asked students to remain confined to hostel rooms and not to venture out. “We were allowed to stay back in hostels on condition that we would not move out of the hostel premises. Except for having food, we are mostly confined to our rooms,” said a final year student of a city college.

Those running private hostels have permitted residents to return home on condition that they will produce medical certificates before appearing for exams.

A private hostel manager said the condition was set as a precautionary measure and as per directives issued by the Health authorities.

On why exams were not postponed despite the COVID-19 situation, MGU authorities said the entire exam schedule would be derailed if exams were postponed.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/concern-over-mgu-exam-schedule/article31070834.ece

152,2020/03/14,Railways implement preventive steps,"Staff provided masks, help desks set up

The Palakkad division of the Southern Railway has come up with several preventive measures against COVID-19 even as it reported frantic cancellation of group bookings in the past few days.

Officials said that creating awareness through announcements at different stations had already been started. Besides, multiple help desks had been provided at major stations at the Palakkad, Kozhikode and Mangaluru Central stations.

The daily reservation counter earnings of the division is ₹30 lakh. But, it declined to ₹10 lakh on Wednesday.

Cleaning

The Railway was taking efforts to minimise the spread of the disease with regular cleaning of booking office glass panes and railings. Materials such as posters and pamphlets regarding COVID-19 were now displayed in local languages at railway stations and in trains.

The staff in high contact areas and those involved in coach cleaning and conservancy work had been provided masks. Further, the railway was also working in close coordination with the State government. Each station had been given a dedicated phone number of district authorities for contact in case of need. Buildings had been identified and facilities made for quarantine and isolation as well, they said.

Flights cancelled

Meanwhile, several flights from the Calicut international airport to destinations such as Doha, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Muscat were cancelled on Saturday.

However, Air India resumed a jumbo flight to Jeddah. Spicejet and Indigo too operated a service each. K. Srinivasa Rao, airport director, said that Saudi Arabia had decided to suspend international flights for two weeks from Sunday.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/railways-implement-preventive-steps/article31070824.ece
153,2020/03/14,Avian flu | Alappuzha duck farmers a worried lot,"Bird flu incidence in northern districts keeps many on the edge

The outbreak of bird flu in northern districts has created a sense of apprehension among duck farmers in Kuttanad.

Kuttanad was badly hit by avian influenza (H5N1) in 2014-15 and (H5N8) in 2016-17. The pain of poultry flocks devastated by bird flu, subsequent mass culling, and huge financial loss suffered is still fresh in the minds of farmers in the region.

Varghese Baby, of Thalavady, recalls that he lost more than 9,000 ducks in 2014 and another 6,750 in 2016. “In 2014, around 2,000 ducks in my farm died and another 7,000 were culled. Though the government paid compensation for the culled birds — ₹100 for ducks that were less than two months old and ₹200 for those older than two months — it was not enough to compensate for the overall loss suffered by farmers like me. Besides, I didn’t receive a single penny as compensation for 2,000 dead ducks as authorities failed to acknowledge it. The same happened in 2016 too, as the government only provided compensation for 5,500 ducks,” he says.

Despite setbacks, Varghese continues to rear ducks to make a living. But not every other farmer. Samuel, a traditional duck farmer from Pallippad, says that he stopped rearing ducks after suffering huge losses and receiving property attachment notice from the bank. Several farmers in the region have downsized the number of ducklings being bred every season, since bird flu outbreaks.

Over 10 lakh ducks culled

Following the outbreak in 2014, some three lakh ducks were culled in Kuttanad. More than seven lakh ducks were culled as part of containment operation in Alappuzha and Kottayam districts in 2016.

It resulted in poor demand for ‘Kuttanadan’ duck, which has a pride of place on dining tables, in the following months and created lasting damage to medium and small farmers. The majority of them conduct farming twice a year, especially with an eye on Christmas and Easter festivities.

According to the Duck Farmers Association, the number of farmers has dwindled from 2,000 to 1,500 in recent years.

“The bird flu, 2018 floods, and recurring bouts of bacterial infections have forced many duck farmers to look for new pastures,” says, B. Rajasekharan, district president of the association.

Duck farmers say the government is showing little interest in their well-being. They have been demanding a mobile laboratory for testing, insurance scheme, storing of necessary vaccines, and so on.

Around 6,000 ducks perished at Thalavady and nearby areas in recent days. The cause of death has been ascertained as bacterial infection with no threat to humans.

Farmers warned

Meanwhile, the Animal Husbandry Department has warned the farmers against transporting ducks from one place to another for rearing in view of bird flu in Kozhikode and Malappuram. “We have put the farmers on alert and are closely monitoring the situation,” says, Mary James, Alappuzha District Animal Husbandry Officer.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ps3bab/article31071249.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tval1--duck,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/alappuzha-duck-farmers-a-worried-lot/article31070823.ece
154,2020/03/14,Preventive measures to be bolstered,"Thrissur district administration to coordinate local self-government’s steps against COVID-19

The local body institutions in the district will prepare and implement comprehensive preventive measures to check the spread of COVID-19.

A meeting of elected representatives and officials convened by Minister of Local Self-Government A.C. Moideen here on Saturday chalked out the preventive measures to be taken under the local bodies. District administration will coordinate the works.

Though the condition is under control in the district, considering the seriousness of the situation, people till ward-level will be roped in to the project.

Guidelines

The people under home quarantine should strictly follow the guidelines of the Health Department. In case of symptoms of COVID-19, people should inform the control room instead of going to hospitals directly. The Health Department would take the suspected patients to the hospital in their vehicles, the Minister said.

The service of the community volunteer army should be utilised after providing training for them. People who reach the government offices would be given instructions about disease prevention methods.

Strict Monitoring would be set up at railway stations and inter-State borders. Awareness programmes would be implemented for the migrant workers. Safety measures would be provided for the destitutes.

Home quarantine

The elected representatives have been asked to provide mental and social support for people, who are in home quarantine. Public functions should be avoided. Celebrations and weddings should be held in a minimalist way.

The local self governments should make sufficient arrangements for home quarantine of the people coming from the COVID-19-hit countries. People coming from other States also should be monitored.

Panchayat-level arrangements will be made to monitor whether people under home quarantine follow Health Department’s guidelines, said Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar, who attended the meeting. Addressing the meeting, Education Minister Prof. C. Raveendranath said the teachers and school workers had been asked to reach schools to ensure their service in the prevention programmes.

Teachers should try to understand problems of each house. The schools should act as centres of preventive steps. Chief whip K. Rajan, T.N. Prathapan and Ramya Haridas MPs, Mayor Ajitha Jayarajan, district panchayat president Mary Thomas, K.V. Abdul Khader, B.D. Devassy, E.T. Tyson, Murali Perunelly, V.R. Sunil Kumar, U.R. Pradeep and Anil Akkara, MLAs, District Collector S. Shanavas, presidents and secretaries of local bodies and district officials participated.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/preventive-measures-to-be-bolstered/article31070812.ece
155,2020/03/14,Kyasanur Forest Disease under check in Wayanad,"Intensive preventive measures of district administration pay off

The summer months are a concern for the Health Department every year as Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, a viral disease transmitted to humans through a tick species usually found on monkeys, rears its head.

The situation was no different this year too. The first case of KFD this season was reported on December 26 under the Appapara Family Health Centre (FHC) in Thirunelly grama panchayat. Later, 14 confirmed cases were reported from the area, of which a woman succumbed to the disease.

However, the spread of the disease is under control now, at the intervention of the district administration.

Preventive measures

“We have adopted a three-pronged strategy to tackle the spread of the zoonosis, including intensive preventive measures, reducing human-monkey interactions, and stepped up surveillance,” Adeela Abdulla, Wayand Collector, told The Hindu.

“Those living in forest fringes have been asked to get vaccinated and adopt personal protection measures, to wear gloves and gumboots and apply repellent lotions, before entering forests as part of the preventive measures,” Ms. Abdulla said.

The public were asked to adopt proper waste management, remove fruits from plants to reduce human-monkey interactions, and not feed the animal.

Scientists at the Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University had been asked to monitor the sick monkey population and carry out research work on the zoonosis with the assistance of forest officials round-the-year, she said.

However, the increasing population of stray monkeys, dearth of studies, and the reluctance of the public to get vaccinated are impediments to containing the disease.

People’s reluctance

“Earlier, the department had targeted to vaccinate as many as 3,868 people in various hamlets in the forest fringes of Thirunelly panchayat but the department could vaccinate only 646 till March first week,” District Medical Officer R. Renuka said.

However, a door-to-door visit of health officials after the KFD death changed the attitude of the public towards vaccination, Dr. Renuka said. As many as 997 people in the area got vaccinated in two days, she said. “The department procured 3,000 doses of KFD vaccine on Friday and the vaccination drive would continue in the coming days,” she added.

The first case of the disease in the district was reported in 2013 and another confirmed case was reported in 2014. The virus wreaked havoc in the district in 2015 when 102 cases were reported and 11 persons died of the disease. Nine cases were reported in 2016. Though two suspected cases were reported in 2017, not a single case was reported in 2018. But seven cases, including two deaths, were reported in 2019.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/6nmxnl/article31070801.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15tvMonkeyfever,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kyasanur-forest-disease-under-check-in-wayanad/article31070796.ece
156,2020/03/14,Kerala’s battle against zoonotic diseases,"A host of zoonotic diseases have left an impact on the State’s public health as well as the economy. The Hindu presents an overview of the challenges ahead for the State

Recurring instances of zoonotic diseases are adding to the worries of public health experts of Kerala. As the State is waging a pitched battle to contain the spread of COVID-19, reports of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) and bird flu (Avian Influenza) have come in from Wayanad and Kozhikode respectively.

While KFD claimed a life this year, it claimed two lives last year. Culling of birds in a-kilometre radius of the two poultry firms where the outbreak of bird flu was reported was the first preventive step initiated. The culling was followed by increased surveillance in a radius of 10 km. The Nipah outbreak that claimed 17 lives in 2018 literally shook the State. The disease made its presence felt last year though the State could contain it effectively. Anthrax, though sporadically reported in animals, has not emerged as a major challenge in the State. However, leptospirosis and rabies continue to be perennial concerns for public health and animal husbandry experts.

Social mobility hit

Besides snatching away precious lives, such disease outbreaks paralyse social mobility of the affected population as a large number of individuals have to be either kept under observation or quarantine. The diseases also leave a significant impact on the economy.

While a section of wildlife experts feel that the recurrence of such diseases could be checked effectively by putting in place a round-the-clock surveillance mechanism and scientific disease management protocols, those at the Animal Husbandry Department say such diseases were an inescapable reality for the State, given the sizeable forest cover.

Wetlands and waterbodies are also routes through which diseases such as bird flu are transmitted to domestic bird populations.

Diseases such as KFD are often reported in human populations living in forest fringes. Though first reported in Karnataka, the disease has made its presence felt in the contiguous Wayanad forests. After the confirmation of the disease, instructions were issued to step up vigil and health care measures in the area, including steps to control the pest population, said R. Jayachandran, Chief Disease Investigation Officer at the State Institute for Animal Diseases, Thiruvananthapuram.

Restrictions on grazing of cattle in forest fringes where deaths of monkeys have been reported, safe handling of carcasses, spraying cattle with disinfectants, and pest-control medicines have been recommended. Disinfectants and insecticides are also sprayed in a 50-metre radius of the area where the carcasses have been found, he said.

When it comes to bird flu, migratory birds are suspected to be the carriers of the disease. Though it bears a zoonotic potential , no incident has been reported in the country so far.

The pathogens carried by the visiting bird population reach the domestic avian species through the contaminated waterbodies of the State. As a large number of migratory birds reach the wetlands and waterbodies regularly, there is the high possibility of the outbreak of the disease.

The department has also been carrying out routine surveillance programmes and analysing bird droppings for possible signs of outbreak of diseases, Dr. Jayachandran said.

After the latest episode of the outbreak, according to a communication, the institute has cautioned officials in charge of the Kadalundy Bird Sanctuary to be vigilant and watch for any suspicious illness or death of migratory birds or other birds in nearby places.

No bird monitoring plan

At the same time, P.O. Nameer, Professor, Department of Wildlife Sciences of the Kerala Agriculture University, Thrissur, who chalked out a round-the-year surveillance scheme for migratory birds for the Forest Department, said the State lacked an effective bird monitoring programme.

The surveillance scheme, prepared following the 2015 outbreak of bird flu, had an elaborate list of 115 sites in Kerala frequented by migratory birds and visiting bird species. The need for identifying the ‘flyway’ of birds was highlighted in the proposal as the State lacked such a database. The Bombay Natural History Society had agreed to collaborate with the project. However, the project did not take off, he said.

There is no point in blaming the migratory birds for the outbreak of such diseases as the State could not obtain conclusive evidence to support the theory. The health hazards posed by imported pet birds need to be looked into. The hygienic conditions of poultry farms shall be ensured, he suggested.

A consortium of experts from the Department of Community Medicine of the Kerala University of Health and Allied Sciences, Wildlife Science of the Kerala Agriculture University, and the Veterinary Public Health Department of the Kerala Veterinary and Allied Science University, may be constituted to address the issues, he suggested.

A senior official of the Forest Department, while conceding that there was no proposal for the continuous monitoring of migratory birds, said the role of the department in such cases was limited to passing on information to the Department of Animal Husbandry (DAH). When unnatural deaths of birds and other wild animals are reported, the information will be passed on to the DAH, he said.

N.N. Sasi, former DAH Director, said rapid response teams should be formed in the State to address the outbreak of diseases. “There should be an epidemic chart which features the possible diseases and the time of the year when its outbreak can be expected,” he said.

Dr. Jayachandran said disease reporting had gone online in the DAH. During the latest episode of avian flu, poultry farmers at the epicentre of the disease could be located and quarantine measures initiated using the web-based application of the department.

“Kerala is prone to such diseases and cannot secure itself from such outbreaks unless necessary measures are taken to screen the animals and birds brought into the State,” he said. Strengthening of check-posts of the Animal Husbandry Department was the need of the hour, he added.

Habitat destruction

T.S. Anish, Associate Professor of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, felt that destruction and shrinkage of wildlife habitats were the key factors influencing the outbreak of zoonotic diseases.

“The loss of habitats of wild animals such as bats, monkeys, and civet cats forced them to move closer to human habitations and establish new interfaces with human beings. The new interfaces also led to the spread of zoonotic diseases,” he said.

“Civet cats have almost become urban animals as their natural habitats have been wiped out. These animals are believed to be the mediators for the pathogen that caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Bats, which lost their natural habitats, moved into human habitations. These animals are now considered as the reservoirs of Nipah and Ebola virus,” said Dr. Anish.

The changed land use patterns and absence of effective waste management systems have led to the increase in rodent population.

Rodents such as rats spread diseases such as leptospirosis. Without addressing the habitat changes and destruction of forest ecosystems, one cannot address the issue of zoonotic diseases, Dr. Anish said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/d2n8vb/article31080212.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/keralajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/keralas-battle-against-zoonotic-diseases/article31070784.ece
157,2020/03/14,16 samples from Kottayam negative,"11 persons are in isolation wards

Even as the authorities have strengthened the precautionary measures against the spread of SRS-COV-2 virus to more persons, as many as 16 swab samples from the district tested negative for the virus during an examination at the National Institute of Virology, Alappuzha.

Giving a major relief to the health authorities, the number of new isolation cases too marked a significant decline with just 56 persons being advised to go on home quarantine on Saturday.

At present, 11 persons are in isolation wards in hospitals and 1,107 persons are under surveillance in Kottayam.

While one person was discharged from isolation ward, a Dubai-returned man hailing from Thrissur was admitted to isolation ward at the Government Medical College here on Saturday.

Meanwhile, relatives of the 64 year-old man who died on Thursday while living under home isolation in Chengalam near Kumarakom, alleged serious lapses from the part of the Health Department in providing timely assistance. The deceased man had been listed as a secondary contact of one of the two COVID-19 patients from Chengalam and died following a massive cardiac arrest on Thursday night

158,2020/03/14,Lotus farmers confident as pink flower finds value addition,"Spurt in demand for kondattam, squash, pickles, herbal products made with lotus

Value addition is increasingly being found for the lotus being cultivated in the wetlands of Tirunavaya in the district.

Even when major temples across the State find a slump in the number of devotees arriving for darshan and major temple festivals facing postponement in the wake of the COVID-19 scare, the two dozen-odd farmers engaged in lotus cultivation at Tirunavaya are confident that this year’s yield will not go begging.

The Tirunavaya lotus has always been in demand as it is preferred to the lotus from other places such as Thripayar and Nagercoil because of its colour, size and smell. The Tirunavaya pink lotus is preferred in temples across the State, including Guruvayur.

Farmers are hopeful that there will be a spurt in demand for value-added products such as kondattam, squash, pickles, and other herbal products made with lotus. Several Ayurveda medicines, especially some meant for children, are made with lotus.

Re-Echo initiative

“We used to supply lotus to Ayurveda medical firms, including Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala, whenever we had good yield. But our priorities continue to be for puja in temples,” said Mohammed Aslu K., alias Aslu Lotus, a farmer at Tirunavaya. An initiative made by the Re-Echo, an environment protection group based at Tirunavaya, for promoting lotus cultivation and creating value addition to the beautiful pink flower since 2015 has had its results. The Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) at Tavanur had shown interest in lotus and explored the potentials of the flower for making such products as kondattam, squash, pickle and cream.

“We could bring the attention of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the lead bank and several other organisations to lotus farming. We could win some respect for the farmers as well,” M.K. Sateesh Babu, financial literacy counsellor of the Malappuram District Cooperative Bank.

The Re-Echo conducted a Lotus Mela at Tirunavaya in 2015 and a couple of years later conducted a mega floral carpet by using 12,500 lotus flowers. This floral carpet had secured an Asian record for using the largest number of lotus.

“We could use so many lotus flowers because it was cheap at that time. Our objective was to bring the attention of the land and its people to the farmers who have been cultivating lotus as a means of traditional living in Tirunavaya,” said Mr. Sateesh Babu.

The tourism potentials of lotus are also being explored by farming lotus in such a way as to help the tourists pluck them for pleasure.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/o1spj9/article31070772.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15TVTV-LOTUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lotus-farmers-confident-as-pink-flower-finds-value-addition/article31070773.ece
159,2020/03/14,"Back home, after a harrowing wait in Rome","20-odd Malayalis had to wait for three days at Fiumicino airport to fly back

“No trauma can be bigger than that of being denied entry to your country of birth when in distress. I will not wish it even for the staunchest of my enemies,” says Abhijit K.S., one of the 20-odd passengers who landed at the Cochin international airport here on Saturday after spending more than 72 disquieting hours at the Fiumicino international airport in Rome.

After being denied flight in the last minute on Tuesday, a group of 40-odd Malayalis had been stranded at the airport before a section of those passengers were taken in by an Emirates flight on Friday evening. The flight arrived here around 8.30 a.m.

“We have been literally camping in front of the Emirates counter since then and finally the airline staff informed us that we will be taken in their flight. By then many among us had gone back in the face of the seemingly never-ending uncertainty,” says Abhijit.

‘An exemption’

Interestingly, they were not required to produce a medical certificate clearing them of COVID-19 infection as mandated by the Union government for allowing them entry into the country. “We were told that those going to Kochi alone were being granted that exemption. Our temperature was checked at the time of boarding and also at Dubai,” says Santhosh Antony, another passenger.

Abhijit says the situation in Italy had spiralled so out of control that there was no way they could have got tested and received a certificate. “People are under the impression that Italy being an advanced European country is more than capable of dealing with this emergency. But the fact is that they are just so jolted by the enormity of the challenge,” he says.

Fego Francis and Gloria Fego are trying to soothe their frayed nerves even hours after reaching the safety of their home in Thrissur. They had to spend more than three days with their their two-month-old son at the airport, something that would haunt them for long.

Tickets issued to the passengers had expired by Friday and with attempts to get tickets rescheduled by the travel agency getting delayed some of them bought new tickets rather than run the risk of another postponement of their journey.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/6zqi36/article31070764.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15TVTV-ITALY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/back-home-after-a-harrowing-wait-in-rome/article31070765.ece
160,2020/03/14,Corona-care centres near airports,"Train passengers to be screened at designated points, checking at 24 border points on roads

The State is readying corona-care centres near all airports as per the directive of the Centre to provide a ‘‘safe environment for those arrivals who may need to be housed overnight” while completing the universal airport screening.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here on Saturday that preparations were already on to identify and ready suitable locations. The Centre had on March 12 issued a directive to all States to establish quarantine centres “that can house 500 to 2,000 people or more in the vicinity of airports”, with CCTV monitoring, to quarantine nationals coming from those countries which are reporting large number of COVID -9 cases and deaths.

Mr. Vijayan said the district administration will be in touch with private hospitals to rope in their support to ensure that proper isolation facilities with ICUs and ventilator support can be additionally arranged.

He announced tightened measures for surveillance at railway stations, airports and border points. Train passengers would be screened at designated points by a three-member team under a Superintendent of Police, which will include a local body representative and health personnel. Similar checking would be held at 24 border points on the roads across the State. Vehicles would be stopped to screen passengers.

Home quarantine

Though people arriving from foreign nations without apparent symptoms were being put on home quarantine, what actual “home quarantine” entails seems to have been lost on people. This is despite the massive awareness campaigns run by the Health Department that home quarantine entails isolating oneself in home, just as one would if they had contracted chicken pox.

This meant confining oneself to a self-contained room, with little or no contact with other family members. Unless this is followed strictly, more people have to be admitted to isolation facilities, creating unnecessary strain on hospitals.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dclulv/article31070756.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15tvpt-coronacallcentre1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/corona-care-centres-near-airports/article31070757.ece

162,2020/03/14,IT training for teachers in online mode,"81,000 primary teachers from 11,274 schools to participate in the programme

In the wake of the closure of schools till March 31 in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) has come up with a novel idea of imparting IT training in online mode for over 81,000 primary teachers in the State through focussed intervention in 11,274 schools.

Traditionally, the IT training would have been conducted in three batches in over 1,000 centres with each centre having 25 teachers and two trainers.

High-tech facilities

However, in the online mode, the same training will be completed within five days by using high-tech facilities made available in schools.

The first part of the training will be held from March 18 to 27. The contents of the programme include measures to combat cybercrime and online safety.

Login facility

Earlier, KITE had provided the State’s first ever government-approved MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) model KOOL (KITE’s Open Online Learning) that enabled a flexible training platform for teachers without worrying about their teaching hours. Over 12,000 teachers benefited from the programme. Similarly, login facility had been enabled for all teachers in the Samagra portal.

“The special IT training has been arranged with the inclusion of necessary support files, video tutorials, resources and so on in the teachers’ login on Samagra to ensure zero quality loss, along with requisite monitoring mechanisms such as accurate online attendance,” K. Anvar Sadath, Chief Executive Officer, KITE, said. Teachers will be able to participate in the training programme either through self-learning using the available resources or through group study. Necessary support systems such as video conferencing with a mentor for a fixed number of schools, social media, and help desk for clearing doubts and monitoring have been set up.

Teachers will have to collate the training contents as in the module in digital format on completion of their daily training.

This will be inspected online by the mentors. The IT coordinators in schools will assist the headmasters/headmistresses.

Telecast

The KITE-Victers channel will telecast a special programme on the training.

In addition to broadband Internet in schools, a facility for the teachers to get digital resources on mobile phones will also be arranged.

It has been decided to provide specific vacation training to all primary and upper primary teachers during April and May as part of KITE’s E-cube English (Enjoy, Enhance and Enrich English) programme for improving English language efficiency.

The first day of the vacation training programme will feature a special test to ensure that only those teachers who successfully compete the online training programme will be allowed to attend the vacation training.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/it-training-for-teachers-in-online-mode/article31070747.ece
163,2020/03/14,COVID-19 | Weddings in the time of coronavirus,"Pared-down guest lists, postponed dates mark the mood of the season

Months before, when the world was yet to hear about COVID-19, Vipin Das and Athira Anish had begun preparations for a big fat wedding. And their parents invited almost all their guests in advance for their wedding scheduled at Makkarapparambu in Malappuram district on March 30. But, in a matter of a week things changed so much that they have now decided to have a simple wedding with just 10 guests in attendance.

“Both of us have a large circle of friends, from Puducherry where we studied and from our native place. Around 2,000 people were set to attend our wedding. With the COVID-19 scare, we thought it would be best to change it into a humble ceremony, with only our immediate family in attendance. We have circulated a small write-up explaining the situation. The response has been positive,” says Mr. Das, who works as a senior associate at the National Payment Corporation of India. Ms. Athira is a PhD scholar.

For some others, there is no other option but to postpone the wedding as either the bride or the groom or both work overseas and have no way of getting back home.

“We have four weddings scheduled to be held this month. All of these are being postponed, out of which two are being put off because the bride or groom is abroad. Some are in a dilemma on whether to go ahead with a ceremony having only a few guests or postpone it,” says T. Thomas, manager, Girideepam Convention Centre here.

At one of the halls here, a wedding ceremony was held on Saturday with only a few guests in attendance.

“There are comparatively fewer number of weddings scheduled this month. Three weddings have already been postponed, while the families that have booked for two weddings which are to happen next week are yet to inform us whether it will be postponed. We are not taking any additional payment for postponement,” says Rarith, managing director of RDR Auditorium in Thiruvananthapuram.

Five days ago, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had urged the public to postpone or choose simple weddings with few guests in view of the prevailing situation. While some are happy at the prospect of a simple wedding sans all the tension and crowd, some others are finding it hard to accept that all their efforts will go down the drain.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/65lwh5/article31070742.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15tv-wedding,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/weddings-in-the-time-of-covid-19/article31070743.ece

To ensure that people in home quarantine adhere to the guidelines of the Health Department, a volunteer will be deputed for each house,” said the Minister.

According to the Minister, the government will also consider setting up ‘isolation hostels’ across the district taking into account the difficulties for some people to go on isolation in their houses, especially the primary and secondary contacts of the COVID 19 patients.

The authorities had already identified some places for such hostels, Minster said.

Meetings

Meetings led by legislative members would be convened at the block-level while the action plan for local awareness would be prepared in meetings to be convened by presidents of respective grama panchayats on Monday.

168,2020/03/14,Govt. cracks the whip on IAS officers,"Chief Secretary warns action for challenging Cabinet

The State government has cracked the whip on civil service discipline. It has warned strict action against IAS officers who openly challenge or resort to public posturing against decisions taken by the State Cabinet.

The move comes against the backdrop of reports that Revenue Principal Secretary V. Venu had threatened to go on leave in protest against the government’s decision to transfer Survey and Land Records Director V.R. Premkumar.

The IAS Officers Association had criticised the transfer. It said in a press release that rules mandated that the government give civil servants a minimum tenure of two years in a post and any abrupt removal should have the concurrence of the Civil Service Board (CSB).

At the instance of the government, Chief Secretary Tom Jose issued a warning stating that the government had noticed that IAS officers were “using public platforms and social media to criticise the decisions taken lawfully by the government.”

Mr. Jose said “it is also seen that some officers respond to such instances by aiding and abetting such actions of other service members.”

He said All India Service Conduct rules, 1968, prohibits adverse comments against the government. The law also bans adverse criticism of any current policy or action of the government.

Mr. Jose also warned officers who “aid and abet” such criticism against the government, in what was widely perceived as an oblique censure of Mr. Venu. The government overrode the demands of IAS officers and appointed R. Girija to the post vacated by Mr. Premkumar.

The government had earlier issued a similar warning against Director General of Police Jacob Thomas for criticising the government response in the wake of the Ockhi cyclone.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-cracks-the-whip-on-ias-officers/article31070458.ece

The Excise Department has released stocks of illicit spirit to public entities to produce hand sanitisers to meet the frantic demand triggered by the COVID-19 threat.

It has freed up hundreds of litres of 70% and above proof extra neutral alcohol from its custody and made the spirit available to the College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, to make the direly needed sanitising fluid. The college has garnered considerable experience in making sanitising liquid for doctors and paramedics during the Nipah outbreak in 2018.

Excise Range, Thiruvananthapuram, has supplied the spirit on the direction of Commissioner of Excise S. Aananthakrishnan.

Officials said they would also provide seized contraband to the Kerala State Drugs & Pharmaceuticals (KSDP) to make hand sanitisers for the public.

The government has tasked the public sector unit to manufacture the sanitising liquid in trade quantities to tide over the current scarcity. The KSDP has promised the government to supply scented and bottled hand sanitiser at a quarter of the market price to the State. The State plans to make it available to the public at a nominal cost through government agencies and public offices.

The patient known as ‘R2’ took a flight on March 10 from London to Bahrain, from where he took a Gulf Air flight (Flight no – GF0060) on the same day to Thiruvananthapuram. After landing at the international airport here at 5 a.m., he travelled in a car with his brother-in-law, sister-in-law and father-in-law to their flat in Kaithamukku.

At 8 a.m. on March 11, he travelled in the family’s car to the General Hospital. From the parking area, he walked to the OP ticket counter and from there to the COVID 19 OP waiting area. After swab tests, he hailed an auto rickshaw (KL-01 CB 4026) at 10.30 a.m. and headed to Kaithamukku. He stopped at a shop opposite the Kaithamukku Co-operative Bank to drink lime juice. On not getting the same in the first shop, he headed to the next one, from where he drank the juice. In both these shops, he stood outside, and hence did not come into close contact with the shopkeepers, said District Collector S.Gopalakrishnan.

He went inside the flat at 10.45 a.m. Till his test results came on Friday evening, he was in home quarantine, but was in close contact with the other family members, eating at the same dining table and sharing the phone. A total of seven persons, including the three family members, have been identified as primary contacts and quarantined.

“One thing we noticed in the case of people who were in home quarantine is that they were not fully in quarantine within their homes. They were in close contact with their family members. This should be avoided. The person who is suspected of being affected should spend the entire duration within a closed room. Food or other essential items should be left at the door. Real home quarantine is the best solution,” said the Collector.

In his flight, there were 69 passengers. Of them, 21 are from Tamil Nadu, 15 from Thiruvananthapuram, 15 from Kollam, nine from Alappuzha, eight from Pathanamthitta and 1 from Malappuram. Seven of them are foreigners. Thirty seven of the passengers have been identified as high-risk contacts, within three rows of his seat. The district administration is in the process of contacting them, with 70% of them being contacted till now.

Regarding the third patient, an Italian national, who has been staying in Varkala, only about 70% of the contact tracing has been completed. He took a flight from Venice to Moscow on February 26. The next day, he took a flight to Delhi, reaching there at 4.25 a.m. From there, he took a Vistara flight (UK 897) to Thiruvananthapuram, arriving here at 10.25 a.m. on February 27. Since it was a domestic flight, only passenger names are available as of now. The district administration is in touch with the Vistara officials to get more details, said the Collector.

Along with his friend, a Kashmiri native running a jewellery shop in Varkala, he went to the Government Hospital in Parippally in an autorickshaw. As per directions from there, they went separately to the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College Hospital. Since the test results were confirmed on Friday, he has been in isolation in the hospital.

173,2020/03/14,Avian flu: Culling of birds begins in Malappuram,"10 rapid response teams engaged in culling, incinerating and burying poultry

Culling of birds, particularly poultry, began at Palathingal near Parappanangadi on Saturday morning in the wake of the detection of avian flu in the region.

Ten rapid response teams (RRTs) of the State Animal Husbandry Department supported by health and civic officials launched the drive to cull about 4,000 birds kept within a one-kilometre area from Palathingal.

A few hundreds of birds were culled methodically as per the bird flu management protocol within the first four hours on Saturday. Animal Husbandry officials said that the culling would continue for two more days.

As many as 20 veterinary surgeons supported by 119 livestock inspectors and 30 attendants are out in the field, catching, killing, incinerating and burying the birds. A section is engaged in sanitizing the area.

The incineration of the culled birds, their feeding utensils and cages, the masks and gloves worn by the RRTs and other accoutrements is done in the same locality as a measure to prevent the spread of the virus.

The district administration has suspended the licences of poultry shops within 10 km area from Palathingal in Tirurangadi and Parappanangadi municipalities. Sale or transport of poultry or any other pet bird is banned in the region for the next three months.

District Collector Jafer Malik said that people would be compensated for the culled birds, but in accordance with the government rates.

A special cleaning drive will begin for three days after the culling. Yet another inspection for the birds will be conducted on the fifth day. If any bird is found in that inspection, it will be confiscated and killed.

S. Nandakumar, disease investigation officer from the State Institute for Animal Diseases, Palode, said that no compensation would be given to the birds culled in the secondary stage.

The State government will submit a sanitation certificate to the Centre after the culling process. Random samples will be collected from within 10 km radius at every fortnight and will be sent for examination to national laboratories at Bhopal or Bengaluru. This will continue for three months.

The Centre will give a certificate only if the tests are negative.

175,2020/03/14,Power-packed punch to a glass ceiling,"All-women team carries out high-risk maintenance of overhead electric traction

For the past few years, women have been a vital part of the maintenance workforce of overhead electrical lines in the Thiruvanananthapuram railway division.

But, an all-women team executing annual maintenance of the overhead electric traction is a first in the division.

In connection with the International Women’s Day campaign of Railways, a 11-member all-women team carried out high-risk annual maintenance of the overhead electric traction at the Kayamkulam railway station and adjacent areas on Thursday (March 5) with ease.

Led by junior engineer Briji and comprising technicians and helpers, the team was drawn from Kollam and Kayamkulam.

With the aid of a tower wagon, they cleaned overhead equipment, insulators, measured the parameters, and climbed the cantilever to carry out adjustments in the overhead line.

Demanding job

Sporting the distinct uniform, safety helmet, gloves, hook and safety shoes, they ascended ladders, climbed to the top of the tower wagon with ease and carried out the work..

“It is a physically demanding job. One has to even climb the cantilever that is seven metre from the ground level. All are in the age group of 30 to 40 years and we executed it with ease. The annual maintenance work has to be carried out when there is no train movement. Completing the work in the time frame was a challenge,” says Briji, who is in the traction distribution wing for the past 17 years.

Snapped lines

Their work is not limited to maintenance alone; these women are also involved in changing the lines that are snapped by uprooted trees and in accidents.

They were active in restoring supply and charging the overhead electric line at several places after electric masts and lines got snapped in rain and floods in 2019.

“These women are involved in all work day and night and they can take up any assignment. Mobilising women-only teams is difficult as only 82 of the 403 personnel in the traction distribution department are women,” says Anoop V., Senior Divisional Electrical Engineer, Traction Distribution. As it is a high risk job, the overhead power lines are switched off and earthed properly before taking up the work.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/obou67/article31064530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09tvworkingladies,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/power-packed-punch-to-a-glass-ceiling/article31064531.ece
176,2020/03/14,Farmer producer companies find neera package inadequate,"They call for broad-based incentives to save the ailing sector

Enterprises have called for a more broad-based financial support for the neera sector while welcoming a package announced by the State government for the debt-ridden farmer producer companies launched around 2014 with the promise of jobs and substantial earnings for the firms.

Neera, the unfermented sap from coconut flowers, has been touted as capable of revolutionising the market for natural health drinks. The Coconut Development Board had taken the initiative in setting up farmer producer companies with a view to tapping the market and increasing farmer income.

The State government has now announced that it will initially support five coconut producer companies that availed themselves of loans from the Kerala State Financial Corporation for setting up the neera-tapping and processing units. These companies are at Kadathanadu, Perambra, Malappuram, Tirur, and Palakkad.

While the government has promised to write off the penal interest on the loans secured by these companies and to extend the time period for the repayment of loans, there is a feeling that more companies should be brought under the government umbrella.

29 companies

E. Shasheendran, chairman of the Badagara Coconut Farmer Producer Company, says the package announced by the government would not be enough to save the companies. There are 29 companies that set up neera-tapping and processing operations with the State government promise of support in different ways. They have run up a bill of around ₹50 crore in loans, including collection through public participation, he says.

Shahjahan Kanjiravilayil, chairman of the Kaippuzha farmer producer company, says the government step is a sign that it is taking note of the distress of the neera sector but more has to be done for the whole spectrum of companies. The present package, he says, is being offered to companies that are not currently engaged in the production and sale of neera. Mr. Sasheendran says that with most of the companies utilising their loan money to set up the processing units, they do not have sufficient funds for the day-to-day operations.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4pkyud/article31064424.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14TVNEERA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/farmer-producer-companiesfind-neera-package-inadequate/article31064425.ece
177,2020/03/14,Three more COVID-19 cases confirmed in State,"Health system gets stretched with more people under surveillance and in isolation, mass testing

Kerala seems to be going into a mass testing mode for COVID 19 as more positive cases continue to surface, posing new challenges and putting the health system under strain.

The very factors that spurred Kerala’s development -- a huge population of non-resident Keralites spread across nations, its attraction as a major tourist destination -- are now turning out to be huge challenges when it comes to tackling the new pandemic.

Three persons in the capital district, all of them came from abroad, were confirmed as COVID-19 positive on Friday, taking the total number of patients in the second wave of coronavirus disease to 19, spread across six districts. One of the cases is that of a person from Vellanad who come from the UAE after visiting several nations, including Italy. He had been advised home quarantine on arrival at the Thiruvananthapuran international airport but was later brought in for testing. COVID-19 was also confirmed in an Italian tourist who had already been in quarantine at the resort where he had booked in at Varkala. His respiratory samples had been collected and sent for testing on Wednesday. The third case was that of a person who had returned from the U.K. and who had been sent to isolation upon arrival at the airport here. All three are admitted to the special isolation ward at the Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital. As on Friday, 5,468 persons are under surveillance, of whom 277 are in isolation in hospitals.

Vigil on tourist centres

Briefing media, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the State would have to keep a vigil on all tourist centres, including homestays and resorts, and that all persons who had arrived from nations where COVID-19 was active would have to undergo testing. The State would have to arrange for testing facilities in trains which come across the border and at the multiple entry points to the State with the help of police.

He said Malayali students who were planning to return from Kalburgi in Karnataka, where a COVID-19 death had been reported, would also have to undergo the Health Department’s testing and isolation. State’s containment activities are going on full steam, but individuals would have to understand the high transmissible nature of the disease and be prepared to impose certain self-restrictions and practise social distancing.

Discussions had been held with airport authorities on strengthening surveillance and in ensuring that none of the travellers escape the universal screening. Forced isolation may be necessary for people returning from some nations where active COVID-19 transmission is on, he said.

He added that considering the shortage of sanitisers in the market, the Kerala State Drugs and Pharmaceuticals would manufacture and supply one lakh litres of the product.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hdqmk2/article31064365.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14TVFOODCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/three-more-covid-19-cases-confirmed-in-state/article31064366.ece
178,2020/03/14,KSDP produces hand sanitisers,"Product priced at ₹125 for 500 ml

With hand sanitisers almost disappearing from the market due to massive demand after the outbreak of COVID-19, the State government has made an endeavour into manufacturing the same.

The Kerala State Drugs and Pharmaceuticals (KSDP), under the Industries Department, has begun production of hand sanitisers, with an aim of producing one lakh bottles in 10 days for the Kerala Medical Services Corporation. Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan said that these will be made available to the public at a fraction of the price of hand sanitisers marketed by private companies.

The first load of 500 hand sanitisers, in 500 ml bottles each, were sent to Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam districts on Friday, with a target of 2,000 set for Saturday. It is being prepared based on a formula approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Severe shortage

The hand sanitisers available in the market cost anywhere between ₹150 to 200 for 100 ml, while the KSDP’s product is priced at ₹125 for 500 ml.

There has been a severe shortage of hand sanitisers in the market, with stocks disappearing in most medical stores. Mr. Jayarajan said that a decision will be taken later on the manufacturing of the product on an industrial scale at KSDP. He said that KSDP, the only public sector drug manufacturer in the State, has made huge strides in recent years.

179,2020/03/14,Relief for some stranded Mayalalis,"40-odd passengers being brought from Rome

The ordeal of 40-odd Malayalis stranded at the Fiumicino international airport in Rome for over three days came to an end eventually on Friday when a section of them were accommodated on a flight headed to Kochi via Dubai.

They had been languishing at the airport since Tuesday when they were supposed to board a flight to Kochi but was turned down in the last minute as they were not able to produce medical certificates clearing them of COVID-19 infection as required by the Indian government for allowing entry into the country.

“We are on an Emirates flight which left the airport at 2.45 p.m. Italian time on Friday. The flight is expected to reach Kochi on Saturday by around 9 a.m. Though the airline tried its best to accommodate all of us, they couldn’t as the flight was full with no cancellations. The rest are likely to board the flight at the same time on Saturday,” said Santhosh Antony while chatting with The Hindu from aboard the flight. He could not confirm how many of them were on the flight.

He, however, was evasive when asked whether the medical test was conducted as required and said that he would share such details on his arrival. Among the passengers aboard the flight was a two-month-old child and mother.

The stranded passengers’ window for a safe exit seemed remote after reports emerged that the Fiumicino airport was set to be closed on Friday. Asked whether the threat of the shutdown of the airport was still there, Mr. Antony said it may still happen in the days to come.

With no food available at the airport, they were dependent on the food arranged by the Malayali community for the last three days.

The trauma of the stranded Keralites was raised even in the State Assembly on Thursday with both the government and the Opposition unilaterally demanding their return home while decrying the Centre's decision to bring in only those who were tested negative for COVID-19.

Health authorities said the passengers would first go to the district hospital, Aluva, and from there those who required tertiary care would be referred for admission at Government Medical College Hospital, Ernakulam.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bttpxo/article31064334.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14TV-ITALY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/relief-for-some-stranded-mayalalis/article31064296.ece

182,2020/03/14,Hospital ties up with Harvard varsity to detect child cancer,"‘Early genetic interventions can address several maladies’

The Shihab Thangal Hospital at Tirur is set to enter into a tie-up with genetic experts of Harvard University, Boston, U.S., for bringing about a new regime for detecting child cancer through early genetic studies.

Discussions between hospital officials and Harvard University professors at Tirur on Thursday decided to utilise their expertise and the latest research methodologies for addressing the genetic disorders in the region.

The death of six children of a family at Tirur over a period of 10 years had raised concerns recently, and the police had to exhume the body of a three-year-old for post-mortem. “Genes can cause such a tragedy,” said Jonathan Picker, assistant professor of genetics from Harvard Medical School and an expert on Fragile X syndrome.

Dr. Picker, whose newborn screening protocols are widely being used in the U.S., said that genetic interventions after proper study of genes would help to greatly address several maladies. He said even problems coming through consanguineous marriages could be addressed through genetic interventions.

Rani George, well known paediatric oncologist from Harvard Medical School, said that child cancer was increasingly being detected. “Parents are often much worried. Child cancer presents itself often too quickly and without any warning. It’s nobody’s fault. It’s just bad luck. It’s in the DNA,” said Dr. George.

With the support of the Harvard Medical School, Shihab Thangal Hospital will conduct health education for early detection of cancer and genetic diseases. “We will organise health seminars by involving world class experts. We will also conduct genetic screening with their support,” said Abdurahman Randathani and Raju George, chairman and chief executive officer of the hospital respectively.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hospital-ties-up-with-harvard-varsity-to-detect-child-cancer/article31064185.ece

The Department of Animal Husbandry has decided to carry out a special drive to disinfect wells and other water sources in areas where birds were culled in large numbers following confirmation of bird flu.

Hundreds of wells and potable water sources in Kodiyathur and Vengeri villages will be covered under the drive taken up with the support of local bodies and Health Department squads.

At a district-level meeting held here on Friday, task force members reviewed preventive measures taken in the affected areas. Though Minister for Forest and Animal Husbandry K. Raju was expected to chair the meeting, he could not turn up following an emergency meeting in Thiruvananthapuram.

At the review meeting, it was also decided to put in place a close surveillance mechanism in areas where migratory birds frequent. It will be done with the support of the Forest Department.

A few vulnerable spots in Kozhikode and nearby districts have already been identified for surveillance measures.

Meanwhile, the collection of samples from suspected areas will continue in Kozhikode district.

The rapid response team constituted for the purpose will continue its sample collection activities. All official helplines will be functional to instantly respond to public complaints and grievances.

Animal Husbandry Department officials said as many as 7,427 birds were culled in the affected regions in Kozhikode district as part of preventive measures against bird flu.

They also called upon the public to cooperate with the upcoming cleaning drive.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/s48dbr/article31064014.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13KI-BIRDFLU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/drive-planned-to-disinfect-potable-water-sources/article31064015.ece

After the first COVID-19 case was detected in Kannur, the Health Department has identified 15 persons who were in primary contact with the patient.

On Thursday, the 44-year-old man from Peringome, who returned from Dubai, was tested positive for COVID-19, a week after he arrived here.

A driver in Dubai, he reached Kannur via Kozhikode airport on March 5. Though he had common cold then, he developed fever on March 7, following which he was taken to Government Medical College, Kannur, where his body fluids were collected. He was also advised home quarantine.

After testing positive for COVID-19, he was shifted to the isolation ward of the Pariyaram medical college. His condition is at present stable, District Collector T.V. Subhash said here on Friday.

The Collector said the district administration was in the process of identifying those who were in primary and secondary contacts with the affected person.

As many as 15 persons who were in primary contact with the patient have been identified so far. Of them, three persons, including the mother, wife and son of the patient, have been admitted to the isolation ward.

The remaining contacts, including the patient’s friends, the taxi driver who drove him from the airport, his uncle, the doctor who attended to him first, and another relative, have been put under home quarantine, he added.

The Collector said the administration was preparing a list of secondary contacts, and that it would be released soon. The Health Department has prepared a route map of places visited by the affected patient.

According to Mr. Subhash, there are 23 suspected cases in various hospitals, including 19 at Kannur Medical College and four at the Kannur Government Hospital. Around 200 persons have been put under home quarantine, he noted.

Meanwhile, two medical boards have been constituted under District Medical Officer Narayana Nayak to tackle the spread of the virus, the Collector said, adding that the situation was under control, and that people need not panic.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/condition-of-patient-stable-says-collector/article31063969.ece
185,2020/03/14,Clarity can be elusive,"It is easy to express one thing but could mean something else, thus confusing the listener or reader. How can we become more coherent?

How often do we come out of a lecture, wondering, “What was that all about?” And there are times when we have to ask for something to be repeated, maybe more than once, and are still left mystified.

On the other hand, it also happens that you read or listen to something, and you get the sense right away — it is as if the words do not stand between you and the meaning.

It could also be the other way around, that you are the one speaking — or writing — and you have a feeling that you are able to say exactly what you mean, and at other times, you feel that the words are just not coming out right.

Clarity is something we all struggle with, both in speech and writing. At times even the simplest idea, even what you think is a straightforward request or response, is very difficult to articulate — and you can see that people do not understand. Being clear is not just about having command over language, although having a good stock of words and an understanding of grammar is a big advantage.

Being coherent

How does one achieve clarity in expression? To start with, we need to be able to think clearly and know the purpose of our speech (or writing). Do we wish to ask a question, seek or give information, or offer an opinion or comment? Each of these demands a different structure, and it should be apparent to the listener (or reader) what we are doing with our words. Usually thinking a little before speaking and playing with the words in our head can help you bring it out better. Cultivating the habit of thinking through your sentence or question can be very useful; you will find that you avoid the several hems and haws that can distract from what you are actually saying. Make it clear from the beginning whether you are asking a question or offering a comment. This helps people prepare their minds to receive information or think about a possible answer.

Second, think about who you are addressing your communication to. This will help you use words that may not be unfamiliar to them, as well as using a tone that is appropriate (formal, casual, respectful, friendly, serious). Often people do not discern the meaning because the tone (if inappropriate) is unexpected, and therefore distracting.

Third, try to be brief. If your idea is clear, it will not take too many words to express it. The advertising wizard David Ogilvy is supposed to have said that if your idea cannot be written on the back of a visiting card, then it is not an idea. You can go into detail if people request you to, and they will definitely ask follow-up questions if they are able to understand what you are saying.

Clarity in writing and speech presents different challenges, and it is important to be aware of them. When you speak, you may have the opportunity to explain yourself once you see people do not understand. But when you write, you cannot do that, so it is even more important to check that you are as clear as you can be — your writing should be impossible to misunderstand.

Ultimately, clarity is about simplicity of expression, and sensitivity to the listener’s or reader’s expectations and needs.

186,2020/03/14,Autonomy is key,"Promoting autonomy is an important step towards higher education reforms. But,are we going about it the right way?

Thirty-six years ago, on the first day of my college life at St. Joseph’s College, Tiruchi, my English teacher, Mr. OK Jose, asked the class, whether anyone knew the meaning of the term ‘autonomy’. With so much enthusiasm, one of the students said, “self-governance”. The teacher was happy with the answer and started explaining the meaning of the term and its implications. The whole 45-minute period was spent on the concept of autonomy and how colleges that are autonomous are different from those which are not. For 17-year-old freshers, it was a useful orientation session.

During the discussion, when a student asked the teacher how autonomy would help the student community, Professor Jose replied, “Prestige. Autonomy is granted by the University Grants Commission (UGC) only to prestigious colleges. There are many benefits…you can proudly state that you are a student of St. Joseph’s Autonomous College.”

Yes, I can proudly state that I studied in St. Joseph’s College (Autonomous) for my UG and PG degrees as the college has been consistently enhancing the quality of education and achieving academic excellence. I was fortunate enough to have my higher education in prestigious autonomous institutions including the Central Institute of English and Foreign Languages (CIEFL), now known as the English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU), Hyderabad.

Why autonomy?

The UGC document on guidelines for autonomous colleges (2017) clearly states that “the only safe and better way to improve the quality of undergraduate education is to delink most of the colleges from the affiliating structure.” Why? The document states that “Colleges with academic and operative freedom are doing better and have more credibility.”

Autonomy implies academic and administrative freedom which should result in the enhancement of quality of education and achievement of academic excellence. The word “delink” is a misnomer as autonomous colleges are not completely delinked from affiliation. They are affiliated to a government body or university but have academic independence.

Advantages

According to the National Policy on Education (1986-1992), colleges which have been granted autonomy status have the freedom to “determine and prescribe its own courses of study and syllabi, and restructure and redesign the courses to suit local needs, make it skill-oriented… evolve methods of assessment of students’ performance, the conduct of examinations and notification of results, promote research in relevant fields, use modern tools of educational technology…promote healthy practices such as community services, extension activities...” Academic independence is the major advantage of being an autonomous institution. Institutions which use the academic and administrative freedom in a responsible manner will flourish and those which misuse the freedom and turn the institutions into ‘teaching shops’ will perish.

Reality

There are over 700 autonomous colleges in the country and Tamil Nadu has the distinction of having the highest total of 190+ autonomous colleges in the country. On what basis is autonomy status granted to colleges? Do all autonomous colleges deserve the status or are they worthy to be called autonomous colleges? Can autonomy be equated with academic excellence?

According to the UGC, colleges which have been given ‘A’ grade — a cumulative grade point average of 3 on a scale of 4 — by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) or colleges with three or more programmes accredited by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) are eligible to apply for autonomy status. What it implies is that colleges accredited by NAAC or NBA have a record of academic standards. But, whether such colleges are really institutes of repute and academic excellence is a debatable question as the perception of the people about the institutions varies.

Affiliation system is not common in developed countries. There is an urgent need to reform the affiliation system in higher education in India. There are 17 affiliating universities with over 500 colleges attached to them. Is good governance possible?

More and more colleges should be given become autonomous status. While promoting autonomy is an important step towards higher education reforms, monitoring whether already existing autonomous institutions have fulfilled the objectives and have really worked towards academic excellence is equally important. As some educationists have raised the concern that not all autonomous colleges are worthy to be called so as they do not propel academic excellence, it is high time the UGC looked into this aspect and took some corrective measures.

Autonomy is a prestige tag and it should be given only to educational institutes that deserve it.

187,2020/03/14,Calm over chaos,"When things start getting tensed, remember to take a chill pill

As a language enthusiast, I often try to explore the roots of expressions or phrases and reflect on how we tend to use them. One such expression that recently caught my fancy is “take a chill pill” or just “chill”.

Apparently, the phrase has its origins in the early 1980s, referring to a kind of medication that induced calmness. Of course this expression has, over time, become quite a popular slang, mostly used when someone is telling us to relax and calm down.

However, in a formal environment such as the workplace, we may not always be able to tell stressed co-workers “to take a chill pill” as it may not always go down well. But we could certainly champion the need to be calm at all times, to the extent possible. This may be especially relevant for the times we live in, infected with anxiety and ambiguity.

After all, the ability to stay calm and act decisively is perhaps one of the greatest indicators of leadership, especially in difficult circumstances. And we don’t need to be in positions of authority to demonstrate leadership and exercise this sense of calm. Fortunately (and perhaps not so fortunately), life throws several situations at us, giving us ample opportunities to navigate stress by staying calm.

Helping others understand

I am full of admiration for individuals unruffled by stressful situations, who indirectly instil confidence in the people around them, through their stoic and comforting presence. I particularly recall a work situation from a long time ago, when a former boss gave us clear, concise and helpful instructions laced with dark humour, when we had to edit and put together content on the 9/11 attacks. This individual’s wisdom and wit helped us objectively approach the task and complete it with diligence and discretion.

We can see the same qualities in some younger individuals too. I have been lucky to work with younger colleagues who exude calm and positivity even when things tend to go south. So, this particular quality needn’t be attributed to wisdom brought on by age or professional experience alone. It could simply be a decision: a decision to choose calm over chaos and panic. Perhaps, this is a choice we could all make in our day-to-day lives, especially when we go through dynamic routines and unpredictable circumstances; or when we are at the receiving end of too much information and misinformation.

Of course, being prepared with the right information, being proactive, taking the right decisions and steps are all necessary and key in any environment, whether the circumstances are extraordinary or not. A calm mindset, perhaps, helps these good old tenets of professionalism to flourish.

So, any time things tend to overwhelm us, we could simply take a chill pill. A few minutes of calm, and we will probably know what to do.

188,2020/03/14,Design your thinking,"An entrepreneurial mindset creates a huge impact, says Nandini Piramal

The Piramal Group recently organised ‘The Tangram Challenge’, an initiative that aims at providing B-school students with a platform to understand the concept of design thinking, and implement its learnings by providing innovative solutions. As part of the competition, students are presented with real-life problem statements in a social setting, identified and curated by Piramal Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Piramal Group.

A key aspect of this challenge involves participants visiting the identified rural areas to delve deeper into the problems faced by communities at the grassroot level, to build and test prototypes of the solutions presented. Through this, they are made aware of issues that are critical roadblocks towards unlocking India’s economic potential.

“Through Tangram, we aim to nurture design thinking as a mindset amongst participants, as they work closely with local communities to build a better future. By the end of the competition, participants discover their own potential and build sustainable, meaningful solutions,” explains Nandini Piramal, the executive director of Piramal Enterprises Limited.

This edition of The Tangram Challenge saw participation from 40 B-schools across India, and received over 1,800 team applications comprising 7,000+ students, where participants underwent three challenging rounds of evaluation. The top 14 shortlisted teams then presented their insights and innovative solutions to a multidisciplinary jury panel that comprised Swati Piramal, Group Vice-Chairperson, as well as other CEOs and business leaders at the Group.

Nandini Piramal, who also heads the Human Resources and Information Technology functions, and is passionately involved with the Foundation, speaks to Education Plus about the importance of design thinking.

Why is design thinking relevant in an academic and corporate environment?

Today’s volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world necessitates individuals and organisations to create innovative, scalable and sustainable solutions with a hands-on approach to address global and local challenges. To meet this requirement, ‘design thinking’ is increasingly being adopted across academic and corporate institutions, providing individuals with a 360° perspective on the current need, its technological feasibility in a social setting, and its economic viability.

The crux of design thinking is in developing empathy and focusing on the end users and communities. As to its relevance in corporate life, we all are in it to serve our customers. Design thinking facilitates this shift from focus on solutions to focus on the customer.

What are the skills that have become increasingly necessary and relevant to the changing corporate sector?

Today, the dynamic workplace ecosystem, while extremely competitive, is undergoing a transformation. To be a step ahead of the curve, individuals need to be agile, innovative, entrepreneurial in spirit, and well-versed with the latest industry trends. We foster innovation and trusteeship and nurture a strong value-based culture that enables our employees to navigate through challenges and market headwinds. We believe that employees with an entrepreneurial mindset, aligned to the values of their organisation, ultimately create a huge impact.

How can such competitions help students?

Competitions such as Tangram provide students with the opportunity to better understand complex problems and challenges faced by the unserved and underserved communities across India while making them more empathetic towards them. Through such competitions, they develop the ability and interest to contribute to the social sector by developing innovative solutions or prototypes that address the concerns faced by marginalised sections of society. These serve as a platform to develop future-ready skill-sets such as design thinking and lateral thinking that are critical for developing holistic solutions to complex problems. In fact, several participants have written to us on how the whole experience has grounded them and encouraged them to step out of their comfort zone.

What is your take on skills versus educational qualifications?

Both are equally important. Increasingly, academic institutions are offering courses focused on building skill-sets such as critical thinking, problem-solving, negotiation, reasoning, technology literacy, creativity, communication, and so on, that are conducive to successful workplaces. These new-age skill-sets complement educational qualifications to enable a well-rounded professional.",education,https://www.thehindu.com/education/dteac3/article31067377.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16EPBSNandini-Piramal,https://www.thehindu.com/education/design-your-thinking/article31067379.ece
189,2020/03/14,Cosmic learning takes off: rise in Montessori education system,"India is witnessing a steady rise in elementary and adolescent Montessori education. The system allows students to find their own space

Preeti Jain’s daughter studies in a Montessori in Bengaluru. When she turned six, Preeti decided to continue her education in the same montessori instead of choosing a mainstream school. “My daughter’s Montessori has an elementary section too,” she says. “I saw how different she was from other children her age, in terms of her social interactions and her independence as a learner. This helped me make my choice.”

Montessori preschools are hugely popular in India but surprisingly, many parents do not know that the Montessori pedagogy and practice extend beyond the preschool years and move to the higher grades too. Montessori education is designed for elementary students in the 6 to 12 age group and for adolescents in the 12 to 18 age group.

India has seen many new elementary Montessoris come up in the last few years. There are currently more than 20 in Bengaluru alone, and this number keeps increasing every year. Chennai has more than three elementary Montessoris, Hyderabad has around 15 and there are new elementary Montessoris coming up in Mumbai, Coimbatore, Erode and Salem. These Montessoris are among the most popular schools in their respective cities.

The adolescent Montessori community is fairly new but is gaining popularity. The country’s first adolescent Montessori community began at Pragnya Montessori in Hyderabad, in 2017. A second adolescent community came up at Medha Montessori in Hyderabad in 2019. These are the first two Montessori adolescent communities in India with teachers or adults trained by the Association Montessori Internationale, a training body that Maria Montessori founded in 1950.

Chaithanya Yalamanchili, Programme Director, Erdkinder, at the Pragnya Montessori School, marvels at the adolescent Montessori or the Erdkinder because it truly unlocks the adolescent’s potential. “They can run an all-economic system completely on their own,” he says. “In our community, they work on entrepreneurial projects, raise funds, make money and reinvest in future projects. They grow vegetables, explore rainwater harvesting and even build boats. They maintain the whole adolescent programme on their own.”

Revolution

Kavya Chandrasekar, the Executive Director of the Montessori Institute of Bangalore (MIB) and Founder of The Montessori School in Bengaluru, says that the elementary Montessori is built on the idea of cosmic education. “We give children tools to be better observers of nature,” she says. “They delve into cause and effect, and investigate their own moral values and beliefs. They work predominantly in groups, but may choose to work independently too.”

This system constantly encourages its students to find their place in the world. They are not confined to subjects. They regularly conference with their guides, document their learning journeys and steer their own course. The Montessori material gives them impressions of real-life scenarios and hands-on practice. In the higher grades, the students in a Montessori move into more abstract work. They work in an interdisciplinary manner and there is a lot of peer-based work.

Curricula

As every student knows, all roads lead to high school exams and all Montessoris that progress into the higher grades inevitably help the students to write these exams. Chandrasekar, for instance, insists that accountability to the national curriculum is emphasised continuously. “Our children understand that they are working with the national curriculum,” she says. “We have a curriculum list that tells them what ground they need to cover by a certain age. Once the children enter elementary Montessori, they meet their teachers or guides once a week or fortnight and discuss their progress. They maintain a journal and talk about how much math, physics or language work that they have done that week. So with freedom, students are also made accountable for the work they need to do.”

Says Yalamanchili, “Montessori students do write board exams. At Pragnya, we work with the Cambridge curriculum. Some montessoris work with the NCERT curriculum. Students don’t find it hard to adapt to that system at all. In fact, we sometimes have students who leave us in the elementary and primary grades to go to mainstream schools and they adapt fairly quickly. When Montessori students leave the school, they are keenly aware of the opportunities and possibilities that exist in the world. For example, my student wants to pursue a career in economics, but also wants to opt for physics.”

As the students approach class VIII and IX, many Montessoris streamline their work to prepare students to meet these challenges. They start using prescribed textbooks and study material. Their concepts are in place and they are able to apply them beautifully. Good elementary and adolescent programmes do prepare children to write exams fearlessly but the difference is in how they do it.

The Montessori method of education was developed in 1897 as a multidimensional learning experience. A Montessori is a mixed-age environment and this encourages a high level of collaboration. In fact, India has a longstanding connection with adolescent Montessori education. When Maria Montessori visited India, she interacted with older children in the country and it greatly influenced her method. The idea of the adolescent community is not at all unusual to India, as seen with Shantiniketan or Gandhiji’s Tolstoy farm.

190,2020/03/14,SCs fear losing benefits under new scholarship plan,"Centre likely to put new scheme in place in a few months

The Central government’s proposal to scrap scholarship schemes catering exclusively to students belonging to communities such as Scheduled Castes (SC) and Other Backward Classes (OBC) and club them into one has drawn criticism from activists in Tamil Nadu.

To be called Pradhan Mantri Young Achievers Scholarship Award Scheme for Vibrant India (PM-YASASVI), the new arrangement is expected to be in place in a few months. Last month, the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment held discussions with senior officials from various States.

The main objection of critics to the Centre’s initiative is the reduced coverage that the new scheme is likely to achieve.

The existing post-matriculation scholarship scheme for SC students, whose origins can be traced to the efforts of B.R. Ambedkar, in the mid-1940s, has become a “big hit” in the last seven or eight years, mainly due to “liberal financial assistance” of the State government, said M. Bharathan, State convener of the Amebdkar Kalvi Nutrandu Iyakkam. “If it is going to get merged with the proposed scheme, it is our apprehension that this may restrict the number of beneficiaries drastically,” he added.

The number of beneficiaries under the post-matric scheme in T.N. has gone up to such an extent that the State government is bearing most of the scheme’s burden, though it is a Central scheme. For example, in 2018-19, the share of the State government was around ₹1,526 crore while that of the Union government was ₹384 crore. One of the reasons being advanced by the Centre for the launch of the new scheme is that the share of the Centre has been reduced to less than 10% which, according to a document of the Union government, has led to the old scheme losing its “character of a national scheme”.

D. Ravikumar, MP from Villupuram, who raised the issue in the Lok Sabha on Friday, found fault with the changes being mooted by the Central government. The inclusion of the criterion of merit might render “a large number of deserving Dalit students ineligible” to get the scholarship, which was, after all, being given only to those who pursued higher studies. Mr. Bharathan said that given the relative disadvantage that the SC students would be faving vis-a-vis OBC students, there was a chance of the latter eating into the share of the former. [However, as per a document of the Central government, out of the annual 62 lakh student-beneficiaries, SCs will account for 42 lakh]. “Let the Central government frame a separate scheme for OBC students. We have no objection,” he said.

While Mr. Ravikumar wants the Centre to retain the post-matric scheme and give it a higher allocation, Mr. Bharathan suggests that the State government absorb the full cost of the scheme. Even now, it has allocated about ₹1,950 crore for 2020-21 towards the scheme. “If the outlay can be increased ₹2,000 crore, there would not be much problem,” he adds.

A senior official of the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department says the State government is formulating its response to the Centre’s proposal.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/150hf5/article31071193.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ravikumar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/scs-fear-losing-benefits-under-new-scholarship-plan/article31070540.ece
191,2020/03/14,I-T dept. shocked by Tasmac’s acceptance of demonetised notes,"Dismisses State undertaking’s explanation of law and order as reason for accepting invalid notes

The Income Tax department has expressed shock over the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac) having accepted demonetised currency notes worth ₹57.29 crore from customers who purchased liquor at its shops between November 9 and December 30, 2016, in complete contravention of the demonetisation announcement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8, 2016.

Also read: Tasmac hikes prices; beer up ₹10 per bottle

After scrutinising Tasmac’s I-T returns for the year 2016-17 through the Computer Aided Scrutiny Selection System (CASS), the department found that Tasmac had an opening balance of ₹84.23 crore as on November 9, 2016, which was declared a bank holiday. Of that balance, ₹81.57 crore was in Specified Bank Notes (SBN or demonetised currency notes of ₹500 and ₹1,000) and ₹2.66 crore in other denominations.

Subsequently, Tasmac had collected ₹3,490.21 crore between November 10 and December 30, 2016, and the cash collections were deposited in its bank accounts on a daily basis. Records showed that the corporation had deposited about ₹140 crore in demonetised notes in bank accounts during the entire demonetisation period. After deducting ₹81.57 crore available as on November 9, 2016, the balance worked out to ₹57.29 crore.

“The assessee is a government-owned State undertaking and it is beyond imagination as to how the State undertaking managed by an IAS officer would collect demonetised currency in contravention of the order of the Government of India... It is beyond probability to think that the assessee company and its outlet shops will exchange the valuable goods purchased by company legally, by transferring valid consideration, in exchange for invalid bank notes (illegal tender).

“Though assessee claimed that it accepted SBN from customers due to law and order problems, the assessee has failed to produce any evidence from Government of Tamil Nadu or Honourable Governor of Tamil Nadu or the police evidencing any law and order issue that constrained the assessee to sell non essential commodity like liquor against invalid bank notes,” the I-T department said in an Assessment Order passed on December 30, 2019 and accessed by The Hindu.

Refusing to believe that such illegal transactions could have been carried out by a State entity and after applying the principle of preponderance of probability, especially because Tasmac did not provide branch-wise details regarding deposit of demonetised notes, the I-T department concluded that the transactions done by the corporation using demonetised notes should be treated as “unexplained investment,” under Section 69 of the Income Tax Act of 1961, for the year 2017-18.

192,2020/03/14,Under-age enrolment at primary level in Tamil Nadu schools is over 10%,"Data reveals that 11.64% of children enrolled in class I in the 2017-18 academic year were below the age of 6

Nearly 11.64 % of children who enrolled in Class I in the 2017-2018 academic year in Tamil Nadu had enrolled before they turned 6. Six years is the minimum age mandated by the Right to Education (RTE) Act for class I. In the 2015 and 2016 academic years as well, the percentage of children below six years of age was 11.95% and 11.84% respectively.

Puducherry tops the list of underage enrolment at the primary level of school education, with 18.75% of students below 6 years enrolled in Class 1 followed by Haryana and Andhra Pradesh. While the Tamil Nadu numbers are low, they were still higher than the national average of 6.98% of students who were below the age of 6 in 2017-18.

The data was a part of the response given to a question raised by Kumari Selja, Rajya Sabha member on whether the government was aware about the high percentage of children enrolled in Class 1 before the age of 6 years. She had further asked if the government had planned to introduce mandatory LKG and UKG Classes in government run-schools.

In his response, Ramesh Pokhriyal, Minister for Human Resource Development said that the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyaan recognises the pre-school programme as a critical component and supports State governments which provide pre-school education either in schools or through co-location of Anganwadis in primary schools.

In December 2018, the Tamil Nadu State Government had announced that montessori-based kindergarten classes would be started in Anganwadi centres functioning in middle schools under the Integrated Child Development Services(ICDS) scheme. The aim was to encourage more parents to send their children to anganwadi centres since parents had turned to private schools for their children aged 4 and 5 years old.

Vasugi Arul, President of the Tamil Nadu Anganwadi Workers Union said that when this was initially announced, it had garnered considerable interest among parents who rushed to admit their children in the kindergarten sections. “This was started in 2,381 anganwadi centres attached to middle schools. The implementation however could have been better since surplus teachers from the department were directed to handle these sections when it should have been eligible anganwadi workers who could have been trained for the same,” she said.

S. Moses, School Teachers Federation of India(STFI) said that to ensure that children not only enrolled in Kindergarten but also seamlessly transitioned to class 1 in the same school, the school education department should have considered setting up kindergarten classes attached to primary schools instead of at Anganwadis, as was proposed. “This will also ensure better administration and students can then join Class 1 in the same primary school,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/uqj6pp/article31068444.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14FEBTH--PRIMARY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/under-age-enrolment-at-primary-level-in-tamil-nadu-schools-is-over-10/article31068445.ece

194,2020/03/14,Rajiv case convict Robert Payas seeks visa for his wife,"HC grants a week’s time to Union Ministry of External Affairs to file its counter affidavit

The Madras High Court on Friday granted a week’s time to the Centre to file its counter affidavit to a writ petition filed by former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convict B. Robert Payas, 50, seeking grant of visa to his wife for travelling from Sri Lanka to India.

After hearing preliminary submissions made by Senior Counsel R. Shunmugasundaram representing the petitioner, Justice K. Ravichandrabaabu accepted a request made by Additional Solicitor General G. Rajagopalan to grant time till March 20 for filing the counter.

In his affidavit, the petitioner said his wife R. Prema and he had come to India on September 20, 1990, as Sri Lankan refugees. Then, she was pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy at a private nursing home in Chetpet here February 6, 1991. The couple named the child Tamilko.

On June 10, 1991, the petitioner was arrested in connection with the assassination and was sentenced to death by the trial court along with 25 others. On May 11, 1999, the Supreme Court commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment while partly allowing his appeal.

A majority of three judges in the Bench acquitted him from the charges under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act of 1987 and confirmed his conviction only for the charge of Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) read with 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code.

Set at liberty

Significantly, “Justice D.P. Wadhwa, the fourth judge in the Bench in fact, in his minority opinion, acquitted me from all the charges and set me at liberty,” the petitioner said and stated that his wife and child had returned to Sri Lanka in 1993 when he was languishing in jail here.

The mother and son came to India on February 10, 2010 on being granted a visa valid for three months. They could not return before May 8, 2010, due to the war between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Sri Lankan army.

Therefore, they got themselves registered as ‘Sri Lankan refugees -Outside the Camp’ at the office of the office of the Commissioner, Rehabilitation and Welfare and were issued registration certificates in July 2010. Within a month thereafter, they returned to Sri Lanka.

During their six months stay in India, they used to visit him in the prison every week. Their return to Sri Lanka on August 22, 2010 was fully authorised since it was the Superintendent of Police, Vellore district, who had granted the exit permit, the petitioner claimed.

Nevertheless, when Ms. Prema applied for visa at the Indian Consulate at Jaffna on November 22, 2018, she was informed orally that some criminal records were found against her. She made a request again on October 14, 2019, but there was no response till date, he said.

Denying that any criminal record exists against his wife, except the charge of having overstayed in the country in 2010, the petitioner sought a direction to the Union Ministry of External Affairs to grant visa to his wife so that she could fly down to meet him.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rajiv-case-convict-robert-payas-seeks-visa-for-his-wife/article31064752.ece
195,2020/03/14,"Prohibition only in phases, says CM","AIADMK reminded about its promise

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami told the State Assembly on Friday that total prohibition in the State could be implemented only in phases.

Replying to S. Austin (DMK), who referred to the AIADMK’s election manifesto on this, Mr. Palaniswami said prohibition would be implemented only in phases to ensure that illicit liquor did not come up.

Taking a dig at the DMK for having announced land for landless agricultural labourers without knowing the reality, he asked how many beneficiaries benefited from the announcement.

“Promises made in election manifesto are to be implemented only step by step. They cannot be implemented within a specific period of time.. When we make promises in the manifesto, our intention is to implement them. But only based on the prevailing circumstances they can be implemented,” Mr. Palaniswami said.

Earlier, Minister for Electricity, Prohibition and Excise P. Thangamani too pointed out that the promise in the election manifesto was only to implement prohibition of liquor in phases and there was no specific timeframe given to implement the promise.

When the DMK pointed out that State-run liquor shops were shifted to other places, after the Supreme Court order against such shops on the highways, instead of closing them, Leader of the House and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam pointed out it was in line with the court order.

Additional revenue

Meanwhile, the government said an additional ₹2,576.96 crore in revenue would be received due to the increase in excise duty of ₹10 on IMFL brands and ₹1 per bulk litre of beer. The revenue to exchequer from excise revenue and VAT for the year 2019-20 until February was ₹28,839 crore.

Mr. Thangamani announced that the State would conduct awareness campaigns against consumption of liquor and drunk driving by printing advisory messages — consumption of alcohol is injurious to health and be safe and don’t drink and drive — on liquor bottles at a cost of ₹3.50 crore and that 25,697 Tasmac retail vending employees will receive a pay hike of ₹500 a month at a cost of ₹15.42 crore to exchequer.

He announced monetary rewards worth ₹15 lakh to prohibition enforcement wing officials and local police who help in

seizure of smuggled rectified spirit, spurious and non-duty paid liquor.

Also, ₹5 crore would be set aside to provide financial assistance for rehabilitating persons who have been weaned away from illicit distillation and illicit liquor trade.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/prohibition-only-in-phases-says-cm/article31064747.ece
196,2020/03/14,‘Physical disability certificates must be in prescribed format’,"HC asks motor accident claims tribunals to follow order scrupulously

The Madras High Court on Friday directed all motor accident claims tribunals in the State to stop accepting physical disability certificates that are not in a format prescribed by the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment on January 4, 2018.

Justice R. Mahadevan held that issuance of disability certificates by medical boards without meeting out the statutory requirements would result in irregularities and inconsistencies. Therefore, a proper and uniform method should be adopted.

He directed the High Court Registry to circulate a copy of his order to all district and subordinate courts dealing with motor accident claims so that they could scrupulously follow it before awarding compensation depending upon the percentage of disability suffered by victims.

The judge made it clear that his verdict should also be forwarded to the government authorities concerned so that it could be circulated to district medical boards.

“The courts shall, henceforth, accept only statutory certificates and not mere statements of disability,” he added. The directions were issued while disposing of a batch of motor accident appeals.

During the course of hearing, the insurance companies complained to the court about the absence of a uniform format for issuance of disability certificates and claimed that such a situation led to irregularities.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/8n5onz/article31064735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14MADRASHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/physical-disability-certificates-must-be-in-prescribed-format/article31064736.ece

198,2020/03/14,BJP’s move puts spotlight on Dalit leaders,"SC candidates in both Congress and BJP have not tasted success in the past

The appointment of L. Murugan as president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State unit has kindled the debate whether a Scheduled Caste member can emerge as a successful leader in a major party in Tamil Nadu given the fact that the community members have not made it to the top in the two established parties so far.

In the BJP, it was after 17 years that a member of the Scheduled Caste could become President. His predecessor was S.P. Kirupanidhi, who held the post during 2000-2003.

His innings was remembered in political circles as a case of failure as Mr. Kirupanidhi himself had alleged “non-cooperation” from sections of the party and in 2011 he joined the DMK.

In the last 50-odd years, the State unit of the Congress had three Presidents from the community. P. Kakkan, who was Home Minister in the Ministry headed by M. Bakthavatasalam, the last Congress Chief Minister (1963-67), became the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) chief in October 1969 and held the post till 1972. At the time of the Congress split in November 1969, he was part of the Congress (Organisation) which had leaders such as K. Kamaraj, S. Nijalingappa and Morarji Desai. In September 1979, L. Elayaperumal, a respected leader, was made president of the State unit of the Congress (Indira) and six months later, he had to quit following dissidence in the organisation. In the wake of the Congress’ rout in the Periyakulam Lok Sabha byelection in September 1982, the State unit of the Congress was dissolved and Maragatham Chandrasekhar, who later became Union Minister, made interim president. She held the post till May 1983.

‘Failure of leaders’

Commenting on the “failure” of the SC leaders in the BJP and the Congress, D. Ravikumar, Villupuram MP and general secretary of the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK), said that “unfortunately, political parties are not able to overcome barriers of caste hierarchy.” Mr Murugan might face more difficult days as the BJP State unit is “more orthodox” than the central leadership. The MP said the BJP, which tried woo Devendra Kula Vellalars, one of the constituents of the SCs, wanow seeking to reach out to another sub-sect, Arundathiyars, to which Mr. Murguan belonged.

Brushing aside the criticism against the Tamil Nadu unit of the party, L. Ganesan, former State president, expressed the hope that the new chief would have a “successful stint” as he had risen from the ranks. Mr. Ganesan said Mr. Kirupanidhi could not make a “huge impact” because he was a “lateral entrant.”

P. Venugopal, two-time Tiruvallur MP representing the AIADMK, said Mr. Murugan would have a “fulfilling stint” given his experience and exposure as vice-chairman of the National Commission for SCs.

G. Ramakrishnan, CPI(M) polit bureau member, said although President Ram Nath Kovind was from Scheduled Castes, there were instances even in Tamil Nadu where village panchayat presidents from the community were not able to function well. “There ought to be policy intervention to make improvement in the socio-economic and political situation,” he says.

P. Ramajayam, academician, said it remained to be seen what stand Mr. Murugan would adopt on the issue of “honour killing”. “Having highlighted the controversy over grabbing of Panchami lands, will he continue his campaign in this regard as in many instances, members of intermediary castes appear to be enjoying possession of the lands?” he wondered.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/bjps-move-puts-spotlight-on-dalit-leaders/article31064705.ece
199,2020/03/14,"Foreign Direct Investment equity inflows register negative growth in Tamil Nadu, says RBI data","Disputing the figures, government officials say State will make up the deficit in fourth quarter

Tamil Nadu continues to register a negative growth rate in the foreign direct investment (FDI) equity inflow this financial year, if the data compiled by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and released by the Union government’s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade is any indication.

During 2018-19 too, the State had an adverse rate of 18.7%. The performance of the State comes as a contrast to efforts of the State government in wooing overseas investments.

In January 2019, the second edition of the Global Investors’ Meet was organised in Chennai when 304 Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) and 12,360 pacts concerning micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) were signed with investment commitments of around ₹3 lakh crore.

Months later, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami followed it up with a visit to the United Kingdom, the United States and Dubai, and in November, Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam went to the U.S.

However, senior officials of the State government do not agree with the data released by the Centre.

They contend that the RBI data does not accurately reflect the actual investments. The data pertained more to the location of corporate offices of companies than the receipt of actual investments.

For example, a firm’s head office may be located in the National Capital Region, which covers the entire National Capital Territory of Delhi and some districts of States such as Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, but the company may be investing in Sriperumbudur or Hosur, they say.

Analysing the trend of inflow in the current year’s three quarters, an official of the State Industries Department says that even though there is an overall drop of around 7%, the first quarter saw an increase of 24% over the same period of the previous year and the third quarter about 7% rise. It was the showing in the second quarter (drop of 43% ) that was responsible for the total negative growth rate.

“Though it is difficult to cite any specific reason, the decrease can be due to the base number of ₹ 6,127 crore (during the second quarter of 2018-19), which, in turn, happened to be an one-off investment,” explains the official, expressing the hope that in the fourth quarter of the year, the State will make up the deficit.

True picture

K.R. Shanmugam, Director of the Madras School of Economics, and R. Subash, investment banker, acknowledge that there is a discrepancy in the way the data is compiled. “You can get a true picture if the data on FDI in the manufacturing sector and FDI in services sector are culled out,” says Mr. Subash.

Yet, there are certain steps that the State government requires to take.

The investment banker says Karnataka has done extremely well in the area of start-ups.

“We have the potential to outperform Karnataka if we create a conducive environment by creating better infrastructure and putting in place hassle-free procedures,” Mr. Subash adds.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/s1c45r/article31064700.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14FDIcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/foreign-direct-investment-equity-inflows-register-negative-growth-in-tamil-nadu-says-rbi-data/article31064701.ece
200,2020/03/14,Neonatal care unit in Tirupattur GH completes a decade,"The facility, started in 2011, has helped to reduce the IMR in the district

A 32-day-old baby brought to the special neonatal care unit at Government Hospital, Tirupattur, with severe breathing problems, is recuperating after treatment and care provided by paramedical staff and paediatricians. This is not an isolated case of precise medical attention and care given by the hospital.

Three more babies are under the care of paediatricians working round-the-clock towards providing lifecare support to newborns.

On February 24, the Special Neonatal Care Unit (SNCU) celebrated its tenth anniversary with over 18,000 cases treated so far. Doctors working in paediatric emergency care said the exclusive neonatal care unit provided emergency medical care to newborns, thereby helping in reducing the postneonatal mortality and infant mortality rate (IMR).

With the unit’s establishment in 2011, the infant mortality rate which was reported at 36 per 1000 live births, has now come down considerably, said R. Senthilkumaran, Nodal Officer, SNCU, Tirupattur.

Neonatal ICU

The National Rural Health Mission Tamil Nadu (NRHM) chose this hospital as one of the centres to start Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), with an allocation of ₹20.5 lakh, he said.

The hospital handles cases referred from 36 public health centres in and around Tirupattur, in addition to patients from Krishnagiri, Singarapettai block and Uthangarai.

So far, the SNCU has treated 2,217 neonatal jaundice cases and 2,297 sepsis cases, apart from providing medical care for 572 cases of congenial anomaly. The SNCU has cared for 2,274 preterm babies and out of this 60 were reported as extreme preterm babies, which were successfully treated. Dr. Senthilkumaran said, “Ambulances with equipment to provide critical care to newborns has helped many reach the hospital in time from far off places.”

Paediatric Resuscitation and Emergency Medical (PREM) unit was set up at the Government Hospital, Tirupattur, after increased instances of neonatal cases. At present the neonatal care ward contains normal and non-invasive ventilators, pulse oxymeters and multi channel monitors, besides beds in the unit.

Among other initiatives, doctors and nurses were trained in resuscitating babies soon after birth and a separate building for Kangaroo Mother Care facility is coming up at the hospital. Equipment will be installed after the construction of the new building, said Chief Medical Officer, S. Dileepan.

“We have trained doctors and nurses to identify visible defects in newborns that could be life threatening. Congenital malformations are a good chunk and it is being handled in the neonatal period. The babies are referred for or surgical management,” he said.

204,2020/03/14,CJ to take a call on case against Velumani,"Plea to list case before same judge

Chief Justice of Madras High Court Amreshwar Pratap Sahi will now take a call on whether a case about allegation of corrupt practices against Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani should be heard by a Bench, led by Justice M. Sathyanarayanan who had dealt with the matter on earlier occasions or Justice M.M. Sundresh who holds the portfolio at present.

When the case was listed before Justices Sundresh and Krishnan Ramasamy on Friday, advocate V. Suresh, representing the litigant Jayaram Venkatesan of NGO Arappor Iyakkam, said he had given a letter to the Registrar (Judicial) on Thursday with a request that the hearing be continued before Justice Sathyanarayanan since he had heard the matter substantially.

Senior counsel C.S. Vaidyanathan, representing the Chennai Corporation, Advocate-General Vijay Narayan appearing for the State government, State Public Prosecutor A. Natarajan for Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption and senior counsel AR.L. Sundaresan, holding the brief for Mr. Velumani in his individual capacity, opposed the plea.

A-G’s stand

While the A-G told the court that he was not aware of any letter given to the Registry, Mr. Vaidyanathan said nothing survived in the present case to be heard by another Bench since a preliminary inquiry conducted by the DVAC did not find any truth in the charges and therefore the government had dropped all proceedings after accepting the DVAC report.

Mr. Sundaresan said the High Court rules clearly stated that all part heard matters would get released from the list of the judge concerned on change of roster and should be listed before the portfolio judge. The only exception to the rule was when lawyers on both sides make a joint representation for listing a matter before a particular judge to avoid arguing the case once again.

Since no such joint representation had been made in the present case, it should be heard by the portfolio Bench, he said. However, Justice Sundresh told the counsel that it would be appropriate to await the decision of the Chief Justice since the petitioner’s lawyer had already made a representation and The judge adjourned the case to April 7.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/lhe4uk/article31064617.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THVELUMANI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cj-to-take-a-call-on-case-against-velumani/article31064618.ece
205,2020/03/14,Anbumani welcomes govt. move to defer NPR,"In a statement, he said the State government must put pressure on the Centre to remove the questions in the NPR that had caused serious concern among Muslims.

PMK youth wing leader and Rajya Sabha member Anbumani Ramadoss welcomed the State government’s decision not to carry out the National Population Register exercise pending clarification from the Centre on certain questions. He hailed the Home Minister’s assurance that nobody would be marked as “doubtful citizens”.

In a statement, he said the State government must put pressure on the Centre to remove the questions in the NPR that had caused serious concern among Muslims.

Centre’s assurance

“The Congress leaders in the Rajya Sabha have accepted Home Minister Amit Shah’s assurance that Muslims will not be affected. He has reiterated that there is no need to answer every question in NPR and provide documents. This defeats the false propaganda by the DMK and other parties that Muslims will lose their citizenship,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/anbumani-welcomes-govt-move-to-defer-npr/article31064612.ece
206,2020/03/14,"Don’t spread fear over CAA and NPR, Palaniswami tells Opposition","House witnesses intense debate on the contentious issue of population registry

Accusing the Opposition parties of spreading fear among minorities and others over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Population Register (NPR), Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Friday called upon leaders of all political parties to extend cooperation so that Tamil Nadu remains a peaceful haven.

Mr. Palaniswami alleged in the Legislative Assembly that the Opposition was instigating the minorities not to extend cooperation for updating the NPR (since deferred), which he claimed led to “tension.”

Alleging that the Opposition had been claiming that the minorities would be deported to other countries, Mr. Palaniswami said this information struck fear in the minds of minorities.

‘Think emotionally’

“It leads to tension. There have been [certain] incidents in Delhi and there have been problems. We have to emotionally look at all these. All MLAs and leaders of all political parties should think over these emotionally,” Mr. Palaniswami said.

“Tamil Nadu has been a peaceful State. There are no differences on caste and communal lines in the State. Everyone should extend their cooperation in this regard,” Mr. Palaniswami said during a debate on NPR in the Legislative Assembly.

Minister draws flak

Earlier, DMK deputy floor leader Duraimurugan referred to a report in The Hindu on Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar’s statement that the work on updating the NPR had been put on hold in the State, pending clarification from the Centre.

The DMK leader wanted to know how the Minister could speak on the subject when there was a debate in the Assembly. It was against the tradition and rules of the House, he said.

Mr. Duraimurugan welcomed Mr. Udhayakumar’s statement and wanted the House to pass a resolution in the House in this regard.

Congress Legislature Party leader K.R. Ramasamy (Karaikudi) and Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) legislator K.A.M. Muhammed Abubacker called for a resolution in the House.

Mr. Udhayakumar said he only repeated what he had said in the House on NPR. His interaction with the media was necessitated by DMK president and Leader of the Opposition M.K. Stalin’s visit to sites where protests were being held against the CA, NPR and the National Register of Citizens, he added.

Stalin’s vists

The Minister said Mr. Stalin's visit to protest sites and his observations made there led to tension and the State government would not remain a silent spectator to these incidents. He pointed out that the Union Home Minister informed Parliament on Thursday that documents need not be submitted when details were collected for updating the NPR.

Mr. Stalin intervened to ask why the AIADMK government could not pass a resolution in the House when the Minister could speak on this subject outside the Assembly.

Mr. Palaniswami said it was the duty of the Minister to allay the fears of the minorities and hence there was no breach of privilege issue involved.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sz5q9f/article31064607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13MARTH--CMjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dont-spread-fear-over-caa-and-npr-palaniswami-tells-opposition/article31064608.ece
207,2020/03/14,‘Vaathi Raid’: Third single from Vijay’s ‘Master’ released,"The song is sung by Arivu and Anirudh Ravichander, and is a surprise to fans ahead of the audio launch

The third single from Vijay’s Master has been released, titled Vaathi Raid, a day before the audio launch of the film. The song is sung by Arivu and Anirudh Ravichander, and has lyrics by Arivu as well.

A surprise for fans with no previous announcement, Vaathi Raid did the rounds on social media, hailed as a reply from the makers of Vijay’s film to the IT department that conducted a raid recently in connection with the actor and questioned him, thereby halting the shooting of the film.

Kutti Story and Vaathi Coming were the two previous songs released from the album, that is composed by Anirudh Ravichander. The film is directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj of Kaithi fame, who shared the Vaathi Raid poster.

For the first time in recent memory, the audio launch of a Vijay film will be a closed ceremony in a private hotel, as a measure to combat the spread of the coronavirus. The actor’s earlier films such as Mersal and Bigil were held in the presence of large crowds.

A release date for the film is uncertain, with the industry beginning to be affected by the COVD 19 outbreak.

208,2020/03/14,Tom Holland says that ‘Spider-Man 3’ story will be ‘absolutely insane’,"Actor also confirms that Zendaya, who plays MJ in the franchise, will be part of the third installment

Actor Tom Holland has revealed that his upcoming Spider-Man movie has an “absolutely insane” story. The British actor said the team will start shooting for his third standalone movie as the web-slinger in July.

“I’m super happy about it. It’s absolutely insane. We will be shooting Spider-Man 3 in July in Atlanta. As for me showing up in other Marvel movies, I’m not sure as to what they want me to do,” Holland said in an interview with Inquirer.

The actor also revealed that Zendaya would be reprising the role of MJ in the upcoming sequel.

“In Spider-Man 3, Zendaya will most definitely be in the film. As to the relationship between Peter and MJ, I’m not too sure what it will be,” he said.

Holland, 23, made his debut as the comic superhero in Captain America: Civil War and went on to feature in Marvel Cinematic Universe movies: Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019).

His first standalone film, Spider-Man: Homecoming released in 2017, while 2019’s Spider-Man: Far From Home marked the culmination of MCU’s Infinity saga.

209,2020/03/14,‘Censor Board should not have people with political party leanings’: 'Gypsy’ filmmaker Raju Murugan,"The director is batting for a system that does not block freedom of speech, and instead chooses to counter with a well-informed argument

You could be excused for thinking Raju Murugan’s drive for making films stem from his ideology and interest in contemporary politics.

But the National Award-winning director of the film Joker insists that he remains committed to making films of all genres.

“There is a lot I want to say through cinema,” he says, as he sits down for an interaction few days after his recent movie Gypsy released to mixed reception among audience and critics, a view he disagrees with.

“I thought Gypsy reached the audience, justifying the expectations with which I made the film. It has elicited the emotions that it ought to have and I’m happy,” he adds. Excerpts from the interview:

The wandering nature of Gypsy’s story line did not seem to have worked across audience.

Every story has its own characteristic. [The character] Gypsy is a nomad, so the story also travels like that with him. It is not a story that happens in one place or discusses one subject. The film does speak of contemporary national politics.

There are so many sects, languages and religions, but it is the humanity in the average man that holds us and binds this democracy together. The travel part is essential to discuss these qualities.

There was criticism that a particular political line of thought was being force-fed.

Look, I’m someone who accepts all kind of feedback my films get wholeheartedly. I don’t speak out against criticism.

I don’t believe in preaching values through an art form. I believe whatever message we try to convey should be wrapped within the aesthetic of the art form. Maybe, the Communist principles and the general politics Gypsy discusses could have made people feel that way... but that should not be the case because this film is based on true events.

Can you elaborate?

You must know of the pictures of Ashok Parmar and Qutubuddin Ansari from the time of [2002] Gujarat riots. We have seen such images from conflict-ridden regions across the world.

A few years ago, I was wondering what happened to those two, and in my research I found out that the Kerala CPI(M) had facilitated a meeting between them. So, when I wanted to make a film on this incident, I wanted to retain the originality. That is why I placed comrades and shifted that part of the story to Kerala.

Raju Murugan | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

I did not force fit my thoughts into the screenplay; it was just an attempt to depict a true event to the best possible way on screen.

Prior to the film’s release, you had mentioned that you had to make 50 cuts to Gypsy due to CBFC objections. Does inordinate censoring curtail a filmmaker’s freedom of expression?

I thought there was no need for [the cuts]. A censor board should not be constituted by people affiliated to political parties. It should consist of society’s intellectuals, thinkers, artists, writers, human rights activists and educationists. Only then can it operate in a democratic setup.

Creators should be allowed their freedom. Charlie Chaplin made a film on Hitler when the latter was at the height of his powers. Even today, in the USA, there is space for films that criticise their Presidents.

An argument or opinion should be taken on by a counter opinion or argument, and not by blocking or changing it.

The politics over a woman’s agency is one of the strong points in Gypsy.

Women have always been used as a weapon either by an individual or a Government in times of war and conflict.

Raju Murugan with Jiiva (third from left) while shooting ‘Gypsy’ | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

The problem starts with viewing a woman as someone who holds our (the society’s) honour because that then gives cause for harming the honour. You see how even in cases of honour killing, the woman is the first target.

We have a duty to oppose and raise our voice against this. Women are not things; she is a soul, she is a human being. An education system, a political structure and a democracy that teaches this is what we need.

Another criticism was the use of a misrepresented community to discuss or expose the shortcomings of patriarchy.

I did not place it in a religion. In our society, all religions and families harbour such thoughts. I wanted to bring forth the male mentality. My female lead character gets an opportunity to realise the difference between her family and Gypsy through those scenes.

The film’s conclusion leaves space for several what ifs. For one, the scene’s composition did not feel organic.

Jiiva and Natasha Singh in ‘Gypsy’ | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

What I wanted to say in the end was that there is no division among people irrespective of the category or class they belong to. There is humanity and love in all of them and the divisions are being sowed by an administration, out of someone’s selfish desire. So, when the characters meet, there is a sense of forgiveness and humanity. I don’t see what is problematic there.

We are not suggesting the message was any less valid... just that the viewer may feel disinvested by that point.

That is your opinion and I respect and accept that. But you must understand that you and Gypsy are not the same.

You have a house, an office to go and work at; the people you and he meets are not the same, you don’t share the same kind of interactions. In the film, I try to convey that there is a relationship between Gypsy and someone he meets in a single montage because he meets so many people. In your life, it wouldn’t be a montage. It could be a scene or even the entire first half (smiles).

What’s next for Raju Murugan?

A script for my next film is ready, and an announcement will be made soon.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/j4a429/article31068197.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPRAJUMURUGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/censor-board-should-not-have-people-with-political-party-leanings/article31068203.ece
210,2020/03/14,Why is Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 movie ‘Contagion’ suddenly viral? It predicted the coronavirus,"The movie, which starred actors like Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt Damon, Jude Law and Kate Winslet, offered surprisingly well-researched insight into pandemic procedurals and worst-case scenarios

The 2011 sci-fi/ drama movie Contagion directed by Steven Soderbergh, is suddenly everywhere in the news.

People across the world are renting it, trying to stream it online and binge-watching it... nine years after its release. iTunes has listed it the fourth-most rented movie now, after the US declared a state of emergency. It is also the second most-watched movie in Warner Bros.’ catalogue in 2020.

But why? The events of the movie eerily, even prophetically, predict the outbreak of a deadly virus that causes a pandemic — and it is spread because a chef in Macao didn't wash his hands after handling infected pork meat, and then shakes hands with Gwyneth Paltrow's character!

Starring the likes of Paltrow, Matt Damon, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Marion Cotillard and Laurence Fishbourne, the film begins with Gwyneth Paltrow’s character returning to the USA after contracting a strange illness in Hong Kong. With a few days, she dies, leaving her husband, played by Matt Damon in shock, as the symptoms begin spreading, and becomes an official outbreak.

It is learnt that the virus originated is MEV-1, that spreads after “the wrong pig met up with the wrong bat,” in the words of one scientist in the film.

With the several theories on the spread of COVD-19 from the Wuhan food and animal market in China, it’s no wonder that the themes in the film resonate with people today, fighting to battle the spread of the coronavirus.

Contagion also offers a deep and surprisingly well-researched insight into pandemic procedurals and worst-case scenarios, with chilling images of empty airports, vacant cities and people quarantined in special wards or their homes itself: all of which can be identified with in the current climate.

While director Soderbergh has yet to comment on the sudden virality of his movie, Contagion writer Scott Z. Burns spoke out recently against the Donald Trump administration for not responding appropriately to the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S.

“It’s stunning to me that our administration can’t put out a clear message on how people can stay safe and what our tools are for understanding the current spread. There’s a video on YouTube of a song they did in Vietnam about hand-washing and how important it is. Why isn’t our government putting out public service messages about how to stay safe? That isn’t that hard,” he said.

The 2011 movie was a box office, grossingover $136 million worldwide at the time of release.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ifoa93/article31067987.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/contagion,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/why-is-steven-soderberghs-2011-movie-contagion-suddenly-viral-it-predicted-the-coronavirus/article31067989.ece
211,2020/03/14,COVID-19 scare dents RTC revenue,"In Karimnagar region, transport corporation sees 5% decline in earnings

The dreaded COVID-19 has cast its shadow on Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) operations in Karimnagar region with the number of commuters witnessing a steady decline.

Occupancy ratio in RTC buses have fallen considerably following an advisory to the people to avoid crowds as a precaution against spread of the disease. Bus stations wore a deserted look and RTC buses were being operated without adequate passengers in most routes in the district.

RTC-Karimnagar region comprises 10 depots with around 900 buses in the integrated district, catering to at least 6 lakh commuters and earning more than ₹1 crore per day.

Till March 5, the average daily earnings of RTC was around ₹1.23 crore. However, from March 6, income declined to ₹1.17 crore — a 5% reduction. Each depot was losing at least ₹50,000 to ₹1.5 lakh per day as very few commuters seem to be travelling by buses.

Holi blow

During Holi, it is usual for RTC to operate at least 50 additional buses to meet the rush, but this year, it could not operate any special services on March 9 and 10 as many refrained from celebrating the festival of colours over COVID-19 scare.

Following the identification of first COVID-19 case in Hyderabad on March 2, and instructions from the State medical department, the RTC had been according priority to thorough cleaning of buses by using all chemicals to sterilise the seats and hand bars.

Poster campaign

The RTC has also launched a poster and sticker campaign to educate people about prevention of COVID-19 and provided masks to RTC conductors.

Admitting that the RTC had incurred close to 5% losses, Karimnagar RTC regional manager Jeevan Prasad said the impact was more in respect of AC buses. “We are ensuring cent per cent sterilisation of buses to check the spread of disease,” he stated.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/llnetx/article31071022.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY14-KARIM-RTC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/covid-19-scare-dents-rtc-revenue/article31070988.ece
212,2020/03/14,‘BJP govt. has set aside public agenda for a Hindutva one’,"CLC leader seeks scrapping of CAA

Civil Liberties Council (CLC) State president Gaddam Laxman has accused the Centre of behaving irresponsibly by privatising essential services like water supply, healthcare, education, electricity, transport, communications and insurance.

Ignoring the welfare of people, the Union and State governments are selling themselves to imperial companies, he said adding that after assuming power at the Centre, the BJP set aside public agenda and brought forward a Hindutva agenda.

The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizenship (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) were part of that Hindutva agenda, he said while addressing the 15th anniversary meeting of the district CLC, here on Saturday.

He claimed the Sangh Pariwar was behind the Delhi riots and the transfer of Delhi High Court judge Muralidhar was testimony to the interference of the BJP-led government in the judiciary. He said that this trend was very dangerous for a democracy and independent judicial system.

Calling for public support to democratic judgments like that by Justice Muralidhar, he demanded immediate scrapping of CAA, NPR and NRC which were the root causes of the riots in Delhi. CLC district president M. Nageswar Rao presided over the meeting and State secretary Narayana Rao spoke.

213,2020/03/14,‘Include TS martyr’s story in school syllabus’,"Tributes paid to Anabheri Prabhakar Rao on his 72nd death anniversary

CPI State secretary Chada Venkat Reddy had urged Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to take measures for including the life history of Telangana Armed Struggle martyr Anabheri Prabhakar Rao in school syllabus.

Mr Venkat Reddy participated in the 72nd death anniversary of Prabhakar Rao by garlanding his statue in the market area in Karimnagar town on Saturday. Speaking on the occasion, he said Prabhakar Rao had sacrificed his life for the cause of liberation of Telangana from the clutches of Nizam rulers. He said the Nizam rulers had killed Anabheri and 10 others in an encounter on March 14, 1948.

Stating that Prabhakar Rao’s statue was installed in Karimnagar town in 1992, he criticised Minister for BC Welfare and Civil Supplies Gangula Kamalakar for removing the island where the statue was installed in the name of conduct of Sri Venkateshwara swamy temple brahmotsavams a few months ago.

Alleging that the Minister had planned to remove the statue from the town altogether, he said that the move was obstructed by CPI leaders. During the period, the Minister promised to reconstruct the island with new facilities, but it has remained unfulfilled. Demanding the government to reconstruct the island around the statue, he said that they would not allow relocation of the statue to any other part of the town.

214,2020/03/14,Telangana government bars all public gatherings till March 31,"The decision, aimed at checking spread of coronavirus, will be reviewed after the period, says Chief Minister

The Telangana government on Saturday night barred all public gatherings, including functioning of educational institutions, cinema halls, marriages, public meetings, clubs, celebrations, rallies, all kinds of sports activities and exhibitions, with immediate effect in view of the prevalence of coronavirus.

The closure will apply till March 31 when the government will review the situation and take a view, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao told press conference after the Cabinet meeting.

However, the examination schedule for SSC, Intermediate and all common entrance tests would be maintained undisturbed. But, other exams would be considered only after March 31. Only the exam writing students would remain at social welfare and other government hostels. They could avail hostel facilities but other students would have to go home.

There was no bar on supermarkets, malls and other commercial establishments.

This being the marriage season, Mr. Rao said marriages already scheduled till March 31 could be celebrated with a limited gathering not exceeding 200 persons. After March 31, no booking of marriage halls would be allowed. Strict instructions were given to police officials to ensure that these instructions were complied with.

The closure would also apply to seminars, workshops, trade fairs, cultural events, bars, pubs, indoor and outdoor sports stadia, swimming pools, gyms, zoo parks, amusement parks, coaching centres, summer camps and museums.

The bus and metro rail services would function as usual with continuous sanitation. The MBBS, nursing and dental students, except those in the final year and post-graduate students, would have holidays.

Mr. Rao said there would be no relaxation of any kind on activities barred and violations would be dealt with stringent action. Even postings on social media and airing of news in electronic media shall be as per announcements by the health department. False propaganda would be seen as a violation and action initiated.

As regards gatherings at temples, churches and mosques, Mr. Rao said they were not expected to be a problem because people would not remain there for a long time. Any how, the government would be in touch with religious heads. The celebrations of Ugadi and Sriramanavami would be considered later. The government would also reconsider the official Ugadi celebration of reading the almanac for the State at his camp office, he added.

These steps, he said, were part of a 15-day action plan decided by the Cabinet. The meeting finalised a task force comprising panchayat raj, municipal administration, forest and police personnel to take remedial steps. An amount of ₹ 500 crore was kept at the disposal of the Chief Secretary to meet any eventuality. A round-the-clock surveillance was maintained at the Hyderabad airport with 200 staff.

215,2020/03/14,"Reform Rythu Bandhu, says Congress MLA","Use the money for seeds, fertilisers and support price, says Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy

Congress MLA Komatireddy Rajgopal Reddy has suggested reforms in the Rythu Bandhu scheme as many rich farmers were also being extended benefits under it, and instead use that money to support the farmers by supplying seeds, fertilisers and extending support price.

Participating in the discussion on Demands for grants in the Assembly on Saturday, he said he himself has received ₹3 lakh under the scheme and it was unnecessary. Nearly 70% of the farming was done by the tenant farmers, he said adding that the rest were poor farmers who solely depend on agriculture.

Pointing out that many rich people were enjoying the benefits, he said such huge money to the tune of ₹12,000 crore should benefit the genuine and poor farmers and not those who just own the land.

He suggested that government should supply quality seeds and fertilisers to the farmers and the money should be utilised to extend minimum support price to the farm produce and those in distress.

Mr. Reddy also criticised the liquor policy and said the belt shops were ruining the lives and the rural economy. Excise revenue that was just ₹ 3,500 crore when Telangana was formed had now touched ₹ 18,000 crore and the target for next year was ₹ 20,000 crore.

Lives of youngsters are being ruined and his survey in a village had proved that 35 people in one village were spending their entire day drinking at the belt shops. On one hand the government gives pensions and takes back the same money promoting liquor sale, he alleged.

Mr. Reddy also demanded that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s remarks on Congress that it was more dangerous than coronavirus be expunged from the records. “How can the CM accuse the Congress that has given Telangana and even CM had admitted several times that without Sonia Gandhi Telangana would have remained just a dream,” he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/reform-rythu-bandhu-says-congress-mla/article31070477.ece
216,2020/03/14,Second COVID-19 case from TS detected,"Two more samples sent to NIV-Pune to confirm if they are positive

The second COVID-19 positive case from Telangana is a 24-year-old woman who returned from Italy on March 7. She is undergoing treatment in a special ward at Gandhi Hospital. Apart from her, samples of at least two more people from the State were sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune for tests.

The second positive case was detected a day after the index case from the State was discharged on Friday after recovering completely.

Officials said that the second COVID-19 case developed cold, cough, two days after returning to her home town and consulted doctors at a private hospital on March 9. Thereafter, she was treated at a Government Hospital. Considering her recent travel history and symptoms, the district health authorities counselled her and referred for admission at Gandhi Hospital.

Accompanied by her family members, she was taken in a government ambulance. Officials said that all the people in the ambulance wore Personal Protection Equipment (PPE). The woman was admitted in Gandhi Hospital on March 11 midnight.

Samples collected from her were confirmed positive by the NIV Pune on Saturday.

“The woman did not visit any place or attend any function after returning from Italy. She came in contact with three family members, including her parents. The family members will be admitted in Gandhi Hospital’s Isolation Ward and their condition will be monitored,” sources said.

217,2020/03/14,Pact inked to boost drone ecosystem,"Step aimed at addressing shortcomings in supply chain in healthcare sector

A memorandum of understanding between Marut Dronetech Private Limited, Asia Pacific Flight Training and the Telangana government was signed on Saturday in an effort to give drone ecosystem a boost.

In collaboration with the Telangana government, Apollo Hospitals and World Economic Forum, Marut plans to provide a solution to take on shortcomings in supply chain in the crucial healthcare sector. For instance, blood samples or medicines from primary health centres can be transported quickly and efficiently by means of drones. Or for that matter, organs too can be transported reducing crucial travel time significantly.

Marut, co-founded by three IIT Guwahati graduates Prem Kumar Vislawath, Suraj Peddi and Sai Kumar Chinthala, tested its drone at Wings India 2020 Global Aviation Summit.

12 km in 8 minutes

“We tested the drone for a distance of 12 km which we completed in eight minutes. Required approvals and exemptions from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and Ministry of Civil Aviation were taken to do this,” said Mr Vislawath.

The test entailed a payload weighing 3 kg.

The drone is powered by an app. The user can chose whether he or she wants to send a package, schedule a delivery and view incoming packages. Another screen on the app allows the user to choose whether he or she would like to send blood, vaccines, samples for medical diagnosis or organs.

20-kg payload

“While 3 kg payload was tested today, the drone can carry a payload of up to 20 kg and has the range to travel a distance of 40 km in about 20 minutes,” Mr Vislawath said.

Earlier in the day, a tripartite MoU was signed between MoCA Krishi Udaan Scheme by Ras Al Khaimah International Airport, GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd and Spicejet Limited.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/caao0x/article31071255.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY14-MEDICALDRONE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/mou-for-drone-ecosystem-signed/article31070247.ece
218,2020/03/14,Officials start disinfection of COVID-19 suspect neighbourhood,"Woman who returned from Italy reportedly tested positive for disease

As news of a 24-year-old woman of Aswapuram, who returned from Italy on March 7, testing positive for coronavirus at the quarantine ward in Gandhi Hospital in Secunderabad on Saturday broke out, the official machinery swung into action and initiated a drive to spray disinfectant in Aswapuram as a precautionary measure.

The woman who arrived in Aswapuram from Italy on March 7 developed fever, cold and cough a day later. She had reportedly undergone treatment at the Government Area Hospital in Bhadrachalam on March 10.

As her fever persisted, she was shifted to the Gandhi Hospital in Secunderabad on March 11 where she was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Saturday, sources added.

A team comprising officials of the Medical and Health, Panchayat Raj and other allied departments rushed to Aswapuram on Saturday evening.

As a precautionary measure, a special sanitation drive of spraying disinfectant was launched in the residential areas in the vicinity of the corona positive woman’s house in Aswapuram mandal headquarters town.

Meanwhile, in a statment Aam Aadmi Party Khammam district convenor N. Tirumala Rao urged the State government to shut all the liquor outlets across the State to avoid mass gatherings to prevent spread of coronavirus.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/officials-start-disinfection-of-covid-19-suspect-neighbourhood/article31070239.ece
219,2020/03/14,Rise in revenue not from higher volume of liquor sale: Minister,"Tax restructuring, arresting non-duty paid sales cited as reasons

Increase in revenue from the Excise Department was not due to increase in the volume of liquor sales or increase in the licensed liquor outlets but it was due to tax restructuring and checking non-duty paid sales and flow of liquor from neighbouring States, Minister for Excise V. Srinivas Goud told the Assembly on Saturday.

In his reply to the debate (voting) on demand for grants to the Excise Department, the Minister attributed the increase in the revenue from ₹10,238 crore in 2018-19 to ₹20,483 crore in 2019-20 to the improved efficiency of the department. He compared the revenue from liquor sales to that of revenue from sand before and after formation of Telangana stating that it had increased to over ₹2,000 crore now from mere ₹50 crore till 2014.

He explained that the number of liquor outlets was still lowest in Telangana (2,217) compared to neighbouring States — Andhra Pradesh (3,500), Karnataka (5,057) and Tamil Nadu (5,299). In terms of volumes, the sale of liquor had increased by 11% and that of beer by 9%. “Generally, the Excise Department is seen as revenue earner to the government, but it also implements several welfare schemes too,” the Minister noted.

Stating that there were about 5 lakh toddy tappers in the State, including nearly half of them in cooperatives, Mr. Srinivas Goud said number of toddy trees were chopped during combined AP rule to deny livelihood to the community depending on the activity. Discrimination against toddy tappers was so high that they were not given any ex-gratia payment even for fatal fall from trees, but the damage to coconut groves in cyclones was compensated heavily, he pointed out.

Neera cafes

The Minister stated that the government was planning to open ‘neera’ cafes in Tank Bund area in Hyderabad and also in other district headquarters to supply non-adulterated and fresh toddy stating that it was good to consume from the health point view too.

On the brewers of illicit distillation (liquor) in Dhoolpet area in Hyderabad, the Minister said the people there were of hard-working nature but they were not given an opportunity to transform by the successive governments by showing alternate livelihoods. The Telangana government, however, had rehabilitated many of them already and they had taken up other livelihood activities.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/rise-in-revenue-not-from-higher-volume-of-liquor-sale-minister/article31070019.ece
220,2020/03/14,Face-off between CM and Bhatti over coronavirus,"State government taking ample measures without creating panic, says CM

Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao lost his cool in the Assembly on Saturday over remarks of Congress floor leader Bhatti Vikramarka that the Centre was not taking all out measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus.

Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao said the Centre had already taken several measures, including cancelling of visas of foreign nationals from seven countries, but the Congress member made a mala fide remark. Of the130 crore population in the country, only 65 persons were affected by Coronavirus, including 17 foreign nationals, while two persons died and 10 persons were cured . One person was discharged from Gandhi Hospital in the city.

The Chief Minister said governments would take responsible action but not create panic. The State government earmarked 150 rooms in Dhulapally and Vikarabad to isolate air passengers coming from seven notified countries and stationed 200 health staff at the international airport for screening the international passengers.

Canadian Prime Minister’s wife also tested positive for Coronavirus but he announced it calmly four or five days later and quarantined himself too. The Central and State governments were taking ample measures without creating panic.

Preventive measures

Mr.Vikramarka pointed out that the coronavirus would not have spread rapidly had the developed and technologically advanced countries taken comprehensive preventive measures initially. Even in China, caution sounded by six doctors against coronavirus was suppressed in December and it became a pandemic now.

“We also should take serious measures like China which constructed 1,000 bed hospital in 10 days. Yesterday one coronavirus patient from Karnataka who came to Hyderabad for treatment died while going back to his home town. So public anxiety was mounting. But the government only activated one ring tone about coronavirus and left it at that,” he quipped.

Closure of malls

In other States, crowded places like malls, schools, gyms, were closed and Telangana also should adopt similar measures. He even took a dig at the Chief Minister for his statement in the Assembly the other day that one paracetamol tablet was enough to control the fever and virus would not survive in the temperatures around 27 or 28 degrees. Mr. Bhatti said, however, a doctor disagreed with it as the virus infected even when the body temperature was 35 or 36 degrees.

Reacting sharply to it, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao said he was on record when he quoted a scientist and some persons were creating unnecessary controversy and quipped that the “dangerous coronovirus that affected the country was Congress”. He urged people to observe personal hygiene as per government guidelines and assured that the government would do its duty in implementing preventive measures.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bhr5lc/article31069864.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY15KCHANDRASEKHARRAO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/face-off-between-cm-and-bhatti-over-coronavirus/article31069865.ece
221,2020/03/14,Cut in eligibility age to benefit 6.6 lakh new Aasara pensioners,"Disbursement to begin from new financial year

As many as 6.62 lakh more beneficiaries would get pension with the reduction in eligibility age for old age pensions to 57 years, taking the total number of beneficiaries to 38.72 lakh.

Panchayat Raj and Rural Development Minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao responding to several members in the Legislative Assembly here on Saturday said all those who attain the age of 57 years will get the pensions from the new financial year.

The government made a budgetary allocation of ₹11,758 crore for 2020-21, including ₹2,355 crore for the additional numbers becoming eligible. He also said that district-wise camps would be set up to identify the physically challenged for the pensions to those with disability. Some members pointed out that if an old man has four sons and one son held an outsourced job, the old man was not being given pension and urged that such persons be sanctioned pension. Others requested for pension to patients undergoing dialysis. The beedi workers should be sanctioned pension without reference to PF cut-off date.

He said that after pensions were doubled to ₹2,016, old people were happy as their family members were giving them due respect and ₹879 crore were being disbursed every month towards Aasara pensions to various categories.

Check Dams

Finance Minister T.Harish Rao said that after formation of Telangana 146 check dams were sanctioned and 53 were completed and remaining were in progress. These would irrigate an ayacut of 56,776 acres. Government with an estimate of ₹3,825 crore, gave administrative sanction to 1,200 check dams from fourth order to eighth order over the major and medium irrigation project ayacut flows.

Of the 1,200 proposed check dams, 600 would be constructed in this year and another 600 in the next financial year.

About 3,000 OTs (off take sluices) in major medium irrigation canals were taken up with ₹471 crore and 70% of work was completed. The check dams were planned to conserve every rain drop. The check dams would help in impounding water throughout the year. They have 15 tmc water storage and would irrigate about 3 lakh acres.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/cut-in-eligibility-age-to-benefit-66-lakh-new-aasara-pensioners/article31069801.ece

223,2020/03/14,Indian civil aviation sector will overcome coronavirus challenge: Union Minister,"It is set to become the third largest civil aviation market in the world, says Hardeep Singh Puri

Union Minister for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri on Saturday said that Centre had started working on the coronavirus issue from January 17, before it was declared a ‘serious global emergency’, and that nearly 12 lakh passengers have been screened till date.

Mr. Puri was speaking at the Wings India 2020 Global Aviation Summit where he sought to address the coronavirus which he described as the ‘elephant in the room’.

“Since we started this, we have screened 10,876 flights coming from outside, which means many of them are wide-bodies planes. So you can gather what kind of task this is. We have screened 11,71,061 passengers, nearly 12 lakh. And this figure goes up as we speak — 3,225 of these 12 lakh passengers required further screening,” Mr. Puri said.

The Union Minister said that when faced which such challenges, there is a tendency to call for a stop to all activities. This, he said, is an inadvertent contribution to the creation of ‘heightened uncertainty’ or ‘panic’. He said that in case people test positive for coronavirus, they have resilient immune system and can overcome and the government is taking on precautionary measures such as disinfecting aircraft and other places. The two unfortunate fatalities have been of elderly people, he added.

‘Passing phase’

Touching upon how the coronavirus scare could affect the air-traffic, Mr. Puri said: “Yes, there maybe a 15%-20% drop in domestic traffic for the time being. But, I believe that also is a passing phase. I am absolutely sure that once people get the correct perspective, know where we are vulnerable and take precautions against that, look at the numbers who are recovering and the number is pretty impressive.”

He expressed confidence that the civil aviation sector in India would overcome the coronavirus challenge and continue to grow. “I agree with what other speakers said. We are not only the world’s third largest domestic civil aviation market, but we are going well towards becoming the world’s third largest civil aviation market,” he said adding India would reach one billion passenger mark before 2030.

Work together

He said that operators, private sector and the government can work together, ‘seize the opportunity’ and demonstrate to the word that the challenge can be overcome.

Touching upon bringing aviation turbine fuel into the ambit of the GST, Mr. Puri hoped that this change would come sooner than later. “I say this with a sense of responsibility. I’ve written many letters. I have appealed to the chief ministers of State governments, I have written to the Finance Minister and I think, by and large, that there is acknowledgment that this should be done, and it will be done,” he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/9vvu0c/article31069751.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY15WINGSINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/indian-civil-aviation-sector-will-overcome-coronavirus-challenge-union-minister/article31069753.ece

228,2020/03/14,LIC asked to pay premium to all ‘duped’ investors,"Sitharaman instructs LIC to help the poor policy-holders cheated by NGO

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has instructed the LIC chairman to help poor policy-holders of micro insurance companies such as LIC Jeevan Madhur and Jeevan Mangal, who were cheated by an NGO by “not repaying the premium amount to LIC” in Karimnagar district.

The Karimnagar Consumers’ Council had written a letter to the Union Finance Minister recently, seeking her intervention to help the poor villagers who got enrolled under the micro insurance policies.

Accordingly, the Union Ministry under secretary Umesh Chandra had written a letter to the LIC chairman for payment of a premium amount to the policy-holders as per the directions of the Karimnagar Consumers Forum.

In the letter, Karimnagar Consumers’ Council leader N. Srinivas had stated that the LIC had appointed an NGO, Good Hearts Association, for collection of premium of micro insurance policies from villagers. But, the NGO had paid only 60% of the premium amount of various policies to the LIC and swindled the remaining 40%, denying insurance coverage to the policy-holders.

The consumers’ council had been fighting for justice for the over 10,000 poor policy-holders in the district since 2015 and filed four cases in the Karimnagar Consumer Forum on behalf of 300 people.

The district forum had instructed LIC to return the premium amount along with interest to the policy-holders. When LIC approached the State commission in Hyderabad, it had also instructed the former to comply with the Karimnagar forum’s directive.

However, LIC had paid premium amount to only 300 people and neglected the other policy-holders, he said.

The Karimnagar Consumers’ Council had urged LIC and the Union government to see that all the policy-holders, allegedly cheated by the NGO, get the premium amount along with the interest rate.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/lic-asked-to-pay-premium-to-all-duped-investors/article31064207.ece
229,2020/03/14,Committed to timely release of funds to GPs: CM,"If required will cut salaries of MLAs, Chief Minister tells Assembly

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has said that the State government is committed to ensure timely release of funds for gram panchayats for their all-round development by cutting down other expenditure like the salaries of MLAs, if need be.

“There will be no fund constraint for gram panchayats. The government is committed to timely release of funds, if need be by pruning other expenditure like salaries of MLAs,” the Chief Minister said. The Chief Minister said the Central government had accepted the interim report of the 15th Finance Commission allocating funds for one year and the State would accordingly get ₹ 1,847 crore on this account.

The State government on its part has provided an equal amount as matching grant and in the process, became the only State to do so. He was replying to the debate on Palle Pragathi which came up as short discussion in the Legislative Assembly on Friday.

Tax collection

Asserting that the government was committed to transform villages into self-sustaining institutions, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao said the government had taken steps to fill all the vacant posts in the Panchayat Raj department at different levels and the post of Additional Collector (Local Bodies) had been created exclusively to focus on their affairs. There was need to ensure 100% tax collection from the local bodies for their sustenance. “Total tax collection is a must or else, the respective sarpanch and the village secretary will stand to lose their jobs,” he said.

He said the government was committed to ensure that each gram panchayat, including the minor panchayats, would get at least ₹ 5 lakh every year and this was in addition to the income generated by them. “The government is committed to release funds to even minor gram panchayats with less than 500 population and orders to this effect will be release this evening itself,” he said. There were 899 panchayats with 500 or less population in the State and the government’s focus was in these habitations that were in remote and far flung areas.

PDS shops

Accordingly, efforts were underway to set up ration shops in these interior hamlets to ensure supply of essentials to their residents. The Civil Supplies Department had been asked to change the rules so that PDS outlets could be set up in these areas.

Responding to CLP leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka’s concern that the government’s decision to provide tractors, trolleys and water tankers to each village was proving to be a burden on the income of the small panchayats, he said the purchase would involve one time expenditure to these panchayats, but the government would ensure that they did not suffer on account of this. He also wanted the officials concerned to take steps to ensure that gram panchayats were not made to pay the salaries of staff from their funds.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/jda20n/article31064024.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY14KCR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/committed-to-timely-release-of-funds-to-gps-cm/article31064025.ece

Praising Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao for making Telangana number one in the country on spending on welfare of minorities, MIM floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi, however, demanded that now he concentrate on cleaning up the Waqf Board that had become a ‘centre of corruption’.

Speaking on demands in the Assembly on Friday, he demanded an inquiry by the CBI or CID or by a sitting judge of the High Court into the functioning of the Waqf Board, which he alleged, was blind to the occupation of precious Waqf lands. He wanted that a special meeting of Collectors be called to discuss Waqf lands in the respective districts.

Moreover, some employees have been promoted as Assistant Directors drawing hefty salaries though their qualifications were just school or Intermediate passed. “Why is the government blind to these activities?” he asked.

Mr. Owaisi also wanted the government to claim the buildings constructed by the then Nizam in Mecca and Madina as they were constructed with people’s money. Thanking the Chief Minister for the welfare schemes for minorities, he wanted a Muslim Research Centre to oversee the implementation of those schemes.

He suggested that the government do away with Iftar dinners and instead donate that money to orphanages where they need food the most. Similarly, government should give ₹ 2 lakh to every minority student admitted in IITs, IIITs, NITs and other national institutes as is being done in Karnataka and Rajasthan.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/7g2tf6/article31063988.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY14AKBAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/akbaruddin-owaisi-demands-cbi-inquiry-into-waqf-board-functioning/article31063989.ece

233,2020/03/14,Two CAF jawans killed in naxal attack in Chhattisgarh,"They were providing security for road construction work

Two Chhattisgarh Armed Force (CAF) personnel were killed in a naxal ambush in the jungles of Chhattisgarh’s Bastar district on Saturday, the police said.

A CRPF jawan was also injured in a blast triggered by naxals in a separate incident in the same area, they said.

A team of the CAF — which is a part of the State police force — was out patrolling to provide security for road construction work under the Mardoom police station area, said Inspector General of Police (IG) Sundarraj P. Around 3.30 p.m., when the team was between Bodli and Malewahi villages, it came under attack, he said.

“Two CAF head constables were killed,” the IG said.

In the same area, a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawan sustained minor injuries in an IED blast carried out by naxals, he said. The jawan is being treated at a local hospital.

Four surrender

Four naxals, three of them collectively with rewards of ₹15 lakh on their heads, surrendered in the Bastar division of Chhattisgarh on Friday, police said.

While three hardcore ultras, including a couple, surrendered before senior police and CRPF officials in Sukma district, a woman quit the banned outfit in Bastar district, a senior police official here said.

One of the men, Kartami Vaga alias Badal, was active as deputy commander of Maoists’ platoon number 26 and carried a price of ₹8 lakh on his head. Badal was allegedly involved in several attacks, including in the Burkapal ambush, where 25 CRPF personnel were killed in 2017, the police said. His wife Madkam Kamli, who had a price of ₹5 lakh on her head, surrendered too.

Sukhmati alias Jyothi, the woman who surrendered in Bastar district, had been active in the Barsoor area, police said.

The woman cadre, identified as Sukhmati alias Jyoti (22), who surrendered before police in Jagdalpur, the headquarter of Bastar district, had been active in Barsoor Area Committee of Maoists since the last 10 years, he said.

“The surrendered Naxals said they were disappointed with the hollow Maoist ideology and their anti-people activities.

At the same time, they also expressed that they were impressed bysurrenderand rehabilitation policy of the state government,” he added.

Acash of Rs 10,000 were also given to Jyoti as an encouragement money and they all will be provided assistance as per thesurrenderand rehabilitation policy, he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/two-caf-jawans-killed-in-naxal-attack-in-chhattisgarh/article31070643.ece

236,2020/03/14,Rajasthan anti-CAA protesters seek clarification from Cong. on NPR,"Gehlot govt. must stop its process scheduled to begin next month, they say

Civil rights groups spearheading an agitation in Rajasthan against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on Saturday demanded that the Congress government clarify its position on the National Population Register (NPR) and stop its process scheduled to begin next month. The indefinite sit-in at the Shaheed Smarak here, inspired by Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh protest, has entered the 44th day.

The protests have also been replicated in several towns across the State. Held under the banner of the Samvidhan Evum Loktantra Bachao Abhiyan, the protest in Jaipur has witnessed the participation of women from the Walled City neighbourhoods and drawn the attention of passers-by with the rendition of poems, songs and slogans on different themes.

Also read: NPR data useful for welfare schemes, says Union Home Ministry

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot put in a surprise appearance at the protest on February 14 and questioned why the information on the birthplaces of parents was being sought for NPR. “I am not aware of my parents’ birthplace. If I am asked to furnish these details, I might be the first person to go to a detention centre,” he said.

Abhiyan’s convener Sawai Singh said at a press conference here since it was widely believed that the NPR would be the first step towards the preparation of the National Register of Citizens, the State government should step in to stop the clubbing of the NPR with the Census. “The people in Rajasthan will boycott the NPR survey unless the the Congress spells out its stand,” he said.

Association for Protection of Civil Rights president Paker Farooq said Home Minister Amit Shah had misled the country by stating in Parliament that no document would be required from people in the NPR survey and no entry of doubtful citizenship would be made. “The Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, contains these provisions, which will be misused in the NPR exercise,” he said.

The Abhiyan members urged the State government to issue an order, along with its notification in the Gazette, that the exercise for preparing the NPR in its present form would not be started. “The Congress government should also inform the Centre that it will not cooperate in the process for updating the NPR,” Mohammed Nazimuddin, State president of Jamat-e-Islami Hind, said.

The State government was considering a move to challenge the CAA in the Supreme Court and a petition is likely to be filed on Monday. The Left Democratic Front government of Kerala had earlier challenged the CAA in the Supreme Court under Article 131 of the Constitution.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ho4zgb/article31070306.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15TH-SMARAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rajasthan-anti-caa-protesters-seek-clarification-from-cong-on-npr/article31070307.ece

238,2020/03/14,Congress moves Gujarat MLAs to Rajasthan ahead of Rajya Sabha polls,"More than a dozen legislators were flown to Jaipur on Saturday evening while another batch will be taken to Udaipur by road on Sunday

Fearing poaching of its legislators by the BJP ahead of Rajya Sabha polls in Gujarat, the Congress party on Saturday decided to move its MLAs to party-ruled Rajasthan.

More than a dozen legislators were flown to Jaipur on Saturday evening while another batch will be taken to Udaipur by road on Sunday.

“We are shifting our members to Rajasthan because the BJP with use of money power and government agencies is trying poach them,” said senior Congress legislator Harshad Ribadia.

According to party sources, more than 50 legislators will be kept in two different batches in Jaipur and Udaipur while around 15-20 MLAs will remain in the State to attend Assembly proceedings since Budget session is underway.

“We all are united against BJP, which is desperate to break the opposition party’s strength with money. Several BJP leaders tried to approach our members offering huge money and ministerial positions,” said Gandhinagar North MLA C.J. Chavda. He added that the Congress members will not fall for BJP’s offers.

There are five candidates in the fray for four Rajya Sabha seats in the State, with the the BJP, fielding three candidates despite being short of numbers.

“The fact that the ruling party has fielded a third candidate despite not having required numbers makes it amply clear that the BJP is up for something unethical and undemocratic and we have to guard our members against the BJP’s onslaught,” a senior Congress leader said.

The opposition party has fielded two of its senior leaders Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki for two seats of Rajya Sabha while BJP has fielded three candidates. BJP’s third candidate is Narhari Amin, a former Congress leader who had defected to the saffron party in 2012 when he was denied a ticket by Congress.

239,2020/03/14,Bengal’s pride: Mamata’s war cry seeks to rebuild her old image,"Hoardings mushroom in Kolkata telling voters to choose between her and the unknown

In West Bengal, if the sun suddenly decides to shine on a chilly morning or clouds gather on a scorching day, it won’t sound odd if such pleasant changes are attributed to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.

Ms. Banerjee has been in power for nearly a decade now and people’s eyes, by now, are long used to hoardings and posters that credit her with every celebration or celebration-worth event that takes place in the State. From handicrafts fairs to food festivals to business summits — almost everything happens with the ‘anuprerana’, or inspiration, of the Chief Minister.

Ms. Banerjee, a street fighter who has risen through the ranks, may not have the persona of Jayalalithaa, but just like Jayalalithaa when she was in power, she is present nearly everywhere: outside airports and railway stations and on bus stands and roads and flyovers. People, not even for a moment, are allowed to forget who’s in charge.

Also read|I am your ‘pehredar’, will not let anyone snatch people’s rights: Mamata Banerjee

In such a scenario, when her presence already occupies a lot of public space and mindscape, fresh billboards have now sprung up all over Kolkata, hailing Ms. Banerjee as Banglar gorbo — Bengal’s pride. The golden billboards are minimalist. They bear no distracting slogans or images: only the face of Ms. Banerjee and the words ‘Banglar gorbo.’ The logo of her party, the Trinamool Congress, is in one corner, trying to make itself as inconspicuous as possible. These hoardings are the war cry — the beginning of a fierce campaign that’s going to unfold over the next 12 months.

The overnight mushrooming of the hoardings comes at a time when the country is in the grip of the fear of COVID-19 and Ms. Banerjee herself has ordered the shutting down of all educational institutions till March 31.

“They [the hoardings] have Prashant Kishor written all over them,” a top bureaucrat told The Hindu, referring to the election strategist who had earlier devised the Didi Ke Bolo (Tell Didi) campaign which never quite took off.

“I think they are trying to capitalise on the fact that the BJP, in spite of its popularity, does not have a popular face in West Bengal. That is why they are again projecting Mamata as their face — this time as the pride of Bengal,” the bureaucrat said on condition of anonymity.

Even well-known political analyst Biswanath Chakraborty is of the opinion that the strategy is to tell voters to choose between her and the unknown. “Projecting her as a face creates a huge gap between the ruling party [Trinamool] and the Opposition,” he said.

Mr. Chakraborty, in fact, sees the hoardings as an attempt to reconstruct the old image of Ms. Banerjee. She first stormed to power in 2011, defeating the Left Front that had been in power for far too long and had seen a decline in its popularity for reasons that included forced acquisition of land in the village of Singur for building a car factory.

But ever since then, a lot of water has flowed under the Howrah Bridge. Her party machinery, over the years, has been afflicted with serious allegations of misrule, corruption and undemocratic practices. “Therefore she wants to rebuild her old image,” said Mr. Chakraborty.

The BJP, in spite of its unexpected and impressive performance in West Bengal in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, still does not have a charismatic and credible face locally. It is led in the State by Dilip Ghosh, who is in the news more often for making controversial statements, such as cow’s milk containing gold.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/4uoqpm/article31069766.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14TH-THGRP-MAATA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bengals-pride-mamatas-war-cry-seeks-to-rebuild-her-old-image/article31069767.ece

Senior Congress leader and leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad on Saturday met National Conference (NC) president and MP Dr. Farooq Abdullah — who was released on Friday — in Srinagar and pitched for release of detained mainstream leaders, while avoiding any comments on Article 370 and 35A.

“Development in J&K, which has come to a halt, cannot be carried out by putting the leaders under detention. A political process is to be initiated and can only proceed only after the [mainstream] leaders are released. Firstly, democracy should be restored here,” said Mr. Azad.

He demanded release of NC vice-president Omar Abdullah and Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti, both former Chief Ministers, and others held in different detention centres in J&K.

Mr. Azad is the first national leader to meet Dr. Abdullah, who was released after over seven months of detention, at his residence in Gupkar Road here. Conspicuously, Mr. Abdullah chose not to issue any statement as Mr. Azad briefed the media after the meeting.

“It was the happiest moment to meet Dr. Abdullah after seven months. He is a friend. Besides, I met him on behalf of those who raised voice against his detention since August last year, in Parliament and at other platforms,” Mr. Azad said.

“Such punishment is given to criminals, to people who work against the nation, but what has he and the other political leaders in detention done?”

Avoiding to make any comment on the August 5 episode, Article 370, 35A or reunification of pre-August State of J&K, the Congress leader suggested that there should be immediate restoration of Statehood to J&K from the Union Territory status.

“J&K was the only State, which was never merged with any other State as it was a big State as compared to others. Downgrading it into a UT was insult to its people,” Mr. Azad said.

An NC spokesman said the meeting took place in an affable atmosphere and “both the leaders discussed a range of issues”.

In an oblique reference to Mr. Azad’s statement, Ms. Mufti, whose Twitter handle is run by her daughter Iltija Mufti, tweeted: “Article 370 abrogation is unconstitutional and illegal. It’s the elephant in the room that most don’t want to acknowledge. Downgrading J&K into a UT was done to shift goal posts. Seasons might have changed since August but the tinge of betrayal remains.”

248,2020/03/14,Valley mosques dedicate Friday sermons to COVID-19 crisis,"This comes as the attendance in the Valley mosques showed no decline despite the advisory issued by the Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC)

Hundreds of Valley mosques on Friday decided to use the pulpit for an unusual noble cause, to educate worshippers about the measures to fight novel Coronavirus.

This comes as the attendance in the Valley mosques showed no decline despite the advisory issued by the Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC) to stay away from large religious congregations.

""Hygiene, the Prophet said, is an essential part of our faith. Time demands that people ensure that everyone practises proper hygiene to collectively fight the menace of Coronavirus. We need to follow the rule of isolating those contracted with the disease. Even during the past Islamic period, the prophet advised people against moving from places where any pandemic has spread to contain it,"" said Moulvi Niyaz Ahmad in a local mosque in Srinagar's Hawal area.

Unusually, reports pouring from major towns in north and south Kashmir suggested that the Friday sermon was focussed on causes and measures to fight COVID-19.

""Mosques have played important role in educating masses for centuries. Many of Ulemas did discuss beforehand about the thrust of sermons,"" said Moulvi Ahmad Shah Banday.

Dr. Muhammad Salim Khan, head of the community medicine, Government Medical College, said he made an appeal to all caretakers of the mosques ""to restrict Friday sermon and prayer period to minimum time"".

The Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC) carried out sterilization exercises around mosques before and after Friday congregation prayers in a bid to contain any spread of the virus.

SMC mayor Junaid Azim Mattu had asked people to stay away from large Friday gatherings. ""I’m of the firm opinion that congregational Friday prayers should be avoided and disallowed. I request people to avoid congregational prayers,"" said Mr. Mattu.

However, his comments have come under attack from preachers. ""This is nothing but interference in religious affairs and peoples' faith. The job of a mayor is keep the city clean and not regulate worshippers in mosques,"" said a senior clerk at a mosque near the Mirza Kamil Shrine.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/valley-mosques-dedicate-friday-sermons-to-covid-19-crisis/article31065105.ece
249,2020/03/14,M.P. MLAs call off Bhopal trip,"High drama at Bengaluru airport as plans change at the last minute

There was high drama on Friday as 13 rebel Congress MLAs from Madhya Pradesh reached the Kempegowda International Airport here to fly to Bhopal but cancelled the trip at the last minute and returned to the resort on the outskirts of the city where they had been staying in the past few days.

Madhya Pradesh Assembly Speaker N.P. Prajapati had served notices on the MLAs on Thursday to appear before him immediately. Two chartered flights were scheduled to take them to Bhopal. Copies of the flight manifest available with The Hindu showed that they were to be accompanied by Ramakant Bhargava, Vidisha MP, Arvind Singh Bhadoria, MLA and BJP State vice-president, and former Minister Umashankar Gupta.

The MLAs reached the airport and went past the security check as well. However, the flights did not take off. While the MLAs claimed the aircraft were yet to get clearance from the Air Traffic Control, there was a change of plan at the last minute and BJP strategists decided not to take them to Bhopal, multiple sources said.

After waiting at the airport for over four hours, the MLAs were herded back in two buses to the resort at night.

Earlier in the day, a Congress delegation led by Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee chief D.K. Shivakumar and two Madhya Pradesh Ministers Jitu Patwari and Lakhan Singh Yadav met Additional Director-General of Police (Law and Order) Amar Kumar Pandey.

Father’s claim

Narayan Chowdhary, father of Madhya Pradesh MLA Manoj Chowdhary, submitted a letter to police officials alleging that his son was forcibly brought to Bengaluru and kept in a resort.

Recounting the drama at the resort on Thursday when he visited there, Mr. Narayan Chowdhary said, “Though my son wanted to meet us, he was not allowed by some local people, said to be BJP members, who threatened us.” The letter requests the police to provide him security to meet his son.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/uafzf0/article31062983.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14TH-KPCC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mp-mlas-call-off-bhopal-trip/article31062984.ece
250,2020/03/14,"After release, all eyes are on Farooq Abdullah’s next move","With all political groups holding their cards close to the chest, all eyes will be on Dr. Abdullah's moves now, after the seven month haitus.

The release of five-time J&K chief minister and National Conference (NC) president Dr. Farooq Abdullah on Friday will stir the stagnant political waters in J&K, with both New Delhi and the regional parties waiting in wariness about his next political move.

For the Centre, the difficult decision to release him will ease the international pressure, especially from the U.S., to release the democratically elected leadership of J&K held post August 5. Slapping the controversial and stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) for the third time on Dr. Abdullah would not have augured well within the political opposition of the country too.

Notwithstanding senior BJP leader and Union Minister Jitendra Singh's frequent public remarks on prolonging the detention of Kashmir-based leadership, especially Dr. Abdullah, the timing of the release starkly reflects the pressure on the Centre.

The political ecosystem of J&K in fact has been in a suspended mode since August 5, when the entire political class, from the regional leaders to separatist Hurriyat, Jamaat-e-Islami and JKLF, were rendered irrelevant by the unprecedented clampdown.

With all political groups holding their cards close to the chest, all eyes will be on Dr. Abdullah's moves now, after the seven month haitus.

“It will be interesting to watch his next steps. Will he raise the issue of Article 370 or will he be quiet about it? Remember Dr. Abdullah was the political leader who put forth the theory that to survive in politics, it is important to be on the right side of the Central government, irrespective of the fact as to who is there in power in the Centre. This Farooq doctrine was recently reiterated by the Altaf Bukhari, who floated the Apni Party,” said Prof. Rekha Chowdhary, former head of department, Political Science at Jammu University.

However, Dr Chodhary warned against taking Dr. Abdullah lightly. “The strength of Dr. Abdullah is the cadre of NC, which remained intact in some form, despite the prevalence of militancy and separatism,” she added.

Also read: 389 people in detention in J&K under Public Safety Act: Centre

His release is likely to dent the prospects of Mr. Bukhari's Apni Party, which has many ideology-less individuals joining hands for pure power politics. In fact, they needed time to have grip on the ground and float new narratives, which was only possible in absence of the traditional political leadership.

“With the Apni Party being floated on the one hand and the Farooq Abdullah being released on the other, it will be important to watch the developments. Apni Party has individuals with pro-Centre inclinations, but the NC has the cadre. But does NC have the pro-Centre inclinations?” asked Dr. Chowdhary.

For now, Dr. Abdullah has made his politics clear. His stress that he will not comment on political matters till all leaders are released only pointed at the Gupkar Declaration, which opposed any dilution of J&K’s special status.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fjzxpq/article31062875.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THFAROOQABDULLA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/after-release-all-eyes-are-on-farooq-abdullahs-next-move/article31062876.ece
251,2020/03/14,U.P. cabinet clears ordinance for recovery of damages to property during protests,"U.P. Finance Minister Suresh Khanna announced the decision of the State Cabinet

The Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government on Friday gave its approval to an ordinance for the recovery of compensation for public and private property damaged during protests.

U.P. Finance Minister Suresh Khanna announced the decision of the State Cabinet, which gave its consent to the U.P. Recovery of Damage to Public and Private Property Ordinance, 2020.

The government’s decision came a day after the Supreme Court refused to stay a Allahabad High Court ruling ordering the Lucknow administration to “forthwith” remove hoardings displaying the personal details of persons accused of vandalism and arson during the protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. During the hearing by the apex court’s vacation bench, one of the judges had orally remarked that the U.P. government’s action was not “covered in law”.

The U.P. government had issued recovery notices to at least 500 persons in the State for damage to property during the protests in December.

Mr. Khanna said the ordinance would arrange for the recovery of damages to public and private property during any protest, movement or demonstration.

Without giving any further details, Mr. Khanna said the specifics would be known when the “niyamawali” or manual of rules was released.

Sidharth Nath Singh, U.P. government spokesperson, said the State had brought the ordinance in compliance with the Supreme Court’s observations.

“We are honouring the court. The court said there must be an act on this,” he said, adding that earlier recovery of damages was covered under a government order but now it would be under a law.

Mr. Khanna said the ordinance was based on a 2007 order by the apex court in criminal writ petitions 73 and 77 that a “strong law” was needed to deal with the damage to public and private property during political protests and demonstrations.

The State government’s decision comes at a time when it has in a controversial move put up several hoardings in Lucknow identifying those accused of violence during the protests against the CAA in December last. The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused are listed in the hoardings.

Terming it an “unwarranted interference in privacy” of people and a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution, the Allahabad High Court had on Monday directed the Lucknow administration to forthwith remove the controversial ‘name and shame’ roadside hoardings. However, the State approached the apex court through a special leave petition against the decision, following which the court referred the appeal to a larger bench.

Those named in the hoardings have been asked to pay for the damage to public and private property within a stipulated time or have their properties seized by the district administration. The total damage listed in the hoardings amounts to ₹1.55 crore. As many as 57 persons have been identified in the hoardings.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/up-cabinet-clears-ordinance-for-recovery-of-damages-to-property-during-protests/article31065081.ece

253,2020/03/14,Pehlu Khan case: minor convicts sent to special home,"Another juvenile aged over 16 at the time is facing trial in a court in Alwar

Two minors convicted of participating in the murder of dairy farmer Pehlu Khan as members of a mob of cow vigilantes in 2017 were on Friday sent by Alwar’s Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) to a special home for three years. Six persons accused of having led the attack were acquitted by a sessions court in August last year.

The convicts, who were minors when they committed the crime, are in the age group of 18-21 now. They are likely to be shifted to a special home on the Central Jail premises in Jaipur.

Video footage

The JJB, headed by Principal Magistrate Sarita Dhakad, had last week held the two minors guilty under Sections 302 (murder), 147 (rioting), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 341 (wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code.

The video footage of the crime scene, which showed the presence of the two in the mob, and other evidence formed the grounds of the JJB’s judgment. Another juvenile, who was older than 16 years at the time, is facing trial as an accused in a court in Alwar, where his case was transferred because of the offence being covered in the category of heinous crimes.

Khan, 55, a dairy farmer from Haryana’s Nuh district, his two sons and a few others were waylaid by self-styled cow vigilantes near Behror on the Jaipur-Delhi National Highway on April 1, 2017, and thrashed on suspicion that they were smuggling cows for slaughter. Khan succumbed to his injuries two days later in a hospital.

The sentence was handed down under Section 18(1)(g) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, providing that a child found to be in conflict with law may be sent to a special home for a maximum period of three years for getting reformative services, including education, skill development, counselling, behaviour modification therapy and psychiatric support.

The Alwar sessions court had acquitted six accused in the case on August 14, 2019, giving them the benefit of the doubt on the basis of the police probe. Those let off by the court were Vipin Yadav, Kalu Ram, Dayanand, Ravindra Kumar, Yogesh Kumar and Bheem Rathi.

Appeal in High Court

The State government filed an appeal in the Rajasthan High Court against the sessions court verdict after a Special Investigation Team pointed out loopholes in the probe conducted earlier by four investigating officers.

The High Court had earlier quashed the case of illegal transport of cattle for slaughter against Khan, his sons and the owner of the pick-up truck in which they were travelling. The court had ruled that Khan had purchased the animals for dairy and not slaughter.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/9u2f5q/article31064903.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14DEPEHLU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pehlu-khan-case-minor-convicts-sent-to-special-home/article31064904.ece
254,2020/03/14,Five more test positive; Maharashtra tally is 19,"With five more cases being confirmed on Friday, the number of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in the State has risen to 19.

The new cases include a 21-year-old man from Pune, with a travel history to the U.S, two from Nagpur who were contacts of a previous positive case, and one person in Ahmednagar with a travel history to Dubai. In Mumbai, the wife of 64-year-old patient who was first admitted to Hinduja Hospital has also tested positive.

State health officials said they were they were aggressively tracing the contacts of all positive patients to curb the spread of infection.

As on Friday, nearly 1.60 lakh people had been screened at the three airports in the State. Of these, 818 people were from Maharashtra.

255,2020/03/14,Back-to-school jitters in the Kashmir Valley,"After a seven-month break caused by the abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and the consequent shutdown of the Valley, students returned to school on February 24. Peerzada Ashiq reports on their stuggle to catch up just before schools closed again in the face of the novel coronavirus threat

Dressed in green sweaters, grey pants and blue ties, Shahid Bashir and Abid Nabi, both in Class 9, raced down the narrow, rickety stairs of Sir Syed Islamia Mission High School on February 24. Private schools in Kashmir Valley were decked up to welcome the children after a long, forced break: candy stalls were set up and motivational quotes painted on the walls.

The thud of school shoes is a familiar sound to everyone, but in Srinagar it was music to the ears. The students were excited; they were returning to school after 202 days, or nearly seven months. Instead of disciplining them, the teachers chose to be indulgent on that day. The sight was especially heart-warming given that Sir Syed Islamia is located in the highly volatile area of Malaratta. Over seven months, two dozen youth were arrested from this area when they protested on the streets.

Shahid and Abid, and the 13 lakh students enrolled up to Class 12 in the Valley, were happy to be finally seeing their friends in school. They were full of stories of how they had spent their time at home and how much of the syllabus they had managed to complete, says Abid. Some students shared gifts and hugged. “There was so much to talk about! Seeing each other in uniform after such a long gap... it felt unreal,” says Abid.

Exams during a shutdown

All the 11,308 schools (837 high schools, 410 higher secondary schools, 4,225 middle schools and 5,836 primary schools) in the Kashmir division were forced to close following the Centre’s decision on August 5, 2019, to end Jammu and Kashmir’s special status drawn from Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution. The decision, and the shutdown following it, took a big toll on the functioning of schools. Most of the schools in the Valley failed to conduct the annual assessment test due to curfew-like restrictions and absence of communication lines. Most schools opted to give students home assignments instead of holding annual examinations in classrooms.

Shahid and Abid were among the few who appeared for the year-end exam held in October-November last year. However, they were directed to come discreetly, wearing casual wear and slippers. “We would sneak into school early morning and sit for the exam. There was always a threat of violence breaking out on the streets,” Abid says. Both secured about 60% in the exam. “We could have done better. With the situation volatile, focusing on studies was very tough,” they say.

But Shahid, the son of a baker, and Abid, the son of a Waza (a cook who prepares dishes at weddings), are still worried. They could not attend any of the tuition classes held during the shutdown because of the deteriorating economic condition of their families in that period. “Shahid and I live just two km from each other. There was so much security presence from August 5 as well as sporadic protests that our parents didn’t allow us to meet. We played home cricket. If we tried to step out, we got shouted at by CRPF personnel. We could not attend any tuition,” Abid says. Shahid wants to become a teacher when he grows up and Abid dreams of becoming an engineer.

Syeda Sadaf Waiz, 14, is the daughter of a copper smith. She has been in Class 8 since November, the beginning of a new school year in Kashmir, but she has kept intact her textbooks from Class 7. The textbooks tell a tale of their own. The pages in the first half of her books have folded corners. The rest are flat and untouched — syllabus waiting to be completed. “We could complete only 50-60% of the syllabus last year. I scored just 75%, unlike my previous record of over 90%,” Syeda says.

In social science, Shahid and Abid have marked out six out of 13 chapters that are unread from their previous class. These include ‘Education and British Rule’ and ‘The National Movements: 1870s-1947’. Syeda says chapters titled ‘Forests: Our Lifeline’ and ‘Motion and Time’ were not covered. “I want to sit for the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test [NEET] and become a doctor one day. But if my basics are not cleared, how will I,” she asks.

Behavioural disorders

Getting the students back to school was no easy task, however. “They had a seven-month forced ‘staycation’. They spent that time without Internet and without any outing,” says Ghulam Nabi Var, who heads the Kashmir Private Schools’ Association (KPSA) and the Coaching Centres’ Association. Var’s association oversees the functioning of about 2,700 private schools.

Also Read In uncertain times, Srinagar schools give video lessons

Var says a student’s motivation to return to school comes down significantly when there is such a long gap. “There are several studies which suggest that they feel less motivated to study if they stay away from school for three months or more. We are yet to assess whether all the students have returned to school [which have been closed again over fears of an outbreak of the novel coronavirus], especially government schools,” Var says.

Students also exhibit many behavioural disorders when they are forced to stay out of school for so long, say experts. Razia Jan (name changed), a Class 7 student, has been regularly going to the outpatient department of the Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (IMHANS) in Srinagar since December. Jan is a hyperactive child. Her parents say that she was often irritated at home and prone to sudden flare-ups. She also shows reluctance in going back to school.

Experts warn that children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other such conditions are likely to show school refusal behaviour. “Some children showed some symptoms of this. Parents had a tough time dealing with them,” says Syed Karrar Hussian, a child psychiatrist at IMHANS. “The discipline and regimented work hours at school regulate the behaviour of students, especially students with ADHD. A prolonged absence from school makes life chaotic for such children. A lot of them get used to not going to school, where they learn pro-social skills. We fear school refusal by such kids.”

Hussian sees around 20 cases on a daily basis. Most of the children are aged 6-12. Since August 5, the number of children with ADHD has swelled. There are 200 children being treated at the outpatient department. “No outdoor play, no Internet, and no entertainment has left children with no places to vent their feelings. Many children may require psycho-social care for healthy growth,” he says.

After schools re-opened, IMHANS monitored the behaviour of the children. “I hope four to five weeks of school reduces the anxiety of children, especially those with hyperactivity complaints. Both parents and teachers need to consult IMHANS in case students are fidgety or less attentive. Unfortunately, such students are given physical punishment. This only aggravates their problems,” says Hussain.

Bridging the knowledge gap

Muhammad Najar Jameel and Mir Suhail, both 16, sit under the spring sun in the beautiful campus of the Sri Pratap Higher Secondary School located on Maulana Azad Road. This is the Valley’s designated government-run model school with ‘smart classes’. Jameel and Suhail, dressed in grey sweaters and pants, have just registered for Class 11. Neither of them is interested in traditional professional courses. “I want to become a theoretical physicist. On any clear day, I gaze at stars for hours together,” says Jameel, who is a big fan of Stephen Hawking.

Established in 1874 by then Dogra ruler, Maharaja Pratap Singh, Sri Pratap School was closed for several days in 2017 and 2019 in the wake of violent protests. The school’s main building was taken over by additional battalions of the CRPF from August 2019. Both Jameel and Suhail are wary of discussing politics. “I want to discuss the new image of the black hole, not politics,” says Jameel. He then pauses for a long time. “No good is going to happen to us because of what the Centre did in J&K,” he finally says.

Reyaz Siddiqui, the principal of the smart school, is aware of the requirements of the times. “All the important topics that were missed, the fundamentals of various subjects, will be taught in remedial classes. We could only teach 65% of the syllabus last year,” he says.

The Director of the Education Department of Kashmir, Younis Malik, says they aim to have 220 working days for the middle school and at least 200 days for primary schools in the Valley this year. But when asked how to bridge the knowledge gap and help students acquire the fundamentals, Malik’s department does not have an answer.

Life without Internet

The lack of Internet during the shutdown was a serious concern for students and school administrations across the Valley. This was the reason why the syllabus could not be completed using apps and video lessons. During the winter vacations, the Sri Pratap School usually hosts ‘Project Kashmir Super 50’, an initiative rolled out by Naeem Akhtar, the former Education Minister and Peoples Democratic Party leader who is now in jail, along with J&K Peoples Movement chief, Shah Faesal, in 2013. Its aim is to prepare children from economically weaker sections for professional examinations. “We had tied up with the Avanti Gurukul app before August 5 to provide videos and study material for examinations like the NEET and the Joint Entrance Examination. However, no online classes could be held this winter. The study material could not be accessed because of the Internet shutdown. We distributed study material in pen drives later,” says the principal, Siddiqui.

Students in a classroom in Sir Syed Islamia.

Sri Pratap School used to offer e-classes for each subject for students of Classes 11 and 12. It had earlier tied-up with e-learning platforms across the country. “It’s unlikely we can offer the same now. All this requires high-speed Internet. There is a need for a mechanism where Internet in schools is not disrupted on the pretext of the law and order situation,” Siddiqui says.

After the Supreme Court’s intervention in January, only 2G Internet and limited access to around 1,500 sites, identified as whitelisted sites, was given. The rest were blocked in Kashmir. This had the students on edge. They fear that this curfew may be imposed again any time.

“There is an Instagram account I used to follow which documents and shares all the major developments happening in the cosmos. I had accessed it before August 5. Besides this, NASA is the only major platform to track new scientific achievements. It remained inaccessible for seven months. Can I compete with others tomorrow when companies look for theoretical physicists,” asks Jameel.

According to KPSA data, most schools in the Valley depend on online teaching for new modules for teachers too. “In the absence of Internet, the teaching ecosystem too gets impacted,” says Var.

Now limited Internet has been restored in the Valley but the threat of COVID-19 has again forced the closure of all schools for the month of March. Parents worry that children will be forced to stay at home again. There is still not access to 4G. “If the government permits this, we can have video classes for the children,” one parent says.

Waiving the fee

Meanwhile, the parents and the government are putting pressure on private schools to waive the school and bus fee for the period of the shutdown (August to November). “Parents owe some 70% of the school fee. Out of some 3,000 drivers associated with private schools, 70% are managing with only 50% of the salary. Most parents are refusing to pay the bus fee,” says Var. The matter is now before the J&K High Court, where the petition filed by KPSA has questioned the order of the Divisional Commissioner of Kashmir, Baseer Khan, to the schools to offer a full waiver on the bus fee for the shutdown period. Meanwhile, the school administration and parents have decided to waive the bus fee for the months of August and September.

“There are people from various sectors, such as government employees and chemists, who were not impacted during the shutdown. Their income was not affected in any way. These people should clear all their dues. The government employees even get an allowance for their children. They should help poor students,” Var says.

Education sector under strain

Educational institutions in the Kashmir division saw only three-and-a-half-months of class work in 2019. “The schools opened in March last year. They closed for the summer vacations in July. Then August 5 happened. Students went to school for only 105 days, whereas the National Education Policy, 2019, calls for 220 working days in educational institutes,” Var says.

Students from Kashmir who went to school at the peak of militancy in the 1990s performed poorly in the national-level competitive examinations till 1998, Var says. “The fact that no aspirant qualified for the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) from the Kashmir region in 2018-19 needs to be viewed with seriousness,” he says. Official figures suggest that on an average, six to nine aspirants from the Kashmir region qualified for the UPSC exams before 2016, the year when Kashmir was engulfed in long cycle of street protests which saw civilian deaths.

Kashmir’s education sector is today under tremendous strain. According to 2011 Census data, the Kashmir region, which has a population of 69.1 lakh, has just 2,700 private schools compared to Jammu which has a population of 53.5 lakh and 4,300 schools. According to official figures, there are 480 government-run schools without teachers, 3,122 schools (33%) without electricity. Also, 70% of the schools are without playgrounds.

Despite this dismal scenario, 65,393 students appeared for the Class 10 exam in 2019. The pass percentage was 75%. Officials say that the J&K State Board of School Education had to offer grace marks to ensure that the pass percentage was brought on par with the 2018 pass percentage of 75.44%. However, the pass percentage in the government schools of Ganderbal (50.37%), Bandipora (53.90%) and Baramulla (57%) districts was poor.

“Over the last three years, 125 private schools closed in Kashmir due to recurring agitations. The ripple effect of 2019 will be visible this year, with at least an equal number of schools likely facing closure and retrenchment of staff,” warns Var. Kashmir’s private schools offer jobs to 65,000 locals in the academic and non-academic sectors.

Even schools that were once managed by the Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) face the threat of closure. With the Centre banning the socio-religious group in February last year, the fate of 385 schools run by the JEI came under question. Together these schools have enrolled one lakh students. “The government’s move put both students and teachers through a lot of stress. Most of them are from disadvantaged classes. One year since, hundreds of students and teachers have already switched to other schools,” says the headmaster of a JeI-run school. This has happened, he says, despite the government’s decision to not seal the property of these schools following protests.

With all these issues, and with the COVID-19 threat looming large, Shahid and Abid have their fingers crossed. “In our mohalla, older boys keep saying the situation will turn worse during summer this year. So far, it has been normal. We hope the spread of the virus is contained soon and classes are reopened for studies and interactions. We hope to continue studying whatever the circumstances and make it big in life despite the odds, both man-made and natural,” says Abid.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/vgxk9l/article31062879.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Nissar-Valley-Schools,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/back-to-school-jitters-in-the-valley/article31062882.ece
256,2020/03/14,Theatre will continue to be a powerful form of protest: Pralayan,"Born in the turbulent 80s, when theatre groups had hundreds of cases slapped against them, Chennai-based playwright-activist Pralayan’s troupe finds even more reason today for cultural expressions of dissent

At 60, street theatre activist Pralayan has no plans to retire. “In fact, now is the time when we should be doing more work,” he says. “For things that are happening around us, shouldn’t we have at least four street plays every day, telling people what it is all about?” For him, theatre — especially street theatre — is all about showing a mirror to society.

Flipping through the pages of Halla Bol: The Death and Life of Safdar Hashmi by Sudhanva Deshpande with characteristic tenderness, Pralayan, a member of the Tamil Nadu Progressive Writers and Artists Association (TNPWAA), appears unconcerned about his own group, Chennai Kalai Kuzhu, turning 35. Since its inception in 1984, Chennai Kalai Kuzhu has worked on contemporary issues, amplified marginalised voices and brought a new, refreshing dimension to theatre in Tamil Nadu. “You cannot still call it a pioneer,” he says. “There were many people who did street theatre before us, but Chennai Kalai Kuzhu was perhaps more detailed.”

After college in Tiruvannamalai — where he ran a film society — Pralayan moved to Chennai in 1984, to learn computer programming. But life had different plans. He and his friends became involved in organising a strike against a garment factory. “My comrades gave up their cushy jobs for this and for other protests. It was stunning. And inspiring.” Pralayan too gave up his job to take up theatre. That same year he launched Chennai Kalai Kuzhu — the TNPWAA was hosting a theatre festival and needed its own troupe. The group has over 50 members today.

Police raj

The early 80s were turbulent times. Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran was in hospital and the headless government unleashed a state of police raj. There were lock-up deaths and police excesses in the name of curbing Naxalites. Theatre groups were punished for being outspoken. “Theatre practitioners like Ashwagosh and groups like Makkal Kalai Ilakkiya Kazhagam had cases slapped against them. The latter had done a play based on an agricultural labourer burnt alive in Bihar. Forums that screened the film Maa Bhoomi were booked,” he says. Some 300-plus sedition cases were slapped against theatre practitioners, audience members, media people and even a Bharatanatyam dancer.

The criminalisation of dissent became the subject of Chennai Kalai Kuzhu’s first play — Naangal Varugirom (We Are Coming) — and there was no turning back. “It was a runaway hit; we showed how the police was running the State and criminalising anyone who dared to raise their voice. We had arrived as a formal theatre group.” Pen (Woman) remains an iconic play — a performance that traces the life of a woman from her birth, her life as a second-class citizen. U. Vasuki, now a national leader of AIDWA, was its narrator.

Street theatre, however, was a tall order. It was 1987; there was a stampede in Chennai when many young men came for the police selection exams. Inspired by this, Mutrupulli (Full Stop), became the group’s first street play, but it also explored the larger issue of unemployment.

“We also wanted to do 15-20 minute street performances. The challenge in street theatre is getting the attention of the audience and keeping it sustained,” he says. “Unlike audiences in a theatre, the street audience is not prepared — he/ she is only curious and exploring the idea.” They made several short format plays — a satirical play on the 1989 elections, one on the Roop Kanwar episode, one on agrarian loans.

Murder and revolution

As Chennai Kalai Kuzhu was thinking of innovating with form and content, Safdar Hashmi was killed. “His death gave birth to a new revolution of sorts. He was killed in January 1989 and that April (on Hashmi’s birth anniversary), almost everywhere across India, his plays were enacted.” Halla Bol, the play Hashmi was staging when killed, was translated into Tamil as Urakka Pesu and staged to a rousing audience on Marina Beach.

“His death was a deep personal loss to us,” says Pralayan. “We were at a crossroads; we didn’t know which direction to take. Badal Sarkar suggested that we have to give up every other form of theatre if we venture into street theatre. We did not want to do that. Hashmi insisted that we should explore all theatre forms — each had its own strength.”

Chennai Kalai Kuzhu’s biggest strength — and success — is that it gave a forum for the common man. “We saw authority from the eyes of an ordinary person, something that has not happened before. In doing so, we made the audience realise its own political importance.”

Shrinking spaces

Pralayan says the space for street theatre is rapidly shrinking. “More so in urban places. Not many groups are aware that you actually don’t require police permission for a street performance that doesn’t disrupt normal life. Sadly, even policemen aren’t aware of it. We require permission only if we use a PA system. Things are getting more difficult — spaces for performance are fast disappearing.”

Does that mean theatre is also disappearing? His answer is a vehement no. “As I said, theatre is a necessary form of protest, it is the cultural expression of dissent. Theatre — both on stage and on the street — will be alive as long as there is a need for dissent, even if the space for dissent is shrinking.”

What could better emphasise this than the reception to Pralayan’s 2018 play on Kashmir, which brought together aspects of Manto’s short story ‘Toba Tek Singh’ and the Kashmir incident where a civilian was made a human shield. “After the abrogation of Article 370 last year, we staged the play in several places. For many, it was a powerful articulation of the pain of Kashmiris — something all of us ought to feel.”

As long as there is a demand for such plays, as long as there is the need for dissent in the form of theatre, Chennai Kalai Kuzhu will remain relevant. “We will continue to protest in the form that we know best. There are even more reasons now,” says Pralayan, holding the Halla Bol book close to his chest.

P.S. Selvarasu, one of the villagers said, “the display boards claim that the works were completed during two different time periods in 2019 at a cost close to ₹30 lakh. The water body is spread over an area of over 15 acres and no proper work has been carried out here in terms of deepening the water body or strengthening the bunds. Also, officials haven’t removed the encroachments in the water body nor have they cleared and desilted the inflow and outflow channels of the lake.”

260,2020/03/14,Mongoose poached in urban tank in Coimbatore,"Snares placed on tank bund to trap it for meat and fur

In what appears to be poaching of Indian grey mongoose (Herpestes edwardsii) for meat and fur, a raw material for painting and cosmetic brushes, snares to trap the animal were found on the bunds of an urban water body in Coimbatore.

While one mongoose was found dead with its tail missing, another one was found ensnared. The traps were found at Singanallur tank that was declared a Biodiversity Conservation Zone by the Coimbatore Corporation in 2017. G.R. Ramya, a nature enthusiast from the city who had gone to the tank for bird watching along with her friend on Saturday, found an Indian grey mongoose trapped on the eastern bund of the urban water body.

“One of the legs of the mongoose was ensnared. As we were trying to rescue the mongoose, the snare made of metal wire got loosened and it was freed. We found snares placed in the area and another mongoose was found dead. Its tail was cut off and missing,” she said.

They also found a bag containing coils of steel wires, copper wires, two knives, iron rods and other trap-type materials from the bund and the matter was informed to the Forest Department.

“As the tail of the dead mongoose was missing, we suspect the animal could have been trapped for its tail which has long furs. Brushes made of mongoose fur are used for making cosmetic and artists' paintbrush,” said Ms. Ramya.

Indian grey mongoose, Ruddy mongoose, Small Indian mongoose, Crab-eating mongoose, Stripe-necked mongoose and Brown mongoose are types of mongoose found in India and all the species are protected under Schedule II of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, poaching of which may lead to imprisonment up to seven years and or a hefty fine.

They are also covered under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), an international agreement between governments, with a complete ban on its commercial trade throughout the world.

In July 2017, the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) had seized around 25,000 painting brushes from six shops in Coimbatore, suspecting that the bristles were made of mongoose fur.

“Samples of these brushes were sent to Government laboratory for analysis and it was found that they were indeed made of mongoose fur,” said a Forest Department official, and added that court proceedings of these cases were underway.

A senior official with WCCB told The Hindu that players involved in the making of brushes made of mongoose fur had admitted after a major bust in the past that the southern States were collection points of the exotic fur.

D. Venkatesh, District Forest Officer, Coimbatore Forest Division, said that a team had been appointed to inquire into the poaching.

In 2017, nature enthusiasts had found snares that trapped eight squirrels on the tank bund.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/mongoose-poached-in-urban-tank-in-coimbatore/article31070646.ece

The Nilgiris district Superintendent of Police, V. Sasi Mohan, inaugurated 25 Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras installed in different locations in Khandal, from the control room at the Ooty G1 Police Station on Friday. “The main objective is to ensure crime prevention and facilitate detection of specific crimes,” said the SP. He added that it was proven that areas where CCTV cameras were installed witnessed reduction in the number of crimes.

“The cameras serve as a psychological deterrent which will prevent crimes from taking place and also instil more confidence among the public,” he added. The police had chosen Khandal for camera surveillance as there had been complaints from locals that there were instances of petty crimes and also disturbances caused by drunk people. With the area being on the outskirts of the town and with very high population density, it required more patrolling and surveillance, officials said. The cameras were purchased with the help of the local merchants’ association, and would cover almost the entirety of the Khandal area, the officials said. Video feed from the cameras could be monitored from the local police station.

269,2020/03/14,Corporation begins identifying unoccupied houses on Muthannankulam bund,"This would be the first step in demolishing the houses to free the tank of encroachments

Town Planning wing officials in the Coimbatore Corporation on Friday surveyed houses built encroaching the Muthannankulam tank on Thadagam Road.

Sources in the know of the exercise said the officials went there to identify unoccupied houses from among the 1,500-odd houses on the tank and to start disconnecting power supply.

This would be the first step in demolishing the houses to free the tank of encroachments.

The Corporation along with the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board had constructed flats in Vellalore, Kovai Pudur, Malumichampatty and Keeranatham for the 1,500-odd families in Muthannankulam after identifying each of them by capturing their biometric details.

The Corporation sources said that the Board had also issued allotment orders to all the identified families and around 1,000 of those had left the Muthannankulam area. And, a few among those who had left the area had rented out their old houses to show that they remained occupied.

The Friday’s exercise was to identify the unoccupied houses and to check if the occupants were the owners or tenants. This would pave way for demolition of the houses soon, they added.

Opposing the Corporation’s move to identify unoccupied houses, the area resident and a former councillor M.S. Velmurugan said the houses the Board had allotted to them in the aforementioned four places were of poor quality that a few among them who moved to the flats had returned.

He wanted the Corporation and the Board to construct them new flats, somewhere closer to the city so that they, the residents, did not lose out on their livelihood, children’s education and pay more for transport to commute to the city.

Around 500 tonnes of manure generated through 21 micro composting centres in the Corporation limits so far has been distributed among farmers free of cost.

The civic body has proposed to make the city garbage-free and is implementing various projects under the Smart City Mission. Garbage accumulated at the compost yards at Vendipalayam and Vairapalayam were biomined at ₹ 37.25 crore, while 21 micro compost centres were established at ₹ 13.58 crore to convert wet waste into fertilizer.

Segregation

About 250 tonne municipal solid waste is generated everyday in the city. The collected waste is taken to the micro composting centres where it is segregated into organic and inorganic. It is dumped into cubical tanks and decomposition is done in 30 to 40 days. Later, micro-organism solution is added to control the odour and the dried compost is sieved to produce manure.

271,2020/03/14,Corporation makes slow progress in completing MCC construction,"Reasons vary from getting power connection to installing machinery

The micro compost centre (MCC) inside the banana mundy on Thadagam Road should be operational by now, if one goes by the commitment the Coimbatore Corporation made in January this year to the State Level Monitoring Committee of the National Green Tribunal for Solid Waste Management in Tamil Nadu. But it is not.

The MCC has nothing more than a few brick tanks built on the ground and a metal sheet for roof. Given the absence of any development for almost a fortnight, the MCC has turned to a favourite place for tipplers, as empty liquor bottles and banned plastic tumblers occupy a part of the premises.

Many among the 12 MCCs that the Corporation told the Committee were functioning were not functional for various reasons, said Corporation sources familiar with the development.

In a few of the MCCs, the construction was incomplete; in a few others the Corporation was yet to take power connection and in others the Corporation was yet to install machinery to start processing the waste, they added.

The Corporation had told the Committee in January that it had put into use 12 MCCs and completed work in 23 to take the total operational MCCs to 35 by March 31 this year.

The Corporation also promised to show progress in another 34 in due course.

The Corporation had planned to build 69 MCCs for around ₹ 7 crore to decentralise waste collection and process. The idea was to transport waste from houses and small commercial establishments in every locality in the city to the nearest MCC.

The Corporation had conceived of the MCC idea in 2018 and started construction in 2019. But as of March this year, it had completed construction in only a few centres, the sources said.

The officials said one of the reasons for the Corporation’s failure to go ahead with the construction in places where it had started work was opposition from people in the vicinity to the site chosen for the MCCs.

And, the second reason was that the delay by the Corporation in constructing MCCs in those places where it did not see protest and using those as show-pieces to convince opposing residents to start constructing more.

The sources pointed out that further delay would only mean that the Corporation would continue to spend more to transport waste all the way to the Vellalore dump yard and ill use the small goods carriers it bought recently to take waste to the MCCs.

The Corporation officials said they had asked the contractors to complete construction at the earliest in those MCCs where they had started work.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/mkatwg/article31064118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB14MICROCOMPOSTCENTRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/corpn-makes-slow-progress-in-completing-mcc-construction/article31064119.ece
272,2020/03/14,"Spinning the ball on the pitch, no matter what","Shashikala Siriwardene, one of Sri Lanka’s most celebrated women cricketers, has called it a day

Shashikala Siriwardene was barely 10 then. She enjoyed playing cricket, although Sunday morning classes were not easy. She couldn’t sleep in, she had to get ready for coaching. Riding pillion with her father who dropped her every week, little Siriwardene would invariably doze off.

“You know, he modified his bike, fixing a couple of extra metal frames to ensure I didn’t fall off it. He even made a compartment for me to keep my kit,” recalls the Sri Lankan star and former captain, who retired from international cricket earlier this month, after a brilliant spell — 4 for 16 — that led Sri Lanka to victory against Bangladesh in the Women’s T20World Cup in Australia.

As a child, Ms. Siriwardene had no clue that the gully cricket she played with her brother and his friends would spark a lifelong passion. Her father’s commitment, the consistent coaching, along with her own drive and skill, took her to the international arena — 17 years of international cricket — with an enviable record as an all-rounder in over 100 ODIs and nearly a 100 T20 games.

Understandably, retiring wasn’t an easy decision. “Seventeen years is a long time. Three generations of players have come and gone, but I was still around,” she told The Hindu at the Mercantile Cricket Association in Colombo, where she coaches aspiring boys and girls.

Every time she had a tough call to make — be it choosing between A level examinations and an important match or other career or life decisions, her father’s lesson came in handy. “Listen to your heart, do what feels right,” he had told her.

Ms. Siriwardene had toyed with the idea of quitting in 2013, when she got married to Namal Seneviratne, a former first-class cricketer. “I thought I needed to spend time with the family.” But her husband discouraged her. She was in great form and was winning high praise for the Sri Lankan team. “Why must you quit now? Just focus on your performance,” he had told her.

In about a year, Ms. Siriwardene was ranked as the top women’s all-rounder in the world and also made it to the World XI team selected to play at Lord’s which was “a dream!”

Andrew Fidel Fernando, a leading writer with ESPNcricinfo.com, describes Ms. Siriwardena as Sri Lanka’s “first real woman cricketing star”, who burst into national consciousness in the last decade. “She bowled, she batted, and won games by herself,” he told The Hindu.

“If Sri Lanka were doing well in a match, she more than likely was a big part of that charge.” Although Sri Lanka Women had impressed in the 2015 ODI World Cup, they got left behind a little by teams such as Australia, India, South Africa and New Zealand because the country’s talent search has been informal and their development systems not “as intensive”. However, an international career like Ms. Siriwardene’s feeds into how women’s cricket is approached at home, more importantly at the grassroots. “In Sri Lanka, we now have a world-class player in Chamari Atapattu, she would make it to virtually any team in the world. That is a result of the investment made by not just the boards and administrators, but also by players like Siriwardene,” Mr. Fernando noted.

Crowd-puller

Globally too, it is a good time for women’s cricket that, in Mr. Fernando’s view, has seen a “stratospheric” rise in the last few years. Ms. Siriwardene agrees. “The crowds at the T20 series in Australia should tell us that whether it’s the game in terms of technique and skill, performance or entertainment, women’s cricket can draw huge crowds,” she said.

As an all-rounder and former captain, Ms. Siriwardene has seen it all. But if there’s one thing that excites her the most, it’s her off-spin. “You know, I like to spin the ball no matter what. I don’t want the pitch conditions to limit me in anyway, I really try and spin the ball irrespective of the pitch,” she said, twirling her right wrist as she spoke.

In his tweet congratulating Ms. Siriwardene following her retirement, fellow Sri Lankan icon Kumar Sangakkara said: “You have done great service to Sri Lanka and the game. Your inspiration will make strong a whole new generation of young girls and boys to follow in your footsteps.”

Her sparkling career has already been drawing aspirants to the game. Debora Stefani began training only a year ago. “I used to watch a lot of cricket. I saw Shashikala miss play on TV and thought why not I too learn to play and that’s why I am here,” said the 19-year-old. While the teenager is thrilled to be coached by her icon, watching her last big match wasn’t easy, she admitted. “I was very sad.”

273,2020/03/14,Coronavirus | BCCI puts all domestic games including Irani Cup on hold,"Prominent tournaments that stand postponed are the Irani Cup, Vizzy Trophy, Senior Women’s One-Day Knockout and the Senior Women’s One-Day Challenger, among others

A day after suspending the Indian Premier League and India’s two ODIs against South Africa, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), has put the whole domestic season “on hold” on March 14.

“In view of the ongoing Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) outbreak, the BCCI on March 14 announced that all matches of the Paytm Irani Cup, Senior Women’s One-Day knockout, Vizzy Trophy, Senior Women's One-Day Challenger, Women's Under-19 One-Day knockout, Women’s Under 19 T20 League, Super League and knockout, Women's Under-19 T20 Challenger Trophy, Women's Under-23 knockout, Women’s Under-23 One-Day Challenger have been put on hold till further notice,” Jay Shah, BCCI secretary, said in a statement.

It will mean that the Irani Cup tie — between Ranji Trophy champion Saurashtra and Rest of India — will most probably be played as a precursor to the next season while the renovated Motera stadium in Ahmedabad, with a record capacity of 1.11 lakh which was scheduled to host the Senior Women’s Challenger from March 26, will have to wait longer for hosting its first competitive game.

Surprise decision

The decision came as a surprise to many since Gujarat is yet to have any positive COVID-19 case.

In fact, the national selection panel had even finalised the Rest of India squad, with Hanuma Vihari as captain. However, considering the rapidly perpetrating coronavirus cases in various regions of India, the BCCI decided to suspend all official cricket tournaments.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/7hxlhi/article31068913.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILES-HEALTH-VIRUS-CRICKET-IND-IPL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/coronavirus-bcci-puts-all-domestic-games-including-irani-cup-on-hold/article31068914.ece
274,2020/03/14,England cancels Lanka tour,"Physical and mental well-being of players and support teams paramount: ECB

England's cricket team abruptly pulled out of a tour of Sri Lanka on Friday citing the “unprecedented” crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

A practice match here was halted as the team announced it would be flying back to London, and the first of two Tests due to start on March 19 has been indefinitely postponed.

“At this time, the physical and mental well-being of our players and support teams is paramount,” said an England and Wales Cricket Board statement announcing the end of the tour. “We will now look to bring them home to their families as soon as possible. These are completely unprecedented times, and decisions like this go beyond cricket.”

The four-day practice game against a Sri Lankan Board President's XI side was halted near the end of the second day. England was fielding when captain Joe Root came on to call the players off.

The match attracted few spectators. Only a handful of England fans and a dozen locals were at the grounds to watch the two teams ahead of the first Test in Galle.

Root made it clear this week that players had been told to take extra precautions and not have contact with fans or members of the opposing team. “It is against our nature as a team, we quite like to socialise and interact with fans and take selfies, autographs and stuff. But it means that we can't do that on this trip,” Root told reporters on Wednesday.

There were no handshakes between the teams before the practice game.

“We were told that England wants to return because of the threat of the coronavirus,” a Sri Lankan cricket official told AFP.

“They decided to stop the practice match immediately and get back home.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/5n2dqz/article31064019.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14ENGLAND,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/england-cancels-lanka-tour/article31064020.ece

Australia fast bowler Kane Richardson has been cleared of a suspected coronavirus infection and rejoined his teammates at the SCG on Friday. Richardson, who returned from South Africa with the ODI squad, was isolated and tested as a precaution after developing a mild sore throat.

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has, however, tested positive for coronavirus, the Premier League club said on Thursday, with the first-team squad set to self-isolate as a result.

276,2020/03/14,Future course of action to be decided today,"Following Health Ministry guidelines, the BCCI has decided to suspend the league till April 15

Board of Control for Cricket in India president Sourav Ganguly said here on Friday the future course of action on the Indian Premier League would be decided after a meeting with franchises on Saturday.

Following Health Ministry guidelines, the BCCI has decided to suspend the league till April 15. However, there is no clarity on whether the tournament will start on April 15 or a revised date will be announced.

“Let’s see. We can’t answer that right now,” Ganguly said after a long meeting at the BCCI headquarters on Friday. He said it was not possible to predict how things would pan out.

As per the schedule, the tournament was to begin on March 29 and end on May 24. Asked whether the window would be extended, Ganguly said: “It’s too early to comment on that. We will discuss all the aspects, see how things go and decide accordingly.”

With the Delhi government refusing to give permission to host any sporting activities, including the IPL, there is speculation that the number of venues could be reduced.

However, Ganguly said: “Our priority is safety and that’s why we decided to postpone it. We will see how things go and then get a better idea (about the venues).”

Asked whether the franchises were happy with the Board’s decision, Ganguly stated: “Nobody has a choice.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/8x9o6t/article31063805.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14DADA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/future-course-of-action-to-be-decided-today/article31063806.ece

279,2020/03/14,Conversion to a different faith is an individual’s choice: HC,"High Court Bench said this while asking petitioner to withdraw his plea as it did not want to reject it

The Delhi High Court on Friday said that religion is a personal belief and whether to convert to a different faith or not is an individual’s choice while declining to entertain a plea for stopping or regulating religious conversions.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar asked the petitioner, BJP leader and lawyer Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, to withdraw the petition as it did not want to reject it.

Following this, Mr. Upadhyay sought permission to withdraw the matter and the Bench allowed him to do so.

When the petition came up for hearing, the Bench said, “Tell us how can we regulate it? What will we regulate? If someone is threatening someone or intimidating someone, it is an offence under the Indian Penal Code.”

The Bench added that there was no reason for an individual to succumb to threats, intimidation or allurement to convert to a different faith.

Mr. Upadhyay, in his plea, had contended that many individuals, NGOs and institutions are converting downtrodden persons, particularly of the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe community, by “intimidating, threatening, luring by monetary benefits and by other acts, including miracle healing, black magic and more”.

It also claimed that as per the 2011 census, Hindus constitute 79% of the population down from 86 per cent in 2001 and if no action is taken “Hindus will become minority in India”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/conversion-to-a-different-faith-is-an-individuals-choice-hc/article31065042.ece
280,2020/03/14,Expectant mother recollects her narrow escape from death,"Musarrat sneaked out with 4 children and the fifth in her belly

Forty-year-old Musarrat ran with all her five children in tow — three daughters and a son forming a chain, hands tightly clasped, and a fifth in her belly.

“Fear is the worst thing,” she says when asked how she managed to run while carrying a full term baby inside her.

On the fateful night of February 25, she decided to flee her house in Shiv Vihar almost on a hunch. It had barely been five minutes since they left their house, when she saw a mob behind them pelting stones in their direction.

Her neighbourhood had been tense for nearly two days. On February 23, there was a minor fire in the street and a day later someone left petrol cans and wires at her doorstep.

She says escaping mob violence wasn’t an easy decision for her. Following her husband’s death in December last year, she has been on iddat [a mandatory waiting period when widows are confined within their house and are forbidden from mingling with people]. She says on the night of February 25, when she fled to her natal home, she was in a dilemma to either abide by an important ritual or save her life and the lives of her children.

Musarrat expects to deliver her baby any day, but there are no signs of a celebration that usually accompanies the birth of a child.

“Doctors have warned that my baby is weak and may require care in a hospital,” she tells The Hindu. She has just returned home after a detailed medical examination.

“There is more tension than happiness. There is fear and trauma,” says Musarrat.

House torched

Days later, her 20-year-old daughter found that their house had been completely burnt. All that is left of their belongings is a cylinder with a tear and the charred remains of utensils and two sewing machines.

281,2020/03/14,Rumour of 4-year-old being stabbed resulted in IB staffer’s murder: police,"Officers put mobile phones on surveillance which led to the arrest of accused

A rumour of a four-year-old child being stabbed to death by a Hindu mob during violent clashes in Chand Bagh allegedly triggered rage in Salman to stab IB staffer Ankit Sharma to death within minutes, said a police officer on Friday.

During interrogation, Salman alias Haseen, who has been arrested for murdering Ankit, has disclosed that he was in Mustafabad on February 25 when he heard about the child being stabbed to death by a Hindu mob in Chand Bagh. He got angered and picked up a knife from a sweet shop and reached near Tahir Hussain’s house in Chand Bagh where people from both sides were pelting stones at each other.

“Around 5 p.m., Salman heard that a Hindu man has been caught and taken near Tahir’s house. He also reached there, along with his friend Sameer, and they attacked Ankit with a knife. Salman stabbed Ankit in the stomach and thigh while Sameer hit him with a rod. Many others in the group also attacked Ankit and later dumped his body into the canal,” said a police officer.

Salman disposed of the murder weapon into the canal and went to his relatives’ house in Mustafabad. Fearing police action, he came out after two days and, along with Sameer, left the area for their respective homes in Sundar Nagari.

Police said that during investigation, they put the mobile phone of a local criminal Moosa on technical surveillance. From the call records of Moosa, they reached to Salman and his mobile phone was also put on surveillance. Salman had made a call to someone and he was heard referring “we punctured one man”.

“After we managed to establish that Salman was in Chand Bagh at the time when Ankit was murdered, he was picked up for questioning. He used to sell onions and came to Delhi in 2015 from Aligarh.

283,2020/03/14,"Shaheen Bagh stir will go on till CAA is revoked, says protesters","Women demand answers from Centre on the violence in north-east Delhi

Nearly three months since they began their protest against the citizenship law, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register, some of the women protesters at Shaheen Bagh said on Friday that the movement will continue till the law is revoked.

Ritu Kaushik, a protester and volunteer at Shaheen Bagh, said: “Women and children of Shaheen Bagh had started the movement after the Delhi Police brutally attacked the students of Jamia. The entire world knows the kind of problems we have faced during this movement, including people coming here with revolvers. Nobody even had a clue that something like this could happen in the national capital. All of this was done to divert attention and end this movement. But the dadis and women did not back down.”

Referring to Home Minister Amit Shah’s speech in Parliament on the NPR, Ms. Kaushik added: “Mr. Shah said that the “doubtful” category will be removed from the NPR. What we want to say is that why are the questions required at all? We demand that the law, which was amended in 2003, be revoked so that the issue gets uprooted once and for all.”

At the late night briefing, several women came forth and demanded answers from the Centre on the recent violence which erupted in north-east Delhi. “One single community was targeted [in the riots] and the ones who [from other communities] tried to save them were also attacked.

“It’s a matter of shame that the UN had to interfere. India is a secular country with humanity which is now embarrassed before the world due to our current government,” said another protester.

Further she added, “On what basis did the HM said that the riots ended on February 25 when police records show there were distress calls on February 26 as well?”

Maintaining that the CAA was unconstitutional and not secular, demonstrators said that the riots were a “targeted attack on a single community to an extent that they are scared to return to the same place” and demanded that the Centre provide compensation to the victims.

Referring to narratives against the Shaheen Bagh protest, one of the women demonstrators said: “Looks like the HM has forgotten the chronology himself. We have been sitting here for the attack on Jamia students and against CAA-NRC-NPR and not because some political party or group has asked us to sit here.”

Speaking about the COVID-19 scare, she added, “They [Centre] don’t need to spread corona virus panic hoping that we will run away from here. We want to tell HM that don’t bother about us as we can take care of ourselves. You think about the people whose houses have been burnt and are left homeless now.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/xcqx5z/article31064956.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL14-SHAHEENBAGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/shaheen-bagh-stir-will-go-on-till-caa-is-revoked/article31064957.ece
284,2020/03/14,Activists urge CM to increase compensation for riot survivors,"Inflation, cost of living cited as reasons

A group of activists, including Harsh Mander and Anjali Bhardwaj, has urged Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to increase the compensation given to survivors of communal riots in north-east Delhi, including increasing the solatium to the family of a deceased person from ₹10 lakh to ₹25 lakh.

“The compensation announced to next of kin of those who have died in the Delhi violence is ₹10 lakh. Compensation of ₹13 lakh was given seven years ago by the Uttar Pradesh government after the Muzaffarnagar riots in 2013, for survivors in a rural economy. Adjusting for inflation and cost of living in an expensive urban metropolis like Delhi, the ex-gratia amount must be enhanced to ₹25 lakh,” a letter written by the group to the Chief Minister read.

Aid for loss of job

The group has also urged the Chief Minister to include sexual violence, including rape and assault, under categories of injury and provide a compensation of ₹5 lakh. They also asked Mr. Kejriwal to provide compensation to workers in the area for “lost opportunities of employment”.

The letter was written by activists Farah Naqvi, Anjali Bhardwaj, Annie Raja, Harsh Mander, Apoorvanand, Anirban Bhattacharya and Amrita Johri.

“Forms of sexual violence, recognised under the Indian Penal Code, including rape, assault or criminal force to outrage modesty or intent to disrobe, must be added to the categories of injury with a compensation amount of ₹5 lakh,” the letter said.

Though the Delhi government had announced immediate financial assistance of ₹25,000 to the families, the activists said that many were yet to receive it. “The survival relief must be released immediately to each family. Today, over two weeks to the violence, many families we spoke to have not received this amount,” they said in the letter.

The group demanded that ₹25,000 assistance must be renewed for families who are still unable to return at the end of 30 days from February 24, 2020, until their final return or resettlement in new locations.

“In case of any default in the timely disbursal of compensation, persons shall have the right to complain to the Deputy CM’s office, which should have a designated officer and widely publicised phone number to monitor these complaints till final resolution of claims,” according to the letter.

The group also demanded to increase the compensation for orphaned children from ₹3 lakh to ₹10 lakh, death of a minor from ₹5 lakh to ₹25 lakh and loss of moveable properties such as buffalo, cow and sheep from the current ₹5,000 to ₹50,000, ₹30,000 and ₹10,000 respectively.

The Delhi government on Friday banned all sports events and activities in the city that are likely to register an attendance of over 200 people in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Addressing a press conference, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that the government has decided that all sports activities in Delhi such as seminars, conferences and events which are in the nature of public gatherings would not be allowed.

Asked if the popular Indian Premier League cricket tournament would be allowed with just players and empty stands, Mr. Sisodia said, “We have banned all sports-related gatherings, but if the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) wants to conduct it in a new format, it is up to them.”

“All sports gatherings (including IPL)/conferences/seminars beyond 200 people are prohibited in NCT of Delhi for the purpose of prevention and control of the outbreak of epidemic disease namely COVID-19,” an order issued by the Delhi government read.

Mr. Sisodia said that the ban would remain in force until further orders.

“We have told all DMs (District Magistrates) and SDMs (Sub Divisional Magistrates) to follow all orders from the Health Department on coronavirus strictly and take action if anyone is violating it,” he said.

Stressing on the need to contain the outbreak by adopting preventive measures, the Deputy Chief Minister sought people’s cooperation. “I want to tell everyone to not wait for government orders but proactively avoid any big gatherings. The government is doing its best but to stop the spread of the disease, mutual cooperation of the people and the government is very important,” he said.

“This is an exponential threat where every day counts. I would urge the people to self-quarantine themselves. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, get your tests done, avoid public gatherings and stay at home. This is the best way to contain its spread,” Health Minister Satyendar Jain said at the press conference.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-govt-bans-sports-events-till-further-orders/article31064938.ece
286,2020/03/14,‘Centre trying to pin blame on women’,"There is a vicious campaign against citizens, says women’s groups

Several women’s groups and individuals on Friday released a statement alleging that instead of taking action against erring police force and against those who openly instigated and perpetrated violence in north-east Delhi, the Central government was trying to pin the blame on the women for protesting peacefully against the CAA.

“What we are witnessing is a concerted misinformation campaign that criminalises the protesters, spins conspiracy theories and targets all those who supported the protests. Anyone who has been to these protests will know how morally low this is,” the women said in a statement.

The women said that there was a vicious campaign against citizens of a free democratic country.

“There is intimidation, FIRs based on falsehoods, threat of arrest against the protesters and those who stood with the protests. This politics of intimidation threatens all women, it threatens each citizen, and it must end.” the statement added.

The women reiterated that across identities of religion, caste, class, gender, sexuality and ability, they oppose the proposed National Population Register (NPR), Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and stand by the protesters and the right to protest.

The women demanded that action be taken against those who have conducted systematic hate campaigns, spread falsehood, instigated and perpetrated the violence. The statement was signed by 105 individuals and 10 organisations.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/centre-trying-to-pin-blame-on-women/article31064921.ece
287,2020/03/14,"Delhi Assembly passes resolution against NPR, NRC","If the Centre insists, NPR exercise should be carried out in 2010 format, says AAP Minister Gopal Rai

The Delhi Assembly on Friday passed a resolution against the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) at a special session here.

By conducting the NPR exercise across the nation, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal alleged during his address, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government was attempting to “divert” the attention of people from “the real issues” being faced by the country such as unemployment and economic crises.

‘No birth certificate’

Mr. Kejriwal’s statement came in the wake of Cabinet Minister Gopal Rai moving a resolution against the NPR in the State Assembly.

Mr. Rai further said that if the Centre insists, the NPR process should be carried out in accordance with the 2010 format.

During the debate on the resolution, Mr. Kejriwal asked for a show of hands to ascertain how many legislators present in the House had birth certificates issued by government agencies; out of the 70-member Assembly, 61 did not have one.

“Me, my wife, and my parents, we do not possess the birth certificate issued by the municipality... will the Central government send the four family members, including the Delhi Chief Minister, to a detention centre? None of the Delhi Cabinet Ministers have the birth certificate, will the whole Cabinet be sent to detention centres?” said Mr. Kejriwal.

“I want to know how many of the [Union] Cabinet Ministers and MPs have the birth certificate. Most of the CMs do not have it,” he said further.

‘The real issues’

“The real issues right now should be unemployment and economy... the Centre might bring forth the claim that all these three things are different, but the Union Home Minister has linked them himself by telling the people to understand the chronology,” he said. “The Home Minister said that first is CAA, then NPR, and then NRC.”

In this process, Mr. Kejriwal alleged, Indian Hindus had the most to lose: if one was a Muslim and did not have papers, an individual would “directly land into the detention centre”; if one was a Hindu from Pakistan then the government would “make your papers”; but if one was a Hindu from India and did not have papers, the individual concerned would still “be sent to the detention camps”.

As many as 11 Indian States, he said, had passed a resolution against the NRC and the NPR and many of these such as Bihar and Tamil Nadu were ruled by parties that are in alliance with the BJP.

“I will request the Central government to not bring the NPR and the NRC because it will be of no good to our country,” the Chief Minister said.

The eight-member Opposition sought to condemn what it alleged was a “deliberate attempt” to spread “doubts and misgivings” about a “well-intentioned move” of the Central government.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/1d0sn4/article31064919.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14DEKEJRIWAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-assembly-passes-resolution-against-npr-nrc/article31064920.ece
288,2020/03/14,‘Six women who were part of a mob that attacked DCP identified’,"Taking help of technical team to get more clarity: police

A team of Delhi Police on Friday claimed that they have identified women protesters who were part of a mob that attacked DCP Amit Sharma and four other constables during the violence in north-east Delhi.

A senior police officer confirmed that after scanning mobile and CCTV footage of Chand Bagh area where violence broke out on February 24, they have identified six women who were part of the anti-CAA protests in the area.

“We are in the process of identifying more women and most of them were wearing burqa and their faces were covered. We are taking the help of technical team to get more clarity over the presence of people at the protest site when violence broke out,” said the officer.

Content of video

In a video of the attack on police officers in Chand Bagh area, around 50 women and 100 men were seen pelting stones at the officers from both sides of the main Wazirabad road.

Deputy Commissioner of Police Amit Sharma was injured in the head after a mob surrounded his team and attacked them while Head Constable Ratan Lal was shot dead.

Mr. Sharma’s wife Pooja Sharma told that he had gone to talk to the women’s group that was part of the anti-CAA protests in the area, but the group attacked the police team.

Notices to be sent

“We are sending notices to the women to join the investigation and counter them with the evidence we have collected from the location,” said the officer.

On Thursday, Delhi Police had arrested seven persons for their alleged role in the murder of Head Constable Ratan Lal.

289,2020/03/14,Delhi violence | 3 PFI members held for alleged involvement in riots get bail,"Judge seeks IO’s explanation noting that offences invoked in FIR are bailable in nature

A Delhi court on Friday granted bail to three alleged members of Popular Front of India (PFI), who were arrested for their alleged “involvement” in anti-CAA protests and the communal riots in north-east Delhi.

Metropolitan Magistrate Prabh Deep Kaur granted bail to Parvez Alam, PFI Delhi unit president, Mohammad Ilyas, its State secretary and ‘active’ member Mohammad Danish noting that the offences invoked in the FIR are bailable in nature.

The court has directed the three persons to cooperate with the police in its investigation and not to leave the country without permission of the court.

“IO [investigating officer] has nowhere mentioned that any non-bailable offences has been disclosed or has come out during investigation till now,” the judge said.

The judge reminded that it is a settled principle that in bailable offences, it is the duty of the IO to offer bail to the accused persons at the first instance. The court directed the IO to give a written explanation with respect to his failure to offer bail to the accused persons.

The court order came while hearing State’s plea for grant of police remand for the accused.

‘Pre-planned conspiracy’

In its application, the police said that on March 6, “specific information was received by the Crime Branch that the communal riots of February 23-23 were pre-planned and the same were hatched by one Umar Khalid, a student of JNU and his aides, all linked with different groups”.

“As per the pre-planned conspiracy, Umar Khalid gave provocative speeches at various places and appealed to the minority gathering to block roads and other public places during the visit of Donald Trump,” the prosecution stated.

“To achieve this objective, firearms, acid bottles and other dangerous articles were used. As a pre-planned conspiracy,women and children were sent to block Jaffrabad Metro Station to create riot,” it said.

Based on the technical and manual evidence collected during the investigation, accused Danish was arrested for his alleged role in the riots. Alam and Ilyas were arrested by Delhi Police on Thursday.

The prosecution had sought police remand to unearth the complete conspiracy and to identify the other persons who were involved in the funding used by PFI to carry out the riots and for verification and confrontation of bank details.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/vwkav0/article31064870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL14-HC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/3-pfi-members-held-for-alleged-involvement-in-riots-get-bail/article31064872.ece
290,2020/03/14,"Cinema halls turn away audience, institutes suspend classes in Capital","Managements comply with Delhi government order to stop spread of COVID-19

Cinema halls, tuition centres and colleges wore a deserted look on Friday following an order released by the Delhi government on Thursday to shut these till March 31 to stop the spread of COVID-19 in the Capital.

While multi-screen halls withheld their bookings on online ticketing platforms, a few single-screen ones still allowed people to procure tickets online. The management of Miraj Cinemas in Subhash Nagar said it received several online bookings, but stayed shut and was processing the refunds.

Amba Cinema, another single-screen theatre on G.T. Road here, had stationed guards outside to inform people that it would remain shut till March 31. “We have sent away almost 20 people who had come to watch a movie, since morning,” one of the guards said.

Prominent tuition centres in South Extension had students visiting for “clarification of doubts” related to studies and competitive medical exams in May, but regular classes remained suspended. Most institutes have deferred the commencement of new classes to April 1.

A student of Motilal Nehru College, Priyanka Dewara, said, “All classes have been suspended till month-end due to COVID-19 scare. We have been asked to report in April.”

Stating that the submission dates of assignments have been postponed, a management student at Fortune Institute of International Business, Shreya, said she welcomed the government’s decision of shutting colleges.

Gautam, who studies in Jawaharlal Nehru University, said: “All seminars and conferences have been postponed, but the libraries are open as of now.”

291,2020/03/14,Rejection of mercy plea: Nirbhaya convict moves High Court,"One of the four death row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, Vinay Sharma, moved the Delhi High Court on Friday claiming that there were “procedural lapses” and “constitutional irregularities” in the rejection of his mercy plea by President Ram Nath Kovind.

Advocate A.P. Singh, representing Sharma, said the matter had been filed in the High Court registry.

The petition claims that the recommendation sent to the President to reject the mercy plea did not contain the signature of Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain.

The mercy plea of the convict was rejected by the President on February 1.

The plea claims that when the mercy plea was moved, the model code of conduct was in force and Mr. Jain was only an MLA candidate then as polls had been announced and therefore, he could not have exercised the power of Home Minister.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rejection-of-mercy-plea-nirbhaya-convict-moves-high-court/article31064814.ece
292,2020/03/14,CM thanks Centre for containment of COVID-19,"We have been able to contain community spread of the virus

The global outbreak of COVID-19, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said during a discussion on the issue at a one-day Special Session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly here, scared him even as he sought to express gratitude to the Bharatiya Janata Party-led (BJP) Centre for its containment in India.

“The virus is still in the stage of containment right now, and we have been able to contain the community spread. As many as 81 cases have been reported in the country so far. I want to thank the Centre for working in close coordination with the Delhi government and various other authorities to contain the spread of COVID-19,” he said.

“All the officers are working day and night. It is largely because of the support of the people that Delhi has reported only six cases so far. I hope that the Centre is cooperating with all other States,” he said further.

The majority of the 81 cases reported in India, he said, involved people who had arrived in India from foreign countries. He also pointed out that India did have cases like a mother being infected with the virus because of her child, which was the sixth case in Delhi and meant that some cases were because of close contact with infected patients. There were only two ways through which COVID-19 could spread and escalate: if a person coughs or sneezes on an individual and if the remnants of a sneeze or cough on a hard surface were touched by somebody, leading to infection.

“A healthy person should not wear a mask because it can have a reverse effect on the person... A person should not touch his mouth, nose, and eyes after touching a contaminated surface,” he said.

“If a person is healthy, but still uses a mask, he may touch his face repeatedly to adjust the mask with unwashed hands, which will increase the chances of him getting infected. This is not an air-borne disease. One should wash his hands every half-an-hour,” he added.

LoP’s demand

Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Legislative Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, demanded that the Delhi government ensure that 96 private hospitals which were given land on concessional rates be roped in to provide free treatment and isolation wards to COVID-19 patients.

The Delhi government, he said, must ensure that they function as per terms and conditions of the agreement between them and the government.

“They [private hospitals] should place 5,000 free beds at the services of the Delhi government. They must provide free medicines and investigation facilities. They are bound to reserve 25% beds and provide free treatment to 40% patients in OPDs,” he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cm-thanks-centre-for-containment-of-covid-19/article31064807.ece

299,2020/03/14,Enumeration of the illiterate incomplete,"COVID-19 scare mars progress

Enumeration of illiterate persons, taken up by GHMC following Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s ‘Each one-Teach one’ New Year message, might be further delayed following the COVID-19 scare.

Initial resistance

The enumeration by the corporation’s Urban Community Development wing was initially scheduled for 10 days between February 24 and March 4, but it is yet to reach completion 10 days past the deadline.

Officials attribute the delay to initial resistance from residents of Old City who mistook the survey as part of the National Population Register (NPR) exercise.

Charminar Zone, which consists of several parts of the Old City, recorded only 50% coverage of households by the survey teams, while Khairatabad zone with circles from Old City such as Karwan and Gosha Mahal, trails with 87% coverage.

In contrast, L.B. Nagar zone recorded 101% coverage of households, Serlingampally, 103%, Kukatpally, 94.5% and Secunderabad zone 94% coverage. L.B. Nagar and Serilingampally zones recorded more than 100% enumeration, as the number of actual households visited turned out to be higher than the number of estimated households, officials informed.

On the whole, the survey has so far identified 1.75 lakh illiterate persons above 18 years of age, from all the zones of GHMC. L.B. Nagar zone has recorded the maximum number of illiterate persons thus far, at 38,402, with Kukatpally following with 35,505 persons. Owing to hampered survey, Charminar zone has recorded mere 16,046 illiterate persons.

Brought to a halt

According to officials wishing to remain anonymous, the survey has been halted for the past few days, though resistance has waned in Old City. The halt was first due to holidays, and then came the COVID-19 scare, they said.

Directions have been issued by officials to wind up the survey by March 17, but in view of a second coronavirus-positive patient in the city, progress of the enumeration now hangs in the balance.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/enumeration-of-the-illiterate-incomplete/article31070915.ece
300,2020/03/14,Rumours of lockdown sees people stocking up,"Customers rush to supermarkets

Long queues and frayed tempers were witnessed in most of the supermarkets in Hyderabad as the news about closure of schools, malls and cinema halls from Sunday spread. “I got three messages about stocking up on staples, groceries and essentials. I think similar messages have been received by others as well,” said Abdul Manan, at a well-known supermarket in the Banjara Hills area. Outside the market, parked cars created a traffic congestion as shoppers rushed to fill up their carts with bags of wheat flour, rice, lentils, liquid soap refill packs, milk powder and beverages.

“I got a list of dry rations that we can stock. If there is no emergency they can be disposed of or shared with others. But if there is an emergency lockdown we will be prepared for at least a few months,” said Venkatesh G., a techie, who said he has completed most of the shopping.

“I tried to buy on an online grocery store but they have run out of stocks and that’s why I had to come here. But frankly, how much can you store? For how long? Ten days, one month. How long will the quarantine shut-down last? We don’t know that,” said Geeta, a market researcher, who said she came shopping for essentials.

“We are privileged that we can buy whenever we want. What about the others?” said Ms. Geeta discounting the need for panic buying. A similar crowded scene was witnessed in other supermarkets as well across the city.

One of the lists doing the rounds on social media includes dry rations as well as list of medicines. “This does not look like panic buying. This is just weekend rush but what people are buying now is different. They are picking up large bags of atta, rice, noodles and soup packets. If there is panic buying we would know it on Monday,” said a shop hand at the supermarket.

A guru to many political stalwarts, including former Congress Legislature Party leader K. Jana Reddy and yesteryear TDP leaders, KV was recollected for his strong party administration skills, social and political understanding of the Telugu States.

Born in West Godavari, he visited Nagarjunasagar in the 1960s as an official when the dam was under construction, and later practising agriculture, he made Anumula his home, senior leaders remembered.

He was elected Anumula gram sarpanch in 1981.

Others also recalled his association with former Chief Minister N.T. Rama Rao, as his adviser and strategist, in conducting several political meetings, assessing ground situations, preparing appraisals of prospective candidates and playing a crucial role during ticket allocation. Legislative Council Chairman Gutha Sukender Reddy and senior leader from Khammam, Thummala Nageswara Rao, visited the family offering their condolences and paid floral respects to him.

On Friday, his protégé K. Jana Reddy, said the death of his mentor was “a void that cannot be filled.” He, along with Miryalaguda MLA N. Bhaskar Rao, participated in the funeral procession -- carrying his body from the house to the cemetery.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/last-rites-of-kv-performed-in-halia/article31066995.ece

303,2020/03/14,Airports Council bats for reduction of airport tax,"The Airports Council International (ACI), a body representing 113 airport operators managing 602 airports in 49 countries of the Asia Pacific and middle east regions, has written to Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh that COVID-19 has drastically impacted the airport business and posed a serious threat to financial sustainability of the airport industry.

According to ACI world estimates, Asia Pacific is suffering the highest impact with passenger traffic volume down by 24% for the first quarter of 2020 compared to the forecasted traffic levels sans COVID-19.

The aeronautical and commercial revenues of airport industry are under serious threat. Non-aeronautical revenues, which usually serve as an additional cushion during economic downturns, are not able to play that role due to the outbreak.

In this context, the airports must continue to be able to collect both aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenues from their users and end users.

Therefore, reduction of airport tax applied on a per passenger basis, consideration on a case-by-case basis to waive concession fees that the private airport operators had to correspond to government by concession agreements and exploring similar relief measures for publicly owned airports, were suggested.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/airports-council-bats-for-reduction-of-airport-tax/article31064346.ece

On Friday, SpiceJet entered into an agreement to lease with the wholly-owned subsidiary of GMR Hyderabad International Airport. This facility will be 33,000 sq ft initially, with a potential to expand to 100,000 sq ft, based on demand, a release from the airlines said.

Chairman and MD of SpiceJet Ajay Singh said that the agreement comes in the backdrop of expansion of SpiceXpress, the cargo arm.

305,2020/03/14,GMR group likely to operate Warangal airport soon,"The proposal requires State govt. to build infrastructure and GMR to operate it for 10 years

Infrastructure developer GMR which, through a joint venture, operates the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) in Hyderabad, one of the busiest such facilities in the country, may get to operate the Warangal airport soon, if a proposal under consideration is any indication.

Bidar model

“We are trying to work out a model based on the Bidar experience,” Airports Authority of India (AAI) Chairman Arvind Singh said on the sidelines of the Wings India 2020 event here on Friday.

Under the proposal that is being discussed, Telangana government will build the infrastructure for the airport in Warangal and GMR will get to operate it for 10 years. After 10 years, the property will revert to AAI, he said.

Earlier, Industries and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao, in the inaugural session, mentioned how all stakeholders had agreed to work to operationalise the Warangal airport soon, with an operating model similar, possibly, to the Bidar airport.

In the absence of such a collaborative stance, the Warangal airport plans may well remain on paper given the government, as part of the concession agreement of the Hyderabad International Airport, had agreed that no airport would be developed in a 150-km zone.

Mr. Singh said that Bidar also figures in 150-km zone and “all the stakeholder concerns [for an airport there] are taken care of. I think one of the ideas suggested but yet to be finalised is that the [Telangana] government builds the infrastructure and GMR operates it for 10 years and subsequently the property reverts to AAI.” The State government is keen to develop Warangal and a meeting on the airport there has been taken by the Civil Aviation secretary recently.

More funds

To other queries, he said the AAI is planning to spend ₹25,000 crore in five years on developing new airports, upgradation of existing airports and in the process of converting under-served and un-served airports under the UDAN scheme for which the Centre is giving funds.

The plan is to step up the annual expenditure from around ₹3,000-₹4,000 crore at present to ₹5,000 crore. In turn, this is expected to more than double the passenger handling capacities.

From 345 million passengers at present, the aim is to touch 700-750 million passengers by 2030. On the source of funding, Mr.Singh said AAI is a profit making company, has large cash surplus and is debt free. “We are earning revenues from the private airports that we have leased out. Delhi and Mumbai are giving us significant revenues,” he said.

The government of India also provided funds to it, for building smaller airports, under the UDAN scheme.

Apart from these, AAI is considering External Commercial Borrowing as such funds are comparatively cheaper to fund its capital expenditure plans. The AAI Board had approved the ECB proposal recently and the plan is to raise $300 million in the first tranche, he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/gmr-group-likely-to-operate-warangal-airport-soon/article31064314.ece
306,2020/03/14,Contribution of women in Indian blogosphere,"Book on gender, citizenship and identity out

Before social media, there were blogs. Blogs where people shared ideas, dreams, anecdotes, and issues like feminism broadcasting their world view.

Sumana Kasturi researched these blogs, logged a PhD and has now published a book on Gender, Citizenship, and Identity in the Indian Blogosphere. On Friday evening, Ms. Kasturi was in conversation with Usha Raman of the University of Hyderabad at the Golden Threshold in the city.

“Indian bloggers in the US were the earliest people to begin blogging. Blogs allowed users to write, use photos and share videos. But blogs were mostly textual. And they turned personal feelings into thoughts and became cultural artefacts and attracted me,” said Ms. Kasturi.

The book examines the role of women bloggers, some of them settled in the US, in Indian blogosphere. It explores how women used new media technologies to create online spaces that share knowledge, raise awareness, and build communities.

“The bloggers were engaged with issues such as feminism, gender, patriarchy and identity, without using those specific words,” she said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/contribution-of-women-in-indian-blogosphere/article31064301.ece

Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan has expressed concern that people tended to ignore warning signs of their poor health assuming that nothing will happen to them but it became a major problem for them subsequently.

Inaugurating the 42nd Indian Cooperative Oncology Network (ICON) conference here on Friday, the Governor said that in spite of great awareness created among citizens and availability of advanced technology, it was disheartening to note that the country faced many major health challenges with increase of non communicable and lifestyle diseases.

“Unfortunately we tend to ignore our health as well as warning signs, assuming that nothing will happen to us. When a small lump or unusual bleeding is allowed to fester, it has the ability to spread. A potentially curable disease quickly becomes difficult to treat or even incurable. This is the big healthcare problem facing us today,” she said.

308,2020/03/14,Dedicated lines for FASTag users on ORR from March 15,"Non-FASTag users may enter the 158-kilometre stretch through the Blue Coloured Lane only

Hyderabad Growth Corridor Limited has tightened the regulations pertaining to payment of toll through FASTags on ORR.

Through a press release, the HGCL has informed about dedicated lines for FASTag and non-FASTag commuters starting from March 15.

Accordingly, the non-FASTag users may enter the 158-kilometre stretch through the Blue Coloured Lane only, leaving the Orange Coloured Lane only for the FASTag users.

The decision has been taken after considering the delay caused to the FASTag users when they travel among the others, the note said.

The HGCL has also relaxed the rule pertaining to charging the non-FASTag users double the amount.

From April 2 onwards, the non-FASTag users will be charged double the toll amount if they enter Orange Coloured Lane instead of the Blue, the note informed.

Payment of toll through RFID based FASTag has been introduced by the central government to reduce long queues near toll gates. It was adopted by HGCL for ORR at the end of last year.

309,2020/03/14,Number of FOBs reduced to 38,"Sixteen foot over bridges will be equipped with escalators

The GHMC has brought down the number of foot over bridges (FOBs) to be constructed in the city based on a feasibility report, and the responsibility has been handed over to the maintenance wing.

Instead of the previously proposed 52, the corporation will now construct 38 FOBs at various locations in the city, to facilitate pedestrian crossing. The revision has received the stamp of approval from the government with a total project cost of ₹83 crore.

The decision was taken after a feasibility report from the University College of Engineering from where an expert has personally inspected all the 52 locations of the FOBs and eight locations for the sky walks. In the report, he recommended FOBs at 38 locations and sky walks at all the eight locations.

The expert, however, has not taken into account the Metro Rail stations close by which serve as FOBs with elevators and escalator facilities.

SRDP works

Decision to revise the number was taken after tenders were finalised, and officials attribute it to the ongoing SRDP works at various locations.

The FOBs have been divided into four packages and given to four different agencies.

Of the 38, ten will be constructed in L.B.Nagar zone, seven in Charminar, nine in Khairatabad and Secunderabad zones, and the remaining in Kukatpally and Serilingampally zones. Only 16 FOBs will be equipped with escalators.

“Escalators will be given based on the pedestrian traffic at the location. Purpose of escalator will not be served if the traffic is sparse,” said an official.

At quite a few places, the FOBs are not far from Metro Rail stations, leaving one baffled at selection of the location.

For instance, at Dilsukhnagar, a previous FOB was removed to facilitate construction of the Metro Rail. After the construction, flight of stairs on both sides of the Dilsukhnagar Metro Rail station served as pedestrian crossover, and HMR authorities have already announced that they may be used by anybody irrespective of whether or not they travel by Metro Rail.

However, GHMC has proposed another FOB just a few yards away, exactly at the same location from where it was previously removed.

Another FOB is proposed near Kothapet Fruit Market, near the same location where the Chaitanyapuri Metro Rail station exists.

Other locations where FOBs are closer to the Metro Rail stations include Habsiguda and Gandhi Hospital.

Delayed process

Construction of FOBs has been delayed enormously, and the responsibility has been shifted back and forth between GHMC and HMDA, before it was handed over to the projects wing of the GHMC, which finalised the tenders. After much delay, it has now been given to the maintenance wing.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/number-of-fobs-reduced-to-38/article31063692.ece
310,2020/03/14,Why are musicians uninterested in each other’s work?,"In the past few decades, I have not heard a single good word by a musician about a contemporary. And I have yet to see a musician attend the concert of another one

In academics, peer review is a common and accepted practice of judging and assessing new work. It is the evaluation of work by people with similar competencies to the producer of the work. This seems to be a fair and beneficial exercise — for both reviewers and reviewees. It seems, however, to be largely restricted to the world of medical, scientific and technical work.

In the performing and other arts, it seems to be largely absent — even in an informal sense. In literary circles, writers do invite and listen to or read peers reviewing or talking about their work, whether in print or at lit fests. But in the field of music, I have only always heard performers either dismissing their peers or ignoring them altogether; including in a city like Pune, where at times they have grown up and lived two lanes from one another!

It was not always this way, from what we gather about musicians of earlier times — when budding performers as well as established ones held all-day or all-night sessions to present their ongoing work, and were open to feedback, review, and exchanges.

Proudly aloof

But in the past few decades, I have not heard a single good word by a musician about a contemporary. And I have yet to see a musician attend the concert of another one. Sure, you will hear lots of fulsome praise and paeans to the old, dead and gone musicians. But ask a contemporary musician which peer’s music he or she listens to, and you will draw a blank. In fact, you will hear a proud “I don’t bother with all these people, I never go for music programmes.”

I am not making this up, but I have entered the homes of some performing musicians and heard something playing on their music system — and when I ask who it is, the answer is, “I am playing my own recordings.” It’s from their own recital on AIR or a U.S. trip, or Europe tour! At most, it may be a recording of their guru or a dear departed great. And no, they are not listening to figure out how they can improve — they are listening in rapt admiration of themselves. Talk about living in an echo chamber!

Recently, a moderately well-known, low-profile chef was invited by a painter to inaugurate his art show. Although a friend, she was surprised at his choice of ‘chief guest’. Why me? I am not an expert, or a collector, or an aficionado, or a critic, or an artist — not by a long chalk, she said. She felt a little foolish to show up and pose for pictures at an art exhibit, given that it was not her area of expertise or interest, and suggested a string of other more appropriate worthies. But the artist simply would not take no for an answer, and as he was booking her time months in advance, she couldn’t throw a ‘not-in-town’ excuse.

Peer snubbing

Only later did it dawn on her that this artist simply did not want to bestow this honour on anyone from his biradari — his peers and contemporaries. He had rarely or never attended or shared space with any of them, or said one good word about their work, and the best way to continue ignoring them all was to import someone from a completely unrelated field to declare his show open. Far from looking for peer review, this was an exercise in peer snubbing.

Rare are the musicians who go to one another’s recitals. Even if they are to perform on the same night at the same venue, one after the other, they usually find excuses to perform and immediately leave (on a jet plane, as the song goes).

A couple of years ago, it was remarkable and wonderful to see several of Sharad Sathe’s peers attend his performance in Mumbai. Legend has it that when Kumar Gandharva returned to singing after his long illness-related hiatus, Bhimsen Joshi went door-to-door on a bicycle, inviting people to come and listen to the re-emergence of a genius.

When I watch music talent shows — classical as well as contemporary music — on TV, it is heartening to see the really young competitors on stage enjoying and applauding each other’s performances. May their tribe grow.

The stepped up enforcement comes in the wake of only vehicles that conform to BS-VI pollution norms being considered fit for registration across India.

“Silencers play a major role in curtailing sound pollution and the emission of carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and sulphur which are harmful to human health. But two-wheeler riders often remove sophisticated and costly silencers and replace them with materials like pipes. This poses health hazards to people,” Mr. Ananthakrishnan said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/vehicles-with-modified-silencers-to-be-blacklisted/article31064384.ece
320,2020/03/14,Zakeer Hussain sees ‘mystery’ behind note,"CPI(M) Kalamasserry area secretary V.A. Zakeer Hussain has demanded a detailed probe into the death of party’s Thrikkakara local committee member V.A. Siyad and what he alleged as the ‘mystery’ surrounding the emergence of a note the deceased reportedly wrote before his death implicating three local party leaders, including him.

Addressing a press conference here on Friday, Mr. Hussain said that the whole controversy over the death was an attempt by the Congress to target the CPI(M) and shield the real culprits behind the scam involving diversion of money from the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund to ineligible beneficiaries.

“There should be a detailed inquiry into the death and the handwriting on the note should be verified. His call details during the last week before his death should also be thoroughly examined. We will petition the city police commissioner in this regard,” said Mr. Hussain.

Siyad, a board member of the Ayyanad Service Cooperative Bank, was found hanging at his home at Thrikkakara on Monday. It caused a stir as the bank had found itself in the middle of the scam after another member of its board was arraigned as accused in the case.

Mr. Hussain expressed doubts over how the note came to the possession of a local Congress leader.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/zakeer-hussain-sees-mystery-behind-note/article31064367.ece
321,2020/03/14,Land acquisition crucial to ensure smooth traffic post flyover opening,"Movement of vehicles on S.A. Road-Thripunithura stretch likely to be hit

The State government or the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will have to acquire land on the eastern side of the Vyttila flyover and carve out at least one more additional lane to ensure smooth flow of vehicles from the NH Bypass towards S.A. Road and Thripunithura, experts have said.

It is because only vehicles moving straight along the Edappally-Aroor NH Bypass, which together constitute approximately 50% of vehicles traversing the junction, will use the six-lane flyover. The rest will continue to depend on the road beneath the structure, which is slated for commissioning by June. They include vehicles taking a turn at the junction and those proceeding in the east-west direction (S.A. Road-Thripunithura stretch) and back, said a senior Public Works Department (PWD) official.

A senior department official explained how the government and the PWD ought to have planned the flyover better, making optimal use of the space available on the NH Bypass and service roads at the junction. “This could have been achieved if the flyover designers and other stakeholders had not insisted on a perfectly straight structure,” the official said. The net effect is that the flyover will choke the movement of vehicles all along the eastern (Thripunithura) side, where the width tapers down to less than five metres at many points. This is in contrast to the approximately three-lane (over 10 metres wide) space available on the western (S.A. Road) side, he added.

“The sole way out is to acquire land to open one more lane [with 3.5 metres width] on the eastern side,” said an expert who is associated with the flyover project. “Land acquisition will be minimal for the lane since there are reports that encroachers have set up shop well into the footpath of the NH Bypass at many places here. The bottleneck is acute in the vicinity of the temple on the southern side of the junction. Minimal land acquisition will also decongest the bell-mouth at the entry to the Vyttila Mobility Hub,” he observed.

The demand to widen roads on the eastern side of the flyover is relevant in view of the fact that approximately one lakh passenger car units (PCUs) use the junction daily. Only half of them will use the flyover, necessitating continued reliance on signal lights for traffic moving in different directions.

Proposals submitted to the government for clearing encroachments and acquiring land on the eastern side remain on paper, probably because the State is hard-pressed for funds.

The Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) should ideally set apart funds for the purpose and to kick-start the second-phase development work at the junction, which include an underpass linking S.A. Road and Vyttila-Thripunithura Road. Before this, road medians will have to be redone and the watch tower of the traffic police relocated to ensure smooth movement of vehicles at the junction, sources said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/qjtvb7/article31064360.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12-KI-VYTTILA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/land-acquisition-crucial-to-ensure-smooth-traffic-post-flyover-opening/article31064361.ece
322,2020/03/14,Emotions to the fore: Tennessee Williams’ ‘A Street Car Named Desire’ to be staged today,"Storyboard Productions presents Tennessee Williams’ A Street Car Named Desire this weekend

Theatre director Sandeep Tadi of Storyboard Productions heaved a sigh of relief when two Corona samples tested negative in Telangana. He now looks forward to bring the timeless English play A Street Car Named Desire this weekend. He says, “We discussed the Corona issue with artistes to check if they were okay to stage the play. They have worked so hard for it and are excited to present it.”

This is Storyboard’s sixth production and their fourth English play. “Collessium Productions’ Preksha Trivedi has the rights for this play. It didn’t work out for them and offered the rights to us.” One of Tennessee Williams’s best works, the play opened in Broadway in 1947 and revolves around Blanche DuBois who visits her sister Stella, who is married to Stanley Kowalski in New Orleans. “Their lives take an unexpected turn with the arrival of Blanche, and what ensues is a roller-coaster ride of emotions and pretences,” he adds.

Considering the play’s iconic status, Sandeep is a bit nervous but unfazed by the pressure. “I love the play for its characters; Everyone is a victim of circumstances. Our focus is to present it in a way that the audience understands every character’s perspective. Cultures might be different but our emotions are same. At the end of the day, if the audience are able to connect, our play has hit the right chord.”

Once the actors were selected from different theatre groups, a reading session was held at Sandeep’s house at Gachibowli and the rehearsals continued at Phoenix Arena. The artistes were asked not to change the accent but to focus on correct pronunciation. In fact, Storyboard’s first play Charlie’s Aunt was a Victorian era play. “Our English is good enough for the audience,” he smiles. Set and lighting designer Junaid Ullah conceptualised the set for the period drama and art director Suresh Mupoor executed it.

Sandeep started his career by joining Samahaara’s acting workshop and worked as a stage manager for three years with different theatre groups. In 2015, he founded Storyboard Productions along with theatre actor David Jonas and Harika Velaga David. The team has made short films and also a film for police commissionerate for their initiatives in the IT corridor. “Storyboard is for those with an interest in any art form; be it poetry, storytelling or painting. We tell stories through different medium,” he says and adds, “We were anxious with the Corona news but surprisingly there was a slight surge in our ticket sales which encouraged us to go ahead with our show.”

324,2020/03/14,Trinamool to support Independent candidate for Rajya Sabha seat,"The Rajya Sabha elections are scheduled on March 26.

The Trinamool Congress on Friday decided to the support an Independent candidate for the fifth Rajya Sabha seat from West Bengal.

Minutes before the nomination process was about to end, Dinesh Bajaj, a former Trinamool Congress MLA and a prominent businessman filed his nomination for the elections. The Left parties and the Congress have fielded Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya for the post.

Going by the present numbers of MLAs, West Bengal’s ruling party can easily get the desired support for four of its nominees. The Left and Congress are likely to ensure the victory of their lone candidate. However, over the past few years, there have been a number of defections from the ranks of the Opposition, when the MLAs have switched loyalties to join the ruling party.

Earlier in the day, two Trinamool nominees Mausam Benazir Noor and Arpita Ghosh filed their nomination papers. Two other Trinamool candidates Dinesh Trivedi and Subrata Bakshi and the Left-Congress nominee Mr. Bhattacharya filed their papers earlier this week.

325,2020/03/14,Many Cong. MLAs will join BJP: Assam Minister,"State Cong. chief rejects Sarma’s claim

The Opposition Congress in Assam could be affected by the Madhya Pradesh syndrome.

Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Friday said one of the 23 Congress MLAs would join the Bharatiya Janata Party in a day or two. Some more would follow, he said. “Rajdeep Gowala will join the BJP very soon,” he told journalists in the Assembly complex on a day when three candidates filed their nominations for the March 26 Rajya Sabha elections.

Mr. Gowala is a Congress MLA from Lakhipur in the Barak Valley. “There are many other Congress MLAs who are ready to join us,” Mr. Sarma said.

Congress State president Ripun Bora rejected the claim. “It is actually the other way round. BJP legislators are yearning to come to the Congress, given the public sentiment against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act,” he said. The secular parties have been working out a plan to stop the “communal” BJP from retaining power in 2021, he said.

Consensus candidate

Opposition leaders said the Congress and Maulana Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) had forged an “anti-BJP and anti-CAA” friendship by naming journalist and anti-CAA activist Ajit Kumar Bhuyan as their consensus candidate. Mr. Bhuyan filed his nomination on Friday, holding hands with Congress veteran and former Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi and Mr. Ajmal.

The other two who filed their papers were Bhubaneswar Kalita of the BJP and the incumbent Biswajit Daimary of the Bodoland People’s Front.

“The democratic forces have felt the need to come together to stop the communal virus from infecting the soul of this country. People are realising that there will be one draconian law after another if this government continues,” said Mr. Gogoi, who had been dismissive of the AIUDF and Mr. Ajmal during his 15-year rule from 2001 to 2016.

“We have come together for a greater good. We hope to continue this friendship,” Mr. Ajmal said.

Mr. Sarma found in Mr. Bhuyan’s nomination a stick to beat the Congress and the AIUDF with. “I extend my best wishes to those who have shown they took an anti-CAA stand only to be at the mercy of the AIUDF and Badruddin Ajmal,” he said.

The BJP often projects the AIUDF and Mr. Ajmal as “pro-Bangladeshi”.

The 126-member Assembly has an effective strength of 124 after the death of a legislator each of the BJP and the Congress. With 87 MLAs, the BJP and its allies — the BPF and the Asom Gana Parishad — expect to win two seats. The Congress and the AIUDF have 37 MLAs.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/gm8o5z/article31064698.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THHIMANTABISWASARMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/many-cong-mlas-will-join-bjp-assam-minister/article31064699.ece
326,2020/03/14,All tourism destinations in district to remain shut,"Service providers asked to report suspected COVID-19 infected travellers

In the wake of the COVID-19 threat, the entry of sightseers to all the major beach and eco-tourism destinations under the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) will be restricted from Saturday.

The support of the local police is likely to be sought to ensure proper surveillance as part of the preventive measures in place to fight the pandemic.

The restrictions will be applicable to the beaches at Butt Road, Kozhikode South, Kappad, Beypore, besides Kozhikode Beach, Vadakara sand banks, Sarovaram biopark and other eco-tourism spots at Thusharagiri, Peruvannamoozhi, Vayalada, Arippara and Nambikulam.

There has been a huge drop in the number of visitors to these destinations after the confirmation of COVID-19 cases in different parts of Kerala.

Several public events in these locations have already been cancelled to comply with the State-level precautionary measures to contain the viral disease.

Tourism Department officials also asked all the major tourism operators and accommodation providers to be watchful of the situation and immediately report in case they notice any suspected travellers.

Overpricing of masks

Acting on complaints related to the unfair price hike of face masks, a joint squad of civil supplies officers and rationing inspectors conducted surprise checks in various wholesale surgical shops and pharmacies in Vadakara. Show-cause notices were issued to some of the shops which were found overcharging for the masks.

Vadakara taluk supply officials who conducted the flash inspection, said there were complaints that some of the shops had even charged ₹20 for a mask which was earlier sold at ₹6. Some of the retailers defended their act with a claim that the wholesale price of the product had been increased by the sellers, they said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/9rj1eb/article31064237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13KI-SAROVARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/all-tourism-destinations-in-district-to-remain-shut/article31064238.ece

As many as 109 persons were brought under the suspected COVID-19 surveillance in the district on Friday.

With this, the total number of people under surveillance rose to 606. They include seven persons under hospital surveillance at the General Hospital and the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital (KMCH). Meanwhile, one person under surveillance in the isolation ward at KMCH was discharged.

Four new body fluid samples of suspected patients were sent for tests, District Medical Officer (DMO) V. Jayasree said in a press release. Informing that 68 samples had been sent for tests so far, she said the results of 61 samples were received, and that all of them were negative. The test results of the remaining seven samples were awaited, she added.

Health officials informed that the four persons under surveillance had been offered counselling through the mental health helpline.

A meeting of district-level programme officers chaired by the DMO reviewed block-level activities to combat COVID-19. It decided to open help desks at the Kozhikode railway station and the KSRTC bus station on Saturday. Through zoom video conferencing, the meeting also instructed health workers in 35 panchayats to intensify surveillance by preparing lists of people coming from infected regions and their contacts.

328,2020/03/14,Remains of suspected murder victim exhumed,"Forensic facial reconstruction to be done to identify victim

The Crime Branch (CB) squad on Friday exhumed the skeletal remains of a man who was suspected to have been murdered at Poloor near Parambil Bazaar in Kozhikode district nearly three years ago.

CB sources said the skull exhumed from a graveyard at West Hill would be used for forensic facial reconstruction to identify the victim.

Though the investigation team had reasons to believe that the victim was a Keralite, it can be confirmed only on receiving the facial reconstruction. It was on Thursday that the CB squad with the support of forensic experts started inspection at the graveyard for exhuming the remains.

Though a Mukkom native, who was earlier arrested on the charge of a twin murder, was suspected to be behind the incident, preliminary investigation could not find evidence to prove his role. The man had been interrogated several times by the Crime Branch squad.

It was in September 2017 that the charred body of a 40-year-old man was found in a bush. The body was reportedly burnt in such a way to prevent identification. An investigation by the local police had concluded that it was a case of strangulation. Though the police carried out a three-month-long probe, they could not zero in on any suspect or identify the body. According to CB sources, the probe team has a list of suspects, and one of them will be quizzed on completion of the facial reconstruction process. DNA sampling too will be required to confirm the identity of the victim, they said.

In Kozhikode district, the Crime Branch had adopted the DNA sampling method in cracking a twin murder case which took place nearly three years ago at Manassery in Mukkom. Birju, 53, who was accused of murdering his mother and another close aide who allegedly assisted him in the matricide, was nabbed after the Crime Branch formed a special squad.

The identification of Birju’s close aide was a challenge for the squad as his body was found in a decapitated state with severed limbs. The accused had abandoned the body parts in different locations to mislead investigators.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/n708z2/article31064120.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13KI-SKELETON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/remains-of-suspected-murder-victim-exhumed/article31064121.ece
329,2020/03/14,Health dept. on high alert after tracking travel history of COVID-19 patient,"Patient suspected to have come into contact with 26 persons

The Health Department on Friday intensified its surveillance and quarantine measures in Kozhikode district following the official confirmation that one of the newly confirmed COVID-19 patients had visited a hotel at Vaidyarangadi near Ramanattukara after his arrival at the Calicut international airport from Dubai on March 5.

The details of his visit to Malabar Plaza Hotel were confirmed by a rapid response team in collaboration with the police. They also checked the closed circuit television camera visuals at the hotel to garner details of those who had come into contact with the patient. Officials said he had spent around half-an-hour at the hotel, and those who were present there at that time would be contacted soon for adopting quarantine measures.

The rapid response team had found that there were 26 persons, including the hotel staff, at the hotel during the patient’s visit. All those who were present at the hotel from 11.45 p.m. to 12.45 a.m. have been asked to contact the district-level control room as part of the stringent quarantine measures. Health Department officials said the condition of the entire staff of the hotel would be closely monitored for action.

Meanwhile, an official communication from the collectorate said the person who was detected with COVID-19 was a Kannur native who was on board the Spice jet flight, SG54, from Dubai to Kozhikode. Those who took the same flight also have been asked to report to the District Control Room on 0495-2371002 or 2371471.

331,2020/03/14,Demand rife to establish maritime academy at Beypore,"Industry body promises to identify land and building for the project

The demand to open a maritime academy headquartered at Beypore to train young professionals in the field was placed before Kerala Maritime Board (KMB) Vice Chairperson Lida Jacob during her visit to the port on Friday to review the local developmental needs and port infrastructure.

Leaders of the Calicut Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCCI), who took up the demand with Ms. Jacob, said they would identify suitable land and building infrastructure if the KMB gave the green light for the project.

CCCI leaders said the academy could be opened in such a way that it facilitated the admission of at least 40 candidates. They also stressed the need for well-trained manpower for managing the academy, apart from a port advisory council for overall supervision.

During discussions, members of the port committee of the CCCI said it was high time the Beypore Port got a better transshipment connectivity to Sharjah. According to them, the Sharjah Airport International Free Zone authorities had promised their cooperation during their visit to Kozhikode for smoothening cargo movement from Sharjah/Dubai to Beypore and Colombo.

On behalf of the importer community, the port committee sought a revision of the existing incentive system for facilitating better container movement through seaports. It called for a revised incentive scheme to compensate the loss of vessel operators in Kerala.

The other demands placed before the KMB included opening of a dedicated wharf for container vessels, dredging of the existing wharf, reduction of port charges, and immediate formation of a statutory port advisory and management committee comprising people’s representatives.

CCCI functionaries said the request to ensure 24x7 work practice and standard operating procedure ensuring better cooperation from local labourers too was submitted to the KMB.

As a result, tension prevailed in and around the bus stand and bazaar areas. As a precautionary measure, shops downed shutters and buses were suspended from entering the bus stand and bazaar areas.

A large posse of police personnel were deployed.

Preliminary inquiries revealed that Arumugam (50) and his nephew Suresh (30) were murdered by a gang, which had come to an eatery outlet owned by Arumugam in two-wheelers around 7 p.m.

The gang attacked the duo with knives and aruvals, in which Suresh died on the spot, while Arumugam, who was rushed to the Tirunelveli GH, died on admission.

A senior police officer said that investigations revealed that the double murder appeared to be committed as a revenge crime. About two months ago, one Nambirajan was killed by an armed gang in Tirunelveli town after he had married a girl from other community. In that crime, one Chellathurai figured as a main accused. Chellaturai’s father was Arumugam and his aunt’s son happened to be Suresh, the police officer said.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Saturday announced that the State government had earmarked over ₹100 crore for various projects, including ₹58 crore, exclusively for laying roads and other facilities for Palani Municipality in Dindigul district.

The CM, who was in the city, to lay the foundation stone for the construction of a government medical college and hospital at Ayyanoothu, near here, on a sprawling 20 acres of land, said that the government would be happy to provide facilities to the devotees and tourists visiting the Palani Sri Dhandayuthapani Swami Temple.

Similar to the facilities available in Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam, the TN government would provide these in a phased manner for the famous shrine, which is visited by lakhs of people from many parts of TN and other States.

The long pending demand of laying good roads in and around the Palani temple would be fulfilled by the Highways department, Mr. Palaniswami said. In a nutshell, the municipality would get a facelift and be ready to receive the devotees with a number of facilities by next Thai Poosam celebrations, he said.

The CM also said that the TN government had earmarked CT scan facility at the Kodaikanal Government Hospital. Apart from this, the bus stand at Natham has been spruced up. As for the drinking water needs for the residents of Dindigul Corporation, a separate scheme has been prepared. A new Primary Health Centre has been opened at Ranganathapuram in Vedasandur block for the benefit of the people.

When the medical college begins functional from the next academic year, the people in the vicinity would benefit, as more number of doctors would be posted and patients need not travel long distance for treatment, he said.

Additional buildings for the Mother Teresa Women’s University in Kodaikanal would be provided at ₹8 crore and the government would be willing to redress the grievances, which could be submitted to the CM’s Special Cell, Mr. Palaniswami said.

334,2020/03/14,40-year-old tests negative for COVID-19,"Awareness programme held in Thoothukudi; importance of maintaining personal hygiene stressed

A 40-year-old man from Tirunelveli’s Pettai, who was admitted to the special isolation ward for COVID-19 at Tirunelveli Government Medical College Hospital, has tested negative for the disease.

The patient, who had returned from Malaysia, showed symptoms of COVID-19 including cold and cough. Upon testing, it was discovered that he instead had viral fever. Doctors at the hospital said that he is likely to be discharged soon.

Two days ago, a youngster who returned from Dubai to Kadaiyanallur showed similar symptoms. He too tested negative but will continue to be monitored for a month at home.

Dean of the Hospital, V. Ravichandran said that there was no need to panic as no one has been tested positive in the district.

Everyone who has exhibited symptoms like cough, cold, body pain and breathing difficulty have been kept in isolation, he said.

Meanwhile, senior police officers including Commissioner of Police, Tirunelveli City, Deepak M. Damor underwent a special medical check up at the hospital.

Awareness programme

Resident Medical Officer, Thoothukudi Government Medical College Hospital, J. Silas Jeyamani, said that students and staff members of Fisheries College and Research Institute, Thoothukudi, should definitely avoid public gatherings.

At the awareness programme organised by the National Service Scheme wing of the college, the doctor said that they should also avoid shaking hands, sneezing in public without closing their nose and spitting in public places. They must wash their hands with soap regularly and must report to officers at the Government Hospital if they have fever, he said.

335,2020/03/14,Late night food delivery options at restaurants on the rise,"Restaurants in Madurai are seeing an overall spurt in people dining out and ordering food late at night. With Tamil Nadu government permitting shops and commercial establishments employing over 10 people to stay open for 24 hours, restaurateurs say that they are starting to see some change in the regular mindset of people.

Proprietor of the Temple City hotel K.L. Kumar who has opened the city’s first 24*7 restaurant, says that though Madurai has carried the tag of ‘Thoonga Nagaram’ for years, there have been no fully-functional restaurants serving food beyond 11 p.m.

“Since our restaurant is located opposite the bus stand in Mattuthavani, there are a lot of customers who stop over for food at odd hours. The aim is to ensure that they have a dine-in option,” he says.

R. Manohar, who manages Bismi Biriyani, a popular take-away shop, says that there has been a tremendous rise in the number of late-night delivery options. They have even established a separate wing just to cater to their online deliveries.

“Although we close our orders by 12 a.m., there is a rush of orders between 10.30 p.m. and 11.30 p.m. We get at least 50 orders on weekdays. The numbers are definitely higher on weekends,” he says.

B. Muthumani, a delivery boy, says that currently food delivery apps close orders by 12 a.m. “But, in other metropolitan cities, including Chennai, orders are accepted till 3 a.m. So, if more restaurants are open late at night, then such an option can be extended in Madurai too,” he says.

A worker at Mukku Kadai K. Subbu restaurant says that their restaurant is quite crowded even till 1 a.m. At Dindigul Thalappakatti biriyani, food is served until 2 a.m., they say.

Despite this change, most restaurants, however, say that they are hesitant about opening shop all night. Mr. Manohar says that they have limited staff who need to come back early the next day to begin preparations for the next day’s sale.

“The number of staff tends to be unreliable. We cannot gamble,” he says.

A source from Mukku Kadai K. Subbu says that there is a drop in the number of clients who visit post 12.30 a.m. “There are very few people who really venture out too late. It is not part of the culture,” he says.

M.P. Murugappan, who helps run a registered push-cart stall near Mattuthavani’s fruit market, says that those who are used to the late night culture are vendors, labourers and truck drivers who stop and eat at pushcarts.

This is the same case near Simmakkal and Arapalayam too and adds that it is the pride of the city but is not preferred by many. “Most places do not have tables or a sit-down option. We also just serve basic tiffin items. The number of dishes is limited,” he says.

Mr. Kumar agrees and says that it is time for people to make use of options and for more restaurants to open up so that trust is built both ways.

“Only if more restaurants open, can more people venture out. Only if more venture out, will the streets become safer and normal. It works both ways,” he says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/2tsyat/article31070079.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA15CITY-HOTEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/late-night-food-delivery-options-at-restaurants-on-the-rise/article31070080.ece

A nine-year-old girl from Sellur who complained of abuse was rescued from her family here on Friday after her relatives placed a call to Childline.

A relative said that the girl had rushed to their house located a kilometre away from her own, crying and complaining of being beaten.

“Her hair was pulled out, she was beaten and tortured over three months by her mother who had illegal contacts with her male friends. The child told us that she would run away if she was forced to return to her house. That was when we called 1098, the Childline helpline,” he said.

337,2020/03/14,Need for a vocational training centre for special children,"Madurai

There is a need for a vocational training centre in every district for children with special needs, say their parents.

“This facility must have a conducive environment and must also accommodate the parents too as these children constantly need their support. Vocational training acts as a means of relaxation for the special children,” said A. Chandrasekar, Managing Trustee of Madurai Group Living Foundation (MGLF), a federation of parents of special children.

He was speaking during a discussion held at Special Needs Park on Alagarkoil Road on Saturday, where parents of special children discussed the challenges they faced in raising their children and the need for government interventions as part of International Women’s Day celebrations.

The parents also stressed that there was a need for a separate government policy focussing on the rehabilitation of special children.

A.S.P. Aruna Devi, a parent who also runs Arivagam Special School, says that the government must identify special children under a separate category and must not club them with the differently-abled.

Children with special needs include those with mental retardation, Autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, down syndrome and multiple disabilities. “The differentiation is important as each kid has different therapeutic needs ,” she said.

Another parent, J. Ariyamala, said that creating awareness of special children and educating parents is important.

“Recognition of autistic children at a young age is important as providing therapy at an earlier stage can benefit the children. Usually, the most difficult part is when parents do not accept that their children are special. Hence, it is important to educate them,” she said.

The social stigma is usually higher when the special child is a girl, said N.M.H. Kalaivani, a parent.

“Also, girl children with special needs require more support and care, especially after puberty. Hence, there is a need for a change in the mindset among the people,” she said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/need-for-a-vocational-training-centre-for-special-children/article31069375.ece
338,2020/03/14,Pachchanady residents want allgarbage processed on daily basis,"While expressing the urgent need to clear waste dumped at Mangaluru City Corporation’s landfill site at Pachchanady since long, a section of residents near Pachchanady have urged the corporation to take action for daily processing of garbage brought to the site.

“We want zero waste at the site. The corporation should clear the waste dumped over years through bio-mining. Waste generated every day should be totally processed on daily basis,” said M.G. Hegde, convenor of the newly formed Pachchanady Hagu Ghanatyajya Bhaadita Itare Pradeshagala Samrakshana Samiti, here on Thursday.

Addressing presspersons, Mr. Hegde said that a proposal to construct a retaining wall at the landfill site at a cost of ₹ 4 crore will not serve any purpose.

“With heavy rain, this retaining wall cannot prevent another garbage slip. The leachete from the accumulated waste at the landfill site has polluted open wells and other water bodies,” he said.

Laurence D’Souza, a member of the samiti, said that enough representations have been given to the corporation and elected representatives to clear waste from the landfill site. “There are technologies available for bio-mining and other modes for processing the accumulated waste. The corporation should make transparent the process of selection of agencies for disposal of waste at the landfill site,” he said.

Sister Veronica, another member of Samiti, said apart from Mandara, which was severely affected following the garbage slip in August last year, residents of Thiruvail, Devarapadavu and Shaktinagar were facing hardship because of the landfill site.

“When the corporation is increasing solid waste management cess, we want it to effectively process the waste,” she said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/pachchanady-residents-want-allgarbage-processed-on-daily-basis/article31066772.ece
339,2020/03/14,‘Adopt modern practices for good income ’,"Deputy Commissioner Sindhu B. Rupesh on Friday asked cashew growers to earn good income by following modern cultivation practices.

She was speaking at the Cashew Day celebrations organised by the Directorate of Cashew Research in Puttur.

The Deputy Commissioner distributed agricultural implements to select farmers from Scheduled Castes on the occasion. She said that the initiative will help improve the livelihood of farmers from the community.

The directorate also observed the Constitution Day on Friday.

Speaking on the occasion, Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer R. Selvamani focussed on Article 3 of the Constitution which emphasised on the duties of citizens. One should respect the national flag, the national anthem and freedom fighters. Equality in all walks of life should be maintained and environment should be protected, he said.

Mr. Selvamani gave detailed information on the benefits given from the government to farmers, on crop insurance and cashew processing at the gram panchayat level. Crop insurance is only available for paddy, arecanut and pepper in the district.

He said that establishing cashew farmers co-operative society and the enhancement of the value of cashew apple through self-help groups would help solve most of the problems of the farmers.

In all, four publications related to cashew crop management, inter-cropping and fruit processing were released.

The theme of the Cashew Day was “Empowerment of Scheduled Castes community through SCSP programmes”. The directorate also organised a visit for farmers to its plantation.

340,2020/03/14,Demo on slacklining on St. Mary’s Island,"It will become a permanent featureon the island next month

A demonstration-workshop on slacklining was held on the St. Mary’s Island about six kilometres off Malpe beach here on Friday.

The demonstration and workshop was organised by the Malpe Development Committee in association with the Slack Mitra Team. It was held from noon to 4 p.m. In a slacklining, a flat rope is tied between two anchors and a person walks or does tricks while walking on the rope from one end to the other end balancing himself all the way.

As many as 10 youth got trained at the demonstration-workshop. While one rope was tied about a feet above the ground between two coconut trees on the island and the distance between the two trees was 10 metres, another rope was tied five feet above ground between two coconut trees and the distance between the trees was 15 metres.

A third rope was tied about five feet above the ground between two coconut trees (40 metres long). The youth were first trained here. Then, they were given training on a rope tied between two boulders on the beach about six feet over the sea.

Sudhesh Shetty of the Malpe Development Committee said that the crew or trainers who participated in the demonstration-workshop included Navin Devnani Torres, Adhwaith Manohar, Kshitij Mittal and Vinay Tataria. “Slacklining is one of the most up and coming adventure sports internationally and it is growing in the country,” he said

He said that a large number of people in big cities, including Bengaluru and Pune, were interested in slacklining. “Besides they would be more interested if it was being held on a beach or an island. The challenge is to retain balance while walking on the rope,” Mr. Shetty said.

Bouyed by the response to slacklining on Friday, the team and the committee would be holding such training workshops permanently from the third week of April.

“Our objective in conducting slacklining here is to promote St. Mary’s Island, a geological monument, as a major tourist and adventure sports destination,” Mr. Shetty said.

341,2020/03/14,Nalin Kumar Kateel takes up Karwar train cancellation issue in Lok Sabha,"The Member of Parliament urges the Railway Ministry to reintroduce the popular service

Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel on Thursday urged the Railway Ministry to immediately reintroduce the Bengaluru-Karwar overnight express that was cancelled while introducing a new dedicated train between Bengaluru and Karwar.

Participating in a discussion on the demands for grants of the Ministry in the Lok Sabha, Mr. Kateel thanked the Railways for introducing the new train, Train Nos 16595/16596.

The new train would help people in coastal Karnataka immensely as the departure and arrival timings of the service were very convenient.

However, the MP said, the Railway Ministry, while introducing the new train, cancelled two existing services — Train Nos 16513/16514 Bengaluru-Karwar-Bengaluru via Kunigal (four days a week) and Train Nos 16523/16524 Bengaluru-Karwar-Bengaluru via Mysuru (tri-weekly). These services were highly patronised between Karwar-Mangaluru and Mangaluru-Bengaluru since inception and their cancellation has severely affected the travelling public, including the working classes, students and traders, he said.

Mr. Kateel said that the cancelled services had been catering to the needs of the public in the region for the last eight years. Withdrawing the popular service at this juncture was not at all reasonable when more and more people were travelling by trains.

Besides snapping connectivity with Bengaluru and Mysuru regions, the cancellation has deprived the public of convenient connectivity between Karwar and Mangaluru during the morning and evening hours.

As such, the MP urged the Ministry to review its decision of cancellation and reintroduce the trains to maintain connectivity via Mangaluru Central.

The Ministry while announcing the new Bengaluru-Karwar train on March 6 had announced the cancellation of the existing overnight express much to the dismay of the travelling public.

Rail activists had alleged that the Ministry took the decision bypassing its own cancellation policy on the insistence of Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd.

The corporation had reportedly said that the introduction of the new train would affect goods traffic thereby causing revenue loss and sought the cancellation of the existing trains to make good the loss.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/exr2t0/article31064667.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14MNTRAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/nalin-kumar-kateel-takes-up-karwar-train-cancellation-issue-in-lok-sabha/article31064668.ece
342,2020/03/14,GST on mobile phones hiked to 18%,"Infosys told to improve GSTN design by July

Mobile phones are likely to get costlier, with the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council on Saturday deciding to increase the rate on mobile phones and specific parts to 18% from the current 12%, from April 1.

Also read: Don’t hike GST on mobiles, govt. urged

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the decision was taken not to increase the prices but to correct the inverted structure of duty on some products wherein the rate of tax paid on inputs purchased is more than the rate of tax on finished products on outward supplies.

“There was a presentation by the Fitment Committee to look at the problem of inverted tax structure...,” the Minister said.

Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman at India Cellular & Electronics Association, said the move to increase GST by 6% would be detrimental to the vision of Digital India. “Consumption will be stymied and our domestic consumption target of ₹6 lakh crores by 2025 will fall short by at least ₹2 lakh crores,” he said.

In a letter to the Finance Minister earlier this week, Mr. Mahindroo said that instead of rationalising the GST on components and inputs, the “bizzare” move to increase the rate on the final product was not in the interest of consumers as well as the industry.

Also read: GST on cellphones, fertilizers, man-made fabrics, garments may be hiked to 18%

On the calibration of rates for other items where similar problems arise, such as footwear, textiles and fertilizers, Ms. Sitharaman said that after a detailed discussion it was decided to take up the matter at future meetings.

The GST rate on maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services in respect of aircraft has been reduced from 18% to 5% with a full input tax credit. “This change is likely to assist in setting up of MRO services in India,” she said at a press conference after the meeting.

On the glitches in the GST Network (GSTN), the backbone of the GST system built and managed by Infosys, the Minister said the company had been given a deadline of July 31, 2020, to implement all the initiatives discussed for the smooth running of the system, instead of the January, 2021 deadline sought by Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani. Mr. Nilekani also made a presentation before the Council on addressing the issues.

344,2020/03/14,Deadline to submit AI bids is April 30,"The government had allowed access to the virtual data room of Air India to interested bidders late in February and allowed them further time till March 6 for queries

The government on Friday extended the deadline for submitting bids for buying 100% stake in Air India, till April 30. The deadline was originally set for March 17.

The government had allowed access to the virtual data room of Air India to interested bidders late in February and allowed them further time till March 6 for queries.

A Ministerial panel led by Home Minister Amit Shah decided on extending the deadline for submission of expression of interest till April 30. While extending the date, The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) said in a notification that the changes were in view of requests by interested bidders and the prevailing situation arising out of the spread of COVID-19.

In January, the government restarted the divestment process of Air India and invited bids for selling 100 per cent of its equity in the state-owned airline, including Air India’s 100 per cent shareholding in AI Express Ltd and 50 per cent in Air India SATS Airport Services Private Ltd.

The government had on January 27 issued the preliminary information memorandum (PIM) inviting EoI for sale of 100 per cent stake in Air India.

On February 21, it issued the first set of clarification answering queries regarding the ‘confidentiality undertaking’

Interested bidders for Air India should have a net worth of Rs 3,500 crore.

After its unsuccessful bid to sell Air India in 2018, the government this time has decided to offload its entire stake. In 2018, the government had offered to sell its 76 per cent stake in the airline.

Of the total debt of Rs 60,074 crore as of March 31, 2019, the buyer would be required to absorb Rs 23,286.5 crore, while the rest would be transferred to Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL), the special purpose vehicle.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/deadline-to-submit-ai-bids-is-april-30-to-bid-for-air-india-till-april-30/article31065145.ece
345,2020/03/14,Temples of critical thinking and debate,"To be among the best in the world, Indian universities must be freed from excessive interference and politicisation

In the recent subject-wise ranking of world universities by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), Indian institutions improved with 26 departments or schools placed in the top 100 of their respective disciplines. Science, technology and business studies were the fields in which our universities showed their mettle. While this is a reason to celebrate, not even a single Indian university features in the QS ranking of the world’s top 150 in overall parameters. The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) of Bombay and Delhi are at the 152nd and 182nd places in the overall rankings, while IISc Bangalore appears at the 184th position. There is much for India to learn from those who are miles ahead of us.

QS’s top 10 in overall terms include five American universities (MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Caltech and Chicago), four British universities (Oxford, Cambridge, UCL and Imperial College) and one Swiss university (ETH Zurich). All the five American names in this list are private universities, while the British and Swiss institutions are public universities which have nonetheless enjoyed significant autonomy from governmental control over decades.

One common factor behind the success of the topmost universities is the freedom with which they operate. They have been major centres of innovation in teaching and research thanks to independence from bureaucratic or corporate meddling and political intervention by parties of the day. They could remain centres of extraordinary excellence in a sustained way by according primacy to matters of the mind, i.e. intellectual ideas and solutions to problems, and avoiding becoming hostage to dogmatic thought.

Pluralistic centres

All the great universities of the world are ideologically pluralistic, with a mix of right, left and centre among their faculty and students. There is no institutional line or official position on any issue. Professors and students are free to choose whatever opinion they prefer. No one is penalised for holding a pro- or anti- view on social, economic, political, cultural or scientific matters.

The top universities are also excellent at attracting and retaining talent. They hire professors very selectively, based on outstanding scholarly abilities. They reject a large number of candidates for admission as students, and admit only the brightest and the most meritorious. This ruthless streak comes at the expense of social inclusion and access considerations, but some institutions must be allowed to generate knowledge as an end in itself so that they reach the summit of intellectual endeavour. Top universities incentivise publication and citation of research in an unforgivingly rigorous way. If an Assistant Professor does not produce brilliant publications in the most reputed journals of her field, she may lose her job and not get tenured as an Associate Professor. By insisting on tough standards which are never lowered or relaxed, these universities promote a meritocratic culture as a habit.

Big universities also inculcate critical thinking, debating and writing abilities in their students. They encourage students to look at issues through interdisciplinary lenses and to challenge their own professors. They award grades to students who are argumentative and who question conventional wisdom in the classroom and in assignments. This type of interactive pedagogy produces champion graduates who have a reputation for cutting-edge skills and knowledge in the job market compared to peers from second- or third-tier universities.

The world’s best universities are known for involving their own alumni in governance and reforms. Top global universities are also super-smart financial managers. Many of them, especially the U.S. universities, have sophisticated alumni offices through which they raise funding, which can exceed the revenue from student tuition fees. By 2019, the total endowment of Harvard was worth $40 billion, which is made up of over 13,000 individual funds. Harvard invests this money in a variety of financial instruments and generates phenomenal income from it.

Since the top Anglo-American universities go back centuries, it is arguable whether such type of elite institutions can be quickly and easily replicated outside the U.S. and the U.K. These big universities are products of historical circumstances which relied on private philanthropy, colonial plunder or governmental subsidies to reach the level they are at today.

The China example

Still, a muscular push from the government of China with massive state funding has propelled Chinese universities into the top tiers in barely two decades. In the QS world rankings on overall basis, Tsinghua University is ranked number 16, Peking University is at 22, Fudan University is at 40, and Zhejiang University is at 54. This is a miraculous leap forward.

In India, as the government is cash-strapped and lacks the kind of resources which the Chinese state deployed to pump-prime Chinese universities, our only viable path to world class universities is in the form of enlightened private philanthropy and borrowing best practices from established iconic universities.

Avoiding politicisation, ideological rigidity and nepotism, and freeing our universities from excessive interference and over-regulation, are prerequisites for success. Most importantly, our universities must have the drive to excel and compete with Chinese or Western universities. Insularity and self-congratulatory frog-in-the-well attitudes have held us back for long.

Ingrained mediocrity and laid-back culture which result in inadequate training of students in theories and methodologies have to be overcome. A nationalistic passion for India to be recognised as a top educational hub must underpin the strategies and activities of our universities.

The government’s decision to identify 20 Institutes of Eminence (IOEs) which will get maximum autonomy from bureaucracy in order to climb up the world rankings is a step in the right direction. The selected IOEs must innovate with new degree programmes, expanded variety of faculty members and digital learning platforms.

India has miles to go in higher education. Unlike in authoritarian and top-down China, there is little likelihood of a meteoric breakout of multiple Indian universities into the top 100 of the world at a rapid clip. India’s democratic and contested character renders change evolutionary and cumulative. Still, with long-term vision and selfless leadership, our universities can eventually make it.

346,2020/03/14,People over profit: On IPL and coronavirus,"Commercial interest should not be allowed to override efforts to deal with the pandemic

Sports and celebrations are the antithesis of social distancing, far from the optimum degree of remoteness required between individuals and between social groups in the time of a pandemic. As COVID-19 takes hold, spreading first from China to other parts of Asia, and then to Europe and the Americas, crowds and spectacle pose a real threat to public health and well-being. Runners sprinting full tilt despite overworked limbs and bowlers stretching every muscle are all part of sporting lore that feeds the ‘toughness myth’ of athletes. Yet, whatever the immunity innate to sportspersons, it offers no guaranteed protection against a malevolent virus. But what is at stake now goes beyond sport and festivities. Fans trooping into massive stadiums, cheering and swapping high-fives, devotees gathering at places of worship, lost to the world in their prayers, shoppers and movie-goers at malls, travellers passing through airports and railway stations, all are at risk in this situation. Ideally, sport’s grand theatre and the coming together of people in public spaces should be cause for joy; but with the grim march of COVID-19, triggering cough, fever and in extreme cases putting lives in peril, social distancing and cancellation of public events are necessary. Quite rightly, sports administrators globally have called off tournaments or kept spectators away. But in India, where the Indian Premier League (IPL) is as intrinsic to its summers as mangoes, speculation lingered about its earlier schedule of a March 29 start. Thankfully, better sense prevailed within the BCCI and the Twenty20 bash was postponed.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

True, the BCCI’s hand was forced after the Sports Ministry’s missive about staging events without an audience and the government’s refusal of visas to foreigners till April 15. The IPL is a domestic tournament with an international flavour that needed both the heft of a vociferous crowd and the brand equity of overseas stars. With the twin facets ruled out for the time being, the Board had to take a stand and it made a virtue of a necessity. The IPL, if it had adhered to its original dates, would have been a strain on the overworked health sector. Fans, even if they are prevented from entering venues, would have thronged team hotels. The innumerable flights that the eight squads take to different cities could only have made the cricketers even more vulnerable. However, the situation is still fluid and it all depends on how the pandemic shapes up in the coming weeks. A Ministry of Health and Family Welfare note emphatically states that mass gatherings ‘should be avoided or possibly postponed till the disease spread is contained’. Valued at ₹47,500 crore, the IPL brand is a huge money-spinner but the citizens’ health and welfare must take precedence. Public interest should always trump profit mindedness.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/people-over-profit-the-hindu-editorial-on-ipl-and-coronavirus/article31062870.ece
347,2020/03/14,Dominion over territory: On UTs and Lieutenant Governors,"Verdict shows both potential for conflict and its resolution lie in the constitutional scheme

The verdict by a Division Bench of the Madras High Court on the respective roles of the elected regime in Puducherry and the Administrator appointed by the President underscores both the inherent potential for conflict in the governance scheme for Union Territories and the manner in which it can be resolved. The Bench has done well to say that its role is not to lay down who has residual control — whether it is the Council of Ministers or the Administrator — but to stress the existing legal framework under which their powers are defined. The Bench has set aside a single judge’s 2019 order that the Lieutenant-Governor should not interfere in the day-to-day administration of Puducherry. To this extent, it is a shot in the arm for L-G Kiran Bedi, but it also contains a note of caution against the Centre going beyond its constitutional limitations. An interesting facet of the case is that both last year’s judgment by Justice R. Mahadevan, and the one overruling it by a Bench comprising Chief Justice A.P. Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad, rely on the exposition of the law by the Supreme Court in relation to the National Capital Territory of Delhi. The apex court had emphasised on the need for constitutional morality and constitutional trust among high dignitaries, implying that Lt. Governors and Chief Ministers must work in unison as far as possible. In the event of an unresolved difference of opinion, the L-G should refer it to the President for a decision.

The main ground on which the single judge’s verdict has been set aside is that it was based on an inappropriate parallel sought to be drawn between a ‘Union Territory’ and a ‘State’. If the matter goes on appeal to the Supreme Court, it may be worth examining whether the single judge relied solely on this parallel. Much of his verdict drew upon the spirit of the Supreme Court’s views on the conflict between the Chief Minister and L-G of Delhi. Whether the precedent on the limits of the Delhi L-G’s powers would apply to the Puducherry Administrator was a question that was raised even then. After all, it is acknowledged that the status of NCT is sui generis. However, the elements of conflict and discord are common to Union Territories with elected legislatures. Hence, the principle that constitutional functionaries should avoid daily clashes, with the Centre using its primacy to resolve disputes, does commend itself. In that sense, the single judge was not wrong in holding that the Administrator is bound by the “aid and advice” clause, and that the power to refer any matter to the President should not mean “every matter”. The main issue remains whether the notion of representative government should get greater credence even in a territory designated as belonging to the Union.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dominion-over-territory-the-hindu-editorial-on-role-of-lieutenant-governors-and-elected-governments/article31062937.ece
348,2020/03/14,COVID-19 | IT companies told to allow staff to work from home,"Following reports that some IT companies are yet to allow their employees to “work from home” despite an advisory from the government, Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said another “strict” advisory will be issued to the companies.

“Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has already issued a strict advisory to the companies to allow ‘work from home’ facility to their employees as it is not advisable for employees to work in closed air-conditioned atmosphere. If any company is not following the advisory, we will talk to them and issue another ‘strict’ advisory,” the Minister said.

He said the companies should realise that in this scenario, there is a need to adopt a cohesive approach. “If IT companies do not understand the gravity of the situation, who else will in the context that most of the positive cases are among IT employees,” he said.

On Saturday, an orientation programme was held for medical college staff regarding COVID-19 infection prevention and control protocols and surveillance activities to support the health department.

IT/BT Minister’s appeal

Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, who is also the Minister for IT/BT has also urged technology companies to make arrangements for their employees to work from home. The Department of Telecommunications has relaxed certain norms for Other Service Providers so that people can work from home.

“With these facilities, it now becomes easier for the industry to provide business continuity. We urge companies to encourage more and more employees to work from home to help decongest the workplace and strengthen Karnataka government’s concerted efforts for containment of COVID-19,” said the minister in a press release.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/it-companies-told-to-allow-staff-to-work-from-home/article31070501.ece
349,2020/03/14,COVID-19 | Devotees keep away from places of worship,"Temples, churches, mosques taking precautionary steps

In times of crises, it’s not uncommon for people to turn to religion for comfort. In Bengaluru, people may be choosing to pray at home as several places of worship have recorded a decline in the number of devotees over the last week.

On their part, temple trusts, mosque committees and the archdiocese of Bengaluru as well as churches from different denominations have been taking measures to ensure that their premises are clean and in compliance with the norms fixed by the government.

Big temples in the city, such as Sri Krishna Temple managed by ISKCON, and Venkateshwara Temple managed by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, have reported a marked decrease in the number of devotees coming in.

According to P. Gopinath from TTD, every Saturday, nearly 6,000 people visit the temple. “However, yesterday (March 14), there were just 2,000 visitors. As a precautionary measure, the temples have intensified cleaning activities.

An ISKCON representative told The Hindu that hand wash facilities have been made. Other temples have stopped distributing ‘prasad’ and ‘teerta’ to devotees.

Several mosques and prayer halls in the city have also taken similar precautions. Maqsood Imran, Maulvi, Jamia Mosque, and member of Moon Committee, told The Hindu that Islam insists on ‘Wadoo’ before prayers five times a day. “While doing ‘Wadoo’, one has to clean one’s face, hands and feet. This helps to keep infections at bay,” he said, but added that footfalls to the prayer halls had not seen much of a drop.

A portion of the sermons are devoted to creating awareness about COVID-19.

With Lent season on, many churches in the city have also put in place some restrictions. Instructing churches to constitute ‘Health teams’, Archbishop Peter Machado, who is also the president of Karnataka Region Catholic Bishops’ Council, said attention should be given to emptying and cleaning holy water fonts regularly.

Communion during mass should be given on the hand, rather than on the tongue, a practice that is already being followed by a few churches. That apart, people have been advised not to kiss the crucifix during Good Friday or the Bishop’s ring.

However, some churches have announced that there will be no services till end of March.

Deputy Commissioner (Bengaluru Urban) G.N. Shivamurthy has issued an order prohibiting any jathre and santhe (village fairs) or any event that will attract many people. It is the season of village fairs in many areas on the city's outskirts, such as Varthur, Ramagondanahalli, Byatarayanapura.

350,2020/03/14,"COVID-19 | Drastic fall in visitors to Lalbagh, Cubbon Park","Bannerghatta Biological Park closed to public from today

The start of the weekend saw a dramatic drop in the number of visitors to Lalbagh Botanical Garden and Cubbon Park. “Though we did not impose any restrictions on the entry, we estimate that footfall has reduced by at least 50% to 60%,” said Horticulture Department officials.

Many families, who would otherwise visit the parks with their children, exercised caution and remained at home. G. Kusuma, Deputy Director of Cubbon Park, said they have been recording a fall in visitors over the last few days. “As a precautionary measure, we have taken several steps. Programmes usually conducted on Sundays at Cubbon Park have been cancelled,” he said. On weekends, the park usually sees 20,000 visitors, but on Saturday it was less than half.

Chandrashekar M.R., Deputy Director of Lalbagh, pegged the number of people at around 1,000 a day when the usual average was 5,000 to 6,000. “It has also impacted our ticket revenue,” he said.

The few people who ventured into the parks said they had never seen them so empty on a weekend. “On Saturday, malls and other places were closed so we decided to go to Lalbagh. Usually on weekends, there would be a queue at the ticket counter, but that was not the case this time,” said Sumanth, a resident in the area.

At the entry gates, security personnel deployed by the Horticulture Department were seen instructing visitors to wear masks and not to go in groups. The few morning walkers and joggers, too, were instructed not to move in groups or be in close proximity to each other.

Infosys on Friday announced that it had evacuated employees from its satellite campus at Electronics City Phase 11 as a precautionary measure after one of its employees had been in contact with an outsider who is a COVID-19 suspect case. “This is to ensure the safety of our employees and undertake a comprehensive disinfection exercise at our facility. Employees have been told to work from home,” said a spokesperson.

To curb the spread of COVID-19, all malls, cinema halls, pubs, exhibitions and summer camps in Bengaluru will be closed for a period of one week starting from March 14, 2020.

Briefing the media after a meeting with several departments, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa stated that even colleges and universities will be closed. He said that all IT professionals and those working in AC rooms will also be advised to work from home. He said that all wedding functions and sport activities will also have to be cancelled.

The Chief Minister advised all residents should stay at home and be safe.

354,2020/03/14,Court pulls up govt. over BBMP wards,"It has been told to submit final list of wards after delimitation to SEC by April 1

The High Court of Karnataka on Friday cautioned the State government that it may have to impose “heavy cost” if the government failed to submit to the State Election Commission (SEC) by April 1 the final list of wards after completing the delimitation process and the list of reservation of wards of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike.

We may have to direct the State government to pay a cost of ₹5 lakh per day for every day’s delay from April 1 for submitting the final list of the wards after delimitation and the list of reservation, a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S Kinagi made this observation during the hearing of a PIL petition, filed by the SEC.

The commission has sought direction to the government to submit the list of wards and reservation of wards at the earliest for timely conduct of election to the BBMP before the term of its council expires on September 10.

Noting that the SEC needs times of four months to finalise the elector list based on ward delimitation, and one month for completing the election process, the Bench observed that the SEC needs five months, from April 1 to August 30, to complete its constitutional obligations. Hence, the Bench said, the government must complete both the delimitation of wards and the reservation of wards by April 1.

While giving one more opportunity to the government to give time schedule for completing the process, the Bench adjourned further hearing till next week.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/court-pulls-up-govt-over-bbmp-wards/article31063829.ece

A State Legislature Committee on Local Bodies and Panchayat Raj has come down heavily on the functioning of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) and their officials for their “carelessness in safeguarding and rejuvenating lakes” that come under the jurisdiction of the Urban Development Department.

A 23-page report tabled in the Legislative Assembly on Friday by committee chairman Araga Jnanedra of the BJP has said that laxity on part of the BBMP and BDA officials led to encroachment of lakebeds/lands and severe pollution of waterbodies in and around the city.

Tahsildars had failed to execute the Karnataka Land Grabbing and Prohibition Act, 2011, and take action against private firms, real estate developers and private people from grabbing lakebeds. Despite frequent orders from National Green Tribunal (NGT), High Court of Karnataka, and Karnataka Lokayukta, the executing agencies have failed to crackdown on land grabbers under the existing laws, the committee said.

The panel members held 15 meetings and visited lakes around Bengaluru city and noted that there are 211 lakes in the BBMP limits and of them, the city’s civic agency manages 167 lakes. While BDA manages 33 lakes, Forest Department manages 9, and BMRCL 3. A total of 19 lakes have become defunct or non-use.

Sewage water

It said that many lakes were polluted following release of sewage water into waterbodies. It suggested the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board to take action against residential complexes that release water into lakes. It recommended the government to rope in NGOs and private people for development of lakes. The panel said installation of Sewerage Treatment Plants should be made mandatory in all residential complexes.

Hulimavu lake

A total of 22 acres of Hulimavu lake has been encroached by the government agencies. It found that 1.11 acres and 1.16 acres of Siddapura and Ibbur lakes have been encroached, respectively.

It said a coordinated action from the Police, Revenue Departments and the BBMP was required to check illegal encroachment of government lands and lakes. It also suggested an appointment of a lawyer for expediting pending cases in various courts.

364,2020/03/14,"On Hyderabad-Chennai Air India flight, passengers contend with stench","Crew told the passengers that the aircraft had flown with a large consignment of fish in the cargo hold earlier in the day

For passengers flying the national carrier Air India, the differences it highlights against the competition are more baggage allowance and legroom and a complete meal experience. And on Friday, March 13, the 138 passengers on board its Hyderabad-Chennai flight (AI 546) got all these and more. As one of them remarked, the airline was indeed living up to its marketing tagline, “A feeling called India”.

The experience began shortly after boarding commenced at Shamshabad airport before the scheduled departure time of 9.15 p.m. using the aerobridge at Gate 26. As the cabin crew welcomed the travellers on board, an unmistakeable odour began to assail them, literally wafting through the floorboards. When some passengers began to make small talk about the air quality, the crew were seen hurriedly using air fresheners which only masked the dank smell temporarily. The stench was soon back during the dinner service.

When a few passengers, including a frequent flier, made queries with the crew, and wanted to know whether the captain was aware of the problem, they were given feedback forms and also told that the 180-seater Airbus A321 (VT-PPK) had flown on the Chennai-Colombo-Delhi-Colombo-Chennai sectors earlier in the day, with a large consignment of fish in the cargo hold on one of the routings.

365,2020/03/14,"Use technology to solve problems, says Tamil Nadu Governor","The Governor was speaking at the 19th graduation day of Rajalakshmi Engineering College on Saturday

Governor Banwarilal Purohit asked students to be aware of real life socio-economic problems and to solve them by using technology learnings.

Addressing the 19th graduation day of Rajalakshmi Engineering College on Saturday, he asked the graduates to use technology in fields such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, Robotics, Quantum Computing, Data Sciences and Cyber Security to solve socio-economic problems.

The Governor said that there was a big challenge to bring about a revolution in the quality of engineering education under constrained budgets. “We need to innovate and adopt the latest trends in curricula and pedagogy. In the future, we can expect more emphasis on societally-relevant, multi-disciplinary streams while emphasising on students’ choices and experience outside the classroom,” he said.

Stating that the world at present had enormous employment opportunities, Mr. Purohit encouraged the graduands to work with discipline as their watchword. “The direction that you decide to go and the choices you make will have enormous impact on your lives, careers, society and India,” he said urging the graduands to use opportunities that come their way to create a better future for themselves and the country.

S. Chandramohan, group president (Finance and Investment strategy) TAFE Limited, told the graduates that their education and process of learning would be a lifelong one. “Remember that your growth, and whatever you are going on to achieve will stop if your learning stops. It should be a continuous journey,” he said.

366,2020/03/14,How foot soldiers are benefitting from a waste upcycling exercise,"As they promote the objectives of Zero Waste Chennai, they find an additional source of income

After serving as a sweeper for a company that was in a contract with the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) to carry out conservancy operations in Zone 11 — Valasarawakkam, 38-year-old B. Mahalakshmi now sees an opportunity coming her way in the new waste management initiatives undertaken by GCC.

Mahalakshmi is now part of a four-member women’s team that has been roped in by GCC to convert the cloth waste generated in Zone 11 into usable items. The other three women, who were housewives all these years and from financially-disadvantaged backgrounds have found some means to augment their family’s earnings. These women turn the cloth waste into pillow covers, cushion covers, mats, purses and bags.

Like them, K. Subramaniam, a cobbler, has also benefited from the GCC’s initiative. As a road-side cobbler, he has been hardly getting any business. Now, there is no dearth of work — with 15 pairs of discarded shoes to mend, he has his hands full.

In addition, he has a good number of worn-out bags including hand bags, travel bags and school bags to repair.

Certain discarded items — gently-used clothes, mattresses, bags and footwear — are being given a new lease of life.

Zonal Officer S. Sasikala says “This exercise offers a win-win situation for the GCC as well as for the tailors and the cobblers we have brought in. Our objective is to prevent recyclable waste from entering the landfills. Likewise, it is an opportunity for them to make some money. GCC has provided the sewing machines; and the power supply is taken care of. These people are just expected to convert waste into useful products and they are allowed to sell and share the earnings among themselves. We also ensure that the cloth waste is laundered with detergents and leave-on fragrant solutions are used. They are dried and ironed before being handed over to the women tailors. The staff and engineers here have pooled in money and bought a washing machine for this purpose. Moreover, we will be bringing in two more cobblers as a we keep getting a good number of footwear and bags.”

Another interesting aspect of the waste-repurposing work that is done here is using thermocol waste to make flower pots. “The themocol is crushed and mixed with cement and using a plastic pot as a mould, thermocol pots are made. After four days of curing, the pots are ready for containing soil, coco peat and manure . The coconut shells and husks which are generated as waste are crushed and converted into coco peat. Manure is also prepared from the decomposable waste. Except for cement, nothing else was bought. We brought saplings from our home gardens. We plan to sell it at a price of ₹.100. To begin with, 50 pots with saplings are ready for sale. We invite people to donate saplings,” says the Zonal Officer.

The Zone 11 team of Greater Chennai Corporation is planning to organise an exhibition-cum-sale of these upcycled products soon.

“We are organising this exhibition to demonstrate to people that the things they have discarded still has some value for someone else. Therefore, we once again request them to segregate the waste they generate,” says the Zonal Officer.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/b18kc9/article31068856.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15DCTNGRVALASARAVAKKAMZONE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/how-foot-soldiers-are-benefitting-from-a-waste-upcycling-exercise/article31068867.ece
367,2020/03/14,COVID-19: IIT-Madras start-up to offer free online courses to students affected by shut down,"GUVI, an online technical education platform, will offer 30-day free webinars, mainly intended for final-year engineering students

GUVI, an IIT Madras-incubated start-up, has announced that it will offer free online skilling classes to students who are affected by shut-downs related to COVID-19.

A statement issued by GUVI, which is an online technical education platform, said that the offer is mainly intended for final-year students in engineering colleges who may need tobe preparing for campus placements, but have been unable to go to training centres or colleges since some of them have been closed.

More than 100 technologists from many top companies have volunteered to conduct 30-day free webinars on Information Technology-related skills that are presently in demand in the IT sector. In addition, online mentors will be available to support the students to practice concepts through Code kata, GUVI’s online coding platform, the statement said.

Students can access these courses through www.guvi.io.

Apart from specific courses, the start-up said that it will be offering its learning platform free of cost to students of all engineering colleges for two weeks.

S.P. Balamurugan, co-founder and chief executive officer, GUVI, said that the idea is to ensure the safety of the students by avoiding the necessity to venture out to colleges or training centres due to the COVID-19 situation, while at the same time providing avenues to acquire skills for brighter job prospects. He added that GUVI wanted to take technology skills to all deserving students by offering courses in regional languages too.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mpv907/article31068769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14MARTH--IITM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-iit-madras-start-up-to-offer-free-online-courses-to-students-affected-by-shut-down/article31068771.ece
368,2020/03/14,Citizens get to know their green neighbours better,"A portal is at the centre of an India-wide, residents-driven initiative to understand what is happening to the trees in our backyards

There are so many trees out there that leave us tongue-tied, not always on account of the grandeur of their blooms. Sometimes, it’s just that we are at a loss, not knowing what to call them. If you are one of those budding tree-watchers seeking to wrap your head around the trees in your backyard, the portal SeasonWatch.in can surely help you — at last count, this pan-India initiative that is around 10 years old has details about 82,369 trees listed, based on 3,71,032 observations, made by 1080 individuals and 918 schools.

However, SeasonWatch has larger objectives that it would like to be known for. One of them is to understand how each species interacts with its environment, and promotes biodiversity. The other objective is to monitor trees for changes in their usual functions — such as being in bloom or in fruit earlier or later than they are supposed to be. The species-specific details of this nature are fascinating as they have been keyed in from different parts of India. These are details fed by citizens across the country.

SeasonWatch is a three-way partnership between Nature Conservation Foundation, National Centre for Biological Sciences and Wipro Applying Thought in Schools. The online initiative was started in 2010 by Suheil Quader.

Online events constitute one of the strengths of SeasonWatch, and many of them have helped the portal soak up considerable amounts of data in relatively shorter time frames. In 2019, over a lakh observations got added due to events like ‘Bioblitz’ and ‘Tree Quest’. “Bioblitz is where citizens across the country collect information on as many trees as possible, on the same four days, says Geetha Ramaswami, programme manager, SeasonWatch.

These short-duration events register sizeable citizen participation as people manage to find the time for it. In contrast, due to the time it may take, people approach long-duration programmes with an automatic resistance, points out Geetha.

Schools play a role in gathering data. Schools from Kerala top the list of contributors. Schools from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa and Meghalaya are the other major contributors.

Geetha adds a lot of data comes from Kerala, and expresses the hope that there will be similar enthusiasm from other parts of the country. In Kerala, SeasonWatch partners with Mathrubhumi and in Meghalaya with the State Council for Science Technology and Environment.

Members can choose how they want to be engaged in this exercise. There are the options of a signing up for ‘regular observation’ and ‘one-time observation’.

Data duplication

“Earlier, the odds of data duplication were low. However, with more sign-ups, checking data duplication is a challenge. Another challenge is calling out wrong observations. Though we informally check with the person about the tree and its features, we want to put in place, an automated system where our App flags off wrong observations,” says Geetha.

Observations are crucial in piecing together a picture about flowering and fruiting patterns of trees, and hence the search for systems to ensure only right observations get past the gate.

There have been so many findings and the logical outcome of that is a scientific paper.

“Our team is working on a scientific paper; it’s a work in progress,” says Geetha.

On some of the fascinating studies that have been done so far, she says, “We have been able to derive the baseline phenological patterns of some common species such as mango and jackfruit. In Indian Laburnum, we have been able to detect an advancement in flowering as compared to the expected flowering time.”

There are always efforts to make the initiative more inviting and a recent effort lets participants learn about the world of trees through games invented by teachers and students.

***

This government school teacher is a valuable contributor

This government school teacher from Salem has been encouraging the students of his school and a few other schools to make voluntary contributions towards building a knowledge base of the trees on their campuses.

“In fact, I am not a science teacher. My subject is English but I was always fascinated with nature,” says P. Rajangam, who teaches at the Panchayat Middle School Salem. For the last one year, his school has been a regular contributor to SeasonWatch. “I started learning the names and characteristics of trees by posting pictures of them in the WhatsApp group,” he says. The school has a bird-watching club that meets every week, so along with observing trees, they have been scanning the trees in the backyard for birds. “Many of our students can also identify trees,” he says. They have also planted many trees to attract birds to the campus.

Rajangam says he has encouraged three neighbouring schools to start making observations and recording them. “By helping them observe trees and birds, we can increase the curiosity level among students as well as get students to come to school regularly,” he says.

A spring in their leaves

SeasonWatch is celebrating spring inviting people to make observations about some colourful trees until the end of March. The objective of this challenge is to find and observe six species during the festival — Rain Tree, Indian Laburnum, Indian Coral, Red silk cotton, gulmohur and mango.

On March 21 and 22, Season Watch will be organising tree walks across India. In Chennai, they have partnered with Nizhal for the event.

369,2020/03/14,"Residents, traffic police join hands to see the back of abandoned vehicles on TVS Colony Main Road in Chennai","Illegal parking of defunct machines had become a stubborn problem on TVS Colony Main Road

On an unsuspecting night a year ago, two lorries — one of them, an oil tanker, to be precise — “found their way” to the bus terminus on TVS Colony Main Road in Officer's Colony, Mogappair, and they have not budged an inch since then.

It happened after the two MTC bus services that are operated from the terminus had returned to the depot at Anna Nagar West bus terminus. The two lorries, which are defunct, have remained at the terminus since that balmy night, prompting residents to make representations to the civic officials of Zone — 7 (Ambattur) of the Greater Chennai Corporation, which maintains both the road and the bus terminus.

With frequent missives and visits at the local Corporation office, residents were seeking the removal of the abandoned lorries from the terminus as well as other such vehicles parked stubbornly on both sides of TVS Colony Main Road.

It seemed an exercise in futility until March 9, when traffic police personnel led by Assistant Commissioner of Police (Ambattur range) Jayakar, and residents removed the abandoned vehicles from the road, including the two lorries at the terminus.

Steel barricades were raised on both sides of the road to prevent such vehicles from being parked on the road in the future. The eviction of the abandoned, residents say, was not as sudden as it may seem, but the culmination of year-long efforts to get the authorities, the Corporation and traffic police personnel included, to have this issue addressed.

“We have now requested the Corporation officials to construct a raised footpath on the road to prevent such illegal parking in the future. We also thank the local police who acted swiftly on our plea to remove the abandoned vehicles,” says V. Rajagopal, president, Anna Nagar Western Extension Phase – II Residents Welfare Association.

Residents point out that apart from this issue, residents and the local police have been meeting regularly to discuss how the neighbourhood could be secured against thefts and rapport had been built.

Residents say a sense of urgency had developed around the issue, as the space around these abandoned vehicles had started attracting garbage, and stray dogs that would relish feeding on leftover food in the trash pile.

Residents allege that even MTC reduced its many services as many buses found it difficult to reach the bus terminus on TVS Colony Main Road due to illegal parking.

The 60-feet TVS Colony Main Road, which is around 1.5-kilometre long and connects Ambattur and Tirumangalam, is a key link road in the region, and lined with many commercial buildings including private hospitals, banks and petrol pumps.

Workers from hundreds of industrial units in Pattaravakkam, Korattur and Ambattur use TVS Colony Main Road to reach CMBT, Koyambedu as the stretch is less congested and has wide footpaths, street lights and is bitumen-topped.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/6xq7o2/article31068531.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15DCANGRtvs1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/residents-traffic-police-join-hands-to-see-the-back-of-abandoned-vehicles-on-tvs-colony-main-road-in-chennai/article31068533.ece
370,2020/03/14,‘Restore old system of directing rainwater to Chetpet lake’,"When the Corporation constructed a stormwater drain network in our area which includes the Pachaiyappa’s College Hostel Road, Nowroji Road and McNichols Road in Chetpet, it was designed to get the rainwater to flow into Cooum via the SWDs.

As the Chetpet lake was located close-by, Association members met the Corporation officials and requested that the SWD network be connected to the waterbody so that our groundwater level would be enhanced. A Corporation team made a visit, following which the design was tweaked as requested by the Association. On account of rainwater being directed into the Chetpet lake, the groundwater table increased.

Now, rainwater from KMC on the northern side and Daspuram on the eastern side flow into the lake. In some areas, there are illegal sewage connections, and due to this, the SWDs are filled with sewage, and the polluted water makes it to the lake.

In 2015, when a major flood happened, the eastern side of the Chetpet lake came under sheets of water, and residents of localities on the eastern side complained about this problem. To check flooding of the areas on the eastern side, major changes were effected in our area, which lies on the western side of the lake. As part of this exercise, the SWD network was blocked with a shutter; and a new SWD network was constructed within Pachaiyappa’s College Hostel (this network starts at the hostel gate, runs alongside the hostel and college compound wall, and ends at Harrington Road, where it flows into the Cooum. It may be noted that this diversion was carried out only after Chetpet lake had been developed into an eco-park.

With the water flow into Chetpet lake being stopped in this manner, the water level in the waterbody leaves a lot to be desired; as a result, the groundwater table has been affected. If there is heavy rain, the shutter on the original SWD network connected to the Chetpet lake should be opened so that excess water would flow into the lake. Corporation officials met Fisheries Department, which owns the Chetpet Eco park, to ensure their cooperation in this matter.

There are two things to be done in the interest of Chetpet lake. One, the old system of rainwater being carried to the Chetpet lake via SWDs should be restored; and two, there is a sewage treatment plant at the Chetpet eco-park to treat the water flowing it. However, walkers in the area complain of a foul odour emanating from the waters of the lake, and so we request that the STP unit be run optimally to prevent such things.

371,2020/03/14,Doing justice to an institution’s rich history,"Senior advocate N.L. Rajah has been conducting a bi-monthly heritage walk around the Madras High Court complex from 2012, and last month the initiative crossed the fiftieth mark

No journey ever culminates at the intended destination. It may fall short of it; or may overshoot it. It may even veer off in a wholly new direction. No matter where a journey leads, one is none the worse for having embarked on it, if one pursues it sincerely. It can be enriching, sometimes in bewilderingly unexpected ways.

When N.L. Rajah, senior advocate of the Madras High Court and a member of its heritage committee, got hold of V.C. Gopalratnam’s A Century Completed: A History of the Madras High Court, 1862-1962, there was a faint intimation of the journey he should undertake. The book had ignited him with a fascination for the history of the Madras High Court, and he wanted to update the work.

“Though I did not update Mr. V.C. Gopalratnam’s book, I did write a book on the 150-year history of the Madras High Court,” begins Rajah, settling down at the High Court Museum for a chat about a subject he would never tire of discussing.

For Rajah, the book, The Madras High Court: A 150-year Journey from a Crown Court to a People's Court, published in 2012, marked the beginning of another journey, this one rather path-breaking because it had no parallels from the past.

A new direction

After working on the book, he was left with a truckload of material about the Madras High Court that he felt compelled to share, using a different facet of story-telling. So, in 2012, he started conducting free bi-monthly heritage walks — on a Sunday — around the Madras High Court complex. In February this year, the walk crossed a milestone — fiftieth walk.

“High Court, you see, is not an institution just for judges, lawyers and the staff of the institution, it is a public institution meant for all the citizens of the country and therefore all of us must know about the High Court. Also, the Madras High Court is one of the three chartered High Courts of the country and is therefore one of the oldest legal institutions in the country,” says Rajah.

Additional walks

His enthusiasm to talk about the Madras High Court is so boundless that he undertakes walks beyond the bi-monthly heritage walk.

“I have six walks in a year but this would be in addition to any special walks which any institution may request and if I find the interest quite genuine and the numbers sizeable, I then arrange for walks for these institutions. Mostly, these are colleges. These are bunches of heritage lovers. These are students of history. So, when they come to me as a group I always entertain them because I would like to feed this enthusiasm.”

Have these walks touched a chord with people beyond the city?

While pointing out that many of the consulates in Chennai send their staff for these walks, Rajah recalls how he was pleasantly surprised to find one journalist from the United States who had attended his walk write in her blog advising those who might be planning a visit to Chennai to time it in such a way that they could attend this walk.

Fresh information

Thanks to such encouragement, he is always on the lookout for fresh information about the High Court.

“And I also keep discovering more and more stuff. The more heritage walks I do, there are more people coming to me with information about the history of the High Court and we have also collected a lot of material from the district courts. There is furniture. There is memorabilia. There are valuable documents. These have now been very well-preserved. In fact, the Charter of 1753 is the charter under which the Presidency courts in Bombay, Calcutta and Madras were all established. The parent documents are in the Madras High Court museum.”

He continues, “Interestingly, Madras High Court was founded on August 15, 1862, the day that would become very important in the history of the country. That is unique about the founding date of the Madras High Court. On the day that it was founded it did not occupy this building. It occupied the building called the Bentinck’s Building on First Line Beach which is where the Singaravelar Maaligai today stands. Unfortunately, we have demolished that building, and that is the building which had the Supreme Court of Madras also. There was a Supreme Court of Madras... as the High Court grew in stature, many people have even forgotten about the Supreme Court of Madras, and even the lovely building where it was housed which was unfortunately demolished in the 1980s.”

The format

Where do the participants get to go, during a walk?

“The Madras High Court is the only High Court in the country which has two lighthouses. The first lighthouse dates back to 1848. On the base of the lighthouse we have created two photographic exhibitions on two themes — the first theme is how Madras is the first modern city of India. The other theme is the contribution of legal luminaries to public welfare.” Rajah says that a walk would last anywhere between two-and-a-half hours and three hours; it starts at the Madras HC Museum where it takes about one hour. Participants also get to go to the Madras Bar Association.

On the features that make the High Court complex stand out, Rajah says, “One of the things that will strike you is the sheer variety. There is hardly anything that is ever repeated. Every court hall is different, and has its own unique features. We today live in a world of standardisation, where we want to see everything being standardised and made uniform. But our forbears lived in a world of variety and beauty.” He also points out that being set in Indo-Saracenic architecture, it captures a lot of Indian elements in its design.

A measure of success

Rajah states the success of the walks largely derives from the fact that young lawyers are now interested in the history and heritage that the Madras High Court represents.

“A large number of advocates attend my walk. I wanted the youngsters to know about their history, the grand heritage of this profession and the fountainhead of all that heritage is the Madras High Court building. I find that there is now so much of pride among lawyers about being a part of this historic building. I have young advocates calling me and telling me that some part of the building is leaking, some part where the plastering has come off.”

Rajah continues, “There are many old court buildings in various parts of Tamil Nadu; 80 to 90 of them that are more than 100 years old. The heritage committee has taken up preservation of these structures, as also the law college. Lawyers from moffusil areas are getting interested in their buildings.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hlw2iy/article31068346.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15DCADYRHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/doing-justice-to-an-institutions-rich-history/article31068349.ece
372,2020/03/14,A tree that will have you eating out of its palm,"The presence of a government-instituted palm products development board underlines the importance of this native tree. But it can still grow taller in stature

At Perur, the land lies limp and helpless under the glowering mid-day sun, much like a fish pinned by the talons of an Osprey. The vegetation is sparse and unremarkable. Chennai’s Great Salt Lake doglegs through the expanse, heightening the sense of desolation. There is a harshness to the whole picture; and it takes a stand of trees to smoothen it. Tall and upright, the palmyra-palm trees dominate the landscape. Likely to be many decades old, these trees are in their elements.

“Palmyra-palm trees, known by the binomial name borassus flabellifer, are drought-resistant and can survive even the harshest of seasons and conditions. It does not need any special care,” says botanist Devanathan Krishnamoorthy, mentee of renowned botanist and member of Tamil Nadu Biodiversity Board Prof. D. Narasimhan.

Low-maintenance, the palmyra tree has an impressive cost-to-benefit ratio. Accounts of its uses may come across as hyperbole, but experience would show that these trees have more uses than one can shake a stick at – after all, there is a government body that functions just to manufacture, promote and market products derived from palmyra trees.

It is the Tamil Nadu Palm Products Development Board, which has its main office at Kuralagam. On Gengu Reddy Road in Egmore, there is a Tamilnadu State Palmgur & Fibre Marketing Co-operative Federation Ltd., which comes under the Board, and markets the products, working on a cooperative model.

“At the basic level, there are 720 cooperative societies across the state consisting of farm artisans who make products based on palmyra trees,” says Navin Kumar from the co-operative federation.

It is that time of the year when palm trees just mean succulent and tender palm fruits and neera, which is derived from palm sap. Every day, neera is processed and packed in sachets at the facility in Egmore and sent to various outlets across the city.

“Earlier, neera was sourced from IIT-M campus and Madhavaram. Now, every day, our vehicles head out of the city early in the morning and travel 112 kilometres to Kadapakkam on East Coast Road to buy neera from cooperative societies. It is around noon, when the vehicles would reach our facility in Egmore, and then the processing, subsequent packaging and distribution work of neera are all carried out,” explains Navin.

Besides the eatables, which also include palm sugar and chocolates, the concept of palm products encompasses the making of cleaning tools such as brushes.

With the world looking for natural and sustainable alternatives to plastics, this may be the time to promote existing palm fibre based products made by the Federation and also create new lines of products. Besides, plamyra’s role as an ecological regulator should be emphasised.

It is said that farm artisans constituting the palm-products cooperative societies are urged to grow palmyra-palms, on lake bunds and other places. Beyond farm artisans, even residents in urban parts should be encouraged to plant palmyra trees where they could be optimally useful. For this to happen, the spotlight should be kept on the benefits of having palmyra trees in one's neck of the woods.

Ecological benefits

“Palmyra-palm trees grow well on sandy soil, and that explains why one will usually find them in good numbers along coastal areas. When they are found inland, usually, they would be found planted around waterbodies and along river beds. Our forbears instinctively understood palmyra trees’ ability to hold the soil. Palmyra trees have fibrous roots that make them efficient soil binders. There are now research articles that call attention to palmyra trees’ ability to recharge the ground water table. As plamyras have a fibrous root system, each root functions like the main root, and they let multiple probes into the earth looking for water,” explains Devanathan.

Economic benefits

A palmyra tree can supply materials that go into the construction of houses. Devanathan points out that the base of a palmyra tree can serve as a pillar, and the stem can go into the making of rafters. “In Cuddalore, next to our house is my uncle’s which remains unchanged.

The wooden rafters used in the house had been sourced from palm trees, and according to my estimation, the rafters must be 200 years old, and yet they show no signs of disintegrating even mildly. Palmyra leaves can be used for thatching; and the petiole part of the leaves can be used for making ropes.”

Food items

The sweet palm sap is one of the most popular food items to be derived from palmyra trees. “By adding calcium carbonate to the palm sap, neera is obtained. It is high on nutritious value. Palm jaggery has high mineral content. The tender palm fruits are a body coolant.

The ripe palm fruits are rich in micro-nutrients. Palm prophyll (where pro is “first” and phyll is “leaf”) is edible, and has high fibrous content; it is called panai kizhangu in Tamil; panai kizhangu may be boiled and dried and then turned into power which can be used to make food items like adai and dosai,” says Devanathan.

Value-added products

Devanatan continues, “Panai kizhangu powder is exported. The fibres extracted from palmyra trees can go into the making of cleaning materials like brushes and brooms. Mats, boxes, hats and umbrellas can be made using palm leaves.

Palm leaves are used considerably in handicraft making. Sunshades made with palm material are also popular.” Devanathan says that the search for organic alternatives has led to a revival of interest in palm products, and adds that the efforts have to gain in intensity.

Empowering farm artisans who make palm products is one of the measures that will move things in the right direction.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pgdbyd/article31068319.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15dcPalmTreesPerur3jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-tree-that-will-have-you-eating-out-of-its-palm/article31068324.ece
373,2020/03/14,Residents want Tasmac outlets near Thirumayilai MRTS station to be shut,"Commuters and pedestrians in the area say that hundreds of people gather at these shops every day, and there are frequent quarrels among the tipplers

Even as the Thirumayilai MRTS station is expected to get 40 CCTV cameras to enhance security, residents of the locality and commuters say that nothing will improve unless two Tasmac outlets, operating close to the station, are shut down.

The two Tasmac shops are located adjacent to each other on Canal Bank Road in Kapali Thottam, near the Thirumayilai MRTS Railway Station. Every evening, hundreds of people gather here to purchase alcohol and some even consume it standing near the compound wall of the Buckingham Canal.

“It has become a menace here. The tipplers come to the road and some lie down on the stairs and pathway leading to the railway station. Though the Railway Protection Force (RPF) chase them away, they come back again after some time,” says a woman staff member at the station.

Pedestrians say that the path, once free of the tipplers, can be beautified. “Women feel unsafe using this stretch. Drunkards have converted this path into an open urinal and some of them gather on the main road, affecting traffic during peak hours,” said Gomathi Krishnan, a resident of Mylapore.

N. Kumar, a resident of Palaku Managar, said that the Tasmac shops have been here for close to 10 years. “Earlier there was only one, then one Tasmac shop was relocated to this stretch from Ranga Road. Now, a new elite bar has also opened. So now there are three wineshops,” he said. Mr. Kumar said that the residents have been fighting to have these shops shut for a long time. “Nothing has happened. There are frequent quarrels between the tipplers. It is not justified to have three shops on one road,” he said.

R. Natraj, Mylapore MLA, said that he has written to the Tasmac headquarters to shut the shops. “Nothing has happened till date. I will raise the issue in the Assembly again,” he said.

Senior RPF officers said that they ensure that the drunkards do not enter the station. “We will be getting 40 CCTV cameras inside the station premises to enhance security. We also chase away people who get drunk and sleep on the stairs. We will also write to Tasmac to shift the shops,” said an officer.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/eytyvq/article31067619.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14MARTH--BAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/residents-want-tasmac-outlets-near-thirumayilai-mrts-station-to-be-shut/article31067620.ece

The students have been suspended following a police complaint against them, said principal P. Arulmozhiselvan.

Around 20 students had attacked the victim, a student of Presidency College, around 2.15 p.m.,while he was returning home from college on March 6. The attack happened near the Nelson Manickam Road bus stop. A group of 10 men gheroed him and snatched his ID. He was assaulted with a knife on the head. The assaulters left him bleeding and escaped on motorcycles. The injured student had filed a police complaint.

375,2020/03/14,"With new facility in Tiruvarur, T.N. now has three testing labs","Senior health official advises against non-essential visits to crowded spaces

With the addition of the Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory at Tiruvarur, Tamil Nadu now has three testing facilities for SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19.

The King Institute of Preventive Medicine, Guindy, has tested a majority of samples till date. The facility at Government Medical College, Theni, is the second.

A senior health official said that four additional testing facilities were ready to be operationalised in the State. “In fact, we can increase our diagnostic facilities to 10,” he said.

The Public Health Department is involved in tracing people in the State who had come in contact with persons who tested positive for COVID-19 in neighbouring Kerala and Karnataka.

According to a bulletin issued by the Directorate of Public and Preventive Medicine, six persons are under hospital quarantine in the State, and 1,406 persons under home quarantine for 28 days.

Till now, 76 samples have tested negative for COVID-19 in the State. The sole patient who had tested positive last week, and his contact, have been moved to a step-down ward from the isolation ward at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. This, after results of two consecutive samples — that were taken 24 hours apart — tested negative. The health status of his contacts under home quarantine are stable.

K. Kolandaswamy, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, who has been urging the public to avoid mass gatherings, said it was advisable to avoid non-essential visits to places.

Social distancing

“Do your work over the phone or through video-conferencing. The State government has now declared leave for kindergarten classes in all districts, and up to primary classes in the border districts. If you are sick, avoid going out,” he said.

“Drop all tour plans. It is better to avoid visiting malls and theatres. We have asked malls and theatres to disinfect surfaces regularly. In fact, theatres have been told to increase the time gap between shows for the purpose of cleaning,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/uk7b7o/article31064706.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THCMREVIEWMEETING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/with-new-facility-in-tiruvarur-tn-now-has-three-testing-labs/article31064707.ece
376,2020/03/14,Gangster held in Uttar Pradesh,"Thanikachalam alias Thanika, a gangster and brother-in-law of rowdy Sridhar, who was absconding the last two years, was arrested in Uttar Pradesh by the anti-gangster team of the Kancheepuram police on Thursday, with his two aides.

After Sridhar’s death, a gang war ensued between Thanikachalam and Sridhar’s driver Dinesh. This resulted in many murders in Kancheepuram and its neighbouring districts.

While Dinesh was arrested recently, Thanikachalam was absconding for the past two years. “He did not use a mobile phone or bank account and it was hard to track him. Based on information, we searched for Thanikachalam in neighbouring districts and we received information that he is in Uttar Pradesh,” said a police officer.

With this information, a special team headed inspector J Manimaran was sent to U.P. by B. Shamoondeswari, Superintendent of Police, Kancheepuram. “Varanasi has over 3,000 lodges, it was difficult to track him. But with the help of informants we managed to nab him and his aides Vasanth and Chandrasekhar. He was plotting an attack here sitting there,” said the officer.

Police claim that Thanikachalam may have tried to contact gangs in U.P. to purchase arms. “But he did not have any. It is suspected that he had made attempts. He chose Varanasi as it is a crowded place with floating population. He thought he could easily dodge us and was staying there for five months,” the officer said.

Till date, Ms. Shamoondeswari’s team has arrested more than 100 gangsters belonging to both factions in Kancheepuram.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/gangster-held-in-uttar-pradesh/article31064690.ece
377,2020/03/14,A quicker response to civic concerns in Chennai,"City to get its first mobile command and control centre next week

Starting next week, the Chennai Corporation will start using a mobile command and control centre to monitor and respond to pressing civic issues.

Chennai Smart City officials have completed work on building the mobile unit. On Friday, the mobile unit was taken to the Ripon Buildings and stationed on its premises.

“We will send the mobile command and control centre to areas where residents report major civic issues. The response will be quicker,” said an official.

For example, the mobile unit will be sent to the site of any major disaster in the city, gathering all kinds of information, on real time. In case of a major industrial fire, the mobile unit will measure pollution levels and facilitate evacuation of affected residents from the area. The vehicle will also be sent to sites of major road traffic accidents.

The police can also use the mobile centre to monitor demonstrations. For instance, it will transmit all data relating to anti-CAA protests in congested areas in the city. A pan-tilt-zoom camera will be used to collect information.

Equipped with sensors

The unit consists of a surveillance vehicle, equipped with a variety of sensors, applications and remote transmission capabilities. A facial recognition camera too can be used for identifying persons who are collapsing in a large gathering. Automatic vehicle locator information will be generated using global positioning system.

“We will increase the number of mobile command and control centres after assessing the utility of the first vehicle,” said an official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/aq9eej/article31064659.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20200313160209,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-quicker-response-to-civic-concerns/article31064660.ece

379,2020/03/14,The ambit and the limits of ‘diaspora diplomacy’,"It is necessary for New Delhi to look at the political choices of Indian migrants abroad through a more realistic lens

Joint rallies by U.S. President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Ahmedabad last month and at Houston last September were unique for their concept and for their crowd sizes, but also for the promise they held out to the leaders themselves: of audiences that would blend support for Mr. Trump with that for Mr. Modi politically. As a result, speaking beyond bilateral relations, both leaders paid tribute to the three million people of Indian origin who are American citizens, who will vote in elections this year.

In Ahmedabad, Mr. Trump referred to Indian Americans as “truly spectacular people”. In Houston, Mr. Modi said the 2016 election of Mr. Trump, who had used the slogan “Abki Baar Trump Sarkar” during his campaign, had “lit up millions of faces with joy”. Mr. Modi’s recall of the slogan sent a not-so-subtle message ahead of the upcoming U.S. presidential poll, where Mr. Trump is seeking re-election. The result of both rallies and the speeches was a heady concoction for both politicians, seeing the Indian diaspora not just as a part of India’s “soft power”, but a fully transferable political vote bank as well.

Pitching to both audiences

Mr. Modi has also brought this dual effect into play in several diaspora rallies worldwide. At each of them, he has spoken of initiatives taken by his government for Indians, and also those for the diaspora, pitching to both audiences at one time. In Israel, for example, Mr. Modi spent much of his speech on talking about his agricultural programmes, which was meant for domestic audiences watching his speech on television, and then announced the start of a direct Air India flight to Tel Aviv, to big cheers from his live audience. The government has also frequently blurred the line between Indian expatriates and Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) in describing India’s strength abroad. In March 2017, the Ministry of External Affairs raised the issue of attacks on Indians strongly with the U.S. government, after three incidents of suspected hate crimes. Only one of the three was an Indian citizen, the rest were Americans of Indian extraction. This is an important distinction from the past.

Transferability of votes

India has the world’s largest diaspora, about 17.5 million and receives the highest remittance of $78.6 billion from Indians living abroad (Global Migration Report 2020). Members of the diaspora, often seen as more “successful” and therefore more influential, can have a big impact on their relatives back home, and this makes for a potent combination for any politician. Mr. Modi’s joint rallies with former U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu all included this promise, and saw those leaders make campaign pitches to the Indian community that Mr. Modi had gathered, even as Mr. Modi’s popularity with his voters back home benefited from their presence at his rallies.

However, the promise of the diaspora’s dual power is based on certain faulty premises, and it is necessary and timely that the government re-analyses the benefits accrued from the diaspora’s political presence through a more realistic lens.

To start with, the transferability of votes has not yet been proven conclusively. Six months after the April 2015 rally, Mr. Harper lost general elections in Canada. Mr. Cameron lost the referendum on Brexit and resigned seven months after the November 2015 rally, and Mr. Netanyahu has had to face re-elections after failing to secure a majority in any of the three polls that followed his July 2017 joint rally with Mr. Modi in Tel Aviv.

One obvious reason is that the Indian community isn’t large enough to make a difference in the voting patterns in any of these countries. The second is that the population that comes out for the rallies doesn’t represent the entire diaspora. Take the case of U.K. general elections last December, where the Boris Johnson-led Conservative party sought to wrest the support of the traditionally Labour-leaning British-Indian community, and even featured Mr. Modi in its campaign advertisements. The results, which gave the Conservatives a massive win, didn’t however make the case for transfer of votes. A report on the 30 constituencies in the U.K. where ‘Asians’ (a majority of whom are of Indian origin) constitute more than a quarter of the voting population showed that Labour won 29 of the 30 seats, the same that it had also won in 2017 elections, and while its vote share dropped, that mirrored its average losses across the U.K.

In the upcoming U.S. election, it remains to be seen whether the Trump outreaches at Houston and Ahmedabad bring in a haul of new Indian-American voters, but the statistics are daunting. In the 2016 election, 77% of Indian Americans voted for Hillary Clinton while just 16% voted for Mr. Trump.

The second issue is that politically active members of the Indian diaspora don’t necessarily support the Indian government’s actions, and often, because they are of Indian origin, hold the government in New Delhi to higher standards than they do others. The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairperson for Asia, Ami Bera, voiced his concerns quite plainly about Kashmir and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) during a visit to India last month, for example, saying that the India that he “loved” was “democratic and secular”. The sponsor of the U.S. House resolution on Kashmir (HR745) Pramila Jayapal; co-chair of U.S. Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’s campaign Ro Khanna; and former presidential contender Kamala Harris, have all been openly critical of the government’s actions. The conclusion for the government is that it cannot own only that part of the diaspora that supports its decisions, and must celebrate the fact that members of the Indian diaspora, from both sides of the political divide, are successful and influential.

Interest and ‘interference’

Third, the government must ensure that its focus on the diaspora doesn’t become a factor in its bilateral relations. While it is perfectly legitimate and laudable to ensure the safety and well-being of Indian citizens in different parts of the world, as the Modi government has done, it must tread more lightly on issues that concern foreign citizens of Indian origin.

Addressing the Lok Sabha in 1957, former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru said about the diaspora, “We want to have no vested interests at the expense of the population of those countries…if they adopt the nationality of that country we have no concern with them. There may be sentimental concerns but politically they cease to be Indian nationals.” (A reply to debate on foreign policy in Lok Sabha; September 2, 1957).

Subsequent governments have distanced themselves from this rather cold-blooded view and warmed up to the diaspora, but none have raised the concerns of the diaspora with foreign governments, on visas and other issues, like the present one has.

The introduction of India’s internal politics into this equation is another new angle, one that led the British Foreign Office to remonstrate with India about interference last December. A tweet, subsequently deleted by an office bearer of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party last month, that threatened to “play a role” in U.S. elections in response to criticism from Mr. Sanders, was also a troubling symptom of this. Politically affiliated Indian diaspora chapters are now also playing old India-Pakistan fault-lines amongst immigrants, which in the past were fuelled by Pakistani agencies. In California primaries this month, local “Hindu-American” groups protested against Democratic candidates like Ro Khanna for joining the Congressional Pakistan caucus and for criticising New Delhi’s actions. (Mr. Khanna won the primary).

Finally, the government must consider the impact that policies conflating the PIOs with Indian citizens could have on the diaspora itself. Most immigrant Indian communities have been marked by their ability to assimilate into the countries they now live in. Much of that comes from a desire to be treated as equal citizens, not as immigrants, while a few also have bad memories of anti-immigrant sentiments in the 1960s and 1970s in Europe and the U.S., when they were targeted and accused of “divided loyalties”. Laying claim to their kinship and culture and taking pride in their success is one thing. It would be a mistake to lay claim to their politics, however.

Apropos the editorial, “Not a time to panic” (March 13), it is imperative to take action against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic but we are fearing an apocalypse and reacting accordingly in sheer madness. Conferences and public events have been cancelled, weddings postponed and schools have been closed fearing the spread of the virus. Businesses did quite well out of the disease. The sales of respiratory masks, hand sanitisers, anti-fever medicines and similar drugs have skyrocketed. If we are to avoid the so-called ‘coronavirus apocalypse’, we need to be guided by evidence, science and collaboration, not hype, hyperbole and impulse.

Preventive measures

The focus now is only on containment, not prevention, especially with a vaccine still not in sight. Shutting down schools, cinemas, travel, etc. are short-term measures. These cannot continue for ever. The government and civic agencies should now focus on prevention, as any virus spreads through unclean environments and also destruction of environments. While there are rules and laws, implementation is extremely poor. So, we have garbage in public places, overflowing drains and sewage, polluted rivers and lakes and animals moving to human habitation. Forests and wildlife reserves are being destroyed to make way for highways, dams and resorts. Now, it is for the government to see how it can make India clean and green, rather than invite more such virus attacks.

Scientific outlook

We feel a deep sense of precariousness in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. We realise how fragile and vulnerable we are to outbreaks of infectious diseases. It is as if we are suddenly blindsided and brought to a standstill by the pestilence. Unsure of what will happen next, we often take a deep breath to calm our racing pulses.

The prognosis is for more people to be affected by the affliction in the coming days. The steep economic downturn and concomitant loss of jobs and incomes, economic distress and lowered quality of life due to the pandemic deepens the all-round gloom. Whether COVID-19 poses an existential threat to the human race or not, it has certainly become a very serious global health crisis. It is spreading rapidly, assuming alarming proportions and causing a lot of psychological anxiety. It is of great comfort that COVID-19 is sparing children and over 98% of the patients recover. At the same time, we wish that old people too are not susceptible to the attack of the virus and all people recover.

A wide range of measures, from closure of borders, denial of visas, cancellation or postponement of sporting fixtures and cultural and religious events, suspension of tourism, ban on air travel, cancellation of hotel bookings, closure of schools and colleges, cinema halls, pubs, gymnasiums, museums, parks, resorts beaches and places of worship and pilgrimage, construction of more isolation units and screening and quarantining and conversion of homes into workplaces are some measures being taken to cut the transmission chain and contain the pandemic. ‘Social distancing’ or staying away from others prevents the transmission.

It is a novel experience to watch matches being played in empty stadiums without spectators or behind closed doors. The chance of ‘external survival’ of the virus in the hot climate is said to be slim; but it is yet to be proved conclusively. However, it is reassuring to hear from China that the pandemic will be ‘over by June’ if countries take concerted action.

The pandemic should promote global cooperation and collaboration, make us aware of the futility of fighting among ourselves and tame our aggressive instincts, result in reduction of manufacture of arms and ammunition and make us more scientific in our thinking and lifestyle.

G. David Milton

Maruthancode, Tamil Nadu

The very phrase ‘COVID 19’ these days strikes an invidious and incalculable terror, coupled with an insurmountable anguish, since the dreaded virus has taken a toll of more than 5,000 innocent lives. It was China from where this dangerous virus commenced its most cruel and hitherto unheard of scourge. China is leaving no stone unturned to put a stop to this deleterious spread of the virus. But it appears that no light has emerged so far. It is struggling much to the dismay of all other countries, which one by one is steadily getting entangled in its vicious grip. But it is a thousand pities to learn that Italy has been the most unfortunate country which has had to bear the brunt of COVID 19. But for wringing our hands in utter despair and despondency, what else can one do? This may be the ubiquitous refrain of all normal human beings.

We need to clasp our hands together and pray to the almighty for the situation to improve and normalcy to be restored.

Congress and ideology

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has said that his former aide Jyotiraditya Scindia has kept his ideology “in his pocket” and joined hands with the RSS (“Scindia has embraced RSS ideology,” March 13). It is pertinent to ask here what ideology the current Congress is having other than abject loyalty and subservience to Mr. Gandhi’s own family. It is undeniable that whether Mr. Gandhi is the chief of the party or not, he calls the shots in the Congress, and party members form a beeline to meet him. When Mr. Scindia said that respect and identity hold importance, he was only hinting that in the Congress, everything begins and ends with the Gandhis.

C.G. Kuriakose,

Mr. Scindia’s exit from the Congress is a significant pointer to the disenchantment within the grand old party, which seems to have become a political asylum centre for elders. The authoritarian manner in which the party is run by the Gandhi family would surely drive away the young and promising leaders like Mr. Scindia. If things are allowed to drift to like this, only the Gandhis will remain in the party, which will reduce it to a regional outfit in the not-too-distant future. The time is ripe for the Congress to act swiftly now, or rue later.

Rajini and politics

The pressure relentlessly exerted on Rajinikanth by his steadfast fans to take the political plunge is akin to dragging an unwilling horse to a pond to make it drink water (Front page, “Never aspired to be CM, want resurgence first,” and some reports in inside pages, March 13). As he himself has admitted, star power alone is not enough to get elected to the Assembly. Sivaji Ganesan could not make an impression in politics. Present-day actors like Vijayakanth, Sarathkumar, and Kamal Hassan are struggling to carved a niche for themselves.

It would be a mistake on the fans’ part to compare Rajinikanth with M. G. Ramachandran and J. Jayalalithaa as the charisma of both the former CMs was on a different plateau. There is already criticism that Rajinikanth makes a speech referring to entry into politics ahead of a film’s release only to promote it. One hopes that better sense prevails on the blind and mad fans!

A. Jainulabdeen,

Politics is a not theatre where one can act a hero. Politics is a playing field where one has to prove his worth and exhibit how far he is committed to the welfare of the people, future of the country and the nation’s inclusive development. What kind of resurgence, change and political revolution does Rajinikanth want in Tamil Nadu politics, which has been ruled by either of the two main Dravidian parties, DMK or AIADMK, since 1967? It is strange that he is shying away from being the Chief Minister and yet wants to be in politics and wants a change, implying that he wants an alternative to Dravidian parties. The rich, super-rich, the upper and lower middle class are more concerned about their businesses and professions and the poverty-stricken people more concerned about the next meal and any uprising or revolution by them is out of question. Corruption has taken deep roots in political and government corridors and the society and it cannot be uprooted overnight, and voters are won through polarisation and bought through money-power, man-power and muscle-power. The ideas and ideology of Rajnikanth are praiseworthy but it remains to be seen whether his dream will be fulfilled in the prevailing political scenario across the country and in Tamil Nadu. Before suggesting others to bring about a change, let him first be the change and stay away from movies and cine-world.

Rights of pedestrians

Certainly, making dashboard cameras mandatory, with the video evidence accepted in the investigation, would protect rule-abiding motorists (Editorial, “Danger ahead,” March 13). But what about law-abiding and eco-sensitive pedestrians and cyclists? Pedestrians and cyclists are arguably the most vulnerable species on Indian roads — who are fighting global warming with every step, every day — but unfortunately in India, no one worries about them. It won’t be a surprise if they form a significant portion of 1.5 lakh people who lost their lives on the road each year since 2015, most of the time without their fault. Hence, cameras along with Global Positioning System (GPS) need to be made mandatory for motorised two-wheelers and three-wheelers also, along with other motorised vehicles. With the ever-falling prices of electronic gadgets, this won’t be costing much money, and only a political will is necessary.

No party except one that is in self-destructive mode could have let a situation as the case in Madhya Pradesh to snowball into one where a leader of national stature had no option but to leave and join its ideological rival. Jyotiraditya Scindia’s decision to leave did not come suddenly and there have been many signs of his disaffection and dissatisfaction with the party.

The factional struggle within the State unit of the grand old party has been festering for long and it is evident that the party high command does not seem to have done much to resolve the problems. The fact remains that there is a vacuum at the top in the Congress and the leaders are unable to reorganise the party in the face of political setbacks. The family has shown that it is unable to revive and re-energise the party, which appears unable to look beyond the family. The Congress is fast getting reduced to becoming an idea without leadership, and without ownership and organisation.

Mr. Scindia is a young and charismatic leader whose departure from the Congress will be a huge loss for it. Despite their incredible performance during the Assembly elections, one wonders why Mr. Scindia and Rajasthan’s Sachin Pilot were not rewarded suitably. This is in contrast with the functioning of the BJP where leaders reach top spots because of their hard work and performance. Why is the Congress neglecting its young leaders? Is it the fear that they will outperform Rahul Gandhi?

Vidhya B. Ragunath,

It seems as if Indian democracy never stops to astonish, disappoint and intrigue us. The Indian National Congress seems to be in a situation where it would not be inappropriate to call it a sinking ship. Its leadership seems oblivious of the obvious problems and internal conflicts which are corroding the party structure. But Mr. Scindia’s exit raises an integral and important question: whether our politicians have any ideological and moral values left. Are they just power hungry, greedy, pretentious and self-centred individuals? Mr. Scindia left a party after many years of association to join a right-wing group which he has on many a given occasion, gone overboard to criticise and even ridicule. His case only exposes all the deep-rooted problems of our political system, our politicians and their fallacies.

The Afghan deal

The situation in Afghanistan is one where the U.S. has marooned the Afghans. The decades-long engagement, an apparent war waged against terror forces, has finally ended up as a zero-sum game. The crucial role played by the U.S. all these days seems to have been in vain if one analyses the present situation since 9/11. The present situation has all the elements to reinvigorate the Taliban once again, which acquires importance in view of the volatile situation in the Kashmir region (Editorial page, “Fail-safe exit for America, a worry for India”, March 12).

To play or not?

It is bewildering how some in the BCCI have discounted the coronavirus threat affecting this year’s IPL fixtures. The virus is a pandemic and has cast its shadow on the international calendar of various sporting events. In such a situation, there is every reason to believe that it would be wiser to err on the side of caution and consider player as well as spectator interests — the latter are bound to throng the stadiums in large numbers. The sky will not fall if the IPL is dropped this year (‘Sport’ page, “COVID-19 – IPL GC meeting on Saturday”, March 12).

382,2020/03/14,"Coronavirus | Sanitisers will be available in public places in Mumbai, says minister","Hand sanitisers will be made available in public places in Mumbai so that people can wash hands and avoid contracting or spreading novel coronavirus (COVID-19), Mumbai district Guardian Minister Aslam Shaikh said on Friday. Hand sanitisers would be made available mainly at railway stations and bus stops, he said.

Meanwhile, while authorities are busy curbing the spread of the virus, some unscrupulous elements, who are looking to make a fast buck by selling substandard hand wash products and sanitisers, have come under the scanner of the State’s health regulator.

The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has launched a crackdown on home-grown units which manufacture substandard hand wash and sanitisers and push them into the local market, an official said.

383,2020/03/14,Coronavirus | Railways sees surge in ticket cancellations,"More long-distance passengers scrap travel plans compared to last year on CR, WR

The Railways have been seeing a surge in cancellations on their long-distance passenger trains over the past week, almost mirroring the increase in the cases of novel coronavirus infection in the country.

Both Central Railway (CR) and Western Railway (WR) have seen a spike in cancellations from March 6.

On March 12, of the 65,943 tickets booked on CR, 22,441 were cancelled, amounting to ₹110.27 lakh in refunds. The cancellation rate on March 12 was 34.03%, much higher than the average rate of around 14%, CR officials said.

Daily year-on-year figures from CR reveal that the rate of cancellation has been increasing since March 5, when it was around 18.4%.

WR has seen a similar trend, with more tickets being cancelled over the last week as compared to the same period in 2019. Between March 1 and March 12 last year, WR saw 4,34,403 ticket cancellations. The figure for the same period in 2020 was 5,27,045, an increase of 21.33%.

On Thursday, the year-on-year increase in ticket cancellations was pegged at 48.09%.

“We are also seeing cancellations of tickets that have been booked for journeys during the peak summer season,” a senior railway official said. For instance, between April 15 and June 15, WR has until now recorded 2,000 cancellations on the Mumbai-New Delhi Rajdhani Express.

Sources said that in a review meeting held by the Railway Minister with officials in the city on Monday, the issue of cancellations was discussed. “The cancellation rate at present is not too alarming, but if the trend continues, steps would need to be taken to ensure that trains don’t run empty,” a senior railway official said.

CR has stepped up its cleaning and disinfection efforts on long-distance passenger trains, with a focus on wiping and cleaning of all passenger interface areas in coaches, such as door handles, berth grab handles and wash basins. Toilets are being cleaned and disinfected and staff has been directed to frequently clean coaches en route and ensure that handwash doesn’t run out.

CR has also started disinfecting local trains, focusing on grab handles and poles.

Meanwhile, as a preventive measure, CR has closed its Heritage Museum at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and suspended its tour of the station until March 31.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/qqjwz0/article31065021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BMtrain,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/railways-sees-surge-in-ticket-cancellations/article31065022.ece

385,2020/03/14,"Coronavirus fears, scrapped visas hit Mumbai’s culture scene","NCPA, Opera House among those to postpone events

As the threat of COVID-19 spreads, Mumbai’s performance venues have postponed or cancelled upcoming events.

On Friday, the National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA) issued a notice citing that the management has decided to cancel all scheduled programmes in all its theatres with immediate effect till March 31.

Following suit, the G5A Foundation for Contemporary Culture too has decided to indefinitely postpone all upcoming programmes for March from Saturday, with an email sent to the venue’s patrons citing “growing concern over the coronavirus being declared a global pandemic, and in the interest of public health and safety”. This includes postponing the Mumbai Academy of Moving Image screening of the documentary For Sama slated for March 16.

The Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum, known for its year-round programmes, has cancelled its weekend public tours, workshops, talks, film screenings, and events in March until further notice as a preventive measure.

Besides, with the government cancelling visas, music performance venues have had to revamp the roster with home-grown talent.

Ashish Doshi, honorary director of the Royal Opera House, Mumbai, said, “The safety and well-being of our patrons, audiences and performers are of utmost importance to us. Therefore all events at the Royal Opera House, Mumbai, stand deferred until further notice.”

The change in event schedules comes shortly after the announcement that Amazon Web Services’ Mumbai Summit, scheduled to be held in April, had been called off, while the Breezer Vivid HGStreet, a two-day festival that was to be held on March 21 and 22, had been postponed.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/b7zamn/article31064993.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BMCINEMAHALL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/covid-19-fears-scrapped-visas-hit-mumbais-culture-scene/article31064994.ece
386,2020/03/14,"Coronavirus | Hospitals in Mumbai restrict entry, check travel history of visitors","Daily screening, training for staff, mass disinfection being held

As the fear of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) grips the city, many hospitals have started taking precautionary measures like screening and probing travel history at entry points, limiting entry to only one attendant, and carrying out mass disinfection on the premises.

Global Hospital in Parel is issuing a form to fill out at the time of entry. “We have requested relatives to restrict going near patients as much as possible. Those who are entering the premises are being screened and asked for their history of travel,” Dr. Ajit Baviskar, head of emergency department, said. “A special desk has been set up where visitors with a travel history and symptoms are first directed to.”

Jaslok Hospital on Peddar Road is taking preventive measures like screening every visitor, patient, doctor, and staffer. “Each individual entering the hospital has to detail out their travel history, and symptoms of cough and cold, if any. Temperature is being tested of the suspects and they are then sent to the emergency medical services department for further check-up,” Jitendra Haryan, chief executive officer of the hospital, said.

For the last one month, Mr. Haryan said, every employee has been educated and trained on from house-keeping to higher management to ensure understanding of the situation is correct and adequate precautions are being taken. “Daily catch-up with staff from all three shifts is being conducted to update them on the situation. In service-related departments, there is a reminder bell rung every hour to go and ‘wash hands’ or use a hand draft,” he said, adding it is being made sure that only one attendant is allowed with the patient.

Dr. Tarang Gianchandani, CEO of Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, said doctors, visitors, employees, and vendors are being screened at the entry points every day.

“We have restricted our entry points and all such points are manned by skilled medical and paramedical workers and security personnel,” she said, adding they are quarantining their staff if they have any travel history.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ce08m/article31065018.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BMMUMBAICORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hospitals-in-city-restrict-entry-check-travel-history-of-visitors/article31064991.ece
387,2020/03/14,MIDC to get permit to supply power,"Will be distributed to industries at competitive rates: Desai

Industries Minister Subhash Desai told the Council on Friday that the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) will acquire its own licence to distribute power to industries at competitive rates as the tariff is high in the State. Mr. Desai also criticised the Centre for repeatedly changing its industrial policy, which has led to large industries opting against making investments.

The Council had earlier held a special session to discuss dwindling employment opportunities for the youth in the State. Several MLCs, including Leader of Opposition Pravin Darekar and Bhai Jagtap (Congress), raised concerns over the welfare of families of mill workers, low investment in new industries, poor health of existing industries, and changes in the Industrial Disputes Act.

Mr. Desai said, “The Centre changed its industrial policies several times, which is why large industries chose not to invest. But we have decided to focus on small industries through our employment generation scheme. The government will help them raise capital through banks. Since the government is involved, banks will not harass them.”

Mr. Desai was referring to the Chief Minister’s Employment Generation Scheme under which entrepreneurs will only have to raise 10% capital. The State will raise 30%, while banks will lend the remaining 60%. He said, “Banks need to change their outlook towards small industries. They put small industries under the microscope while big fish like Nirav Modi take away thousands of crores of rupees.”

Mr. Desai said a Bill will be brought in the next Assembly session to reserve 80% jobs for locals and ensure that employers disclose the number of contractual employees. He said, “When industries ask us why our electricity is so costly, we are at a loss to explain it. It is true that in neighbouring States like Gujarat, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, the tariff is much lower. In fact, some people set up a unit in the neighbouring State but continue to live here. That is why, we want MIDC to procure a distribution licence which will help us reduce the tariff for industries.”

Mr. Desai said the State gives farmers power at ₹1 per unit. To offset the burden of ₹10,000 crore, power is given to industries at ₹9 or ₹10 per unit, while other States give it at ₹6 or ₹7 per unit.

Mr. Desai said it is a myth that the larger the industry, the more employment it generates. “Statistics from my department show in big-ticket projects, an average investment of ₹1 crore creates only one job as they may be highly mechanised. But in small-scale industries, a ₹1 lakh investment can create one job. In micro industries, this amount is as low as ₹25,000.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/43psj3/article31064982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14bmAssembly-Backbencherscol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/midc-to-get-permit-to-supply-power/article31064983.ece

Organised by the Raza Academy, the meeting started at 1.30 p.m. outside Khatri Masjid and was led by Muhammad Saeed Noori, founder-president of the academy. Mr. Noori, members of the academy and local residents recited prayers out loud.

“We appeal to Allah to reduce the fear about the pandemic in each person’s heart and to eradicate the coronavirus,” Mr. Noori said after the prayer meeting. He also criticised the decision by Saudi Arabia to stop pilgrims from visiting the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.

“Islam doesn’t preach any concept which says this disease can spread through air or by touching one another. The restrictions put on the Islamic religious pilgrims of Mecca and Medina by Saudi Arabia should be withdrawn and people should allowed to visit these places. Allah has decided the day you will die and no one will lose his life even a second before that. The restriction is just a reason to stop us from worshipping and is anti-Islamic,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/orq12f/article31064966.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BMCORONAPRAYER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/residents-pray-for-eradication-of-virus/article31064967.ece
389,2020/03/14,Crime in the time of coronavirus,"Hackers are sending phishing emails in the guise of tips to deal with the pandemic

Even as stock markets tumble and panic spreads over the novel coronavirus outbreak, cyber criminals are hatching plans to make the most of the ongoing crisis.

According to cyber experts, the most frequent trend observed in the past two weeks is of hackers sending phishing emails to citizens with the words ‘Corona’ or ‘COVID-19’ in the subject line. The emails contain attachments in pdf, mp4 or docx format, which are designed to look like advisories or tips to deal with the pandemic, but are actually viruses or malware. To sell their lie further, the hackers also mention the names of credible agencies like the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A recent study by Kaspersky has found that some of these emails contain links that look like legitimate web pages but actually lead the target to a log-in page meant to steal passwords.

“Trojans embedded in attachments or links are designed to steal passwords of the targets. This is damaging in a time when people like to save passwords of their email and social media accounts in their browsers for faster log-in, which means the hackers can get an entire list of passwords at one go,” Shubham Singh, who is a civilian consultant for the Mumbai Police, said.

Kaspersky has also detected a high number of such attempts in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, including emails offering products such as masks. In a statement, Kaspersky said, “For example, an Excel file distributed via email under the guise of a list of coronavirus victims allegedly sent from the World Health Organization was, in fact, a Trojan-Downloader, which downloads and installs another malicious file. This second file was a Trojan-Spy designed to gather data, including passwords, from the infected device and send it to the attacker.”

In the APAC region alone, Kaspersky has detected 93 coronavirus-related malware in Bangladesh, 53 in the Philippines, 40 in China, 23 in Vietnam, 22 in India and 20 in Malaysia. There were single-digit detections in Singapore, Japan, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Myanmar, and Thailand.

Cyber experts have also noticed a trend of creating websites similar to official government ones offering information on the COVID-19 outbreak. One such attempt was a fake map showing the number of coronavirus victims in regions all over the world, which was also sent out via email in the form of pdf or exe files. Mr. Singh said, “These are actually trojans that will infect the system as soon as they are opened and give hackers remote access of the devices.”

With companies increasingly starting to opt for the work from home option, experts say the threat might worsen. Employees would be now accessing work-related data from internet-provider devices that are not as secure as the ones at their offices. Stephan Neumeier, managing director, Asia Pacific, Kaspersky, said, “It is a known that once devices are taken outside a company’s network infrastructure and connected to new networks and Wi-Fi, the risks to corporate information increase. It is high time we boost our physical immunity and networks security against these damaging attacks.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/m8fbry/article31064949.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14bmphishing,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/crime-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/article31064950.ece
390,2020/03/14,"44 Indian pilgrims from Iran arrive in Mumbai, quarantined","They will spend 14 days at a Navy facility in Ghatkopar

Forty-four Indian pilgrims, who were stranded in Iran, arrived in Mumbai on Friday and were shifted to a new Indian Navy quarantine facility in Ghatkopar, where they will stay for the next 14 days.

A Mumbai International Airport Ltd spokesperson said the special Iran Air flight, IR810, from Tehran landed at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport at 12.07 p.m.

“All passengers and crew underwent screening by the airport health organisation at the isolation bay and were transferred directly from the aircraft to the Indian naval facility in Ghatkopar to follow the mandatory 14-day quarantine period,” the spokesperson said.

Though all 44, including 21 women, have tested negative for novel cororanvirus, the quarantine is a necessary protocol. This is the second batch of Indian pilgrims. All of them were part of a group of 120 Indians, 76 of whom will come on a Mahan Air flight that will reach Delhi on March 15. The first batch of 58 Indian pilgrims was brought back from Iran on March 10.

Iran is one of the worst-affected countries by the coronavirus outbreak and the government has been working to bring back the Indians stranded there. “Second batch of 44 Indian pilgrims has arrived today from #Iran. Our efforts to bring back the others continue. @India_in_Iran and our medical team - keep up the good work. Appreciate the support of Iranian authorities and their airlines,” External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar tweeted.

On Thursday, the government had said that there were over 6,000 Indians in various provinces of Iran. These include 1,100 pilgrims from Maharashtra and Jammu and Kashmir. All these Shia Muslim pilgrims are in Qom city. The shrines in Iran attract millions of Shia pilgrims every year. Besides the pilgrims, there are 300 students in different parts of that country.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/44-indian-pilgrims-from-iran-arrive-in-mumbai-quarantined/article31064941.ece
391,2020/03/14,Mountaineering fraternity in State staring at steep losses,"Nepal government to scrap Everest expeditions from today

The Nepal government’s announcement to cancel all climbing permits from Saturday till April 30 to Mount Everest in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic has sharply affected trekkers in Maharashtra.

With at least 1,000-odd trekkers from across the State and country venturing to Nepal for different expeditions, including scaling the Mount Everest and Kanchenjunga besides other peaks, mountaineers estimate cumulative losses to run into crores of rupees.

Besides the financial aspect, they rue the loss of many months of gruelling psychological and physical training for preparing for these often-risky expeditions. Speaking to The Hindu, veteran mountaineer Umesh Zirpe, who heads the ‘Giripremi’ club, which has conducted several mountaineering expeditions in Nepal, says that spring is the season where maximum Indian trekkers venture to climb the peaks in Nepal.

Mr. Zirpe said, “At least seven persons whom I know were to attempt scaling the Everest this season. Their average cost is around ₹25 lakh. On an average, 1,000 trekkers go for different expeditions like the Annapurna base camp and others in Nepal. If we take the average cost at ₹1 lakh for the lesser expeditions, and if all these are scrapped, as is likely to be the case, the financial loss incurred personally by the trekkers will be tremendous.”

Mr. Zirpe, who runs the Annapurna expedition to scale Mount Everest, was due to depart for Nepal on Saturday. “Whatever the scope of the expedition, mountaineers have to prepare physically and mentally from anything between 12 months to two years with all the dedication of sportsmen taking a shot at the Olympics,” he said.

Satyarup Siddhanta, a Bengaluru-based software engineer and record-setting mountaineer who has successfully scaled the seven highest summits as well as the seven volcanic mountain summits in the world, said the Nepal government’s decision was “very disappointing”. He said he hopes the Indian government will take some initiative in compensating for the losses incurred by the mountaineers.

“Unfortunately, we of the trekking fraternity are left in the lurch in such cases. I urge the Indian government not to look down upon mountaineering as just some other ‘adventure sport’ and take more interest in encouraging mountaineers, who are risking their lives to flutter their country’s flag in some of the world’s most hazardous spots,” said Mr. Siddhanta.

The COVID-19 outbreak has cast a shadow on Mr. Siddhanta’s second expedition to the North Pole. “My first expedition to the North Pole was cancelled owing to Ukraine-Russian tensions, while my second one is already hanging in the balance. I have thus far incurred a debt of ₹45 lakh which I have raised for these expeditions. Mountaineering is an extremely expensive business and the cancellation of the Everest expeditions is indeed a huge blow for the trekking fraternity,” he said.

Surendra Shelke, a city-based mountaineer with more than two decades of experience, said only the $11,000 ‘royalty’ or permit fee as charged by the Nepalese government gets carried forward, while the rest of the cost translates into losses for the mountaineers.

“The cost component is usually divided into the logistics at the base camp including tents and food, the fees of the Sherpas and the oxygen cylinders. For many Everest climbers, the scaling of the peak takes at least a couple of expeditions for which they raise money from banks and local sources and usually incur heavy debts,” he said.

Citing the tragic example of Pune mountaineer Nihal Bagwan, who tragically died during the descent from Mount Everest after scaling the peak, Mr. Shelke said he was deeply saddened when he visited the mountaineer’s home in Akluj in Solapur.

“It was Bagwan’s second attempt and he died due to exhaustion after scaling the peak, which had always been his dream. He had to abort his first expedition in 2017. In securing funds for both expeditions, he had incurred debts which ran into lakhs of rupees,” Mr. Shelke said, remarking that the scrapping of Everest expeditions was a disheartening blow to the mountaineering fraternity – both financially and psychologically.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mountaineering-fraternity-in-state-staring-at-steep-losses/article31064934.ece

A day after a 64-year-old man admitted to PD Hinduja Hospital for a heart ailment tested positive for COVID-19, as many as 96 people — including staff members and patients at the hospital, his family members and neighbours — are being closely watched for suspected exposure to the novel coronavirus.

Sources said those under watch include the patient’s treating doctor.

Late on Friday night his wife’s test was also confirmed as positive.

On Friday, the patient was shifted to Kasturba Hospital, where he is on oxygen support.

According to the BMC’s executive health officer Dr. Padmaja Keskar, 82 of those under watch are from the Hinduja hospital, including doctors, nurses, other staff members and a few patients.

“Of the 82, eight were high-risk contacts and were isolated at the Hinduja Hospital. Their swab samples have been sent for testing to Kasturba Hospital. The remaining 74 were advised home isolation,” said Dr. Keskar.

The 14 others include the patient’s wife and relatives, neighbours, and security guards at his building. Of these, seven were high-risk contacts and thus isolated at Kasturba Hospital, while the rest have been advised home isolation.

Five civic teams surveyed 460 households in the area where the patient lives. However, no symptomatic patient was found.

The patient, who had a travel history to Dubai, was admitted to Hinduja Hospital on March 8. His samples were sent for testing for the coronavirus on Thursday, and tested positive. But till then, he had come in contact with many people.

According to hospital source, “Due to the panic, some patients cancelled appointments, while some doctors did not attend the outpatient department.”

A statement from Hinduja Hospital said the hospital operations, including OPD and IPD, are functioning with necessary protocols. “All the medical and non-medical staff who came in direct or indirect contact with the affected patient have been screened and a few have been quarantined at home, as per government guidelines. Post the screening, hospital staff has been tested as negative for COVID-19,” it said, adding that necessary precautions for the personal safety of the staff and patients have been initiated.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/82-from-hinduja-hospital-under-observation/article31064905.ece
394,2020/03/14,"Previous govt. gave disproportionate funds, says Ajit Pawar","Finance Minister counters BJP’s charge that budget neglected regions in State

Finance Minister Ajit Pawar on Friday countered the Opposition’s charge that the State budget had neglected the needs of regions such as Vidarbha, Marathwada and north Maharashtra. Mr. Pawar also accused the previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government of reducing funds to other regions and allocating disproportionate funds to Nagpur, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s home district.

‘Adhered to norms’

During a discussion on the State budget, Mr. Pawar said the previous government did not follow the fund allocation norms. He said, “We adhered to the distribution norms. You took money from others and gave it to your districts. We didn’t do it.” Mr. Pawar said based on the size of the district, population, and human development index, Nagpur should have received ₹288 crore. However, it was allocated a total of ₹525 crore.

Mr. Pawar said his predecessor Sudhir Mungantiwar also allocated an excessive ₹160 crore to his home district of Chandrapur and Mumbai (city), Mumbai (suburbs), Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Pune, Sangli, Solapur, Kolhapur, Nashik, Aurangabad, and Amravati did not receive their due funds.

Stating that the budget is meant to give justice to all regions in the State, Mr. Pawar listed out various allocations made for the development and welfare of farmers and other groups in Vidarbha, Marathwada, and north Maharashtra. He said the government has so far sanctioned ₹11,340 crore under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule crop loan waiver scheme and disbursed money in 17.80 lakh accounts of farmers. He said the scheme has benefited six lakh farmers in Marathwada (₹3,600 crore), 3.87 lakh farmers in north Maharashtra (₹2,375 crore), 3.83 lakh farmers in Vidarbha (₹2,575 crore), and 3.43 lakh farmers in western Maharashtra (₹2,400 crore).

Mr. Pawar on Friday said the limit for legislators to purchase cars has been raised from ₹10 lakh to ₹30 lakh. The government will pay the interest for car loans.

Later, speaking to reporters outside the Assembly after his party boycotted the business in the House, Mr. Fadnavis said Mr. Pawar’s reply was “misleading” and merely a political speech.

Mr. Fadnavis said, “When we talked about the injustice meted to Vidarbha, Marathwada and north Maharashtra, Mr. Pawar tried to suggest that funds are being given to these regions by allocating just regular funds.”

The State government only gives guarantee when cotton is purchased from farmers annually, but Pawar is “creating an illusion” of doing a favour to the State’s cultivators, he alleged. Mr. Fadnavis said, “He said road and health works will be carried out, including in the Vidarbha region. If he thinks doing routine work means development of these regions, then it is completely wrong.”

Given the high number of COVID-19 patients in Pune, schools and colleges in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad will also be closed, he said, making an exception for students appearing for Class X and XII board exams.

The CM also asked private companies to allow employees to work from home wherever possible. Asked about schools and colleges in Mumbai, Mr. Thackeray said it is better not to spread panic. , “We will take the decision at the appropriate time.”

People who had left for China, South Korea, Italy, France, Germany, Spain and Iran after February 15 and will return after 5:30 p.m. on Friday will be quarantined as per the Centre’s guidelines. “However, those who tested positive for the infection in Maharashtra had been to Dubai, U.S. and France, which are not on the list sent by the Centre. We are informing them about the cases,” the CM said.

While the government cannot stop rail and bus services as they are essential services, the CM urged citizens to avoid unnecessary travel and crowds. “Avoid going to malls, restaurants and hotels. These are simple but very effective ways of prevention. Avoid being in large crowds, wash your hands with soap regularly, and greet people from a distance,” he said.

As the Epidemic Diseases Act was brought into effect in the State from midnight on Friday, religious institutions across the city stepped up precautionary measures.

The city is home to several places of worship such as the tomb of Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari, known as Haji Ali dargah; Makhdoom Ali Mahimi dargah, popularly called Mahim dargah; Siddhivinayak temple in Prabhadevi, Mahalakshmi temple; and hundreds of churches.

We conduct counselling sessions and spread awareness through social media. There has been no drop in the footfall at both dargahs. The doctors at Mahim dargah visit Haji Ali dargah to provide their services.”

Mr. Khandwani said earlier officials of the maintenance departments at both dargahs briefed visitors twice a day on hygiene, now they do it eight times. “We have put up posters on counselling sessions so that people can reach out to us,” Mr. Khandwani said.

Adesh Bandekar, chairman of Siddhivinayak Temple Trust, said sanitisers have been placed in the temple for devotees. He said, “We make sure that the railings are cleaned every 15 to 20 minutes and the staff wear masks. There has been a slight reduction in footfall as people are taking precautions and avoiding public gatherings. The primary concern is to not induce a sense of panic in the people, and to maintain high levels of cleanliness.”

Father Nigel Barrett, spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Bombay, said there are no restrictions on visiting churches. He said, “We are taking whatever precautions are advised, such as making sanitisers available. The use of biometrics in the offices has been stopped. The overall footfall of the faithful hasn’t dropped, although I cannot comment on any specific church. It is important to not create a sense of panic as that makes things much worse.”

A clerk at Mumbadevi temple said the staff members have been instructed to wear masks. Sharadchandra Padhye, general manager of Mahalakshmi Temple Trust, said that the footfall has dropped slightly. He said, “Posters have been put up informing people about precautionary measures. Only five to six men and women are allowed to enter the inner sanctum at a time to prevent physical contact with each another. The staff is advised to use sanitisers and masks, though use of masks is not compulsory as Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has himself said.”

Mr. Padhye said the temple is now cleaned once in 30 minutes and the inner sanctum is cleaned thoroughly using detergent.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/caygwr/article31064845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BMMUMBAICORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/places-of-worship-in-city-put-up-squeaky-clean-look/article31064846.ece
397,2020/03/14,"Coronavirus | Tell IT firms to issue work from home directive, says FITE","Employees’ forum says only 30% of IT park staff working from home due to lack of laptops

With some staff members of IT firms in Pune showing symptoms similar to that of COVID-19, the city chapter of the Forum for IT Employees (FITE) has urged the Pune District Collector and Guardian Minister to direct IT companies to make it mandatory for all employees to work from home.

Engineers who are part of the FITE claim that only 30% of the total IT workforce at the 120-odd companies located in Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park at Hinjewadi — most of them top management — is working from home as there are not enough laptops for everyone.

Lives at risk

The forum has alleged that the larger firms, by not making provisions for all their staff members to work from home, are putting employees’ lives at risk.

“While some firms, notably the smaller ones, have issued clear ‘work from home’ directives, the larger ones have left it to their employees to take a call. Only 30% of the total IT workforce in Hinjewadi, which includes senior management like project managers, critical lead resources, and support personnel, are being given laptops as companies don’t have the necessary infrastructure,” said Pavanjit Mane, president, FITE.

He urged the district authorities, the Guardian Minister or the Health Minister to make it incumbent upon IT firms, especially the bigger ones, to issue directives to their employees to work from home.

Earlier this week, one company from the Hinjewadi IT park and another from Magarpatta, had evacuated and sealed some offices after a couple of employees exhibited symptoms of the infection.

Sense of fear

“There is a real sense of paranoia pervading the Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park. An employee working in Phase 1 had shown COVID-19-like symptoms. So, are companies in Phase 2 waiting for the virus to infect their employees before permitting them to work from home? If so, they are putting employees at risk,” said FITE member Pravin Khajindar.

Gaurav Sisodia, another FITE member, said most companies have stopped the biometric thumb system of attendance and taken other precautionary measures. However, he said, “The decisions being taken are voluntary, and precautions are on an individual basis. Unless there is a clear indication on part of authorities making it compulsory for IT companies to follow certain stringent guidelines, employees continue to face the spectre of exposure,” he said.

Lack of preparedness

Another software engineer, requesting anonymity, said a larger question was IT firms’ total lack of preparedness to deal with disasters, something that came into sharp relief when the district was battered by heavy showers in August last year.

“At the time of excess rains last year, there was a similar ambivalence in instructions given by IT firms. While some categorically directed employees to work from home, others remained equivocal, thus putting the lives of employees in jeopardy, many of whom were forced to make a harrowing commute to Hinjewadi,” he said.

At the same time, Mr. Mane said there were practical problems in issuing a ‘work from home’ directive as well, given that a number of projects were being executed on the Agile framework, in which team members have to sit next each other.

He said the frequency of internal travel in the IT fraternity is also high, and as a result the monitoring would have to be tight.

“Furthermore, as many among the IT fraternity live in residential complexes, the possibility of exposure is very high. Recently, an IT engineer returned from the UAE. While he was checked at the airport, there is still a palpable fear among neighbours and co-workers. In such situations, a clear ‘work from home’ directive goes a long way in assuaging fear and panic,” Mr. Mane said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/emf27d/article31064831.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BMHINJEWADI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/tell-it-firms-to-issue-work-from-home-directive/article31064832.ece
398,2020/03/14,Coronavirus: Navy opens 100-bed quarantine camp in Ghatkopar,"Seven Hills Hospital in Marol will soon have 30-bed isolation ward

The Indian Navy on Friday commissioned a 100-bed quarantine camp for those suspected to have been infected with novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on the premises of its material organisation warehouse in Ghatkopar, thus adding to the existing 78 beds at Kasturba Hospital. Marol’s Seven Hills Hospital will also soon be converted into a quarantine facility for 300 people with an isolation ward of 30 beds.

“In accordance with a directive from the Department of Health and Family Welfare, government of India, to set up COVID -19 quarantine facilities in the vicinity of 30 major airports, the Western Naval Command (WNC) of the Indian Navy has set up a 100-bed quarantine camp at Ghatkopar,” chief public relations officer Commander Mehul Karnik said.

On Friday, the naval quarantine camp received its first lot of 44 people, who arrived from Tehran by an Air Iran flight at Mumbai airport. “These evacuees will be kept under observation for two weeks. The WNC remains committed to providing all possible assistance to the national and State authorities in the campaign to control the COVID–19 pandemic,” Commander Karnik said.

Back home: Indian evacuees brought from Iran at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai.

Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner Praveen Pardeshi and other officials visited Seven Hills Hospital on Friday morning for a review. BMC’s health officer Daksha Shah said the facility should be ready for use in the next few days. “Besides Seven Hills, there are 233 beds available for admissions in several city hospitals, including 78 in Kasturba Hospital,” Dr. Shah said.

The BMC is also making arrangements for geriatric care services, including ICU facility, for the management of complicated patients likely to be transferred.

So far, 1.6 lakh passengers from 1,390 flights have been screened by the airport health organisation at Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur airports. Till date, 238 symptomatic patients have been admitted.

399,2020/03/14,PIL urges court to issue orders to prevent spread of COVID-19,"21-page plea seeks directions to protect country’s population

A public interest litigation (PIL) was filed at the Bombay High Court on Friday seeking directions to prevent the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from affecting a large number of people.

The PIL was filed by 42-year-old social worker Sagar Jondhale, who said COVID-19 has been spreading in China’s Wuhan province since December 2019. He said over 4,000 people have lost their lives and one lakh people are under treatment. He said the virus is not limited to China, and has spread to the U.S., South Korea, Iran, Japan, Italy and over 100 countries in the world.

The PIL states, “If no proper precaution is taken in India, it will affect a large population. Considering the high density of population in India as well as limited resources for tackling the pandemic, it is likely to spread at a very high rate.”

The 21-page plea also mentions, “Some States like Kerala and Karnataka have already declared holidays for schools and colleges. However, the State government has yet not taken any serious preventive action.”

The PIL urged the court to pass directions to invite suggestions from various organisations and experts to make the Epidemic Diseases Act more effective to prevent the outbreak of dangerous diseases. It also sought the court to direct the Centre and the State government to set up an Epidemic Disease Control Board to take immediate steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

It also sought directions to issue a public notice to declare holidays for schools and colleges and direct subordinate courts, tribunals and quasi-judicial authorities to adjourn matters that are not of extreme urgency.

Mr. Jondale also urged the court to direct corporates and private companies to issue public notices to allow employees to work from home, the State to adopt hi-tech measures at airports, and ports to detect affected people. A Division Bench of acting Chief Justice B.P. Dharmadhikari and Justice Nitin Borkar will hear the matter on March 16.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pil-urges-court-to-issue-orders-to-prevent-spread-of-covid-19/article31064822.ece

Mr. Scindia, a long-time Congress leader and former Union minister, quit the party and joined the BJP on Wednesday. Taking a dig at Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis for doubting the longevity of the MVA government, Mr. Pawar said, “You have to keep your flock together.”

Mr. Pawar, who holds the finance portfolio, was speaking during a discussion on the State budget. He taunted BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar for his statement on Thursday that his party had made a mistake by ditching its ally the Shiv Sena last year. He also said just like in Madhya Pradesh, there will be a Scindia in Maharashtra too. “There is no pardon for the mistake,” Mr. Pawar said, looking in the direction of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray as the House burst into laughter.

401,2020/03/14,Private airport operators seek facilitation fee to tackle rise in operating expenses,"Letter to Centre also demands an airport operator alleviation package

The Association of Private Airport Operators (APAO) on Friday requested the Central government to allow levying of a nominal passenger facilitation charge as part of airline fares to cover increased operating expenses being incurred in the wake of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and fall in passenger volumes.

In a letter to the civil aviation secretary, APAO also sought provisioning of an airport operator alleviation package by the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority to facilitate the growing operational expenses, released in the next control period of applicable airport operators.

Citing Airports Council International (ACI) estimates, APAO said the Asia-Pacific region is suffering the most, with passenger traffic volumes down by 24% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to the forecast traffic levels without COVID-19. Against this gloomy background of sharp declines in traffic and passenger throughput, airports’ aeronautical revenues and non-aeronautical revenues are seeing similar declines.

The ACI World Airport Traffic Forecasts 2019-2040 project revenue loss owing to COVID-19 to the tune of $3 billion. “While cancellation of flights by various international and domestic carriers (a measure by airlines to save operational expenses in response to muted passenger demand) has impacted the air traffic management-related revenues for airports, reduced number of passengers has hit the passenger-related revenues,” APAO secretary general Satyan Nayar said.

Mr. Nayar said reduced passengers at airports have adversely impacted the non-aero revenues due to less sales at food and beverage and retail outlets. “Non-aero concessionaires have already started asking for reduced revenue share or minimum monthly guarantee which in turn will impact airport operators’ revenues.”

Besides, APAO said ensuring compliance with the government advisories on screening of passengers has required airports to significantly beef up their manpower deployment and spend on various items like masks, sanitisers, and floor cleaners.

“These issues are impacting the airport adversely with no offset or compensatory stream available and are severely impacting the cash flows for the airport operators,” Mr. Nayar said. He pointed out that this is unlike airlines which have got one major compensatory stream in terms of significantly reduced (more than 50%) crude oil prices, which make up almost 40% of their operational expenses.

APAO in its appeal to the government said it is also pertinent to mention that while airlines can choose to cancel flights or relocate their aircraft to other markets to reduce operating costs, airports face immediate cash flow pressures with limited ability to reduce fixed costs and few resources to fund capacity expansion efforts for long-term future growth.

“For privately-held airports, the situation is even worse as they do not benefit from relief measures but are obliged to continue paying concession fees to the regulator,” the APAO letter said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/private-airport-operators-seek-facilitation-fee-to-tackle-rise-in-operating-expenses/article31064780.ece
402,2020/03/14,Mrs. Mathrubootham writes in,"Sir/Madam, at midnight I was awoken by sound just like telephone cough ‘lokku-lokku’

Dear Madam,

Whether you are putting any phone call in last 4-5 days and having someone coughing lokku-lokku right inside your ear drums? Corona warning it seems but it is sounding very much as if Corona itself is calling. Like Yamaraja visiting through phone. First time I was so frightened I cut the call thinking maybe some over-eating or something is affecting my hearing.

But as you have printed in your esteemed newspaper somebody is filing PIL explaining to government that such realistic A.K. Hangal in deathbed coughing is not needed for health warning. Simple voice telling dos and don’ts is enough. Let us wait and see what learned judge will say. Some birds are telling he will refer to larger bench.

Meanwhile you must be wondering what happened to lovable rascal Mr. Mathrubootham? Lovable and all I don’t know but rascal I am fully agreeing. Why I am being like this when I should be thinking tender thoughts like Sita you are thinking? Madam, is every man allowing wife to live peacefully? No. Instead he is occupying best armchair in house for many hours and needing to be fed and watered 3-4 times a day. Like pet or plant. Not at all conducive to tender thoughts madam. It is not surprising Sita is preferring underground burrow to surface palace.

Anyway, yesterday evening I was returning from Ladies Club meeting at about 7:00 p.m. — we got delayed because Mrs. Shankaramenon was telling recipe for excellent nei appam contribution that she made for meeting. As I am entering flat I found Mr. M exiting flat in great hurry. ‘Why you are rushing and where you are going,’ I enquired.

‘Nothing, nothing Kamalam, you go inside and rest. I am going for walk,’ he said.

‘What walk?’ I asked. This was shrewd question on my part. Because I am knowing fully well he is doing Senior Yoga until 6 o’clock and then all those useless men from building will get together and talk and talk like no tomorrow. After all that activity Mr. M is always very hungry and then it is time for serving one more meals.

Mr. Mathrubootham is always hating it when I am shrewd. ‘She is shrew when she is shrewd hahaha’ is the unfunny joke he has cracked some 10,566 times. (Yes, I have counted, what it is to you?)

But he had to stop and reply. ‘Why you are always so curious ma? Go inside and keep dosai ready. I am coming in 10-15 minutes after brisk walk.’ As you are well knowing, madam, Mr. Mathrubootham has not taken one brisk walk in entire life so my ears are quivering like antenna on intelligent mosquito.

As soon as he has gone out of sight I rushed into corner bedroom which has one window where if you put head out at 45 degrees angle you can see corner of road and corner of building gate. Immediately I can see reason of rushing. One group of ladies from building are standing and doing haha-hehe over there while 2-3 men like that foolish Shankaramenon are putting jalra. This was urgent evening walk for Mr. Mathrubootham.

‘How was walk? You’re not sweating?’ I asked when he came back. ‘Oh it was so cool outside,’ he said. I served the dosai which was also quite cool and drooping like cloth. Then went off to sleep.

At midnight I was awoken by sound just like telephone cough lokku-lokku. The cool evening air is not agreeing with one retired gentleman in my house. He is now sleeping in guest bedroom. Like Italian quarantine I told him.

Yours with exasperation,

Mrs. Mathrubootham",columns,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/wi86h/article31060616.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-826910276,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/mrs-mathrubootham-writes-in/article31060250.ece
403,2020/03/14,The other side of the coronavirus story,"Like you, I also follow a three-step process of washing my hands: I first wash them with soap, then with Dettol, and then with gau mutra

I’ve been thinking: What if all that the coronavirus wants is harmonious coexistence? Before you bite my head off and burn my house down, hear me out. I have no wish to defend the coronavirus. I’m as terrified of it as you are. Like you, I also follow a three-step process of washing my hands: I first wash them with soap, then with Dettol, and then with gau mutra. Like you, I also have cow dung smoothies every morning to build my immunity against coronavirus. And the most important thing that I try to do, and which I encourage all of you to do, is to follow the recommendation of honourable Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Shri Yogi Adityanath-ji. His advice is simple: overcome mental stress to overcome coronavirus.

Easier said than done, I know. It could be rather difficult not to get mentally stressed when you know that your very survival depends on not getting mentally stressed. The knowledge that even a little bit of mental stress can make you susceptible to the dreaded coronavirus can be a most stress-inducing thing. And constant awareness of the fact that your stress levels are rising because of your rising stress levels, can further raise your stress levels, until you’re on a self-reinforcing spiral of ever-escalating mental stress that leaves you almost wishing for a coronavirus-carrier to just drop by and say ‘achoo’.

Anyway, my point is that I don’t belong to any political party that supports the coronavirus. But we are a democracy, I am a liberal, and I believe it is the duty of every journalist to present both sides of every story. Which is why I’m devastated by the failure of my peer members to retain even a semblance of neutrality, objectivity, and balance in their coverage of the coronavirus disease, or COVID-19, as it’s called. Don’t ask me who came up with that name, because who did come up with that name.

Apex predators

I know that, as a species, we currently occupy the position once occupied by the dinosaurs. We are the apex predators. The power elite that oppresses every other life form on planet Earth. But does that mean the only perspective that exists is the human perspective? Isn’t it this very mindset that’s responsible for the massive loss of biodiversity and the whole mess of climate change? And yet, I haven’t seen a single news report or editorial or column where the writer takes into account the virus’s point of view as well.

Again, let me emphasise that I don’t endorse violence by viruses, be it against humans or other viruses. That’s the reason I’ve always condemned the well-known computer virus Agent Smith’s anti-national statements against human beings. If you’ve seen the famous three-part documentary, The Matrix, you’d know what I’m talking about. If you haven’t, you should. It’s the only extant documentation of the virus’s perspective on humanity.

For the benefit of those who haven’t seen the Matrix trilogy, this is what the A.I.-created virus Agent Smith says about humans: “When I tried to classify your species, I realised that you’re not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we are the cure.”

Revolutionary vanguard

What if this was actually the case? Can anyone deny that our entire economic model is geared towards depleting every planetary resource? Also, ask any biologist of your choice. She’ll tell you that viruses are one of the earliest inhabitants of this planet. They were here long before the first human appeared. Not surprisingly, viruses are convinced that human beings are migrants – from another planet, and in all likelihood a planet that used to be beautiful and habitable until they gutted it, prompting the move to earth. According to my sources, as of March 2020, all non-human life forms are convinced that if humans continue to run amok — decimating forests, murdering rivers, polluting oceans — it won’t be long before either they and/ or the planet are liquidated.

What if viruses are the revolutionary vanguard of the planet’s non-human beings? What if they are the guerrilla army of Nature, battling the biggest threat to the biosphere? And what if ‘quarantine’ is just the coronavirus sending humans to detention camp? Answer this question objectively: which of the two represents a bigger threat to the greatest number of species on earth? Homo sapiens or Sars-CoV2? Now tell me: are there or are there not two sides to the COVID-19 story? Of course there are: the virus's side, and the Sars-CoV2’s side.

Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) V. Vaithilingam has requested the Railway Ministry to lay a new rail line between Puducherry and Cuddalore.

Participating in the Demands for Grants for Railways on Thursday, Mr. Vaithilingam said a rail line would ease traffic congestion on the stretch. People find it very difficult to commute on the route due to the heavy volume of traffic.

District Collector S. Gopalakrishnan has ordered the closing down of malls, gatherings on beaches and at other public places under the Disaster Management Act as part of steps to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Announcing the measures at a press conference here on Saturday, a day after two more cases were confirmed in the district, he said that an advisory will also be issued to commercial establishments involving personal contact, including gyms, ayurvedic massage centres, saloons and spas, to function only in unavoidable circumstances.

“All public gatherings have to be stopped. Functions like marriages should be conducted with the least number of guests possible. As for festivals, this is not the time to show our religious faith, rather it is the time to save ourselves and the community. We are not yet issuing a complete ban on gyms, massage centres and spas, due to livelihood concerns. But, an advisory will be issued to remain closed, if possible, and take all precautions in case they are functioning,” said the Collector.

He also requested the public in the district to avoid getting out of their houses unnecessarily. People in Varkala should take special care as the Italian tourist who tested positive for COVID-19 had spent around 15 days in the place, and had visited shops and restaurants in the area. His contact tracing is still being carried out.

“One thing we noticed in the case of people who were in home quarantine is that they were not fully in quarantine within their homes. They were in close contact with their family members. This should be avoided. The person who is suspected of being affected should spend the entire duration within a closed room. Food or other essential items should be left at the door. Real home quarantine is the best solution. Those who are returning from abroad should be in home quarantine for 28 days. As of now, the virus has not spread at the community level. So, we have to take all steps to arrest its spread,” said Mr. Gopalakrishnan.

Those who have mild cough or throat infection need not visit hospitals, but should remain within their houses. In case of any symptoms of the disease, they should contact the nearest primary health centre or community health centre or any Government hospital. The district collectorate’s control room (contact no – 1077) can also be contacted, as doctors have been posted for this purpose.

406,2020/03/14,"KIIFB will insist on quality, says Public Works Minister","It had ordered stoppage of 10 road works due to such issues

The technical inspection wing of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) had ordered the stoppage of 10 road construction works temporarily on reasons ranging from lack of quality of work to overshooting of the deadline, Public Works Minister K.Sudhakaran told the Assembly on Friday.

Nine projects

The work on nine of these projects, all of which are overseen by the Kerala Road Fund Board, were later restarted after seeking reports from the contractors responsible and after site inspections by the chief engineer and other officials.

As on Friday, only the stop memo of the MES College-Payyanadam road in Palakkad executed by KCP Engineers is pending, for which instructions have been given to fulfil the directions in the observation memo.

The Minister pointed out the name of Kudroli Construction Company, three of whose works were issued stop memos.

No compromise

“The government is not ready to compromise on quality of the work. Out of 200 road works funded by KIIFB, issues have been noticed in only ten. This was due to serious failings on the part of the contractors. If the construction companies are not ready to rectify their mistakes, steps including cancellation of licence will be taken. Action will also be taken against engineers who fail to report issues,” said Mr. Sudhakaran.

Land acquisiton

To a question on the delay in starting the works on the coastal highway project, he said land acquisition has been a roadblock, though funds of ₹6,500 crore has been set aside for this.

Fish worker families, who live together in the coastal region, are reluctant to part with their land even though proper compensation is offered.

Even if they have to be provided land, it has to be given near the coast, from where they can go for fishing easily.

For the hill highway, work on 12 reaches could not happen, as the Forest Department has not provided land for the project.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/kiifb-will-insist-on-quality-says-public-works-minister/article31064518.ece
407,2020/03/14,Three persons found dead at Kulathoor,"Two were strangled to death

Three members of a family were found dead under suspicious circumstances in a house near Kazhakuttam early Friday.

The bodies of Suresh, 35, who hailed from Vembayam, his wife Sindu, 30 and their nine-year old son Sharon were found in a rented house in Kulathoor. The police suspected Suresh to have committed suicide by hanging himself after strangulating the others to death, following a domestic dispute.

Voice message

According to the Kazhakuttam police, Suresh allegedly sent a voice message on WhatsApp by around 6 a.m. to Sindu’s sister’s husband in which he asked him to rush to their house.

After subsequent efforts to contact them on phone turned futile, Sindu’s parents, who hail from Manvila, rushed to the house to find the lifeless bodies. While Suresh was found hanging from a plastic rope, the bodies of Sindu and Sharon were found covered using a mat and a bed sheet respectively.

The bodies were soon shifted to the mortuary of the Government Medical College Hospital and forensic experts collected evidence from the house.

Suresh, who has been working abroad for three years, returned last month and had been working as an autorickshaw driver ever since.

Sindu had been working in a private company in Pattom. Sharon was a Class 4 student in the CSI English Medium School in Ambalathinkara.

Kerala Tourism is gearing up to launch a ₹50-crore Travancore backwater cruise tourism circuit linking the brackish water Kadinamkulam Lake, the biggest inland waterbody of capital district, and the Anchuthengu and Akathumuri lakes.

A final shape to the circuit is being worked out by Kerala Tourism Infrastructure Ltd (KTIL) to commence civil works this year, Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran said in the Assembly on Thursday, replying to demands for grants in the Budget for 2020-2021 for tourism.

Adventure tourism

The government is looking into the possibility of integrating adventure tourism and water sports for the proposed circuit, he said.

Anjengo Fort, Lighthouse, Asan Memorial, Kayikkara, and historical places en route to south of Varkala will form part of the circuit involving three lakes with Perumathura, 29 km north of Thiruvananthapuram.

A three-hour cruise from Kadinamkulam Lake to Akathumuri is possible if houseboats and speedboats are introduced and berths are constructed at Perumathura, Asan Memorial, Hanging Bridge, and the Panayilkadavu for boat operations.

Commencing from Kadinamkulam, the cruise will cover Perumathura bridge, Muthalapozhi, fishing harbour, Anchuthengu Fort, Anchuthengu lighthouse, Hanging Bridge, Asan Memorial, and Ponnumthuruthu (Golden Island), a privately-owned island in Akathumuri Lake, and conclude at Nedunganda Onnam Palam.

A ₹100-crore Travancore heritage tourism project to protect the heritage structures of Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Pathanamthitta districts will be launched this year. The process to select the consultancy is on and it will be launched this year as ₹10 crore has been provided in budget, the Minister said.

Considering the success of the Miyawaki afforestation project on the Kanakakunnu palace premises in the capital, Mr. Surendran said the model would be adopted for afforestation at 50 centres under Kerala Tourism this year.

Regulatory authority

The Minister said the proposed tourism regulatory authority would be set up this year and the draft Bill was ready. This would help put an end to the harassment of tourists and control the unhealthy practices in the sector.

Administrative sanction had been given for a ₹16.5-crore project to construct airport-model toilets at key tourist places.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/tnsadv/article31064478.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvbackwater-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/50-cr-backwater-cruise-on-the-anvil/article31064479.ece
409,2020/03/14,Geotube breakwater at Poonthura soon,"Five breakwaters of 100-m length will be installed initially

Coastal protection works using sea walls made of groynes and rocks maybe a thing of the past with the Fisheries Department going ahead with the first offshore breakwater using geotubing at Poonthura.

Fisheries Minister J.Mercykutty Amma told the Assembly on Friday that the project is set to take off in April.

The project is being implemented with the technical support of the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT). The department had a few months ago begun a pilot of the project at Poonthura, with the construction of a 700-metre-long offshore breakwater using geotubing.

“The NIOT Director was in the State on Thursday. We conducted a review of the pilot. The tender has also been opened and we have identified a contractor. The first such breakwater in the State will be from Poonthura to Shanghumukhom. We expect the work to begin by April this year with an expected completion time of three months. The NIOT has experience in building breakwater using geotubes at Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu, which will be the model we will be following here,”she said.

The Minister said that if the project is proved successful, it can be replicated across the State’s coastline. This will help in protecting the coastline without mowing down hills for rocks.

Funds for the project have been sanctioned from the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). With the implementation of the project, the breakwater will intercept the waves 120m from the shore. The reduced intensity of the waves will prevent coastal erosion, and allow beach enhancement. Fishers too will have no problems in beaching their boats.

The offshore breakwater will be built parallel to the shore. Five breakwaters of 100-m length will be installed initially. They will be situated 50 m apart. Boats will be able to reach the shore through these gaps.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/geotube-breakwater-at-poonthura-soon/article31064447.ece
410,2020/03/14,"Improve service delivery, govt. told","Coordination of Revenue, Survey and Registration departments needed: ARC

The Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) has asked the government to move towards people-centred service delivery by accepting affidavits given by the people who seek services instead of the present requirement of submitting certificates at multiple points for availing services.

Adoption of this system will improve satisfaction of people about service delivery by the government, reduce workload of officials and reduce and eliminate corruption, the Commission headed by former Chief Minister, V. S. Achuthanandan said in its fifth report to the government on Friday.

Penalty for submission of incorrect information will be sufficient deterrence in committing fraud.

“Certifying of personal information by government officials is a relic of the colonial era and has no place in the democratic system of governance,” the Commission has noted.

In land-related services provided by the Revenue, Survey and Registration departments, the Commission said the improvement of service delivery can be achieved only through integrated service delivery of these departments and a time-bound move to the system of conclusive titles.

Till conclusive titling is implemented, mandating the survey map and Record of Rights accompany the deed for registration.

A Digital Family Register accessible to all notified officials had been suggested till the adoption of self certification.

Develop SOP

All departments should develop a manual of standard operating procedures (SOP), including details of documents required for each service, fees in Malayalam and English (Kannada and Tamil where it is applicable) and should make it available through Akashya Centres, associated service delivery points, ration shops and document writers office, the Commission has recommended.

Grass-root level community workers, Anganwadi workers, SC/ST promoters, ASHA workers should be empowered to provide necessary information to the people. All relevant information should be provided in the websites and it should be updated. A poster of new initiatives like ‘Thuna’ should be displayed prominently in public places including schools in the State.

Doorstep collection

The Commission has asked the government to take steps for doorstep collection of the applications and delivery of services at least for the vulnerable people.

The government has been asked to being collective responsibility in Right to Service and service delivery by fixing time-lines for each stage of service to be delivered instead of fixing accountability to a particular officer.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/improve-service-delivery-govt-told/article31064423.ece

415,2020/03/14,"ISL | ATK has the final laugh, picks up a record third title","Javier Hernandez’s brace leaves Chennaiyin FC ruing its missed chances

Javier Hernandez’s brace helped ATK defeat Chennaiyin FC in the final and create Indian Super League history, at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Saturday.

A handful of lucky people — mainly friends and family of the team owners who were given special access — were witness to the interesting action which was held behind closed doors because of the Coronavirus scare.

In guiding ATK to its record third title, Antonio Lopez Habas became the most successful coach of the ISL as the Spaniard picked his second crown while returning to the side after a break of three seasons. The ATK centre-half Hernandez, who had never scored before the final, stepped up as the finisher scoring the first and the third goals while Spainard Edu Garcia scored one in between. Nerijus Valskis pulled one back for Chennaiyin FC late in the second half.

Missed chances

The final could have easily gone the other way had Chennaiyin FC managed to avail two opportunities in the first four minutes.

Chennaiyin FC pressed the attack mode right from the start and had Andre Schembri running up the right to cut the ball back to winger Rafael Crivellaro in the box.

The latter’s attempt took a deflection off an ATK defender and was headed into the goal but Pritam Kotal made a timely goalmouth clearance to the save ATK. Keeping up the pressure, Chennaiyin made another inroad in the fourth minute but this time it was the crosspiece that blocked Valskis’ attempt.

ATK released the pressure by the getting the goal in the 10th minute. It was the result of a fantastic combination in the attack which saw Roy Krishna moving up on the left to collect a long floater from the centre.

The Fijian forward essayed a nice cross upfront to his colleague David Williams, who played a dummy letting Hernandez move from the centre and finish with a spectacular scissors kick. ATK could have doubled the lead in the 23rd minute when Krishna set up another cross which was partially cleared by Vishal Kaith.

Schembri had the chance to draw level for Chennaiyin FC in the 31st minute but the ATK goalkeeper Arindam Bhattattacharya put up a fantastic effort to clear the former’s header. The ATK suffered a big blow when Roy Krishna walked off the pitch in tears after suffering in injury in the 40th minute. The setback, however, did not appear to hurt ATK much as it came back after the break to double the lead in the 48th minute.

Edu Garcia did the finishing act to set ATK on the victory path. Valskis made it 2-1 in the 69th minute but that appeared to come a bit late as ATK effectively sealed its back-line. Hernandez made it 3-1 in the injury-time to complete a fantastic win for ATK.

Motorists had a tough time as scores of people turned up on the main roads of the city to cheer candidates, belonging to various political parties, who went in a procession to file their nominations for the GVMC polls, on the last day of filing nomination on Friday.

The traffic at Chitralaya Junction came to a standstill as vehicles from all sides were caught in the traffic jam as candidates came to file their nominations at the GVMC Zonal Office at Suryabaugh. The police had a tough time in regulating the traffic and clearing the crowd.

Women, with babies in their arms, turned up in large numbers in the nomination rallies and the BRTS Road near Gnanapuram was chock-a-block with people, who participated in the election rallies. While the contesting candidate and two supporters were allowed to go to the GVMC Zonal Office at Gnanapuram, all other supporters were stopped on the BRTS Road, about half-a-kilometre away. This added to the chaos as a number of candidates, belonging to various parties, along with their supporters converged at Gnanapuram.

423,2020/03/14,We have come through: Review of Isabel Allende’s ‘A Long Petal of the Sea’,"Allende’s affecting, if a bit too optimistic, story of displacement and homelessness, hits home

Sample these lines: “Friends are fighting, families are split down the middle; it’s impossible to talk to anyone who doesn’t think as you do.” Or, “People grew accustomed to the sight of the police in riot gear, protest placards and banners, inflammatory posters, the threats and catastrophic warnings in the press…” Or, “…people lived in the midst of lies, omissions and euphemisms, in grotesque exaltation of the blessed fatherland, brave soldiers and traditional morality.”

Spanning continents

Just like that, Isabel Allende’s new novel puts us square in the middle of contemporary India. Except it isn’t, of course. A Long Petal of the Sea is set mostly in Chile, at the other end of the earth from where we are, in a different time. But these words from the novel describe the days just preceding the horrifying, repressive Pinochet regime, which lasted 17 years when many died and many others went missing. We know all too well that for many people displacement and homelessness in times of political upheaval is a lived reality, but never has it hit so close to home.

A Long Petal of the Sea spans continents and countries, takes you all the way from Spain to Chile, from Chile to Venezuela, and back to Spain and Chile again as we wander hopelessly with its protagonists, Victor and Roser, who escape from the brutal Spanish Civil War only to find themselves caught up, years later, in a similar situation in their adoptive South American country.

At the heart of the novel is a love story of two people thrown together because of circumstances not in their control, though beyond a point it fails to move, owing primarily to Allende’s narrative style that keeps the reader at arm’s length, protecting you from the worst, so that even when terrible events unfold you see them with the interested but detached gaze of a bystander.

It also makes things bearable that, despite their tribulations, Victor, a doctor, and Roser, a musician, do very well for themselves, landing on their feet every single time. Towards the end the book drags, seeming to repeat itself so that after a point you are just chewing gum.

Full circle

Chapters open with beautiful verse by Pablo Neruda — the title is taken from a Neruda quote too, and what a lyrical way to describe the long strip of a country that runs along South America’s south-west coastline.

The poet also makes a guest appearance in the book; he plays a small but significant role in the fate of Victor and Roser. Clearly Allende admires him deeply, but with his memoir now being read in a new context, some readers might feel conflicted. To rub salt into the wound there’s a blink and you’ll miss the mention of Picasso.

Allende’s novel has lessons for the world as we know it today, but it is also full of hope and optimism. The world carries on despite dictators and despots and eventually things come full circle.

424,2020/03/14,‘The Constitution was meant to interrogate relationships of power’: Gautam Bhatia,"Gautam Bhatia on how the Constitution tries to bring democracy out of the public and into our social and private lives

Through nine cases in The Transformative Constitution:A Radical Biography in Nine Acts, shortlisted for the Hindu Prize for Non-Fiction, Gautam Bhatia gives us a glimpse of constitutional interpretation not as it is, but as it can and should be. An excerpt from a short interview:

Why should we read the Constitution as a radical charter? How should we interpret the ‘transformative’ Constitution?

The Constitution was meant to be “transformative” in two ways. It was intended to alter the relationship between individual and state, by turning erstwhile subjects of the colonial regime into citizens of a democratic republic. This was accomplished through a number of classic civil and political rights — freedom of speech, personal liberty, equality, and so on — which constrained state power.

In a second, and equally important, sense, the Constitution was meant to interrogate hierarchies and relationships of power and domination that existed within what we now understand as the “private sphere” (e.g., caste groups, the family, and so on). This was to be accomplished through “horizontal rights” that existed between private parties, such as Article 17 (prohibition of untouchability), Article 23 (prohibition of forced labour), and Article 15(2) (non-discrimination in access to public spaces).

Did the framing of the Constitution signify continuity or an obliteration of the past?

There was a form of administrative continuity, with much of the governance structure being borrowed from the 1935 Government of India Act. There was also a degree of unfortunate substantive continuity, with rules about preventive detention, emergency powers, and so on, being replicated from colonial legal structures.

However, the overall thrust of the Constitution was transformative in the manner outlined above, and the continuities — as I argue in the book — need to be read and understood in the light of an overall transformative framework (which would, for example, require the preventive detention provisions to be read very narrowly).

You write that Ambedkar “distilled the heart and soul of the Indian Constitution” in his concluding speech to the Constituent Assembly where he said that the principles of liberty, equality and fraternity “form a union of trinity” and cannot be treated as separate items. Why is this important in the Indian social context?

It is important because, as Ambedkar recognised, in India the state has never been the sole locus of power, domination, and oppression. Social groups, community structures, religious injunctions — all these and more have affected individuals’ standing in society, as well as their freedom and dignity.

Ambedkar envisioned the idea of “fraternity” as the bridge that would make freedom and equality meaningful for people, by ensuring that these values applied not only to the state, but also to the private sphere. In other words, it was an effort to bring democracy out of the public domain, and extend it to our private lives, within the family, community, and so on.

What role does the fundamental rights chapter play? Have the polity and judiciary failed the Constitution?

The fundamental rights chapter is the concrete manifestation of the demands of liberty, equality and fraternity, by making them enforceable in specific terms. The record of both the legislature and the judiciary has been mixed. Laws such as the Right to Information Act and the Forest Rights Act represent legislative attempts to enact these values, but these have been few and far between. The courts have had a patchy record themselves, on enforcing the vertical aspect of the transformative Constitution (curtailing state power), by often deferring to the legislature and the executive on core fundamental rights issues such as liberty and personal freedom (for example, the National Security Act, the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, the TADA, and the POTA were all upheld by the Supreme Court).

And the horizontal aspect of transformation has, with a few exceptions, not yet been engaged with. This is why I refer to the nine cases in my book as constituting a “contrapuntal canon” (borrowing from Edward Said).

They give us a glimpse of constitutional interpretation not as it is, but as what it can — and should — be.

425,2020/03/14,The Indian publishing house that’s become a movement,"The story of Yogesh Maitreya and Panther’s Paw and how it all came about

One of the poems in Yogesh Maitreya’s collection of poetry, The Bridge of Migration, is titled ‘Proof of Merit’. The short poem, about handlers of carcasses who write beautiful poems and stories when given an opportunity, resounds like a thunderclap in the midst of this continuing debate about merit and reservations that we have in our deeply casteist society.

The hands

Confined

To pull

Dead carcasses,

Started to write

And, and

They wrote poems

Beautiful stories

Of their lives.

Exclusive coteries

Maitreya’s poems are simple, just like this one. Bereft of tropes that one usually associates with poetry, Maitreya’s poems often come across as just a collection of words. However, the feeling of indignation and a desire to rise against the odds cannot be missed in the simple, seemingly unpoetic verse.

The varna or caste system leaves the job of clearing carcasses to those who don’t belong even to the lowest rungs of the caste hierarchy. While the Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya castes are relatively sharply defined, the fourth rung, the Shudras, are further divided into sub-castes — so that ‘Shudra’ might perhaps be called a group of castes and not a caste.

Consider this: among the Brahmins, a Dubey can marry a Choubey and a Mishra can marry a Pandey; among the Kshatriyas, a Singh can marry a Thakur. But among the Shudras, a Yadav cannot marry a Mahato and a Pramanik cannot marry a Mandal. This should give a hint of how the caste system allows the Savarnas to place themselves in exclusive coteries where they can have relationships with others of their kind and exploit their oneness to their advantage, but the Shudras have almost no scope of interacting with other Shudras because the caste system further sub-divides them. A Pandey is only a Brahmin, but a Pramanik is a Shudra as well as someone from the barber caste. This is perhaps where the importance of the term ‘Bahujan’ — literally meaning ‘the majority of people’ — as opposed to ‘Savarna’ can be seen.

The fifth caste

The castes that clear carcasses don’t feature in these four main castes. The removers of carcasses have always been treated as ‘impure’ and ‘untouchable’ by the four castes, and these ‘untouchables’ have not really been a part of the Hindu-Brahmini Dharma or their caste system, even though the proponents of the system have called them ‘Atishudra’ (inferior than even the Shudras) and the pancham varna or the fifth caste — the rank fifth denoting that the caste system places the untouchables in a far worse position than the Shudras.

I am writing this piece in Jharkhand, where it is the task of the Dom caste to clear carcasses. Historically, Doms have been treated as impure. However, with changing times, these ‘impure’ people have, through education and opportunities, risen up in life and earned a relatively respectable place for themselves.

Today, Dom is one of the Scheduled Castes (SC) in India, while the Dom people, along with other oppressed people generally on the bottom tiers of the caste ladder, have come to be known by the politically heavy term Dalit. Dalit includes not only those castes which were once untouchables or which are included today in the SC, but also those castes which were called Shudra earlier and which may, in the present time, be included in the Backward Castes (BC) or the Other Backward Castes (OBC). Despite all of them being Dalit, the BC and the OBC members might still treat former untouchables or other SCs as inferior or even untouchable — this should not come as a surprise.

Dom people have traditionally lived in ghettoes marked exclusively for them. People higher up on the caste system — even those from the BC and the OBC, who might be called Dalit — do not live in these ghettoes, which are traditionally considered impure and untouchable. The ghettoes are called basti, and because Gandhi has had such an influence on our society and because Gandhi called Untouchables “Harijans” (people of god), these ghettoes came to be known as Harijan basti.

On the periphery

There was a Harijan basti in Ghatsila, my hometown, whose residents were employed as the sanitation staff in the nearby copper company. Cleaning drains and toilets and afterbirth in the company hospital’s labour room were tasks that people of other castes would just not do. In Chandil, where I now work and live, there is a Dom basti: Dom Para. Since the name sounds too indicative of the caste and our society practises caste discrimination but does not like to talk about caste, many people — including some Doms too — prefer to call the Dom Para by a moderate-sounding name, Kalindi Para, Kalindi being a common surname for people of the Dom caste in this part of Jharkhand.

The discrimination they have faced down the ages might have suppressed the voice of the Dom people; but now, they are a vocal and assertive lot. They demand what is due to them, and despite being aware of their precarious position, are not too afraid or intimidated. Their power is particularly visible during the elections when politicians distribute blankets in the Dom Para — their numbers make the Doms a formidable vote bank. The point, however, is that the Untouchables have always been excluded, placed in isolation, on the periphery.

Maitreya grew up in one such basti in Nagpur in Maharashtra. Nagpur is an interesting place. Apart from being the second capital of Maharashtra and famous for its oranges, it is Nagpur’s religious and socio-political position that is noteworthy. This is where the right-wing, Hindu nationalist organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), was founded in 1925. Nagpur is where the Dalit Buddhist movement (the Navayana or the Neo-Buddhist movement) was started in 1956, when Dr. B.R. Ambedkar publicly converted to Buddhism, rejecting Hinduism and its caste system.

Dignity of labour

Maitreya was born Yogesh Suresh Wanjari in a Buddhist family in Nagpur. Theoretically, as a Buddhist, he should have had no caste. But his forefathers were Hindus who had converted, in 1956 with Ambedkar, to Buddhism, and, like Ambedkar, Maitreya’s forefathers too belonged to the Mahar caste. Mahars were Untouchables, and are today categorised as SC, “and since we live in… a caste society,” Maitreya told me over email, “and since… Mahars converted to Buddhism as a movement, the society still sees us as Mahars or untouchable.”

A basti might denote segregation but living in a basti with others of the same caste ensured that Maitreya’s interaction with the other castes — read: non-Dalit — was minimal and, hence, as a child, he did not face caste discrimination. He grew up hearing from the people in his basti that they were Buddhist and Ambedkar’s people; hence, ‘caste’ was a word he was not aware of for a long time.

Also, the residents of Maitreya’s basti were known for what he calls “their militant attitude and fury”. Several residents from Maitreya’s basti were government employees, financially independent and secure. Therefore, despite the existence of higher castes like Brahmins and Kunbis, which have been included among OBCs, around their basti, there was never, in Maitreya’s memory, any incident of “caste conflict in the direct manner”. Maitreya first confronted caste when he had to collect his post-matric scholarship. That was when he had to get a caste certificate made, which said that he belonged to the Mahar caste and was an SC.

Maitreya’s childhood was beset with financial difficulties. His father worked as a driver. When the family’s financial crisis deepened, his mother started to work as a domestic help, something she does even now. Her children today ask her to stop working in other people’s houses, but Maitreya’s mother refuses. “You work for yourself,” Maitreya recalls his mother telling him, “I too should work for myself as long as I can.” Maitreya believes that people who labour and earn have a strong sense of dignity and that, perhaps, is why his mother continues to work.

Buddha of friendship

Maitreya had to discontinue studies for five years after his Class X board exam, during which time he worked to support himself. It was only later that he was able to return to studies and complete Class XII. Even after that, he had to work for another year before college. It was during this time that Maitreya realised that for a person like him with no social capital, sustaining oneself materially and intellectually was very important. Realising the importance of money and education, Maitreya focussed on education.

Today, Maitreya is a PhD scholar at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) in Mumbai, which he joined in 2013 as a post-graduate student. As a poet and writer, Maitreya is known by his pen name; a name he adopted long ago, in 2008. For a brief period, Maitreya had been in contact with a Buddhist order whose approach to Buddhism was totally spiritual with no social pursuit. Maitreya Buddha is believed to be the Buddha of a future time, who will be born as a symbol of friendship. Maitreya does not believe in the story of Maitreya Buddha any longer, but he liked the concept of Maitreya Buddha so much that he decided to adopt Maitreya as his name even before he had actually written anything.

It was at TISS that the idea of creating Panther’s Paw Publications came to him. Maitreya says: “I have seen that the history and stories of my community have always been that of victims. From where I come, I have not seen my community as a victim, but a community of militant people.” Maitreya could not relate to the Dalit texts that he was tasked with reading at TISS.

When he read the first volume of J.V. Pawar’s writings on the Post-Ambedkar Ambedkarite Movement — written originally in Marathi — he realised that the history of Dalits was different from what was taught in institutes like TISS where the medium of instruction is English.

Learning from observation

That was when he decided to translate into English the writings of Pawar, who was one of the founding members of the Dalit Panthers. Once the translation was done, the question was who would publish it. Maitreya decided to publish the work himself. He had no experience and no knowledge about publishing, so he decided to learn from observation. The people who helped make Panther’s Paw Publications possible were mostly Buddhists, Ambedkarites and a few Savarnas with an anti-caste vision.

Someone directed Maitreya to a printer-cum-publisher — an enterprise run by a Savarna — in Prabhadevi, Mumbai. Maitreya says: “Most of the people running this press were Communists. I got a chance to see the publication process closely... I started visiting the press often and learnt about paper varieties, size, cover page quality, production cost, etc.”

Maitreya decided to name his publishing house Panther’s Paw Publications after the Dalit Panthers — who were writers, poets, intellectuals, and later leaders. Panther’s Paw, in Maitreya’s words, is an independent, anti-caste publishing house that aims to follow the footprints of the Dalit Panthers and is a part of the larger Dalit movement and not merely a business organisation. With its main office in Nagpur, Maitreya’s hometown, Panther’s Paw Publications published its first title in 2016, Ambedkarite Movement After Ambedkar by J.V. Pawar, translated from Marathi by Maitreya. Today, it is coming out with its seventh title, Sangeeta Mulay’s Savitribai Phule and I, the story of a Dalit girl who goes from a village to the city to study in an engineering college.

Its main office is in Nagpur but the publication house is run, almost single-handedly, by Maitreya from his hostel room at TISS. Maitreya chooses which books to publish. He talks to authors for their consent and, once published, he gives the authors copies of their books as their share. Being part of the larger Dalit movement, the enterprise relies on public contributions in the form of subscriptions, and any profit it makes goes into printing and publishing more books. Panther’s Paw does not follow the conventional trajectory of contracts, royalties, etc., and started giving copies to reviewers only as late as 2019, by which time it had already published four titles.

Care and attention

In no way does Panther’s Paw compromise on the production quality. Every title it has published — starting with the first till the latest, Flowers on the Grave of Caste, a collection of short stories by Maitreya — has a catchy and intriguing cover. In fact, its third book, Broken Man: In Search of Homeland, a collection of poems by Loknath Yashwant, translated from Marathi to English by Dr. K. Jamanadas and Maitreya, has on its cover a black and white photograph by renowned photojournalist Sudharak Olwe, who is a Dalit and a founder of Photography Promotion Trust (PPT), which — according to its website — is “a non-profit organisation that uses the skills of photography to create definitive change in the lives of socially marginalised communities and promotes social documentary photography.”

The paper quality and even the fonts used in Panther’s Paw books are on a par with that of books published by mainstream publishers — which Maitreya prefers to call ‘Savarna publishers’ — testifying to the care and attention Maitreya puts in. In The Bridge of Migration, there is a poem titled ‘Dilemma’. It is about language.

My father sang to me

In a language his father taught him

Hence, in it, his rage had clarity

His love was sublime.

But I grew up much greedy

I wrote in English and kept on writing;

Later father’s words turned voiceless to me

I turned deaf to his song, I grew up mean.

Today, I imagine

If I have a son or a daughter,

What song shall I sing to them?

Precisely, in what language shall I sing?

Just as in this poem, Maitreya was faced with the question of which language Panther’s Paw Publications would publish in. He decided on English — both original works in English as well as translations from bhasha into English — and Maitreya has a reason for this. “In our native languages,” Maitreya says, “Dalit literature has been written for many decades, but there is a dire need that it is also written in English language as — [in English, in the hands of the upper castes] our history, our stories, and the idea of our community have been distorted and appropriated.”

Deconstructing caste notions

Maitreya doesn’t feel positive about the recent interest that mainstream publishers are showing in Dalit writers and Dalit writing. “Savarna publishers,” he says, “have chosen to publish Dalit books that were milestones long ago, and they are publishing Dalit writers who died years ago.” Panther’s Paw publishes Dalit writers who are still alive as, Maitreya believes, “it is very important for a Dalit writer to see the glory of his/ her work while still alive. It is recognition, opposite to rejection.”

Maitreya disapproves of Savarna publishers publishing non-Dalit writers writing on Dalit issues. He wants Panther’s Paw to represent Dalit history and life through Dalit voices alone. He says he will work with non-Dalit writers only if they write about their non-Dalit lives in a way in which their writing helps demolish and deconstruct caste notions.

Maitreya’s own writing is very personal — the alcoholic, Bollywood-buff father in his poem, ‘Choice’, in The Bridge of Migration can also be seen in his story, ‘The Sense of the Beginning’, in Flowers on the Grave of Caste. Yet, apart from that, the one thing that I noticed in his stories was that he did use capital D to spell Dalit. Usually, in writing, words like Dalit, Adivasi, Savarna, are spelt with capital letters. In Maitreya’s stories, Dalit always begins with a small d: dalit. About this, Maitreya says: “Dalit are human beings. They are not a special entity or species. They breathe, feel, comprehend, reason, and make sense of life just like any other human being. Spelling dalit with a capital D gives it a special look that forces us to see the dalit community differently. Hence, I choose to spell dalit with a small d.”

Panther’s Paw is a humanising effort whose journey has just begun. It does not have a website yet and spreads word about its work only through a Facebook page and through Maitreya’s personal Facebook account. However, when one sees the work Panther’s Paw is doing and the faith and earnestness of founder Maitreya, one can see the bigger movement it has started.

426,2020/03/14,"‘Sridevi, The Eternal Screen Goddess’ review: Chronicle of a distant life","The enigma that was Sridevi is explored in a biography, an eminently readable fanboy account

One needs to brace oneself to read a fanboy biography. There is only so much of saccharine that one can take. Cloying descriptions, books written out of a thesaurus tend to be tedious, because, frankly, nothing works better than a critical look at the life and works of a star.

Sridevi, The Eternal Screen Goddess is an unabashed fanboy account, but rescues itself from tedium by being eminently readable, and sometimes, one even struggles to put down the book.

In her death, as in life, there is no doubt that Sridevi was a sensation, and yet always a little distant, a bit out of reach. Two years ago, when the shocking news of her sudden death in a faraway Dubai hotel came in, it was clad in as much mystery as her life was lived.

Diligent narrative

Explaining this enigma is probably done best through tinted lenses. While Sathyarth Nayak does wear a heavy shade of stars-in-the-eyes, he painstakingly goes after the minutiae — the pirouette of the dancer, the pout of the star, the turn of a wrist, the single tear coursing down a fair cheek. And how does he do this? By watching nearly all, or is it all, the films that Sridevi was ever a part of; every single film, in every language, chronologically narrated. That’s due diligence. That is also a book saver.

There is appreciably, a sense of proportion, more pages for the superhits, or significant films, and then, a casual mention, mouth still wide open in wonderment. A 16 Vayathinile, or a Mr. India, the iconic Moondram Pirai (Sadma in Hindi) by master craftsman Balu Mahendra, the runaway hit Chandni, Khuda Gawah with Amitabh Bachchan, or RGV’s muse in the Telugu box office hit Kshana Kshanam, or the subtle but stunning housewife in English Vinglish, get more play, as they help establish the rise of the first female superstar of Bollywood, a preserve until then, and even later, of heroes.

That helps him tide over the huge disadvantage of writing a posthumous note on a person he has only idolised on the big screen. It could not have been an easy book to write, in that sense.

In these set of circumstances, the author is forced to rely on others’ judgement of her, their experiences recounted after years, newspaper accounts, but the effect need not be in the least awkward, as Nayak demonstrates by weaving together various accounts cogently, in a well-told story.

He slips easily in and out of passionate observances about the tilt of her chin or her ability to transform during a scene, to tiny tidbits of trivia effortlessly.

But it is indeed rapture that guides the author along, as he traces the rise of the prima donna from a talented child.

Beyond films

Nayak also manages to get a foot into parts of her personal life, going by reportage, or accounts of friends of her relationships — with her parents, siblings, husband, and daughters; the loneliness, the light and the darkness, the shyness, a metered account of her last day, also how kind and considerate or fun loving she could be.

That’s not a Sridevi the people know; and that elevates the book from remaining mere filmography. It is disappointing though that a behemoth publisher has allowed editing errors in the book.

They mess with the flow of what is otherwise a certainly well-written hagiography of a talented actor who, if anyone does, deserves the highest commendation for what she achieved, and what she still inspires in the hearts of the movie-crazy people of this country.

427,2020/03/14,‘Backstage: The Story Behind India’s High Growth Years’ review: Strategist at work,"As one of the key players in the finance ministry, the PMO and the now defunct Planning Commission, Montek Singh Ahluwalia captures the essence of policymaking between 1985 and 2014

This polite and civilised book is the memoir of a man whose thinking, after P.C. Mahalanobis’s in the 1950s, shaped India’s economic policy the most. But there the similarity ends because if Mahalanobis was influenced by the Soviet approach to economic strategy, Ahluwalia was influenced by the American one.

After studying PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics) at Oxford University he went to the World Bank where he soon headed the poverty division. Ahluwalia says the job was first offered to Arun Shourie who turned it down saying there was nothing to say about poverty other than “it is there and there is a lot of it.”

No ‘I’ word

If Mahalanobis got his chance when one Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, trusted his judgement, Ahluwalia got his when two others, P.V. Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh, trusted him. But unlike Mahalanobis who, for a while, was the real backstage man, Ahluwalia influenced policy from the centre of the stage. That’s why the title Backstage of this book is quintessentially Ahluwalia. He rarely uses the word ‘I’.

This book captures the essence of policymaking between 1985 and 2014. But it does so very blandly. That’s a pity because an essential ingredient of writing contemporary history is drama, which is missing, and Ahluwalia has written about some very exciting times when a prevailing intellectual paradigm was being pushed aside by a new one.

For example, a discussion of the tensions that arose while developing new policies would have given us some important insights into the management of policy which, during the coalition years, had come to mean the management of ministers. After all he worked with so many in his different roles in government.

Ahluwalia returned home to India from the World Bank in mid-1979 to join the finance ministry. His career really took off in 1985 when he moved to the Prime Minister’s Office. It was at this time that the Indian approach to the economy started changing. As the joint secretary handling economic policy Ahluwalia played an important role.

Architect of reform

The Rajiv Gandhi years (1984-89) saw two major changes: a hesitant movement towards market economics and a shedding of fiscal rectitude. The first worked. The second culminated in the crisis of 1991. Ahluwalia skims over the latter, giving the impression he was a bystander.

It was in 1991 that Ahluwalia really came into his own. As commerce secretary when the Narasimha Rao government came to power he was the chief architect of India’s liberalised import policy. Then, between 1992 and 1997, as finance secretary, he initiated and oversaw financial sector and tax policy reforms. His account of it is, as usual, modest.

In 1998, the Vajpayee government saw no further use for him and he went off to the IMF. Then when UPA I came to power, Manmohan Singh appointed him Deputy Chairman of the now defunct Planning Commission. If the Sonia Gandhi led National Advisory Council guided the government on distributional issues, Ahluwalia focused on growth.

The NAC pumped in a few lakh crore into rural India. The Planning Commission harnessed some of it for investment, in infrastructure mostly. The system worked well till about 2009 when India grew at around 8% during these years.

During UPA II, the government started spending money like there was no tomorrow. It led to massive inflation and a near-crisis in 2013. But by 2010, Ahluwalia, like his boss Manmohan Singh, had become less influential. All he could do was to try and defend the indefensible.

For example, after the ordinance-tearing by Rahul Gandhi, Manmohan Singh asked Ahluwalia if he should resign who told him not to. But he defends Rahul too for upholding a principle.

Sense of helplessness

He didn’t approve of many things. One of them was the retrospective tax on Vodafone. He says he had advised the finance minister to make it prospective. He also blames the delay in environmental clearances without telling us why they happened. Nor does he say what he thought of the UPA’s law on land acquisition. He also says a large section of the BJP was in favour of it. This is not known.

The sense of helplessness seeps through in the chapters on UPA II. With scams and inflation both running high the government lost credibility. Ahluwalia’s despair forms the base notes of the theme song of UPA II.

Finally, unless I missed it, Ahluwalia doesn’t take Narendra Modi’s name even once. There is just one reference to him in the very last sentence of the book. If you want to know what it is, you will have to read the book.

428,2020/03/14,‘Road to Mekong’ review: Riders on the storm,"Four women on motorcycles travel from Hyderabad to Southeast Asia and back

Swinging a leg over a bike and crunching miles on a winding road with its possibilities ranging from serendipitous learning to the ghastly accident, are all part of an avid rider’s life. The black tarmac calls, tyres blur and a sense of liberation courses through your veins.

Motor-cycling is an elemental pursuit that marries varied terrains, multiple languages, diverse cultures and lip-smacking but greasy cuisine of the kind you get in dhabas. But it also throws up a stereotype. Think biking and often the mind conjures up these hefty bikers with long hair, unkempt beard, tattooed arms and a propensity to quaff multiple beers every night.

Glass ceiling

Biking is supposed to be an ode to the alpha-male but that glass ceiling was broken a long time ago and women are equally adept with two wheels and can last the journey with more finesse. Take a spin in your car across the national highways and you are bound to see female bike riders chasing the horizon with courage and chutzpah as their fervent allies.

Piya Bahadur’s book Road to Mekong is one such endeavour where she chronicles her epochal ride of 17,000 kilometres from Hyderabad to Southeast Asia and back over nearly two months. Piya rode as part of a team that had Jai Bharathi, Shanthi and Shilpa as her co-riders. Astride Bajaj Dominars, the 400 cc bike, the quartet traversed across the Northeast before slipping into Myanmar from the border town of Moreh in Manipur. Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia were also sampled while the return leg involved a detour to Delhi and a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Piya writes with candour, highlighting the initial trepidation, the endless trips to Delhi to get their papers and permits in order and there is gratitude too as both Telangana Tourism and the Indian Government as part of its Incredible India campaign, backed the four with sponsorships while Bajaj contributed the bikes.

Endless possibilities

Riding on roads, both the rough and the smooth, braving the sun and the rains and even the odd political rally, Piya and team keep their sights firmly on the road. There is the rare tumble, at times bad surfaces slow down the pace but they soldier on, banking on the strength of their hearts, the kindness of strangers besides strong tea, anda bhurjee (scrambled eggs) and parathas at wayside joints.

The food changed shape, colour and taste once they zoomed into Southeast Asia but with adaptability being their byword, the four riders easily adjusted.

A bike ride through highways and country roads often opens up hidden vistas in our minds and Piya nails it when she writes: “I had heard about the idea of ‘being liberated’ often enough. I glimpsed its possibilities on the road.” To go with the flow, embrace change and treat every day as a fresh challenge, are some of the life-lessons that biking bequeaths and this book is replete with those nuggets.

429,2020/03/14,Can Lakshadweep’s fragile lagoons survive a multi-crore tourism villa project?,"In a petition this January, 114 scientists from more than 30 universities and research institutes urged the Lakshadweep administration to reconsider the project

Hidden in the azure waters of Lakshadweep’s lagoons is a stunningly colourful world: corals burst in tones of red, pink, yellow and blue. “And you’ll find every colour of the rainbow in the reef fish,” says Nachiket Kelkar, a biologist who has studied these lagoons. These waters are also home to a variety of threatened and endangered marine life, including green turtles, sea cucumbers, giant clams and corals.

Closer to the shore, and beneath the seemingly barren white sand, grows an entire grassland. Tiny tips of smooth, waxy sea grass gently break the grainy surface, and if left undisturbed, will grow into a lush meadow in a few years, waving their green fronds as far as the eye can see.

But all these inshore reefs and underwater grasslands may be in deep peril if an ambitious tourism project — involving the construction of beach and water villas offering 370 rooms — becomes a reality.

The multi-crore project has been proposed by NITI Aayog and the Ministry of Home Affairs. In a petition this January, 114 scientists from more than 30 universities and research institutes urged the Lakshadweep administration to reconsider the project, fearing the possible ecological impact it could have on the islands’ sensitive lagoons and beaches.

News about tourism villas on 10 islands in the Andaman-Nicobar and Lakshadweep archipelagos has been trickling in since October 2018. A 2019 NITI Aayog report lists ‘best possible development strategies’ for the ‘holistic’ development of these islands. In the 36-island archipelago of the Lakshadweep, this proposal has been earmarked for the islands of Kadmat, Minicoy and Suheli.

With an initial investment of ₹266 crore (and additional investments of up to ₹788 crore expected from the private sector), the project will be implemented by Lakshadweep’s Society for Promotion of Nature Tourism and Sports (SPORTS).

Just like Maldives

The NITI Aayog report repeatedly stresses that the projects are ‘technically feasible, economically profitable and socially acceptable’; that the ‘up-front’ clearances (both environmental and Coastal Regulation Zone) recommended for the project are a ‘unique move aimed at creating much-needed conducive environment for private entrepreneurs to invest’. And in November last year, the Lakshadweep administration supplied more details of the project to potential bidders: successful bidders would get 75 years to finance, construct and operate the projects. Floating solar panels in the lagoons nearby will supply sustainable energy. And as much as 75% of the jobs will go to the local community, says Asker Ali, Managing Director of SPORTS.

Not so win-win

The vision appears straightforward and grand: create job opportunities for locals, and world-class, ‘Maldives-like’, carbon-neutral tourism facilities that will also give India its first-ever water villas. A win-win for all stakeholders: the government, locals and tourists. But the ecological impact of such a project on the lagoons and coral reefs is likely to be far more complex and damaging than what is being acknowledged, argue India’s scientists in their petition.

Rohan Arthur is a marine biologist with the Nature Conservation Foundation-India and has been studying Lakshadweep’s reefs and sea grasses for more than 20 years. He, and the several others who framed the petition, describe these lagoons as the islands’ ‘insurance sites’. The shallow lagoons are protected from the open sea by an outer coral reef; this reduces the impact of wave action, preventing beach erosion and protecting the islands’ limited freshwater supply. The healthy sea grass meadows in lagoons, crucial nurseries for many reef fish, also have high soil-binding capacities, he says. “Lagoonal sea grasses help stabilise beaches and prevent beach erosion.”

Erosion is indeed a problem in many of Lakshadweep’s beaches. While wave action on beaches is a common geological process, extensive beach erosion and accretion (the creation of new sandy areas) from ‘unscientific, indiscriminate dumping’ of concrete tetrapods (structures used as a seawall to reduce wave action) has already impacted the islands’ beaches, says the 2015 Integrated Island Management Plan (IIMP) that governs management activities on 10 islands of the Lakshadweep.

Lagoons act as insurance sites also because it is only here that you find temperature-adapted coral species. Coral cover in outer reefs (in deeper waters) declined by almost 40% during the climate-change related coral bleaching events of 1998, 2010 and 2016, as Arthur and his team found.

The reefs witnessed a startling shift in coral species, as they tried to adapt to climate change. Coral species such as the delicate, finger-like Acropora gave way to more temperature-tolerant ones such as the large, boulder-like Porites. As bleaching events keep recurring, these lagoons will become ‘source sites’, says Arthur. “Every time there is a mortality of coral in the outer reefs, these lagoons will supply new recruits to recolonise the reefs in the deeper waters.” Without them, the reefs outside the lagoon will suffer. “The entire outer wall of the protective reef will start crumbling. The lagoon will die and islanders will suffer,” says Arthur.

Plastic in coral

Human activity, such as construction, is bound to impact the lagoon’s corals too, says Kelkar, a doctoral student of aquatic ecology at the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment. Waste disposal will affect water quality; microplastics are also a concern. In Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, for instance, studies show how inshore corals can confuse microplastics for food and these microscopic pieces then get embedded in coral structures, impacting their health. “And we still don’t know how increased boat movement in the lagoon could affect these ecosystems,” he adds.

In 2014, the Justice R.V. Raveendran Committee, appointed to evaluate the IIMP, made some strong recommendations. It is “highly essential to protect corals, sea grass and other ecosystems from anthropogenic activities,” the report said, going on to list activities such as waste disposal, port development, dredging of navigational channels, construction of breakwaters, tourism and related activities, sand mining, and intensive fishing. This recommendation is now part of the IIMP.

Whose beaches are they

The petition from the scientists also points out that beaches and lagoons have always been important economic and cultural spaces. Islanders fish in the lagoons for their daily consumption. Lagoon fish are also the backbone of Lakshadweep’s famous sustainable and indigenous tuna fishery industry. And the beaches are heavily used: catch is processed and sundried on these sands. With tourism, and the spatial restrictions it could bring, locals fear that they will not be able to use the beaches or lagoons for their traditional livelihoods. “We catch bait fish — two or three-inch fish — for our pole-and-line tuna fishery from the lagoons,” says Mohammad (real name withheld on request), who lives in Kadmat. “I fear that the floating solar panels could restrict our access to the lagoon and affect the fishing.”

That’s not the only hazard the floating panels bring. They will also get in the way of the green turtles that graze on the sea grass. Then, the artificial shading that they cast on the lagoon floor would be ‘disastrous’ for sea grass meadows and reefs.

Says Arthur, “Going carbon-neutral in this manner in a place like Lakshadweep is warped logic. The first ecological casualties of the project will be the green turtles, the sea grass meadows, and the coral reefs.” Moreover, the energy and water needs of such a project are an abiding concern. Already, two of the inhabited islands where the villas are to be built are reeling under a water crisis.

The scientists behind the petition clarify that they are not against development, but they want a transparent, third-party impact assessment to evaluate the project’s ecological and social costs. As the project now stands, it does not meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

‘No approvals yet’

Ali, who heads SPORTS, is also the nodal officer for the tourism project in Lakshadweep. He insists that the process is transparent and that all stakeholders, including local panchayats, have been consulted. He dismisses claims that the project would restrict local people’s access to beaches or lagoons. “The project was not decided overnight. Impact assessments and studies were made by government institutes including the National Institute of Ocean Technology. The project will be implemented within the approved carrying capacity,” he says, adding that “SPORTS cares about the protection of coral reefs because without them there can be no tourism. After all, livelihoods are more important and you have to strike a balance.”

In an email response, Amitabh Kant, CEO of NITI Aayog, says they are committed to sustainable development of the islands, and adds: “We will not undertake any project without detailed environmental studies and only after following all due processes and taking all approvals. These processes are still under way. No approval has so far been received. All proposals will be subject to technical and environmental inputs.”

But 370 rooms are “far, far beyond” Lakshadweep’s carrying capacity, points out tourism entrepreneur Jose Dominic, the former CEO of CGH Earth, who pioneered sustainable and responsible tourism in Kerala and ran Lakshadweep’s Bangaram Island Resort for 20 years.

He strongly discourages the project. “The water villas will be a disaster for everyone except the tourists staying in them,” he says. “There was a similar proposal to build water villas on the Bangaram coral atoll almost 15 years ago, which thankfully didn’t materialise. The pillars for the villa construction will be driven through coral rock. You’re destroying the very resource that people are visiting the island for.”

The scientists agree. “Why is this particular project being pushed with so much urgency when we have far more urgent climate realities to deal with,” asks Arthur. “The project pursues an imagination that is far at odds with reality.”

430,2020/03/14,Wolfing down watermelons,"The predators are also fond of grapes, maize and wild berries, besides livestock

Indian wolves are the same species that roam across North America and Europe, but they are entirely different animals. Not only do they look dissimilar, being smaller, lankier, and less furry, but they act differently. While the Western wolves symbolise fierce wilderness, many populations of the Indian wolves hang out near humans, a risky strategy for a carnivore. To survive, they rely on camouflage, stealth, and an awareness of humans, says Iravatee Majgaonkar.

In Koppal district, northern Karnataka, wolves lurk around villages and fields set in the black Deccan soil of the valleys ringed by picturesque rocky hillocks. Despite the large canids’ proximity to civilisation, “they have this ability to be invisible especially in peninsular India,” says Majgaonkar. In a landscape with few wild areas where they can thrive free of human disturbance, they often den adjacent to fields.

Beige and blending

Pups appear to be born shy, scooting into their hideouts long before any dog, wolf, or human approaches. Their skill at disappearing is partly due to their beige coats with black highlights that blend with the arid landscape. Majgaonkar witnessed this uncanny trait when she struggled to spot her first wolf even as it trotted across an open fallow field in full sight. “When I finally saw it for about three minutes, it hit me that I was one of the lucky few to see this fascinating creature,” she says. Despite spending two years in the region studying people-carnivore relations and the wolves’ entirely rural lives, she’s seen them on fewer than 10 occasions.

Even residents of the area go about their business unaware of the animals’ presence. Majgaonkar and her team spotted a pair of wolves standing behind bushes, panting in the heat of the day. Not one pedestrian realised the wild animals were less than 100 metres away.

While the wolves of grasslands hunt in packs, spreading out and chasing blackbuck towards an ambush, village wolves usually steal through settlements under the cover of darkness. They don’t have to plan their strategy to get at their livestock prey huddled asleep in enclosures. Occasionally, one blows its cover, going into a killing frenzy inside an animal shed. A shepherd told Majgaonkar two wolves killed 19 sheep in one night. In the old days, this would have been enough to destroy the cornered predators. That remains the official policy for livestock-killing wolves in many western countries. But the aggrieved man let the animals go and claimed ex gratia compensation from the Forest Department.

Watch dogs

To avoid such senseless slaughter, owners use dogs to alert them to wolves. Unlike Western wolves, the Indian ones usually don’t kill domestic canines. They often cross paths with free-ranging dogs as they scavenge from the same sites and drink from the same puddles, although they don’t seem to crossbreed, at least in this area.

Protecting their livestock isn’t the only headache for farmers. They blame wolves for devouring juicy watermelons on cold winter nights. Seeing the remains of fruits strewn in the fields, Majgaonkar thought it was a case of mistaken identity. Perhaps the villagers confused omnivorous jackals with carnivorous wolves. But she realised they were right when she came upon bright red wolf droppings studded with black seeds. Elsewhere, the predators are said to eat grapes, maize, and wild berries.

Despite these aggravations and even though villagers often know the location of dens, they generally leave them alone. “This is not to say that wolves are not under any threat here,” says Majgaonkar. “Their numbers have plummeted and few are left. Nonetheless, they are adaptable creatures, and if given good habitat and relatively low human densities, they will survive.”

All of this highlights that it’s not only Indian wolves that behave differently from their Western counterparts. Indians may be the same species as those inhabiting North America and Europe, but they are entirely different people.

431,2020/03/14,Kerala architect Vinu Daniel uses debris as building material,"Wondering what to do with that cracked ceramic water closet? Ask Vinu Daniel — he will upcycle it and any other form of debris into strong building material

“A broken ceramic commode maybe an ugly piece of waste but, for me, it is useful construction material. In fact any kind of debris is great to work with.” Architect Vinu Daniel’s significant body of work challenges conventional design and building practices.

His latest innovation is a shuttered debris wall, which is proving to be a low-cost and stylish building solution. A residence under construction in Pothencode, Thiruvananthapuram is using this wall, for which the patent is pending, along with a design that creates “a safe haven for frogs, dragonflies and snakes” and nurtures local ecology. Created along with architect Shobhita Jacob, the wall is a mixture of poured and rammed earth with debris of varying sizes — three to seven centimetres in diameter — with 7-8% cement stabiliser.

One of Vinu’s early works is Tease Me Café in Kottayam. Its walls fall and fo

ld like frozen smooth drapes. The 10-foot drops are made with ‘clothcrete’ or thin concrete poured over naturally hung cotton. Tara Pillai’s residence — in Mananthala, Thiruvanthapuram — made predominantly with bamboo, retains the marshy land in its design thus conserving the natural ecosystem. A coconut thatch home in Karjat, Mumbai, and a terrace verandah of casurina poles jutting 30 feet into Peermade’s pure air underway are some more of Vinu’s architectural novelties.

The 38-year-old says, “I am an anarchist by choice; anything other than conventional is creative.” Vinu graduated in Architecture in 2005 from College of Architecture, Thiruvananthapuram, but hated it because it was like “building someone’s ego.” His attitude changed after listening to “the great Laurie Baker” who spoke about the idea of building around a tree. “Architecture did not make any sense to me until then,” he says.

Originally from Alappuzha, Vinu grew up in an affluent household in Dubai. This showed him the non-functionality of opulence in plenty and the desert made him realise the value of trees. Two distinct memories from childhood are of going to school on treeless roads in the searing desert heat, and wide chairs with large curvaceous arms that served no purpose.

Another influence on him was Auroville-based veteran architect Satprem Maini of Auroville Earth Institute. “I learnt from the venerable SN Kanade the reasons for dogmatic construction rules, like why the window sill is 60 cm high. It is a Victorian legacy, because the writing table was 80 cm and the ink pot needed to be at a comfortable height on the window sill at 60cm,” he laughs. In the aftermath of the tsunami, he learnt all about the mud block, building low cost houses at Auroville Earth Institute in 2006-2007 and gained experience in restoration while working on a Nataraja temple in Puthukoopam, Tamil Nadu.

Armed with these, he began innovating and convincing clients of his ideas. In Kerala the Compressed Stabilised Earth Blocks (CSEB) proved difficult to manufacture as they use up a lot of soil. So Vinu came up with a new strategy: using debris or waste construction material. “All over the world, in urban areas, there’s a huge issue of construction waste. I thought of recycling that,” says Vinu, who calls him self a vagabond, office-less architect, who moves from “site to site.”

Cloth and concrete

He founded Wallmakers in 2007 and recalls a time when his ideas were suspect and he got contracts only to build compound walls. When the first big break came, he remembers his brother, who works along with him, telling the client that they were only wall makers. “We started from there.” Today his team believes in his innovative ideas and non-conformist ways. “I am the chieftain of the tribe, so to speak,” he laughs.

What inspires him? Vinu talks about the sensorial and translating sensibilities into buildings. The ‘clothcrete’ captures the “smoothness of Michelangelo’s Pieta”, the casurina verandah is all about feeling the breeze at an altitude of 30 ft. The Umbrella Pavilion at the Kochi Muziris Biennale (2014) with its dramatic origami structure was all about contemporary visual arts.

A few of his current projects are: a residence for his physically challenged friend Gokul Retnakar, at Karikulam in Thiruvanthapuram, made from debris collected from quarries and the entire space will be a ramp; a school in Uganda (project by Kwagala Foundation) made of bamboo by the villagers.

Vinu has faced legal issues over his irreverent architectural ideas and won, “a case is still pending”, he remains undeterred, driven by passion

432,2020/03/14,"TIFR study reveals role of glucose in regulating liver functions, ageing","Study shows both over-activation and under-activation of longevity factor SIRT1 can lead to diseases

An enzyme that goes by the name SIRT1 is known to be associated with regulation of metabolic activities and also ageing and hence has become a target of therapeutics. A study by researchers from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai (TIFR) shows that glucose controls the function of SIRT1 directly. A shortage or absence of this control can lead to a diabetic-like state, while excess feeding and sustained low levels of SIRT1 can lead to obesity and enhanced ageing. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Health and feeding regimen

There are many diseases related to high calorie content in the body, such as metabolic disorders as shown in animal studies. Studies have shown that metabolic diseases are associated with wrong feeding regimen, even in humans. Every organism has evolved so as to feed and then alternately fast, so it becomes important to understand this cycle. This cycle, known as the feed-fast cycle is a basic pattern and the metabolism related to this is largely taken care of by the liver.

In an earlier work, published in Cell Reports, researchers in the lab of Ullas Kolthur-Seetharam from the Department of Biological Sciences at TIFR, found the mechanism that triggers the liver to go from one stage to another in the feed-fast cycle.

Role of glucose

Now, working on a different angle, the group has discovered that glucose controls the functions of a protein SIRT1 which in turn maintains everyday feed-fast cycles and is also associated with longevity. “In normal healthy individuals, SIRT1 protein levels are known to increase during fasting and decrease during feed, which is essential to maintain a balance between glucose and fat metabolism,” says Prof Kolthur-Seetharam.

“Despite decades of work on the beneficial roles of SIRT1, metabolic factors that decrease its functions both during normal feed-fast cycles and in nutrient excess states (like obesity) was unknown,” explains Tandrika Chattopadhyay, who is the first author of the PNAS paper in an email to The Hindu.

“While there is active research to identify drugs that can activate SIRT1 which would be beneficial in countering ageing and metabolic diseases, the cost of uncontrolled overactivation of SIRT1 has not been investigated especially since it decreases in a healthy individual in a fed state,” says Dr. Chattopadhyay.

Glucose puts a check on the activity of SIRT1 in the fed state. In the absence of this check, SIRT1 activity increases and results in hyperglycaemia in a fasted state, mimicking diabetic state. “Constant feeding or high calorie intake that leads to sustained reduction in the levels of SIRT1 (by glucose) is associated with ageing and obesity,” she says.

“Our study shows that both over-activation and under-activation of this longevity factor could lead to diseases,” she adds.

Future steps

This study paves the way to regulating this modification, which might be beneficial in tackling lifestyle disorders and ageing related diseases.

The group next seeks to investigate if glucose-dependent control can dictate gene expression during feed-fast cycles. “Also, we would like to investigate if small chemical molecules or drugs can selectively activate SIRT1 which could be used in the clinic to either increase or decrease the levels of SIRT1, as per the needs of the individual,” says Prof. Kolthur-Seetharam.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/5gi277/article31069619.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15TH-SCILIVERjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/tifr-study-reveals-role-of-glucose-in-regulating-liver-functions-ageing/article31069620.ece
433,2020/03/14,Trial shows success in treating drug-resistant TB,"The small trial using three oral drugs in 109 patients showed a treatment success rate of 90%

A small trial (Nix-TB) undertaken at three sites in South Africa to test the safety and efficacy of three oral drugs — bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid — in 109 patients (57 males and 56 females were HIV positive) with extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) showed encouraging results — treatment success rate was 90%. The favourable results held true regardless of the HIV status of the patients.

The treatment using the three oral drugs lasted for 26 weeks and was followed-up for six months after the end of the treatment. Patients received the treatment daily for 26 weeks. The trial of 109 patients included 71 who had XDR-TB and 38 with MDR-TB.

Success rate

The 90% treatment success in the case of hard-to-treat patients is at par with the success rate seen while treating drug-sensitive TB. Of the 109 patients treated, 11 had unfavourable outcomes while 98 had favourable outcomes. Of the 11 patients who had unfavourable outcomes, there were seven deaths and two had a relapse during the six-month follow-up period. Of the 98 patients who were successfully treated using the three drugs, 63 patients had XDR-TB and 35 had MDR-TB. The treatment success rate was 89% (63 of 71) for XDR-TB and 92% (35 of 38). The MDR-TB patients included in the trial were either not responsive to standard treatment or had discontinued treatment due to side effects.

Adverse effects

“This study shows that XDR tuberculosis and complicated MDR tuberculosis can be treated with a regimen consisting of three oral agents for 26 weeks,” the authors write. The results of the study were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Of the three drugs used in the trial, a “high-percentage” of patients experienced adverse effects related to linezolid drug. Of the 109 patients treated, 88 patients (81%) had peripheral neuropathy (weakness, numbing and pain usually of hands and feet due to nerve damage), though the symptoms were mild to moderate in the majority of cases.

Two patients developed optic neuritis, where the optic nerve becomes inflamed, which was resolved when linezolid drug was withdrawn. Also, 40 had anaemia, while eight patients had adverse event of the liver and the regime had to be interrupted (but they eventually resumed and completed the 26-week treatment).",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/ldj0e3/article31069609.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15TH-SCIDRUG-RESISTANTjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/trial-shows-success-in-treating-drug-resistant-tb/article31069610.ece
434,2020/03/14,Heat stress may impact over 1.2 billion people annually by 2100: study,"This is more than 12 times the number who would have been affected without industrial era global warming

Stress from extreme heat and humidity will annually impact areas which are home to about 1.2 billion people worldwide by 2100, assuming current greenhouse gas emissions, according to a study.

This is more than four times the number of people affected today, and more than 12 times the number who would have been affected without industrial era global warming, said researchers from Rutgers University-New Brunswick in the US.

Rising global temperatures are increasing exposure to heat stress, which harms human health, agriculture, the economy and the environment, according to the research published in the journal Environmental Research Letters.

Most climate studies on projected heat stress have focused on heat extremes but not considered the role of humidity, another key driver, the researchers said.

“When we look at the risks of a warmer planet, we need to pay particular attention to combined extremes of heat and humidity, which are especially dangerous to human health,” said senior author Robert E Kopp, from Rutgers University-New Brunswick.

“Every bit of global warming makes hot, humid days more frequent and intense. In New York City, for example, the hottest, most humid day in a typical year already occurs about 11 times more frequently than it would have in the 19th century,” said lead author Dawei Li, a former post-doctoral associate at Rutgers, and now at the University of Massachusetts.

Heat stress is caused by the body’s inability to cool down properly through sweating. Body temperature can rise rapidly, and high temperatures may damage the brain and other vital organs.

Heat stress ranges from milder conditions like heat rash and heat cramps to heat exhaustion, the most common type.

The study looked at how combined extremes of heat and humidity increase on a warming Earth, using 40 climate simulations to get statistics on rare events.

It focused on a measure of heat stress that accounts for temperature, humidity and other environmental factors, including wind speed, sun angle and solar and infrared radiation.

Annual exposure to extreme heat and humidity in excess of safety guidelines is projected to affect areas currently home to about 500 million people if the planet warms by 1.5 degrees Celsius, and nearly 800 million at 2 degrees Celsius, the researchers said.

The planet has already warmed by about 1.2 degrees above late 19th century levels, the said.

An estimated 1.2 billion people would be affected with 3 degrees Celsius of warming, as expected by the end of this century under current global policies, according to the study.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/oyj9b5/article31069591.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15TH-SCIHEAT-STRESSjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/heat-stress-may-impact-over-12-billion-people-annually-by-2100-study/article31069592.ece
435,2020/03/14,The time is right for OneHealth science,"Emergence of pathogens calls out for cross-country collaborations

As India goes into emergency mode to tackle the potentially catastrophic impacts of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the ‘Kerala model’ is being widely cited as an example to emulate. In 2018, Kerala reacted quickly and efficiently to tackle the Nipah virus outbreak and successfully managed to confine it to 23 cases. This success has been credited to the strong public health infrastructure and the political will to quickly seek help from a multidisciplinary team of national and international experts. The Kerala Nipah virus outbreak was thought to have come from fruit bats, a group of animals that may also be implicated in other more deadly outbreaks, possibly including the novel coronavirus.

These diseases, which “spillover” from animals to humans are referred to as zoonotic diseases, and represent more than 60% of emerging infectious diseases worldwide. The destruction of the natural environment, globalised trade and travel and industrialised food production systems have created numerous pathways for new pathogens to jump between animals and humans. Understanding this critical intersection between human health, domestic and wild animal health and the environment requires a new integrated framework — a paradigm called ‘OneHealth’.

Kyasanur Forest Disease

Although OneHealth, as a conceptual entity, emerged relatively recently, a stellar example of OneHealth being operationalised in the field was seen in India in the late 1950s. It helped discover the source of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), a highly dangerous haemorrhagic fever more threatening than COVID-19. It was locally called ‘monkey fever’ because of the links between monkey deaths and human infections in Shimoga District of Karnataka where it emerged in 1957. It took pioneering interdisciplinary work to bring together diverse entities like the Rockefeller Foundation and the Virus Research Centre (later the National Institute of Virology), Pune, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Bombay Natural History Society.

The Rockefeller Foundation provided the financial and technical support, including laboratory facilities, while P.K. Rajagopalan and a team of dedicated researchers from the Virus Research Centre combed the forests of the Western Ghats for potential carriers and autopsied monkeys in their investigations into the cause of the disease. The legendary bird man of India, Salim Ali, supported by WHO funds, tagged migratory birds to rule out the possibility that they were carrying pathogens responsible for the disease in their cross-continental flights.

As successful as the epidemiological investigation into KFD was, it largely remained an isolated example. This model of cross-sectoral collaboration did not set the tone for further research along similar lines or fructify into readying our public health system to address zoonotic diseases. To our great loss, everyone slipped back into their silos. Many decades later, India is yet to operationalise a true OneHealth policy.

Range of permissions

Further, the regulatory framework for doing OneHealth research in India with international collaboration typically requires approvals from multiple authorities, including ICMR, the Ministries of External Affairs and Finance, Directorate General of the Armed Forces, National Biodiversity Authority, Committee for the Purpose of Control & Supervision of Experiments on Animals and State health authorities, among others. Additional permissions are required from state forest authorities and biodiversity boards for accessing biological resources within natural landscapes. While the necessity for research permits is not being questioned, the range of permissions needed and the long waiting periods (ranging from three months to more than a year), raises the issue of whether we are unwittingly hampering our ability to rapidly respond to emerging threats from infectious diseases.

Given our pioneering historical contribution to combat zoonotic diseases, and robust institutional framework for biomedical research, India has the opportunity to take the lead in combating the massive public health crisis posed by emerging infectious diseases. An opportunity now exists for India to leap-frog over the systemic and institutional barriers that prevent an integrated OneHealth framework from being operationalised.

The Government of India has recently launched the National Mission on Biodiversity and Human Well-being. The mission aims to explore the neglected links between biodiversity science and human well-being across the sectors of health, economic development, agricultural production and livelihood generation, in combination with efforts to mitigate climate change and related disasters. One of the components of the mission explicitly links biodiversity to human health through the OneHealth framework.

The OneHealth programme aims to encourage team science by having networks of institutions collectively bid for grants to set up integrated OneHealth surveillance systems across India at 25 sentinel surveillance sites in potential emerging infectious disease hotspots. In this manner, government and private institutions, across a range of disciplines, from virology to epidemiology, genomics to ecology, and social and behavioural sciences to veterinary and animal sciences can collaborate to understand how zoonotic diseases can emerge, the threats they can pose, and the mechanisms by which the emergence or spread can be controlled.

The frequency with which new pathogens are emerging or old ones are re-emerging across the world are alarm calls for greater transparency, cross-country collaborations, and enhanced national infrastructure and capacity for integrated OneHealth science. The cause of mitigating large-scale human suffering justifies making such a hitherto unprecedented effort.

436,2020/03/14,Superhydrophobic coating to save metallic surfaces,"Created with polyurethane and silicon dioxide nanoparticles, the coating can be easily spin-coated on steel

Fascinated by the beauty of water rolling off a lotus leaf, a team of chemical engineers has now created a similar superhydrophobic coating that can be used to save steel from rusting.

The team from the Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad, and Ohio State University used polyurethane and silicon dioxide nanoparticles to create the coating which can be easily spin-coated on steel.

“Not just steel, the coating can be done on other metallic surfaces, such as aluminum, copper, brass. We have also successfully developed superhydrophobic coatings for glass, cloth, paper and wood,” explains Aditya Kumar from IIT (ISM) Dhanbad and one of the corresponding authors of the work published in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A.

Treated surface

Before applying the coating, the team created a roughness on the steel using a chemical etching process to improve the adhesion strength. Without this, the coating tends to easily peal off due to smoothness of steel.

The team also tried different methods for the application of the coat on steel and found that spin coating was advantageous and cost-effective compared to immersion coating and spray coating. Spin coating dried quickly and the thickness of the coat could be controlled easily.

The surface of the coating was found to have superhydrophobic property. The coating was also chemically stable in both acidic (pH 5) and alkaline (pH 8) conditions for more than six weeks. It also exhibited thermal stability up to 230 degree C.

The mechanical stability of the coating was tested with water jet, floating, bending, sand abrasion tests and was found to be highly stable.

Self-cleaning coating

Another useful property exhibited by the coating was of self-cleaning. When water droplets were made to fall on an uncoated surface they stuck to it and made a messy surface.

However, in the case of a coated sample, water droplets roll away while collecting dust from the surface.

Easy to make

“The chemicals used to make the coating are easily available in our country and they are environmental friendly too. When mass-produced on commercial scale, the cost of coating will further reduce,” adds Mukesh Kumar Meena, first author of the paper who completed his M.Tech from IIT (ISM) Dhanbad.

Now the team is working on developing an antimicrobial superhydrophobic coating for biomedical applications.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/v3rtxe/article31069546.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15TH-SCIWaterdropjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/superhydrophobic-coating-to-save-metallic-surfaces/article31069547.ece
