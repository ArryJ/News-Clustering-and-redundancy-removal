0,['14/03/2020'],Saju Sreenivas: An Indo-French music project to conserve nature,"Many artistes use their talents not only to entertain the audience, but also to create awareness on the various social and ecological issues. The upcoming French-Malayalam music album that is conceived by Malayali playback singer Saju Sreenivas , photographer and artiste Praveen Muraleedharan and French singer and composer Jo Ziako is one such venture. It sheds light on nature conservation and the fight against the use of plastic.

The idea of such a project had germinated after Ziako was moved by Praveen’s wildlife photography exhibition in France last year. Ziako says, “I was heartbroken to see the photographs that showed how humans have polluted the lush green forests and their ecosystems. A photo of a lion-tailed macaque holding a plastic water bottle stirred something in me. That’s when I thought of turning my music as a tool to create awareness on nature conservation and eradicating the use of plastic. Thus, we decided to do an Indo-French collaboration with musician Praveen and Saju Sreenivas, who will write the Malayalam lyrics for our project. I believe music has a universal language that can reach all.”

The music album which is yet to be named will have seven songs in total that will focus on nature and its importance. The team is currently busy shooting and recording their music album at various landscapes across the State.

According to Praveen, the project will be an eye-opener for many in the society and it will persuade them to save wildlife and stop the usage of single-use plastics. “Though the song recordings are progressing, we have managed to perform at colleges and some schools as we believe that the future of the world lies in the hands of the next-generation and they are the ones that must be informed about the perils if our wildlife and ecology are destroyed.”

The team will be using a blend of Kerala and French musical instruments for its orchestration. They have mixed, chenda, idaykka, madhalam and other traditional percussion instruments to the hues of French music, Praveen says. “The songs include themes like anti-plastic, travel, forest, Bohemian life and so on. We have focused on rendering simple lyrics in Malayalam too, so that everyone can sing it,” he explains, as he thumps on a Cajon (a box-like instrument) matching Ziako’s guitar notes.

Meanwhile, Valiyaperunnal singer Saju Sreenivas says that it’s “an organic music venture” for him. “I felt it was a refreshing and novel idea in our music culture. The album is rich in organic music as we have recorded the live instruments and avoided processed music. The album will be unique as it has used French tunes with a touch of gypsy music. Praveen translates what Ziako says and that itself was a new experience. I worked on the lyrics after understanding the meaning of the French lines by Ziako. Also, the songs are performed in a way that they can be interpreted by the audience,” says Saiju.

Everything about Aditi Rao Hydari is regal — her looks, her attitude, the way she carries herself, her fiercely loyal personality, and her generosity with praise and gratitude for those who she feels truly deserve credit. When we tell Aditi that she has been voted Chennai Times Most Desirable Woman of 2019 from a bunch of achievers under the age of 40, her first reaction is, “I feel like a kid who’s been told everyone in class likes her. I’m full of gratitude for those who voted for me, and my people who have stood by me throughout.” In a heartfelt chat with Chennai Times, the actress talks about her idea of desirability, her definition of beauty and more. Read on…When I’m told that a huge number of people find me desirable, I feel like, ‘Yessss, thank you! I want to do a little jig’. Because on most days, you wake up feeling very normal, you get to work and do your job, and somewhere, I’m aware that there’s a whole team that creates that person — either the characters that I play or me as an individual. Apart from how we look naturally, there are so many people who collectively come together to create that image that gets portrayed to the outside world. On one level, it feels exciting to be called the most desirable woman, and at the same time, I’m also thankful to all those people who make me who I am. I truly believe that the beauty that people see in others is a reflection of them and their eyes that see us like that. And I’m thankful for that.To me, it’s an intangible thing. The moment you are able to pinpoint that, you become self-conscious of it. Desirability is a collective quality and comes from deep within. I think if you are desirable on the surface — like you look good and have a great body — then beyond a point, that can become cumbersome and boring. I think desirability comes from talent, your attitude, the way you treat people, your heart… it’s all very sub-conscious.I love it and it makes me feel great when people write to me. It’s because of people who like me, follow me, say great things about me and encourage me that I am here. You’ve come into a difficult industry where you don’t have a backing; you learn as you grow and these are the people who are with you and support you. These are the people who vote for you, buy tickets for your films, watch your films repeatedly and send sweet messages to you on a day that could have been the worst day for you. It’s their love that makes you grow and I love it.Fans are never difficult to handle. They are good people who come with a warm heart and lack ego. I think most of the time, they only want a photo with you. It takes so much courage to come up to a person who is surrounded by so many people and ask them for a photo, knowing very well that the person may turn you away. So, I rarely deny them. The people who are difficult are the trolls, not the fans. Even with them, I try and send them some love. Maybe they are having a bad day, so that doesn’t mean I should behave badly with them. I feel we can control our attitude with love.Well, there’s no downtime because you are being judged 24X7. Their eyes are always on you, they pass judgement, and you don’t have personal time. But there are also positives of being an actress. I feel like a child in a playground when I’m on a film set. While so many people spend their whole life trying to find that one thing they love doing, I’m lucky that I have figured out what it is. There are so many positive aspects in being an actress that they outweigh the few difficulties we might have.When I came into the industry, there was a lot of pressure on me to look a certain way. I didn’t like wearing too much makeup. I used to wear sweatshirts and flats. A lot of people advised me, saying I should be glamorous and sexy. But somewhere inside, I used to be like, ‘But that’s not me’. I used to feel I was wearing somebody else’s shoes and clothes and trying to be somebody else. But one day, I realised that was not right. A lot of things changed, I found a team of people who believed I was perfect the way I was, and I realised that when you are authentically yourself and accept yourself for who you are, that’s when people will also see you and love you for who you are. I have been told so many times that I was too petite, too skinny and my face was so small, but ultimately, people have to love that about you. So today, I happily roam around in my sweatshirt and sweatpants, don’t wear makeup every day…. And it was from Mani sir (Mani Ratnam) that I learnt that the camera can capture your real beauty and you don’t have to wear makeup for that. I feel the day you are comfortable with yourself, that’s when people will see you for who you are. I used to feel like a factory prototype image of beauty and for me, that was a burden. Anything that’s a burden is not going to make you happy. Yes, we all are obsessed about some feature or the other; like, I have an OCD about my eyebrows. That’s normal human tendency. But that can’t dictate your life.It’s effortlessness. You can be in the same room with the person and you don’t have to speak a word, but you both know what you want to communicate. It’s like, you share a soul. Love is also respect because I have to be able to respect that person to truly be able to love that person.If a person talks down to people, use their position of power to treat others badly, are twisted and complicated, then I can’t be with that person — either in a romantic way or just as a friend. I like simple, happy people. I’m a heart person and trust my instincts. And, in any relationship, loyalty is sacred.A rumour is called a rumour for a reason. I hear one every second day. It affects me sometimes because it can be disrespectful to the other person who’s also part of the rumour! I don’t like negativity. Even if I take myself out of the equation, it affects the other person and I don’t like that.I’d say I’m doing every film of Mani sir.I like to be with people I love and trust, and get along with. I like MY people. Actually, people call me an energiser bunny because I’m jumping and dancing all night and still function the next day. That’s because I’m generally high on life, not because I consume any intoxicating substance.Using pick-up lines is the worst way to speak to a girl. When someone flirts with me, I’m like, ‘See you never!’. Once, I was in Turkey and this guy asked me where I was from. I told him, ‘India’. He went, ‘OMG! Really?’ I have heard people tell me I look like a Colombian. So, I asked him if he thought I was from Colombia. But he said, ‘No, I thought you were from paradise’. I just walked away from there.On sets, I’m Mother Teresa. My empathy metre is 180 on 100. So I don’t create difficult situations for anyone. I think there was just this one time where I offered people cream biscuits with toothpaste. That’s very harmless, no?People think we have a glam life and that we go to sleep and wake up like that. But no. It’s a lot of sweat, hard work, no sleep and working with puffy face!",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74611861,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-594481/74611861.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/chennai-times-most-desirable-woman-2019-aditi-rao-hydari/articleshow/74611861.cms
3,['14/03/2020'],"Ashi Singh: In the race to look glamorous, most girls look the same","Actress Ashi Singh , who played Naina in ' Yeh Un Dinon Ki Baat Hai ', was on a break for the last seven months. The actress confesses that the character had taken over her life and she needed to break free from it. She says, “I lived Naina for two-and-a-half years, until the show ended in August, last year. Like Naina, I, too, am a simple girl. So, for a long time, I felt that I may not be able to portray a character, which is drastically different.” Ask the actress what kept her busy for the last seven months and she says, “I was busy pursuing all the hobbies that I had forgotten in the past two years. I was also focussing on fitness, spending time with family and travelling.”She is glad that she has bagged the lead role in 'Dil Jaise Dhadke… Dhadakne Do', which is undergoing a leap. Ashi says, “The show revolves around banishing age-old superstitions, and I play an interesting character. When I played Naina, I had firmly resolved that I would not play a typical sari-clad bahu role in the future. So, there were offers, but I refused all of them. Though I will be seen wearing saris in my new show, I don’t play a typical bahu in it. I am glad that I am doing something different.”With most actresses posing for bold photoshoots and playing glamorous characters , we ask Ashi if she ever felt the need to shed her simple image, and she replies, “I am an actress and it is my job to look glamorous if the role requires it. Having said that, I take pride in the fact that I have a simple personality and simplicity is my virtue. One can look glamorous, but it is important to be talented, too. If you look around, you will see many girls who are glamorous. But in the race to look glamorous, most of them end up looking the same. That way, I stand out.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74609851,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-91956/74609851.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/ashi-singh-in-the-race-to-look-glamorous-most-girls-look-the-same/articleshow/74609862.cms

9,['14/03/2020'],"Chennaiyin, ATK Chase third ISL title behind closed doors at Fatorda","Margao: Chennaiyin FC have fond memories of their time at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda. It was here that they recorded their debut win, here that they stunned hosts FC Goa for their maiden Indian Super League ( ISL ) crown in 2015. Since then, they have added one more trophy to their cabinet, and on Saturday they can create history once again by becoming the first club to clinch their third trophy.

It won’t be easy. At the other end, there is ATK , a team which is as successful and with similar ambitions. Even though the match will be played behind closed doors because of fears over the coronavirus, nobody will need an added dose of motivation.

ATK were always the favourites to make it to the final. Chennaiyin, however, are the dark horses, who galloped ahead of everyone else. They have come a long way since being at the bottom and just one win from their first six games.

Much of the credit goes to head coach Owen Coyle, who transformed the team after taking over from John Gregory in December.

“I took over for the Jamshedpur game and our next match against NorthEast (United) was postponed which gave me eight days to work with the team. We changed the team and discovered outstanding Indian midfielders like (Anirudh) Thapa, Germanpreet (Singh), Edwin (Vanspaul),” said Coyle.

The former Burnley manager has brought the best out of winger Lallianzuala Chhangte, who has seven goals to his credit, most from open play. The 22-year-old is the first Indian to score in both legs of the semifinals and is the second highest domestic goal-scorer behind India captain Sunil Chhetri.

“I think as a group we have worked very hard. We are not here by accident and had to win every week. It was our mentality of winning in different situations and it was just incredible,” said Coyle.

ATK and Chennaiyin are the most successful teams in the ISL but they meet for the first time in the final. Interestingly, both have never lost a final. In their first meeting this season in Chennai, ATK walked away with a solitary goal win. But Chennaiyin went all out in the return leg and won 3-1 in Kolkata.

Unlike their opponents, ATK had to claw their way back into the second leg semifinal after suffering a 0-1 defeat in Bengaluru. Although Ashique Kuruniyan gave the defending champions an early lead, ATK showed character to bounce back with Roy Krishna’s equaliser and a second half brace from David Williams. The duo forged a strong partnership which comes having played together for Wellington Phoenix in Australia.

“We have the same purpose, an idea and it will be important for ATK to win. In football , every match and final is different. We have to enjoy the match and win the final,” said coach Antonio Habbas , who won ATK’s first title in 2014.

ATK have won both their previous finals with a slender margin. They defeated Kerala 1-0 in the inaugural final and edged them out again 4-3 via tiebreaker after the teams were locked 1-1 at full time in 2016.

Chennaiyin have gone on to produce high-scoring finals. On both occasions, they won 3-2, first defeating FC Goa, and then Bengaluru in 2018. It will be interesting to see what Fatorda has in store for the teams.

TALKING POINTS

In ISL history, the team which defeated FC Goa in the semis, has never lost the final.

If Chennaiyin win, they will have a unique record of winning ISL every alternate season.

If ATK win, Antonio Habas will be the first ISL coach to win the league on multiple occasions. He also won the ISL title with ATK in 2014",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/the-final-countdown/articleshow/74619665.cms

But more than skills and technical ability, mental strength will count as the clubs will have to play behind closed doors at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Saturday.

With fears of the deadly coronavirus, sports ministry sent out an advisory on Thursday asking national sports federations to “ensure that no public gathering takes place in any sporting event.” Only accredited team officials, ground staff and media would be allowed at the venue.

“It is a big problem in the world and in India. We have to respect the decision of the organisers because the safety of the people is more important than football . It is obviously different to play with support and without support,” said ATK head coach Antonio Habbas .

The home venue of FC Goa attracted an average crowd of 13,000 for each match and would have certainly exceeded the number considering travelling fans.

“This is the first game I will play without fans. I think everybody will agree that football without fans is not the same, but first of all we have to think about the safety of the people and that was a good decision of the league. I don't think about this too much and be focused on this game to be the champions of the ISL,” said Chennaiyin captain Lucian Goian.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/isl-final-empty-stands-but-enough-motivation/articleshow/74619680.cms

The All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) has decided to play the remaining 28 matches in the I-League behind closed doors but that hasn’t eased fears over the deadly coronavirus A few I-League clubs have raised concerns that their players, particularly those from foreign shores, will hold them responsible, should things go wrong.A leading club has already withdrawn a goalkeeper from their squad before travelling for an outstation game after he showed signs of fever. Unwilling to take any risk, the player was sent for tests and initial reports suggest there is nothing to worry.“It has been decided by the AIFF to complete the I-league season with the remaining matches being played behind closed doors. Only officials and players of the teams, match officials, limited number of LOC members, medical staff, TV crew and registered journalists and photographers other than security personnel can be present within the stadium complex on matchdays,” the AIFF said in a statement on Friday.The AIFF also said they are in the process of reworking the fixtures “so that we can try and finish the league earlier.”The email sent to all participating clubs received favourable responses from clubs like Mohun Bagan and Punjab FC, but others like Chennai City were not entirely convinced.“I personally feel that the league should consider to postpone since health and safety of all players comes first. We already have faced couple of issues from foreign players and especially from their families abroad on this concern. The initial problem or worry is not about conducting the games closed doors, but the fact that the virus can be spread while travelling as well, especially in airports,” Chennai City said their email to the AIFF.The former champions though said, “considering the importance of finishing the league and also taking logistics into concern, we will look to convince our players and support staff on the decision.”",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/i-league-behind-closed-doors-foreign-players-raise-an-alarm/articleshow/74619705.cms
12,['14/03/2020'],"#CoronaScare: With Delhi halls shut, will people flock to Gurgaon or Noida?","In response to the coronavirus threat and as a precautionary measure, the Delhi government on Thursday evening decided to shut down cinema halls till March 31. The announcement has impacted the release of four Bollywood films – 'Angrezi Medium' (which released yesterday), 'Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar', 'Sir and ' Sooryavanshi '. While all shows in Delhi have been cancelled, the cinemas in Noida and Gurgaon will continue to run, since both Uttar Pradesh and Haryana haven't yet issued any orders to shut theatres. However, exhibitors and distributors say that they can't predict whether moviegoers will head to Noida and Gurgaon to watch recently released films.A couple of hours after the announcement, the makers of Akshay Kumar-starrer Sooryavanshi announced that the film, which was to release on March 24, has been postponed. The statement read, ""Due to the recent coronavirus outbreak, we, the makers, have decided to postpone the release of Sooryavanshi, keeping in mind the health and safety of the audience. Sooryavanshi will be back when the time is right.""Tillotama Shome-starrer Sir, which was to be released on March 20, has also been postponed. Shiladitya Bora, who is spearheading the India release of the film, tweeted, ""Bearing in mind public health concerns and the advisory from the health ministry, we have decided to postpone the release of Sir. We look forward to sharing the film with our home audience in India and will announce an updated release date ASAP. Meanwhile, we urge everyone to stay safe and take all necessary health precautions.""On Thursday, a statement released by Angrezi Medium’s makers confirmed that the film will be released ""as scheduled across India except for Kerala, Delhi and the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir.""Exhibitors say that the shutdown of theatres in Delhi will affect 'Angrezi Medium''s box office collection as Delhi was expected to contribute a major chunk to it. Rajendra Singh Jyala from INOX says, ""Around 15% of Angrezi Medium’s business, which would have come from Delhi, will be affected. However, safety comes first, and if other states will follow suit, then obviously we will be closing cinemas until further notice."" Joginder Mahajan, a Delhi-based distributor, pointed out that since the announcement came on Thursday, there was no time to reconsider the film’s release. ""If the decision would have come on Monday, it would not have affected Angrezi Medium as much as it will now,” he says. Sanjay Suri, who's involved with the India release of the French film Les Miserables, which also hit theatres yesterday, says, “We shall wait for the situation to improve and see if a phase-wise release (in Delhi) is possible when the shutdown is lifted. Safety is most important.""The makers of 'Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar', which is supposed to release on March 20, did not respond to our queries, but as per sources, they are sticking to the scheduled release for now.With Delhi theatres shut, will the Delhi audience go to Noida and Gurgaon now? Maybe not, say exhibitors. Yogesh Raizada of Wave Cinemas says, ""We're not sure if the shutdown in Delhi will lead to a higher occupancy in Gurgaon and Noida. Since the last couple of weeks, people have been avoiding theatres and the occupancy is down by over 30%.""A Delhi-based exhibitor says, ""Unfortunately, we have some good family films in cinemas right now, like 'Angrezi Medium' and 'Thappad', but most of the moviegoers are avoiding visiting cinemas with kids. The shutdown of Delhi theatres will have its effect in Noida and Gurgaon as well, as a huge section of moviegoers will now avoid going to cinema halls."" Shaaminder Mallik, a distributor, adds, ""We have information that other states are also planning to shut theatres. Most major films scheduled to release in April-May are likely to be postponed.""S Bansal, a distributor in the Rajasthan-Delhi belt, says, ""Other states like Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan might also follow suit and shut down their theatres for a few weeks. It will take the business over a year to recover from that. Release dates will also get affected and the calendar will be disturbed in a big way and box office clashes might become inevitable.""The spread of coronavirus and the resulting shutdown in Delhi will also affect the business of films that were released in the previous weeks. Yogesh Raizada of Wave Cinemas says, ""Had the occupancy in cinema halls not dipped last week because of coronavirus scare, 'Baaghi 3' would have done even better.""Ahmed Khan, director of 'Baaghi 3', says, ""The safety of the audience is extremely important. We would never want their lives to be at risk. It’s unfortunate that the theatres in Delhi will be shut for a while now and that will affect the overall collections of my film, but some things are beyond our control. We must follow what the government bodies decide.""Anubhav Sinha, whose directorial 'Thappad' is also still in cinemas, says, ""Thappad has completed 80% of its run at the box office. Delhi contributes about 15% to the collections. That will be impacted but we have to live with it because logon ki jaan se badhkar kuch nahi hota. But we should not panic because that can just make the situation more difficult to handle. Apart from pulling down shutters of theatres in Delhi, governments across states and UTs need to educate people about this disease.""— Inputs from Rachana Dubey",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74614334,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-205353/74614334.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/coronascare-with-delhi-halls-shut-will-people-flock-to-gurgaon-or-noida/articleshow/74614228.cms

She delivered twins — a girl and a boy — in the UK last year and returned to India a couple of months ago. She says, “I suffered a miscarriage around seven years ago. It took me a while to recover from it and be healthy again. I was working constantly and one day, I realised that it would be a never-ending cycle if I didn’t take a break to start a family. I knew that I could come back to acting anytime.”While Sara is glowing with happiness in her social media posts, the new mommy says that it’s not been an easy journey. She shares, “I suffered from baby blues and my hormones were all over the place. It wasn’t easy to breast-feed two babies and three months into it, I was hospitalised for dehydration. While motherhood is one of the happiest experiences in a woman’s life, I wondered why every little thing affected me. I was tired and lethargic, and was crying every day. Though my husband (Arfeen) is a life coach, one can never train a close family member. So, I started taking therapy.”Seeking professional advice did help. Sara says, “One day, I decided to take charge of my life and I realised that I needed to step out, to begin with. It seemed difficult in the beginning, as I couldn’t step out of the room, let alone the house. Even dressing up took a lot of effort. I had to coach my mind and make conscious efforts to get over that phase. The most difficult part was getting used to my bloated body. Once I returned to India, five months after my delivery, I rested for about 20 days and started working out slowly. It’s important to lose postpartum weight the right way. I am way happier now and can’t wait to get back to acting, but it will depend on the kind of offers I get and how my babies react to me leaving for work.”Talking about losing postpartum weight, does she feel that the society puts pressure on a woman to look perfect post pregnancy? “I don’t let society put any pressure on me. After delivering twins, I am amazed by how God has made a woman’s body. How can I find faults in my body after I’ve given life? I will take my own time to let my body heal and get fit.

Rudra, who has been part of shows like Kullfi Kumarr Bajewala, Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai and Balika Vadhu , replies, “I had never thought about leaving CRPF and becoming an actor, but in 2007, I was forced to quit because of severe back pain.

While toying with the idea of starting a business venture, I came to Mumbai for some personal work. One day, a friend asked me to try acting and I started giving auditions. It happened suddenly.”Hailing from Jodhpur and with no connections in the industry, it wasn’t easy for Rudra to find a foothold.

20,['14/03/2020'],Dance your way to better mental health,"Think of the word ""therapy"" and you’re automatically picturing a room with a counsellor sitting on a couch in front of you, discussing mental health issues and solutions. While counselling sessions are important and helpful for those suffering from mental health problems, there are some who hesitate at the thought of opening up to someone verbally. Experts recommend alternative therapies for them and one that is slowly but gradually gaining popularity in India is Dance Movement Therapy (DMT).DMT is a type of therapy that uses the body, movement and dance as a way of expressing oneself and findings ways of exploring and addressing psychological problems or difficulties. Dance therapy gradually gained acceptance in the field of mental health.One of the pioneers of DMT in India and co-founder of Creative Movement Therapy Association of India (CMTAI), Tripura Kashyap recalls, ""Though creative movement therapy started off as a form of treatment for war veterans and psychiatric patients, its scope and application gradually widened to embrace people with developmental, medical, social and physical impairments."" She adds, ""India has thousands of dance forms and it is worth exploring how these can be used to help people open up and express their mental health problems without the fear of being judged."" DMT can also be the perfect outlet for many to deal with daily anger and frustration, say experts.Clients of any age can attend these therapy sessions to relieve their stress, improve their confidence & self-esteem, and to get over body image issues. ""As a form of therapy it is not restricted to any specific clientele base. From neurotypicals to kids suffering from learning disorders and attention deficiency, DMT can help anyone,"" says Reetu Jain, co-founder of CMTAI. DMT can also leave a deep impact on people who have suffered from any kind of trauma and are not comfortable in opening up verbally.""Attending a regular dance class is done with the intent to either learn, perform the art, improvise movements or to have a good time. But DMT uses the body and movement to foster communication and integrate physical, emotional functioning for clients/patients,"" explains Nishi Joshi, a licensed Dance Movement Psychotherapist. In DMT, each session looks unique depending on the clinician, clients, and setting.A typical DMT session is around 50-60 minutes long and has a definitive but loose structure. The first few minutes are spent checking verbally where the clients/patients interact with the facilitator and tell them how they are doing. Then begins the warm-up session followed by theme development, which is the most important part of the session. Theme development is the part where facilitator holds a safe space for the client to move and express theirselves. (The session varies from client to client.) The end of the session is dedicated to a verbal processing of the entire session where the clients are free to open up verbally.With talking about mental health still being considered a bit of a taboo subject across the globe, many people find opting for methods like DMT much easier. ""Our first mode of expression, as we're born is through our body and without words. So movement is natural to us. Whereas it isn’t always easy to put words to how one is feeling, or thinking. That’s what makes DMT effective, where the client and therapist can have a dialogue without words and any taboo,"" explains Nishi Joshi, a licensed Dance Movement Therapist. As it might not be easy to express with words in a therapy session, movement therapy opens up the possibility of expressing through the body by holding a safe space for the client to move and create their own flow and rhythm.""Workplace stress and anger issues are two things I am trying to fight. While DMT has helped me recognise some of it, my therapist believes that I have a long way to go. DMT has helped me more than speech therapy as I didn’t even know that I had a problem,"" says Muskan Kapoor, marketing professional from west Delhi.""I like to go for DMT group sessions instead of getting one-on-one therapy. It makes me more comfortable. Getting to meet so many new people and rediscovering myself along with them is a very cathartic process and helps me connect with my inner self,"" says Jenika Agarwal, a corporate employee from Gurgaon.DMT is also being used as a co-curricular activity in educational settings nowadays and as adjunctive therapy in hospitals, special schools, halfway homes, and treatment centers. Some organisations in India provide diploma courses and hold workshops for the same.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74615011,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-205141/74615011.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/dance-your-way-to-better-mental-health/articleshow/74614893.cms
21,['14/03/2020'],"#CoronaScare: With Delhi halls shut, will people flock to Gurgaon or Noida?","In response to the coronavirus threat and as a precautionary measure, the Delhi government on Thursday evening decided to shut down cinema halls till March 31. The announcement has impacted the release of four Bollywood films – 'Angrezi Medium' (which released yesterday), 'Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar', 'Sir and 'Sooryavanshi'. While all shows in Delhi have been cancelled, the cinemas in Noida and Gurgaon will continue to run, since both Uttar Pradesh and Haryana haven't yet issued any orders to shut theatres. However, exhibitors and distributors say that they can't predict whether moviegoers will head to Noida and Gurgaon to watch recently released films.A couple of hours after the announcement, the makers of Akshay Kumar-starrer Sooryavanshi announced that the film, which was to release on March 24, has been postponed. The statement read, ""Due to the recent coronavirus outbreak, we, the makers, have decided to postpone the release of Sooryavanshi, keeping in mind the health and safety of the audience. Sooryavanshi will be back when the time is right.""Tillotama Shome-starrer Sir, which was to be released on March 20, has also been postponed. Shiladitya Bora, who is spearheading the India release of the film, tweeted, ""Bearing in mind public health concerns and the advisory from the health ministry, we have decided to postpone the release of Sir. We look forward to sharing the film with our home audience in India and will announce an updated release date ASAP. Meanwhile, we urge everyone to stay safe and take all necessary health precautions.""On Thursday, a statement released by Angrezi Medium’s makers confirmed that the film will be released ""as scheduled across India except for Kerala, Delhi and the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir.""Exhibitors say that the shutdown of theatres in Delhi will affect 'Angrezi Medium''s box office collection as Delhi was expected to contribute a major chunk to it. Rajendra Singh Jyala from INOX says, ""Around 15% of Angrezi Medium’s business, which would have come from Delhi, will be affected. However, safety comes first, and if other states will follow suit, then obviously we will be closing cinemas until further notice."" Joginder Mahajan, a Delhi-based distributor, pointed out that since the announcement came on Thursday, there was no time to reconsider the film’s release. ""If the decision would have come on Monday, it would not have affected Angrezi Medium as much as it will now,” he says. Sanjay Suri, who's involved with the India release of the French film Les Miserables, which also hit theatres yesterday, says, “We shall wait for the situation to improve and see if a phase-wise release (in Delhi) is possible when the shutdown is lifted. Safety is most important.""The makers of 'Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar', which is supposed to release on March 20, did not respond to our queries, but as per sources, they are sticking to the scheduled release for now.With Delhi theatres shut, will the Delhi audience go to Noida and Gurgaon now? Maybe not, say exhibitors. Yogesh Raizada of Wave Cinemas says, ""We're not sure if the shutdown in Delhi will lead to a higher occupancy in Gurgaon and Noida. Since the last couple of weeks, people have been avoiding theatres and the occupancy is down by over 30%.""A Delhi-based exhibitor says, ""Unfortunately, we have some good family films in cinemas right now, like 'Angrezi Medium' and 'Thappad', but most of the moviegoers are avoiding visiting cinemas with kids. The shutdown of Delhi theatres will have its effect in Noida and Gurgaon as well, as a huge section of moviegoers will now avoid going to cinema halls."" Shaaminder Mallik, a distributor, adds, ""We have information that other states are also planning to shut theatres. Most major films scheduled to release in April-May are likely to be postponed.""S Bansal, a distributor in the Rajasthan-Delhi belt, says, ""Other states like Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan might also follow suit and shut down their theatres for a few weeks. It will take the business over a year to recover from that. Release dates will also get affected and the calendar will be disturbed in a big way and box office clashes might become inevitable.""The spread of coronavirus and the resulting shutdown in Delhi will also affect the business of films that were released in the previous weeks. Yogesh Raizada of Wave Cinemas says, ""Had the occupancy in cinema halls not dipped last week because of coronavirus scare, 'Baaghi 3' would have done even better.""Ahmed Khan, director of 'Baaghi 3', says, ""The safety of the audience is extremely important. We would never want their lives to be at risk. It’s unfortunate that the theatres in Delhi will be shut for a while now and that will affect the overall collections of my film, but some things are beyond our control. We must follow what the government bodies decide.""Anubhav Sinha, whose directorial 'Thappad' is also still in cinemas, says, ""Thappad has completed 80% of its run at the box office. Delhi contributes about 15% to the collections. That will be impacted but we have to live with it because logon ki jaan se badhkar kuch nahi hota. But we should not panic because that can just make the situation more difficult to handle.

24,['14/03/2020'],"Coronavirus in Delhi: As screens go dark, cinema halls stare at loss of crores","NEW DELHI: Roughly 150 cinema screens in Delhi have gone blank. The state government announced the closure of all cinema halls till March 31 in view of the risk posed by the novel coronavirus . The halls were already counting their losses with many movie releases being postponed and people wary of going to theatres. The two-week closure will affect not just the movie industry, but also cinema-associated industries such as retail and food and beverage outlets.Contrary to the belief that OTT, or streaming, platforms were weaning away cine-goers, theatre attendance was actually on the rise. An industry expert associated with a leading cinema chain estimates that around 2,000 people visit a multiplex on weekdays with the number touching 3,000-3,500 on a weekend if a popular movie is being screened. This translates, he explained, into roughly one lakh people seeing movies in the city’s multiplexes every day and spending on average Rs 500 per person for tickets and snacks. “Going to a movie also includes parking cost, fuel cost and taxes on movie tickets and food. Entertainment, especially movies, is a big revenue and economic contributor,” he said.Amit Sharma, MD of Miraj Cinemas, which as 128 screens across India, felt a shutdown in Delhi would mean a loss of up to Rs 20 crore per week for the industry. “There are new releases every week. There are movies that are in their second or third weeks and are having a good run alongside sought-after regional movies. All these earnings come to a standstill in case of a shutdown and impact the movie industry as a whole,” he said.Sharma though conceded that the situation created by the novel coronavirus was beyond anyone’s control and that he would not lay off any employee but bear their cost. “When the world enjoys movies on the weekends, our staff almost never have an off. This is the time to stand by them,” he asserted.Employees at other cinemas in the city are worried about their jobs as the communication from their employers hasn’t been as clear as Sharma’s. Most of them reported to work on Friday. Some who spoke to TOI on condition of anonymity complained that there had been no clear direction on whether to sit at home or report for work. “This is not a time when one can afford to lose a job loss because there aren’t other outlets hiring anyone for the next few weeks,” said a cinema employee.Most advance bookings for the closure period have been refunded, including those that were bought at the cinema counters, which are being refunded on site. Majority of the phone calls made to the cinemas on Friday related to refunds. Effort was made to explain that refunds were being processed at the earliest either by the cinemas or by the popular ticket booking platforms, a cinema worker revealed.PVR Cinemas, which has 68 screens in Delhi, stated that it believed this was a temporary crisis and remained optimistic about the film business in India. Sharma similarly said he expected things to pick up post Good Friday on April 10 and normalcy returning from May with the virus successfully contained across the globe by then.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74622856,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-230519,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/coronavirus-in-delhi-as-screens-go-dark-cinema-halls-stare-at-loss-of-crores/articleshow/74620160.cms
25,['14/03/2020'],"Coronavirus cases in India: Fewer cases, but India becomes 5th country to isolate coronavirus","More on Covid-19

NEW DELHI: India has become the fifth country to successfully isolate a strain of the novel coronavirus. China, Japan, Thailand and the US did it before.Simply put, it means that scientists have been able to obtain a pure sample of the virus that has been contained outside the human body.The scientific success is important because it will help in developing drugs, vaccines and rapid diagnostic test kits, the director general of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Dr Balram Bhargava, said.He added that the isolation of the novel coronavirus, the agent responsible for the ongoing outbreak of Covid-19, wasn't easy as India had fewer positive cases when they started the project.""Total 21 throat swab and nasal swab samples were examined for this purpose. Of that, 11 tested positive and eight strains could be isolated from among them. They are 99.98% identical with the strain of the virus that led to outbreaks in Wuhan in China,"" said Dr R R Gangakhedkar, chief epidemiologist at ICMR. He added that now scientists can test whether a drug will work against the virus or not to develop rapid diagnostic kits.The isolation of this virus will also help in understanding the biology and evolution of the novel coronavirus, say ICMR experts. Till date, there is no cure for Covid-19. Also, there is no preventive vaccination.Anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir have been tried on some Covid-19 patients, including the Italian national admitted at Sawai Man Singh hospital in Jaipur, with promising results. But the scientists said it is too early to conclude the efficacy.Most patients are only receiving symptomatic treatment, they added.Recently, in a draft report made public by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the experts claimed that Remdesivir, a drug developed for use against ebola, which caused major outbreaks in remote villages in Central Africa in 2014, is most promising for treating Covid-19.This is because the in-vitro (tests performed in test tube) and in-vivo (tests performed in living organism) data for the drug is available for coronaviruses. ""Further, studies in mice using Remdesivir showed superior efficacy over Kaletra+IFNbeta,"" the draft report said.The report added that a clinical trial is being planned in China to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug in association with optimised standard of care, as the next step. Remdesivir slows the infection of healthy cells by blocking viral replication.The WHO expert also reviewed drugs used in HIV treatment - lopinavir and ritonavir - either alone or in combination with IFNbeta. It stated that among the repurposed drugs under consideration, this would be the suitable second option for rapid implementation in clinical trials.The use of convalescent sera-serum obtained from someone who has recovered from an infectious disease and considered to be especially rich in antibodies against the infectious agent of the disease could also be an option, said the expert group. However, the report added: ""...but it remains to be defined if sufficient amounts of sera with high antibodies titres could be feasibly collected, using concentration and purification processes.""",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74620343,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-81646,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fewer-cases-but-india-becomes-5th-country-to-isolate-coronavirus/articleshow/74620323.cms

27,['14/03/2020'],UP govt brings ordinance to recover dues from protesters,"LUCKNOW: The UP government on Friday empowered itself to recover the cost of property damaged during protests, riots and rallies from the accused by promulgating the 'UP Recovery of Public and Private Property Ordinance'.The ordinance was cleared by the Yogi Adityanath cabinet even as a three-judge Supreme Court bench is slated to hear the state's special leave petition next week challenging the Allahabad high court order which asked the government to remove hoardings carrying names, pictures and addresses of 57 protesters accused of damaging properties during anti-CAA violence in Lucknow on December 19.After large-scale violence in December during the protests in which property worth crores was damaged, the government had served recovery notices on the accused, citing a 2009 order of the Supreme Court.State finance minister Suresh Khanna told newspersons after the cabinet meeting that the SC, in reference to writ petition 77/2007, had said in 2009 that a strict law was needed to recover costs if private or public property had been damaged during protests like political rallies, strikes and sit-ins.""Following that order, we have cleared the ordinance. The next step is to draft the rules for this law which will also be cleared by the cabinet,"" Khanna said, adding that in the 2009 order, the SC had talked about constituting a recovery tribunal to recover losses to government and private properties in political and illegal agitations in the country.Although the rules for recovery of cost of damage to property are yet to be framed, a UP government source said that ""posting of pictures and other details of accused in such cases"" is likely to be included.As anti-CAA protests broke out across UP, Yogi had said that the government would recover the cost for the destruction of property from those who indulged in violence. The government served more than 500 notices on people across the state in the aftermath of the December violence. Out of these, 57 notices were issued just in Lucknow.After SC's 2009 order, the Allahabad high court also issued a similar order on December 2, 2010 which was followed by a government order (GO) on January 8, 2011 during the BSP regime. The 2011 GO said: ""...the damage suffered to public property shall be assessed and the concerned department, local body, public corporation etc, i.e. the owner of the property, shall file a claim for realisation of such amount from the political parties/persons (who called for agitation/procession in which damage takes place)"".It adds that if the person or persons against whom the claim is filed were responsible for the loss, ""the amount assessed and awarded by such competent authority shall be realised, if not paid on its own by the person responsible within such time as directed, as arrears of land revenue"".The Allahahad high court took suo motu cognizance of these 'name and shame' hoardings and directed the government to pull down the banners immediately. However, the government challenged the order in the Supreme Court.Referring to SC's 2009 order, government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh said: ""The SC had asked for a law to be made and we are only respecting that. The CM's decision to challenge the HC order will ensure that such incidents of violent protests will not take place in the state again.""",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74620418,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1659157,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/up-govt-brings-ordinance-to-recover-dues-from-protesters/articleshow/74620406.cms

NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR: In the first release of a former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, who has been kept in detention since the nullification of Article 370, National Conference patriarch and Srinagar MP Farooq Abdullah on Friday stepped out of his Gupkar Road home after seven months.

Abdullah, 82, was booked under the Public Safety Act, on grounds that he had made speeches that could inflame public sentiment. His release, official sources said, could set the stage for his son Omar Abdullah and PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti , both former CMs, also being freed — perhaps signalling a political thaw.

He parried questions from reporters on his future plans, saying he would “prefer silence till others detained under PSA are released”. With wife Molly by his side, he said, “I am free... Hope other political leaders will be released soon. I thank all parliamentarians who fought for my freedom. Will be able to take a decision on future only after other leaders are released.”

Asked if he would continue to speak out against nullification of Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution to revoke J&K’s special status, Farooq said, “I will go to Parliament and raise my voice there.”

There had been reports of a political outreach to those held in detention at their homes with former RAW chief AS Dulat meeting Abdullah. There were indications that NC and PDP, the two main regional parties in the Valley, might consider participating in panchayat elections if their members were released. There was also a limit, in political terms, to the length of detention, particularly as the situation has been largely peaceful.

“The release of Farooq Abdullah and further plans to review detention orders of Mehbooba and Omar under J&K Public Safety Act (PSA) indicate the situation in J&K has returned to complete normalcy,” said a central government functionary. The detention order issued under PSA against Mehbooba and Omar in early February has a validity of three months.

Sources said political activity was already on with former PDP, NC and Congress MLAs floating Apni Party. “The release of top leaders of NC and PDP will now restore political activity in full and also ensure they are part of consultations on proposed delimitation of assembly and parliamentary seats,” the functionary said.

Abdullah’s release comes as there are indications that the Centre might consider scheduling panchayat polls that were put off recently. The emergence of Apni Party under former PDP member Altaf Bukhari, with the support of some 40 former legislators, has stirred the waters in the Valley and given NC and PDP something to think about.

Principal secretary (home) Shaleen Kabra’s order announcing the administration’s decision came after Abdullah completed six months of detention under a law which, ironically enough, was enacted in 1978 by his father Sheikh Abdullah.

Though the NC chairman had been under house arrest since August 5 last year, it wasn’t until September 15 that the administration invoked PSA to extend his custody by three months. The move came hours before the Supreme Court was to hear a petition filed by MDMK’s Vaiko, challenging Abdullah’s detention. On December 13, the administration issued a fresh order extending his detention by another three months.

TOI has learnt that the delimitation commission — constituted last week with former SC judge Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai as chairperson and election commissioner Sushil Chandra and state CEO as ex-officio members — is likely to begin its work towards the end of this month. Sources indicated that the panel, which will also be handling delimitation of seats in four other states — Assam, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh — may take between six-eight months to complete its work.

Only after the delimitation award is notified can fresh assembly elections be held in the UT of J&K. Post-delimitation, the J&K assembly will have a total of 114 seats, up from 107 at present.

More on Covid-19

We took a comprehensive and coordinated approach to engage the entire GoI machinery in containing the situation. With the PM setting out the approach, we have worked at jet pace and in mission mode as far as our preparedness levels are concerned. We are taking a number of measures to ensure the impact from imported cases is controlled and, at the same time, the localised spread is restricted.Firstly, we are focusing on comprehensive sanitisation at entry points like airports, seaports and border crossings. Since March 4, 2020, we have undertaken universal screening for all international passengers coming to India. Teams of specialist doctors have been stationed at all airports to ensure effective screening and arrangement for isolation in attached hospitals. Screening of passengers has also been initiated at 12 major sea ports and 65 non-major ports to identify passengers and crew coming from China and to isolate if found symptomatic.Government has initiated screening at all integrated check posts with bordering countries in collaboration with states of UP, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Sikkim and Bihar as well as Sashastra Seema Bal and Land Port Authorities.We are using stringent 'contact surveillance' for cases having travel history from all major Covid-19 affected countries. Through the Integrated Disease Surveillance network, all such persons were tracked and as on March 13, 2020, a total of 42,000 individuals were brought under 'community surveillance' and state and district surveillance officers and rapid response teams are monitoring them daily.On receipt of requests from around 11 countries - Maldives, Myanmar, Bangladesh, China, South Africa, USA, Sri Lanka, Nepal, South Africa, Peru and Madagascar - we brought back 43 foreign nationals from Wuhan and five from Japan.We focused on identifying gaps and building capacity of our health response system. We have done a massive capacity building exercise in the last 55 days in epidemiology, surveillance, laboratory support, clinical management, non-pharmaceutical interventions, infection prevention and risk communication. We are countering misinformation campaigns and rumours on social media and other platforms. So far, around 25,000 calls (011-23978046) have been attended including around 981 international calls.States and central government hospitals have been advised for assessment of isolation and critical care facilities. Sufficient isolation beds and supplies have been made available in tertiary facilities across India. I have also held meetings with leading private hospitals and they have all assured all support. Nearly 14,000 quarantine beds have been identified so far and more are being identified.As on date, around 17,500 beds are available at various government facilities at central and state government level. Additional facilities will be made available as and when required.We have asked leading manufacturers of masks, personal equipment to share details of production capacities, stocks in hand. Details of all manufacturers have been shared with principal secretaries of all states and UTs to enable them to contact suppliers and undertake procurement. Sufficient supplies are available to handle any situation that might arise.We have stocks of medicines varying from four months to nine months depending on the medicine. We are given to understand that China has restarted its plants and started supply of medicines from second week of February 2020 from all their provinces except Hubei.We have sent 117.2 crore SMS's. Dos and Don'ts are being played on every mobile call. Ads have been issued in 156 newspapers. MyGov weekly mailers have been sent to 70 lakh users and push notifications have been sent to another 20 lakh users. We have also asked for display of dos and don'ts at post offices, railway stations, airports, other public places.In rural areas, we have adopted a two-pronged strategy. Eight central teams have been deputed to the rural areas adjoining our international borders in UP, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Sikkim and Bihar to review activities at the border crossings, conduct gram sabhas and facilitate awareness and risk communication to the communities. Elsewhere we have sought support of the ministry of panchayati raj to facilitate awareness generation. We are also utilising the network of National Disaster Management Authority to spread awareness.We are regularly reviewing the emerging situation and preparedness with the states and UTs. Along with Union health secretary, I have been organising regular meetings with state/UT health ministers, health secretaries and other senior officials. On Holi (March 10) I had called up health ministers of coronavirus-affected states to get feedback about the condition of patients and problems being faced in availability of required supplies of personal protective equipment, masks and capacity building of health workers.NIV, Pune is the nodal laboratory. As part of Indian Council of Medical Research's preparedness for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, NIV has established capacity for molecular diagnosis of Covid-19. Next generation sequencing has also been established. The facility for collection and testing of clinical samples has been established in 52 labs. 57 labs have been identified as sample collection centres. The network is being further expanded.At the highest level, PM Modi is reviewing the situation on regular basis with representatives of all central ministries.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74620513,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-279527,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/working-at-jet-pace-to-check-major-coronavirus-outbreak-harsh-vardhan/articleshow/74620510.cms

More on Covid-19

NEW DELHI: As the world battles the coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched a diplomatic initiative by inviting all SAARC nations to jointly combat the global health crisis.In a tweet that created a huge buzz through South Asia, Modi said, “I would like to propose that the leadership of SAARC nations chalk out a strong strategy to fight Coronavirus. We could discuss, via video conferencing, ways to keep our citizens healthy. Together, we can set an example to the world, and contribute to a healthier planet.”Sources said, the video conference, would be set up in the next few days.Modi’s invoking of SAARC was itself significant as in the past three years, the government has consistently overlooked SAARC, even promoting other regional arrangements like BIMSTEC. No SAARC summit has been held since November, 2014 in Kathmandu. India refused to participate in the 2016 summit in Islamabad after the Uri terror attack. No summit happened in 2018 either.The PM’s invitation was accepted by all SAARC nations, except Pakistan which had not responded till late Friday evening. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa responded in a tweet: “Thank you for the great initiative Shri @narendramodi- #LKA is ready to join the discussion & share our learnings & best practices and to learn from other #SAARC members. Let’s unite in solidarity during these trying times and keep our citizens safe.”The reason for the Indian outreach is perhaps the extrenely porous borders which could undermine efforts of one country by flow of people and goods. Wagah and Attari borders with Pakistan are open as also borderwith Bangladesh in Meghalaya. So, it makes sense for all countries of the region to coordinate their actions and responses, as one official said, “contain and control” should be the mainstay during the crisis.President of the Maldives Ibrahim Mohamed “Ibu” Solih said, “Thank you PM @narendramodi for taking the initiative on this important endeavor. Covid 19 requires collective effort to defeat it. Maldives welcomes this proposal and would fully support such a regional effort.”Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli said,“I welcome the idea advanced by Prime Minister Modiji @narendramodi for chalking out a strong strategy by the leadership of the SAARC nations to fight Coronavirus. My government is ready to work closely with SAARC member-states to protect our citizens from this deadly disease.”In his response, Bhutan PM Lotay Tshering said, “This is what we call leadership. As members of this region, we must come together in such times. Smaller economies are hit harder, so we must coordinate. With your leadership, I have no doubt we will see immediate and impactful outcome. Looking forward to the video conference.”By evening, governments of Afghanistan and Bangladesh had also accepted the invitation. Bangladesh’s junior foreign minister Shahriar Alam tweeted, “HPM Sheikh Hasina welcomes the proposal and look forward to a constructive dialogue with @narendramodi @ibusolih @PM_Nepal @PMBhutan @GotabayaR n others HOSs/HOGs who already consented to discuss way forward at this testing times for the region and the world.”Modi’s new outreach raised hopes for revival of SAARC. However, sources said the potential collaboration would be under the regional rubric and this would not be extended to other areas. India has refused to be part of SAARC as long as Pakistan engages in cross-border terrorism.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74620540,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-35007,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-pm-urges-saarc-nations-to-join-forces-members-welcome-move-pak-mum/articleshow/74620530.cms

“Common people don’t need to wear expensive masks... Most of the people buy them due to lack of awareness and deceitful marketing of masks. Panic-stricken parents are buying exorbitant N-95 and surgical masks but they are not required,” Agarwal said.

“Only Covid-19 suspects or those suffering from coronavirus or medical or paramedical staff of hospitals should wear these masks,” said Agrawal, who is also a pediatrician.

In view of the rising positive cases in India and Uttar Pradesh not remaining unscathed by the global epidemic, hand sanitizers and face masks have vanished from chemist shops in the city due to panic buying. A large number of chemist shops have run out of stock and manufacturers are yet to replenish stock as demand saw a sudden spike in the past few days.

Most of the shops have displayed ‘no mask and no sanitizer’ boards.

PATNA: All three NDA candidates for Rajya Sabha, including deputy chairman of the Upper House of Parliament Harivansh Narayan Singh, filed their nomination papers in the state assembly on Friday.

Senior NDA functionaries, including CM Nitish Kumar, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, JD(U) state president Bashishtha Narayan Singh and state BJP president Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal, accompanied them in the chamber of the state assembly secretary Bateshwar Nath Pandey.

While Harivansh is the nominee of the JD(U), the two other NDA candidates are Ram Nath Thakur from the JD(U) and Vivek Thakur from the BJP. Several senior ministers, including Bijendra Prasad Yadav, Shrawan Kumar, Nand Kishore Yadav and Mangal Pandey were also present on the occasion.

With two RJD nominees Prem Chand Gupta and Amrendra Dhari Singh having already filed their nomination papers on Thursday, there are altogether five candidates to fill the equal number of seats that would fall vacant next month. Since no sixth candidate is in race, all five candidates looked set to get elected unopposed.

While the scrutiny of papers will be done on Monday, the five candidates would be deemed as elected unopposed on March 18, the last day of withdrawal of nomination papers. Otherwise, the election date was due on March 26.

“I feel grateful to CM Nitish Kumar for selecting a common man and sending him to the Rajya Sabha,” Harivansh said. It would be his second term in the Rajya Sabha.

“The CM has been paying attention to improving the social and economic reality of the dalits, socially backward sections and economically deprived groups. He has become their voice,” Ram Nath said.

Vivek said the BJP has always been a party of committed workers and honoured them. He also thanked the party’s central and state leadership for selecting him for the Rajya Sabha. Later, he was given a rousing welcome at the party’s state headquarters. “The mood of the party workers was upbeat,” state BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said.

35,['14/03/2020'],All universities should follow PU in disbursal of retiral benefits: Lokayukta,"Patna University

PATNA: The Patna University (PU) administration on Friday got a shot in the arm from the office of the Lokayukta for timely disbursement of retiral benefits to its teachers and non-teaching staff.

In its communication to PU, the office of the Lokayukta has stated that the report submitted by PU registrar should now be made a role model for the registrars of all other universities in the state inasmuch as the payment of retiral benefits is being claimed to be made to each and every retiring employee on the date of retirement itself.

In fact, the university has also taken a lead in the matter of fixation of pay revision and consequential revision of basic pension as per the 7th Pay Committee recommendations, the report says.

The report further states that there is only one pending case of an Urdu teacher, who could not be paid his retiral benefits due to non-submission of his pension papers even after seven years of his retirement, shows the splendid efforts made by the officials and employees of PU in achieving almost zero level of pendency of retirement benefit cases. “As a matter of fact, when repeated notices have been issued to the teacher concerned and even then he has failed to comply with the orders passed by PU by way of submission of pension papers, nothing more is required to be done in this case except publication of a press communiqué in the newspaper giving one last opportunity to him to fulfil the requisite condition for receiving the retiral benefits. And, if he still fails to do so, his case will not be treated as a pending case,” the report says.

PU vice-chancellor Rash Bihari Prasad Singh, when contacted, told the newspaper that as desired by the Lokayukta, a press communiqué demanding pension papers from the retired Urdu department teacher would be published in the local newspapers soon. And, PU officials would report the matter to the office of the Lokayukta on Monday, he said.

PU has already started making payment of revised salaries and pension to the working and retired employees respectively and the arrears of difference for the period from April 2019 till date would be paid along with the salaries and pension of March. The state government is also likely to release funds for payment of arrears of revised pay and pension with effect from January 2016 to March 2019, the VC added.

36,['14/03/2020'],New vehicle sales in city hit recession roadblock,"Surat: The ongoing recession in the diamond , real estate and textile sectors coupled with cash crunch in the market has affected purchase of new vehicles.

This is evident from the data of vehicle registrations the Surat Regional Transport Office (RTO), which is struggling to achieve its annual target of revenue collection.

The registration of new vehicles fell by nearly 18% in the city between April-February, 2020 and it is likely to further drop by the end of March.

Against the annual revenue target of Rs 475 crore in 2019-20, the RTO has been collected Rs 290 crore till February, falling short of Rs 185 crore.

“We won’t be able to achieve the target this time due to the sharp fall in the registration of new vehicles. Most of our revenue comes from the motor vehicle tax, but in 2019-20, the sale of vehicles has dropped 18%,” said in-charge regional transport officer, DK Chavda.

According to Chavda, the overall revenue collection of RTO comes from motor vehicle tax, licence fees, passenger tax, compounding fees and other fees.

Industry sources said that the situation of automobile sector is worrisome and few dealers have also closed their showrooms in the last one year.

Amish Mali, CEO of a leading automobile brand, told TOI: “At least dealers have shut down their showrooms in the last one year. The purchasing power of the people in the city has gone due to various factors including inflation, market slowdown etc.”

Mali added, “There is a flat 28% GST on the car and that the customers have to pay 20% cess on buying cars below 1500 CC and 23% on those above 1,500 CC. The price of cars have increased in the recent past, which has come as a major deterrent for the customers.”

Mehul Soni, owner of a two-wheelers dealership, said, “Crisis in the diamond, textile and real estate sectors has badly hit purchases. Also, the implementation of BS-VI vehicles has led to prices of vehicles increase by Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000. There is nearly 30% drop in the sales of two-wheelers”

The rupee recovered sharply to 73.91, up 31 paise against the dollar, as the RBI’s measures were seen to be supporting the Indian currency.The forex markets were also reassured by the RBI’s statement on ensuring normalcy. “The RBI is closely and continuously monitoring the rapidly evolving global situation and will take all necessary measures to ensure that money, debt and forex markets remain adequately liquid and stable, and continue to function normally,” the RBI said in a statement, while announcing a Rs 25,000-crore, seven-day repo auction. IFA Global founder & CEO Abhishek Goenka said, “The panic in equities did not snowball into currencies to the same extent. The central bank has done a good job of containing volatility so far. After making a lifetime low of 74.49 levels, the dollar-rupee pair retraced to 74 mark on visible regulatory interventions. A weekly close on either side of the range 73.75-74.50 will guide further direction.”Foreign institutional investors have pulled out over $5 billion from the equity markets this month. While the RBI has a large stash of dollars with which it can defend the rupee, it is using the reserves to stem the volatility by ensuring a constant supply of dollars at the market rate.Despite the RBI’s announcement of a repo to ease liquidity, yield on the 10-year bond inched up as a continuing global lockdown is expected to turn international investors risk-averse. The dollar continued to gain against emerging market currencies.Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve said it would give banks $1.5 trillion. But the announcement failed to have a positive impact on markets, which were spooked by the travel restrictions. “Dollar index stood tall as investors scrambled for the world’s most liquid currency amid deepening panic about the coronavirus , while the euro nursed losses after ECB disappointed by not cutting rates,” said SMC Investments in a report.According to A Prasanna of ICICI Securities Primary Dealership, the RBI’s out-of-turn repo auction suggests that it is proactive in addressing market dislocations as they arise. “The central bank would also be well advised to put in place contingency plans for smooth functioning of financial markets in case the virus outbreak hits closer home in Mumbai,” he said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74620211,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-95177,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rupee-rebounds-from-new-lows-as-rbi-gives-rs-25k-cr-support/articleshow/74620212.cms
39,['14/03/2020'],"With just 2-3 months worth of raw material, industry hopes Covid-19 threat subsides soon","Panaji: Goa’s industrial sector will face a severe crunch in raw material supply in the coming two to three months if the emerging threat of coronavirus (Covid-19) does not subside, said Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Manoj Caculo here on Friday.

While the tourism sector has already been hit by the spread of the virus, the manufacturing sector is yet to press the panic button.

“Production is not affected as raw material continues to come in. But if this continues, and it doesn’t get corrected soon, demand will drop and production will get affected. At present people have stock to last another two or three months. However, if any industry is dependent on raw material from outside the country, like China, they will not be able to sustain for more than that as raw material will totally be in short supply by then,” Caculo said.

He was speaking to reporters in Panaji after a function organised by the income tax department to create awareness about the centre’s “Vivad se Vishwas” scheme.

Caculo said that while tourism has already felt the impact of the virus outbreak, the retail and auto sector are also showing a decline.

“The retail industry is suffering as people are avoiding going out to public places,” Caculo said.

Caculo also said the sales of four and two-wheelers has remained poor with dealers struggling to sell vehicles with BS4 engines.

“The four-wheeler sector is not affected much, but the stock of two-wheelers is a lot and it seems difficult that it will be sold by March-end. The auto industry is dependent on components coming from China and Thailand, so production could be affected, but since demand is low, production is also low,” he said.

Soaps and different brands of handwash are also in high demand.There is also shortage of N95 masks and alcohol-based sanitizers. Diwakar Prasad, owner of a chemist shop near Gola Road, said people are buying masks and hand sanitizers in large numbers. “Taking precautions is all right, but stocking products at home is not advisable,” he said and added that there has been 80% rise in the demand of self-hygiene products. “The alcohol-based sanitizers at my shop are out of stock. Besides, there are very few N95 masks left in stock,” Prasad said.Malls and supermarkets are also finding it difficult to meet the increasing demands of hand sanitizers. In addition, soaps, handwash, mosquito repellent cream, wipes, roll-ons, coils, mats, vaporisers and sprays are in high demand following the rumours about the spread of Covid-19.Ghanshyam, a sales executive in a mall on Boring Road, said, “Earlier, people in the city didn’t take the virus seriously, but after seeing so many positive cases in several parts of the country, they have become conscious. No wonder, we are facing shortage of self-hygiene products, especially hand sanitizers, soaps and handwash.”Wholesalers also made similar claims about the shortage of sanitizers and other products “There has been a higher demand of personal care products in the last fortnight. Earlier, people asked for simple sanitizers but now they look for alcohol-based ones,” said Kumud Sao, a wholesaler of Kadamkuan.Residents also feel scarcity of masks and hand sanitizers following the rise in Covid-19 cases in the country. “Last night I went to buy masks for my family and myself, but the seller offered me a very low quality mask at a very high price.

The move could prompt more organisations to issue similar guidelines to contain the pandemic.In response to a TOI query, HUL CMD Sanjiv Mehta said, “As the risk of infection is currently heightened, we have taken several measures to minimise employee exposure and ensure they as well as their families are safe. As a global business, our teams consistently work in an agile manner, meaning we already have robust systems in place. The company has decided to implement ‘work from home’ for all office-based employees starting March 17.”HUL’s total strength in India is around 18,000 employees, of which office-based employees — who will be covered under the ‘work-from-home’ guideline — are over 4,000 in number. “Our first priority is the safety of our employees, who we’ve been regularly communicating with and sharing the precautionary measures we all need to take, while ensuring business continuity,” said Mehta. With revenues of over Rs 38,000 crore, HUL is a leading fast-moving consumer goods company and India is the second-largest market for the $58-billion Unilever whose products are sold in 190 countries.As part of a new set of measures announced by Unilever to protect its people from coronavirus, CEO Alan Jope said, “All office-based employees globally should work from home. Any exceptions (which we expect to be few and far between, and most probably due to the need to access data-intensive systems) must be approved by the country general manager. The only country where this does not apply is in China, where people are beginning to return to work per national controls.”For its field sales employees, the guideline issued by the maker of brands like Dove, Knorr, Lipton and Ben & Jerry’s states they should connect with customers virtually wherever possible and minimise the use of public transport if a customer visit is necessary. “Strict protocols on social distancing (including non-physical greetings), and hand hygiene (especially after handling cash) will also be put in place and will be communicated shortly,” it said.“Since the initial outbreak in China, we have put in place measures to help minimise the risk from coronavirus to our employees and their families. Our approach has been one of abundant caution, and the speed of response and collective responsibility I have seen across Unilever has been truly heroic,” said Jope.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74624489,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-245453,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/huls-4000-office-staff-to-work-out-of-home-from-tue/articleshow/74620220.cms

MANDVI (SURAT): Umarkhadi , a tiny village , 80 km from Surat city , is set to become the first ‘avoidable blindness free’ village in Gujarat .

Avoidable blindness is blindness which can either treated or prevented by known and cost-effective means, according to International Agency for Prevention of Blindness.

A pilot project, which was initiated by Mandvi-based DivyaJyoti Trust-run Tejas Eye Hospital in this tribal village, is about to completed in the next few days.

“We had selected Umarkhadi which has 320 households with a total population of 970 to make it free of avoidable blindness. Last month, our team screened 897 villagers and the remaining 77 are being screened periodically as they are migrant workers. Of the total 897 screened, about 40% (363 people) were found to have some or the other eye problems,’’ said Dr. Uday Gajiwala, an ophthalmologist and superintendent of Tejas Eye Hospital.

Dr Gajiwala said 140 villagers were given ready made spectacles while 13 were provided tailor-made glasses.

“On checking the blood sugar of 160 people, four were found to be diabetic. We had taken photos of eye fundus (interior lining that includes retina) of 124 people of which three patients found to have abnormalities. We had given medicines to 59 people who had minor eye problems. In all, 17 villagers were referred for cataract operations of which 11 have been done,” he added.

All patients were screened and treated free of cost by the hospital.

“The idea behind the project was to prevent avoidable blindness through intensive efforts as people may neglect the eye-related problems due to lack of awareness and poverty. Out of the total blindness in the country, 80 percent blindness is avoidable and we can prevent. People visit the hospital only when eye problem becomes severe and its too late by then,’’ Dr Gajiwala added.

Chunuben Vasava, 70, a resident of Umarkhadi, said, “I was suffering from eye sight problem, but did not go to hospital. But during screening, doctors found I had cataract and I was operated the next day.”

SURAT: The textile players in Surat has opposed the proposed move to rationalise tax rate at the GST Council meeting.

A meeting was organised at the Jash textile market at Ring Road on Friday where the leaders from the powerloom weaving sector, textile traders and knitters opposed the proposed move to rationalise the GST rate in the textile sector.

Sources said that the GST council meeting will be held on Saturday where they have selected few sectors including textile for the rationalisation of GST tax rate at 12%.

The industry stakeholders stated that there are two tax slabs in the man-made fabric (MMF) sector including 12% on polyester yarn and 5% on the fabric. The powerloom weavers, traders and knitters fall under the 5% tax bracket of the GST. However, the common rate in the sector will increase the fabric cost for the end consumers.

President of Federation of Gujarat Weavers’ Association (FOSTTA) said, “The tax rationalisation move by the GST council is only going to hurt the MMF textile sector. The industry is comfortable with the 5% tax slab and that any further increase would destabilise the sector.”

Hari Kathiria, member of FOGWA said, “If the rates are revised then the industry will be facing lot of hardships in terms of sustaining the fabric prices. This will result in unemployment and closure of the powerloom units as well.”

50,['14/03/2020'],Bihar: A new device to fill trains with water in just six minutes,"An East Central Railway train

PATNA: In a bid to streamline railway traffic, the East Central Railway (ECR) successfully tested a new ‘quick watering device’ installed at Pt Deendayal Upadhaya (DDU) Junction on Thursday. The new device is likely to reduce detention of long distance passenger trains to fill water.

ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said the new device was successfully tested on the Danapur-New Delhi Jansadharan Express (13257) and Pt Deendayal Upadhaya Junction-Ara-Sasaram passenger (54271) when the full rakes of these two trains were automatically filled with water in hardly six minutes at the DDU Junction. “In normal case, it takes at least 10 to 15 minutes to fill water manually in the coaches of passenger trains,” he said.

The CPRO said DDU Junction was the first choice for the railways for installation of the new device as a large number of passenger trains pass through it. “DDU Junction is also the inter-change point for several mail and express trains coming from Eastern Railway, Northern Central Railway, Northern Railway and Western Railway. It has been observed that in case of late running of passenger trains, manual water filling process further delays trains. The new device will prove a boon as far as punctuality of trains is concerned,” the CPRO added.

He said the water filling process can be carried out simultaneously in four to five passenger trains at the DDU Junction through the new device. “Everything is computerised and controlled though remote. The new device also gives a hint about the exact requirement of water in each coach,” the CPRO added.

Special trains: Railways has decided to run superfast special train (02365/02366) between Patna and Anand Vihar to cope with passengers’ rush post Holi. While the special train will leave Patna Junction on Sunday at 8.25pm and reach Anand Vihar next day at 2.20pm, it will leave Anand Vihar on Monday at 6.45pm and reach Patna next day at 12.30pm on its return journey. Another special train (05533/05534) will run between Saharsa and Ambala. It will leave Saharsa on Sunday at 7pm and reach Ambala the next day at 12.15am.

Bharat Darshan train: Union minister of state for health Ashwani Kumar Choubey on Friday welcomed pilgrims travelling in the Bharat Darshan special train at Buxar station falling under Danapur division of the East Central Railway (ECR). Choubey said Buxar has historical importance and a place to visit for tourists. He also inaugurated a newly built VIP lounge on platform number 1 at Buxar station. Danapur divisional railway manager Sunil Kumar, senior divisional commercial manager Aadhar Raj, senior divisional engineer Sujit Jha, senior RPF commandant S K S Rathore and other railway officials were present on the occasion. The special train, which left Delhi on March 5, will cover several important tourist places in the eastern region of the country.

The results were announced by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi on Friday evening.

A farmer’s son, Abhash (22) cracked the examination in the first go and scored 87.33% marks. The overjoyed Abhash said no one had expected me to get the top rank. “I was quite sure to be in top 100 scorers, but I had never expected to top the exam. I’m very happy to make my parents proud,” he told this newspaper. “I told my parents about the results and they are very happy. They are sharing the news with all the friends and relatives in the village and here in Patna as well,” he said.

Born to Bhupendra Nath Rai and Saroj Rai (homemaker), Abhash wants to work in public sector undertakings. “Based on the GATE score, I would apply for jobs in National Thermal Power Corporation Limited and Power Grid Corporation of India. I have not decided much for the future, but I want to give a better life to my parents,” he said.

He has also got a job in L&T Company with Rs6.5 lakh per annum package through campus placement.

52,['14/03/2020'],Panic cancellations burn holes in tourists pockets,"Rajkot: Rajkot-based businessman Shreyash Borad had booked a 17-day trip with his wife to France, Switzerland and Italy in April. After the Coronavirus scare and clampdown in Italy, he rushed to cancel his tickets and was successful in getting refund from the airlines only. Borad had to pay penalty for hotel and cancellations of the other reservations he had made.

However, many other travellers who had planned summer tours abroad aren’t as lucky as Borad. A few airlines and hotels are issuing customers credit notes against their cancellations which can be used in the future.

Chief executive of Transglob travels, Sanjay Mehta said, “The airlines are issuing refunds for cancellations till March 31, but uncertainty looms large for April and May. There are few airlines who are collecting cancellation charges in accordance to their booking policy and some in UAE, Middle East and Europe-bound airlines are issuing credit notes for April onwards cancellations.”

According to travel agents, tourists for USA have to apply for visa four months before intended visit and for the UK, six months before travel. People generally plan abroad tours during summer vacation in April-May and book their packages accordingly during November and December to benefit from cheaper air fares and hotel accommodations.

However, most of such hotels are now reluctant to issue refunds and are either charging cancellation fees or issuing credit notes. Europe train companies are also issuing credit notes and asking passengers to choose alternate dates. “In the prevalent panicky situation, people are not in a position to choose alternate dates and end up paying penalties,” Mehta added.

Secretary of Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI), Manish Sharma said, “We are asking travel agents and passengers not to panic and cancel bookings. We are asking them to wait and watch till April and May.”

Sharma further said that because of the situation, agents’ money is also getting stuck as they block the seats in airlines and hotel rooms for a year.

According to travel agents, the panic has made people even cancel tours to nearby South East Asian countries like Indonesia and Malaysia.

On the contrary, these international cancellations have spurred domestic bookings.

Pratik Soni, a travel agent said, “We are getting more inquiries for Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Darjeeling and we are focusing on domestic tours this year. Tourists are avoiding South Indian destinations especially Kerala, one of the most favourite destinations in normal days.”

The driver ensured he parked the bus safely at the roadside on the busy Bahadura road before collapsing on the footpath and dying.

Dumbhare, engaged with a Mouda-based school, had nearly reached home when he is learnt to have started feeling discomfort in the stomach. The pain later shifted to the chest as he began having a choking feeling.

Dumbhare was barely half a kilometre from his home and he struggled to complete the last stretch. Sensing something seriously wrong and unable to cope with his condition, Dumbhare got out of the driver’s cabin after parking the bus along the side of the road. He collapsed on the footpath when a neighbour, Mahendra Kohale, saw him writhing and tried to help. But it was to no avail.

Dumbhare was the sole earning member of the family. His wife Archana is a housewife. They have two school-going children. Friends and neighbours stated the family lost its breadwinner and has none to look after the children and their education now. Dumbhare, who would leave home at 5.30 am, worked hard. He would drive around 27 km from the school to reach his place at 6 pm.

Kohale, speaking to TOI, said it appeared as if Dumbhare was suffering from an epileptic fit. “We assumed he was suffering from some kind of convulsions or fit. Initially we treid to revive him through traditional means like trying to make him smell onions and so on,” he said. “We rushed him to a local hospital but were referred to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) where he was declared dead,” he said.

Sakkardara police were informed by the GMCH booth after Dumbhare was declared dead. Sakkardara police have registered the case as an accidental death.

55,['14/03/2020'],No gauge conversion of Talala-Visavadar line,"Rajkot: The railway ministry is not planning to broad guage conversion of the Talala-Visavadar meter gauge line. The broad gauge was a part of Veraval-Talala-Visavadar conversion project, but the ministry has dropped this plan in order to protect the Asiatic lions in Gir.

This was informed by minister of railways and commerce and industry, Piyush Goyal, in Rajya Sabha on Friday. Goyal said this in response to a question from Rajya Sabha MP Parimal Nathwani who sought to know whether the gauge conversion of 72 km track between Talala and Visavadar passing through Gir wildlife areas will pose danger to the Asiatic Lions. Nathwani also wanted to know whether the government is mulling retaining the meter gauge railway line as a heritage railway line in view of its rich wildlife.

“Presently, it has been decided to retain this section as meter gauge due to forest issues as the alignment is passing through Gir reserve forest,” Goyal stated in his reply.

Railway has also reduced the speed of the train from 50km per hour to 30kmph between Talala and Veraval stations in Gir forest area so that driver can apply breaks to on seeing wild animals crossing the track. Goyal also said that the ministry is closely working with the the forest department regarding information of lion’s movement near the track.

56,['14/03/2020'],‘Protection of women need of hour’,"Panaji: Expressing sadness and shock over the recent abduction and rape of a school girl, Congress on Friday questioned the safety measures put in place to protect minors and women from sexual assault.

The state Mahila Congress committee president Pratima Coutinho said that it was shocking that a minor girl has been kidnapped and raped in the deputy chief minister’s constituency of Quepem.

“Students in schools are not safe. The message is going out that daughters and minor girls in schools and colleges are not safe. Rapes are increasing across the country. Law and order is not proper,” she said.

Congress said that despite several crimes against women, the government is deaf. “Where are the fast track courts? I ask CM Pramod Sawant to take steps to protect women and law and order,” she said.

She also said that parents need to bring up children with proper values and discipline. Congress also warned the government that if the accused in the rape case escapes, all officers involved should be arrested.

A few weeks ago, one kg of live chicken was being sold in the range of Rs80 to Rs90.“I have faced loss up to Rs10 crore in the past few weeks, as there is no demand for chicken in the market,” said Pramod Hinge, owner of Urja Poultry farm, which has registration of over 600 poultry farmers from Ambegaon, Khed, Manchar and Shirur.Hinge said, “Since there is no demand in the market, we load our chickens in vehicles and sell them in villages in Ambegaon tehsil at a very cheap rate,” he said.The animal husbandry department and the Indian Medical Association (IMA) have categorically said Covid-19 does not have any connection with chicken. “Since people had experienced bird flu virus in the past, they think that Covid-19 also spreads from chicken. Our staffers and farmers are reaching out to the people to improve the situation,” said Hinge, who is a member of the Poultry Breeders Welfare Association in Maharashtra, an independent body.Vasant Kumar Shetty, president of the association, said poultry farmers in Maharashtra have faced about Rs700 crore loss in the past few weeks. “Since chicken is a food item, we cannot stock it for long.

SURAT: An alert has been sounded in the Bharuch town after a leopard was spotted near the Torrent Power guest house at Kukarvada on the embankment of Narmada river on Friday morning.

Forest officials said that the security personnel at the power company’s guest house, which is just 2km from Bharuch town, had spotted the leopard in the bushes on the river embankment.

This is first time that the leopard has strayed into the city limits of Bharuch. The official bungalows of the district superintendent of police (SP) and the collector are located few metres away from the spot where the leopard was spotted, said a forest official.

Talking with TOI, wildlife warden of Bharuch forest department, Ashish Sharma said, “This is first time that a leopard has ventured into the city limits. We have alerted the residents living close to the river embankment to take extra precaution and avoid getting out of their house after dusk.”

According to Sharma, the spot where the leopard was seen has dense bushes and is near the river embankment, which makes it difficult to locate the leopard.

Raj Patel, district forest officer (DFO) told TOI, “We have alerted the local residents about the presence of leopard. Cages have been placed to capture the big cat. We have also arranged night surveillance by the forest staff to keep a tab on the leopard.”

BHUBANESWAR: The state government will set up a witness protection cell at the state crime branch ( CB ) office in Cuttack to ensure the successful implementation of the witness protection scheme-2019. It will be headed by the Crime Branch SP.

“I have declared the Crime Branch office as the witness protection cell of the state. It will remain dedicated to implement the scheme in letter and spirit. The Crime Branch SP will act as the nodal officer and coordinate with the district police,” director general of police (DGP) Abhay said on Friday. The DGP released an order in this regard on Wednesday.

“We will monitor court trial of sensitive cases, mostly crimes against women and ensure protection of the prosecution witnesses,” a Crime Branch officer said.

The state government had in July last year introduced the witness protection scheme, which envisages free and fair trial of cases in courts and extends protection to the prosecution witnesses from getting intimidated by accused or influential persons.

Crime Branch sources said fresh advisories might be issued for the superintendents of police (SPs), inspectors general of police (IGs) and deputy inspectors general (DIGs) of police ranges in the state about their roles and responsibilities for the complete implementation of the scheme.

The protection measures also ensure that a witness and the accused or his accomplices do not come face to face during investigation or trial. “We will urge police to install security devices in the home or office of a witness, whose identity should be concealed at all cost. There should be regular patrolling around a witness’s house or office. This apart, a witness should also be escorted to court from home and vice-versa amid tight security,” the officer added.

Notably, the witness protection scheme-2019 looks after three categories of shield for witnesses.

While category A consists of those cases where a witness or any of the family member faces threat for a long time to life during police investigation or court trial, category B deals with cases with lesser degree of risk to life and reputation of a witness. Category C cases bear moderate risk to life of a witness.

KOLKATA: A man in his 40s — a former cop according to family members — was arrested for allegedly smashing his aunt’s head with a hammer at their Behala home on Thursday night. Namita Dutta, 65, was taken to a private hospital where she died in the early hours of Friday.

Police said Dutta was washing utensils on the ground floor of their house when her nephew Subhasis, 40, allegedly hit her from behind. Alerted by her cries, Dutta’s husb-and came running down the stairs and saw Subhasis continuing the assault even as Dutta bled. In his complaint, Dutta’s husband Phanindra Nath, 74, claimed he started calling for help.

Subhasis then went into his room and began drinking. Other relatives in the house called cops and took the woman to Vidyasagar state general hospital and then to a private hospital in Mominpore, where she succumbed to her injuries. Subhasis was initially arrested on charges of attempt to murder, which was turned into a case of murder. He was produced in an Alipore court on Friday and was remanded in police custody.

While family members claimed Subhasis was drunkard and had a nervous disorder along with signs of mental illness, cops claimed the attack was a fallout of a property dispute.

“It looks like Subhasis, whose parents were dead, was denied his share of the property by other members of the family and after a heated altercation, he attacked the woman. We are probing into the case to know more details,” said an officer.

Subhasis’s family members claimed he had joined the wireless division of Kolkata Police 16 years ago but stopped attending office for the past several years following his mental illness and nervous disorder. Cops, however, said they have not found any record of him being associated with the department till Friday evening. Cops said they have found a training completion certificate with a Kolkata Police logo at his home, but are yet to verify its authenticity.

Police said the accused, Azruddin Saiyed (30), Sikandar Memon (27) and Shehzad Memon (25), allegedly demanded the money from Chandrakant Tanna (54), saying they had been given a contract to kill him. And if Tanna wanted to save himself, he would have to pay the accused Rs 1 lakh.

According to the police, Tanna is into wholesale business of sugar and edible oil. On the fateful day, Saiyed came to Tanna’s shop in the afternoon and asked him to accompany him, telling him that he had some work with him.

Saiyed drove Tanna on his motorcycle to the compound of Sangramsinhji High School, where Sikandar and Shehzad were waiting for them.

Sikandar told Tanna about his ‘supari’ (contract to kill) and demanded the money to spare him. Then the accused dropped Tanna back at his shop. They then called Tanna twice in the evening, demanding the money.

PATNA: The Patna high court has overruled its previous judgment and ordered that in a case of elopement, a girl between 16 and 17 years will be sent to remand home and will not be allowed to live with the person of her choice.

Sending of a minor girl to protection home, remand home or ‘nari niketan’ by a judicial order in elopement case can’t be treated as illegal confinement giving rise to a remedy under habeas corpus writ, the court ordered on March 5. A full bench comprising Justices Ashwani Kumar Singh, Ashutosh Kumar and Birendra Kumar overruled the judgment by a division bench on September 23, 2010 in which the subordinate courts across Bihar had been directed to treat a girl as major if she is assessed to be aged between 16 to 17 years in medical examination and be allowed to go with the person of her choice in elopement cases.

While overruling the earlier judgement, the full bench also disposed of criminal writ petition of a minor girl urging that she be allowed to be set free from the aftercare home at Gai Ghat in Patna where she had been kept by the order of ACJM court, Motihari.

Her father had lodged an FIR with Govindganj police station in East Champaran on January 7 last year against one Dhanjeet Yadav and his family members alleging that they had kidnapped the girl. However, the girl after being recovered, recorded her statement before a judicial magistrate that she was loved Dhanjeet and married him after leaving her residence on her own.

The minor had also expressed her wish to go with Dhanjeet and said her family was hostile towards her and she had life threat from another person. She was later medically examined in which her age was ascertained to be between 16-17 years.

On January 25 last year, her father produced original documents in the court showing her date of birth as January 2, 2002. He sought his daughter’s custody pleading that she was a minor. The matter was adjourned at least five times till March 2 last year when the minor was produced before the ACJM court where she stated that she didn’t want to go to her parental house. The court ordered her to be kept at Gai Ghat until she becomes a major. Then the girl moved the high court and the division bench of then Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Ashutosh Kumar referred it to larger bench on September 23, 2019.

The 2010 judgment was in a case in which the girl was around 16 years of age and 34 weeks pregnant. She had told the court of a judicial magistrate that she had not been kidnapped but married one Mohammad Arif on her own will. However, she was also sent to Gai Ghat home by the CJM court in Katihar. She had challenged it before the high court, which ordered her release with an advisory to judicial magistrates in state that women in such cases be allowed to go with people of their choice.

72,['14/03/2020'],Cognizant’s bonus for staff among lowest in its history,"Chennai: In a year when Cognizant’s corner office was occupied by a new CEO, the company announced that it will reward its employees with a bonus payment in the range of 35% to 95% of the promised sum, its lowest ever. For nearly 80% of its India-based employees the bonus is between 65% to 95%.

Cognizant follows a Jan-Dec fiscal year and Brian Humphries took over at the company’s CEO last April. Since then he has announced a massive restructuring of people and business with a stated objective to get growth back to the company and regain its bellwether status.

“This is the lowest ever I have received as bonus,” a senior Cognizant employee told TOI. “The average is just around 60%. The lower level employees get much less. Nobody received 100% bonus, this has never happened in the company.”

“Cognizant believes in a performance-based culture and has consistently shared the rewards of its growth with employees. In years of industry-leading growth, we paid significantly above the target. 2019 was a challenging year for us and our bonus payout is a reflection of that performance. We are a more focused, determined, and confident company now and all distractions of 2019 are behind us. We think we are doing the right things to return to historic levels of growth and once again make Cognizant the industry bellwether,” a Cognizant spokesperson told TOI.

During the year, the company had guided for revenue growth of 5.1%, but managed to achieve 5.2% in constant currency terms, at $16.8 billion. “

Speaking to analysts in a post earnings call, Humphries said the company would look to enter 2020 with a two-pronged strategy to expose Cognizant to faster-growing market categories.

“The first element is to protect and optimise our core business while scaling internationally. The second part is to invest to compete and win in four key digital battlegrounds: data, digital engineering, cloud and IoT,” he told analysts.

In an earlier interview to TOI, Humpries had said, “When I do see our associates, we do one-on-ones, but we also do town halls. After every one of those town halls, we get surveys, NPS (net promoter scores). And so, throughout the world, over the last 11 months, I have been tracking the NPS over town halls.

Simultaneously, of course, we look at our attrition rates as a company. Now in Q4 (December quarter), our attrition rate fell 3 percentage points from Q3. Q3 was 24, Q4 was 21. But more importantly, we are trying to drive a performance culture in Cognizant.”

“We have seen the RBI advisory. In view of the decision taken by the Cabinet a week ago, the finance department has issued an order on Wednesday. The department has directed all departments, corporations and civic bodies to not deposit their funds in the private financial institutions,’’ a top bureaucrat told TOI.

The official added that though the RBI has issued an advisory to the state chief secretary, it is advisory in nature and not mandatory. “As the Cabinet has taken the decision, it was decided not to take note of the RBI advisory,” he said.

In the wake of large-scale irregularities in Yes Bank , the state Cabinet directed all departments, corporations and civic organisations last week to not park funds in private banks and, instead, deposit them in nationalised banks.

“We found that many state departments and organisations had deposited huge amounts in private banks, including Yes Bank. Since there is no guarantee that the funds will remain safe with private lenders, the Cabinet took a decision to park them in nationalised banks,” the official said. “The RBI had pointed out that any apprehension on the safety of funds is misplaced and such a reactive decision will be against the stability of the private banks,” the official added.

PATNA: The Bhojpur district administration in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology- Patna (IIT-P) and Unicef as its knowledge partner, has launched a pilot project on domestic waste management in three panchayats having a population of around 20,000 households.

While liquid wastes will be cleaned by some aquatic plants to be developed on constructed wetlands, solid wastes will be shredded, bundled and sold to the agencies working under the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Patna. Money generated through the sale of wastes will be used for development work in the panchayats concerned.

“It is a pilot project designed to suit the rural areas and being based on technologies provided by IIT-P and the Unicef. It will serve multiple purposes of keeping the villages clean and generate re-chargeable resources of ground water,” Bhojpur DM Roshan Kushwaha said.

A two-day workshop on this project begun at the IIT-P on Friday, which was inaugurated by the principal secretary, rural development department Arvind Kumar Chaudhary, Bhojpur DM and several other officials of the district.

The Bhojpur DM said that initially the project has been launched in three panchayats—Dawan, Bampali and Nargada and the IIT-P team has already inspected the sites. “For liquid wastes treatment, all the small drains of a panchayat will be connected to a single large drain, which will empty its discharge on a specially constructed wetland,” said Kushwaha.

He added, “The water after microbial cleaning will be used for irrigation, fishery and other works. The project will come to ground in a month, after which other villages will be selected for the second phase of work.”

Unicef consultant on water, sanitation and hygiene Nikhil Kumar Singh said about 10 pollutant absorbing plants, including Canna Indica, Phragmites Australis, Glyceria Maxima and Baumea Articulata species for microbial cleaning have been selected for the purpose. “”The sewage water after treatment by these simple techniques will finally have the access to the existing water bodies like ponds and ditches for use in irrigation, fishery and other purposes,” he said.

PATNA: While Loktantrik Janta Dal (LJD) chief Sharad Yadav on Friday refused to comment on RJD’s nomination for the Rajya Sabha, his party state vice-president Binu Yadav criticized RJD chief Lalu Prasad for betraying Sharad and even asked people not to vote for the party.

“He (Lalu) had betrayed an old socialist leader. It was Sharad Yadav who had parted ways with JD (U) for the sake of mandate of 11 crore people of Bihar and joined hands with Lalu Prasad. Now when time has come to send him to Rajya Sabha, Lalu sold the ticket to a rich businessman,” said Binu.

Playing the caste card, Binu said that the entire Yadav community had been cheated. “It is now clear that neither the Yadavs nor Muslims are with the RJD. Lalu actually believes in use and throw policy and people need to be cautious. Now, the people of Bihar will decide whether to caste vote in favour of such leaders or not?” Binu said. He further said his party will be contesting on all the 243 seats in the upcoming state assembly election.

Talking to an electronic media channel earlier, Sharad said he will be soon coming to Bihar and hold talks with his alliance partners and discuss the ‘sehat’ (health) of Mahagatbandhan.

Sharad had already said that he was not interested in state politics and will be doing politics from the Centre.

The “sharp dip” in footfall after the global outbreak of coronavirus and paucity of big Hindi movie releases have forced many Bengal theatres to consider staying shut for a while. The final call is expected to be taken by Sunday.Ratan Saha, the chairman of the exhibitors’ section of the Eastern India Motion Pictures’ Association, has noticed a “50% dip” in sales. “As it is, single-screen theatres don’t do good business. And now, most people are not even going to the theatres. So, what’s the point in keeping the outlets open if there are no patrons? It is better to shut down and use this time for renovation,” Saha said.Navin Choukhani, owner of Navina, noticed a sharp drop in footfall since Thursday. “For the first-day show of ‘Angrezi Medium’, we had less than 50 viewers whereas the capacity is 800. As the news of the global outbreak spread, people stopped coming for movies. I feel that, irrespective of a notification, it is better to shut down,” Choukhani added. In his opinion, it makes sense to be safe than sorry. “We are monitoring the situation very closely and on Sunday we shall take a final call on whether to run the shows or suspend them till the situation improves,” he said.Suranjan Paul, owner of Minar, Bijoli and Chhabighar, said, “People are cautious about their health. At present, I have noticed a drop in sales.”The nCoV fear has also hit the release of movies. The release of the Akshay Kumar-starrer ‘Sooryavanshi’ has been postponed. In a statement, Rohit Shetty Picturez said the film, which was supposed to release on March 24, will be back when “the time is right”. The release of ‘Sir’ — a March 20 release starring Tillotama Shome — has also been postponed keeping “public health concerns and the advisory from the health ministry” in mind.Arijit Dutta, the owner of Priya Cinemas, said, “One can’t run a theatre while incurring heavy losses. There is a 30% dip in sales. Additionally, getting good content will be an issue since most of the movies have been postponed. Many single screens run on laser-thin margins. But if they shut down once, I wonder if they will be able to reopen.”Saha is equally worried about getting content. “We can’t run our theatres only on the basis of footfalls generated by screening Bengali movies.

Citing a starred question in the state legislative council, Selu tehsildar Mahendra Sonone had written a letter to forest as well as social forestry departments. On Khedkar’s complaint, Selu police had also written to the forest department on February 20. Despite this, the forest department failed to take an action.

TOI on March 4 had reported that Wardha district administration omitted three pieces of lands, including forest land with khasra no. 206 of mouza Kotumba, for fine levied on Afcons. The administration assured to carry out survey on two lands owned by it — khasra no. 7 of mouza Itala reserved as zudpi jungle and khasra no. 65 of mouza Giroli which is a hillock. Also, the administration reportedly sent a letter to the forest department for inspection on the latter’s land with khasra no. 206.

The forest department then started survey of khasra no. 206 from March 6. Wardha deputy conservator of forest Sunil Sharma on March 12 had told TOI about murrum excavated from this piece of forest land.

The team of forest department continued the survey to know exact excavation in this land which is 4.68 hectares in total.

Khedkar had obtained documents from land records department on March 9 and came to know that khasra nos. 293/1 of 0.6 hectares and 293/2 of 50.71 hectares are also forest lands. The state government had handed over these two lands to forest on May 30, 1997. He had to say excavation also done on these two lands.

Afcons has been repeatedly denying its involvement in any sort of illegal excavation whatsoever. The company also alleged it is being unnecessarily targeted and harassed with a malafide intent to impede smooth execution of Samruddhi Mahamarg, which is a project of public interest.

It is the second case so far. On August 22 last year, Selu police had filed an offence against Anil Kumar, project officer of Afcons, and Ashish Daptary, owner of MP Constructions, for excavation of murrum without permission from Cozy Properties land.

Bhopal: Amid political upheaval in Madhya Pradesh, Vidhan Sabha Speaker N P Prajapati rejected rumours of possible postponement of the budget session in the wake of fears around coronavirus.

Prajapati termed a message being circulated in his name as “fake”. In the evening, cybercrime branch, acting on complaint filed by J K Sharma, who is posted as director (security) at Vidhan Sabha, registered a case against unidentified persons on charges of cheating by personation under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and IT Act.

DIG Irshad Wali said further investigations are on.

“I did not post any message on twitter or any other social media platform about the postponement of budget session of the state assembly. It’s fake,” said Prajapati on Friday.

Earlier, a fake tweet being circulated on social media networks purportedly posted on behalf of Speaker Prajapati, had claimed that the budget session of the House has been postponed till April in the wake of fears of coronavirus. Several leaders from both Congress and BJP had expressed surprise over the rumours of the session being postponed.

Reddy pointed out that the University Grants Commission, in a notification dated June 30, 2016, listed the Lucknow-based Bhartiya Shiksha Parishad, where Fernandes claims to have studied, as a fake university, “with a statement that the matter is subjudice before the district judge-Lucknow”.

Raymond was one of the 16 candidates selected in January by the North Goa collectorate for the post of Awal Karkun. Advocate Aires Rodrigues had filed a complaint with chief secretary Parimal Rai on February 25 seeking a probe into his selection, especially the authenticity of the degree and computer course certificates submitted by him.

The North Goa Collector had then asked GU to verify the same. Reddy has responded with a copy of the judgement of the Madras High Court and of the Calcutta High Court where Bhartiya Shiksha Parishad is stated to be a fake university. Reddy also informed Redkar that GU has not granted any equivalence to the computer courses completed by Raymond.

Meanwhile, demanding an investigation into Raymond’s selection, Goa Forward Party (GFP) has also demanded Isidore’s resignation on moral grounds. “There are many deserving candidates from Canacona, but Isidore got a bogus certificate for his son to ensure that he gets the job,” GFP vice-president Dilip Prabhudesai said.

86,['14/03/2020'],Tax dept expects collections to drop due to virus impact,"Panaji: A spiralling economy triggered due to the Covid-19 scare, especially the slump in Goa’s tourism sector, will lead to lower income tax and corporate tax collections in Goa, chief I-T commissioner B V Gopinath said here on Friday.

Gopinath, who held an awareness programme on the Centre’s ‘Vivaad se Vishwas’ scheme, said the closure of mining operations had already led to a dip in I-T collections and if the tourism sector also suffered because of coronavirus, income in the hands of taxpayers would come down.

“It looks like there is an issue of foreign tourist arrivals because of coronavirus. I suppose it will have an impact on income and subsequently, tax collection,” Gopinath said.

The I-T officer said that year-on-year tax collection from Goa has shown marginal growth. “The mining closure has affected tax collections. They have dipped in comparison to the period when mining was on in the state,” Gopinath said.

Among the private sector, pharma companies are the highest taxpayers in Goa, followed by the hospitality industry.

The ‘Vivad Se Vishwas’ scheme for direct taxpayers was launched by the I-T department to end litigation and allows taxpayers to pay only their dues and get a waiver on interest. However, a number of grey areas remain.

Five Goa government agencies feature among the several tax disputes pending in the state. Gopinath said the I-T department has raised a demand for nearly Rs 2 crore in total from the five public sector undertakings.

“We met the chief secretary to tell him that the state government PSUs can avail of the scheme, too,” Gopinath said.

89,['14/03/2020'],KL 13L 8527 — tale of an outcast dalit woman,"Eramangalath Chitralekha

KANNUR: In 1893, dalit social reformer Ayyankali rode the villuvandi (bullock cart), which the dalits were not allowed to in the feudal Kerala, and created history in the social reformation. It’s been 127 years and Eramangalath Chitralekha , a dalit woman struggling hard to make both ends meet by plying an autorickshaw, is still an ‘outcast’ in her own native village, and had to leave that place to become a driver.

Incidentally, she was ‘outcast’ from the house of her friend and dalit leader Jignesh Mevani , she says in her biography set for release next month.

The book, ‘KL 13L 8527: Chithralekhayude Charithram’, written by her friend and activist Rupesh Kumar , is all about such struggles, fights and the discrimination she faced in a place that is said to be progressive.

“When you talk about the angst that the Muslim community is facing in India, against the backdrop of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, what I have to tell is that in a sense I am also fighting for my citizenship, and I am a displaced human being, which prompted me to tell my tale,” she said.

From her native Edat near Payyannur, she had to migrate to Thaliparamba, a few kilometers away, and again she returned to her native hoping that she could survive there. However, male autorickshaw drivers in the area did not allow her to ply the three-wheeler. It was attacked on many occasions. KL 13L 8527 was her first vehicle, which was set afire. Now, she plies an auto rickshaw in Kannur town.

Even though the previous UDF government sanctioned her a piece of land at Kattampally, where she had started constructing a house, the LDF government decided to take it back and the case is now in court.

When she decided to live in her ancestral house again, the electricity connection was cut as the bill was not paid for a month. When she went to pay the bill, she was asked to apply for a new connection, she said. Even though the house was damaged in the rain last time, the government was not ready to provide any help, as she is an eyesore for the local CPM activists, who are highly patriarchal, she said.

Ironically, she faced discrimination in the house of dalit leader Jignesh Mevani when she visited Gujarat to participate in a protest organised by Rashtriya Dalit Adhikar Manch (RDMM). When she visited Mevani’s house, she was not even allowed to use the toilet inside his house, she says in the book.

The biography is not just about her struggles, but also about how the mainstream political parties and even the feminist organizations ignored her fights, said Rupesh.

India, by suspending most visas till April 15 to retard the spread of the virus, has taken the right step. But what is lacking here in Goa is seriousness from the state government in tackling the pandemic. State politicians, as is their wont, are incessantly suggesting to stay calm. While that may be a good idea, what is far more urgent and imperative is a radical change in behaviour. After much dithering, the state government has invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, a half-hearted measure for a full-blown, exponentially spreading virus. Even the Unicef guidelines to the schools and educational institutions that have been issued only on Friday, have been diluted and there is no restriction on public gatherings, events or religious congregations, exposing thousands of people, especially children and senior citizens to a deadly communicable disease. Social distancing is the only way to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. But the state government and its CM Pramod Sawant have ignored the most crucial fact and carried on with a false bravado of senseless hope that all is well in the sunshine state. India has already seen two deaths—a 76-year-old man in Karnataka and a 68-year-old woman in Delhi—and Goa’s vulnerability can be judged by the fact that it has the second largest proportion of people aged 60 years and above, constituting 11.2% of the state’s 14.5 lakh population. We don’t need an outbreak to act. Sawant, by his sluggish attitude, has shown a clear lack of leadership and foresight. Instead of downplaying the risks of coronavirus and hiding behind bureaucratic sloth, the state government must immediately ask people to stay away from public places, cancel big gatherings, bring religious congregations to a grinding halt and plan and prepare for any eventuality. Whether it is moving classes online, cancelling rallies and public meetings or even playing games in front of empty stadiums, the state should ensure every form of social distancing. As the elected head of the state, Sawant should take responsibility and set an example and not use potential panic and over-reaction as an excuse to put the public at risk.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/better-to-err-on-the-side-of-caution/articleshow/74620063.cms

According to the complaint, the survivor’s husband went out for shopping on Holi, when the accused Sadiq Ahmad forcefully entered her house and raped her.

When her husband returned, she narrated the entire ordeal and the couple went to mill authorities to complain against the driver and were assured action against Ahmad. However, when they went for a follow up the next day, they were held hostage inside the mill for two hours, the compalint said. The woman claimed that they were released after the intervention of corporator of ward number 13, Ranjeet.

Asked if action was initiated against the mill management for holding the accused and her husband captive to hush up the case, he said, “All allegations against the sugar mill management is a subject of investigation.”

However, mill GM Karan Singh denied the charges, saying, “The driver and the labourer had a clash over some issue which was later resolved. The allegation of rape is false and it is a conspiracy to defame the sugar mill.”

CUTTACK: The Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC)’s integrated solid waste management project-2016 is back to square one after four years.

The CMC’s plans to execute the project through a five-year contract with a private firm have to be reworked now.

The state government has ordered the cancellation of CMC’s tender process for the collection and disposal of solid waste from the city and asked the civic body to invite fresh bids with shortened scope of work to bring down expenditure.

CMC’s deputy commissioner (health and sanitation) Sanjibeeta Ray said “estimates have to be drawn all over again before inviting fresh tenders as we have been asked to cut down the scope of the work”.

“The civic body has been asked to involve self-help groups (SHGs) of women in sanitation operations and limit the scope of work to cleaning of roads and drains and cutting bushes while giving contracts to private firms through tender process,” Ray said.

The integrated solid waste management project 2016 was slated to be a blueprint for better disposal of garbage in the city. The execution of the project had become extremely vital as adhoc arrangements for nearly four years had resulted in unprecedented chaos in garbage collection and disposal in the city.

The delay in execution of the project is being seen as a typical case of failure of the civic administration. “It’s unfortunate that the civic administration has been unable to finalize a tender in a process proper enough to pass through scrutiny – be it legal or administrative even after more than three and half years,” Chittaranjan Mohanty , a city-based lawyer and social activist, said.

No headway has been made since 2016 despite three attempts to select a private firm by inviting bids for the execution of the much-awaited project that envisaged a crucial set of reforms by including GPRS tracking system, biometric attendance system, mechanized sweeping and a new set of regulations for better segregation and disposal of waste.

The CMC had first invited bids for the execution of the project in 2016. But the high court finally quashed the tender process in September 2017 after issuing a stay order.

Though there was a fresh dispute over the finalisation of tender in favour of a private party, the court gave a clean chit to it 2018.

With restrictions on travel and shutdown of movie halls, parks, summer camps, etc, there’s little else to keep them engaged. Many working parents are struggling to find babysitters and some are even taking leave as leaving kids alone at home is not an option.But psychiatrists and child specialists say that parents should view this situation as an opportunity to make children socially responsible and train them in homemaking and leading a healthy lifestyle. They suggest that parents should also use the opportunity to spend more time with children to help them develop social skills. Also, the vacation could be used to help kids develop good hobbies and nurture creativity.“It is true that Covid-19 has derailed the plans of many families but I think parents can turn this into an opportunity and mould their kids into responsible homemakers. Children, irrespective of gender, could be trained in helping parents with household activities like cleaning, cooking, gardening etc. Also, as it will be an extended vacation, children might lose touch with academics, especially when there were no final exams. So, it is ideal to make them revise what they have learned over the last one year till the official vacation begins,” said Dr Philip John , senior psychiatrist.Doctors said that children should be made aware of the health situation and trained to develop personal hygiene. “While younger kids need assistance in hygiene, elder kids need supervision. Parents should find time to make them aware of what Covid-19 is without scaring them and highlight the importance of hygiene. Coronavirus should not govern their personal hygiene, which should be made part of their daily routine,” said C J John, senior psychiatrist.Experts caution against children being allowed to spend more time in front of screens and advise parents to screen the content they watch. “Most kids would prefer playing computers games, on smartphones and watching TV. Parents should not allow them more than two hours a day. Watching movies on online streaming platforms is quite common today but parents can choose the content for kids and restrict their viewing time. Otherwise, there is good chance of addiction. Also, don’t allow them to sleep during daytime as it will make them night owls,” said Philip John.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74621264,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1060435,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/make-it-blessing-in-disguise-experts/articleshow/74619383.cms

The MoA was signed between Gajapati collector Anupam Saha and Surendra Pradhan , general manager (finance), REC regional office, Bhubaneswar, in presence of senior officers of the district and the company.

According to the MoA, the public sector undertaking (PSU) will construct 53 additional classrooms in 32 government-run schools through REC Foundation, the corporate social responsibility (CSR) arm of the PSU. The Navaratna enterprise will spend Rs 3.32 crore under the CSR initiative for the purpose, a company source said. The construction of the new classrooms would be completed before reopening of schools after summer vacation, an official said. The additional classrooms would be constructed in government schools of Gosani (3) Rayagada (3), Mohana (10), Nuagada (5) Gumma (5) and R Udayagiri (6) blocks under the Aspirational District Scheme (ADS), the official added. Gajapati has been identified as one of the aspirational districts in the state by the Niti Aayog.

The finance assistance of the REC Limited to the district would boost primary school infrastructure in the district, said the collector. Besides, this would also facilitate quality education to the students, he said. Similarly, the REC will provide Rs 1.57 crore for supply of RO water systems to 94 government-run schools across the district. The amount was sanctioned under the CSR of the PSU last year. Utilising the funds, the district administration would also continue the Super 30 programme initiative to impart coaching to 30 brilliant students in the district to excel in the annual high school certificate (HSC) examination.

105,['14/03/2020'],ESZ monitoring panel clears HC parking project,"Chandigarh: While the Punjab and Haryana high court has ordered demolition of all unauthorised structures in the Sukhna Lake catchment area, the monitoring committee for eco-sensitive zone for Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary has cleared a contentious project.

Sources said in a recent meeting attended by officers of the UT engineering department, urban planning department and UT’s forest and wildlife department, the project of three-level basement parking for the Punjab and Haryana high court was given clearance.

A senior UT officer, who attended the meeting, said the officials of the department concerned had submitted before the committee that the parking site does not fall under the catchment area as per Survey of India’s 2004 map. So, the committee cleared the project, the officer added.

The monitoring committee was recently re-constituted by the UT administration under the chairmanship of Debendra Dalai, UT chief conservator of forests who also holds the charge of chief wildlife warden.

Members of the monitoring committee included UT chief architect, UT chief engineer, MC chief engineer, UT director, rural development, and member secretary of the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee. Deputy conservator of forests is member secretary of the committee, which was formed for a period of three years.

The UT engineering department has already sent a proposal to the UT environment department, seeking permission for the construction of proposed multilevel basement parking in the vicinity of the HC.

The Chandigarh Heritage Conservation Committee (CHCC) had in November last year given approval to the expansion plan of the HC, which included construction of three-level basement parking opposite the existing one in Sector 1.

As per the proposal drafted by UT engineering department, the multi-level parking will have three floors of basement to accommodate around 5,000 vehicles. The tentative size of the basement parking is 434ft x 810ft, with approximate covered area of one floor as 3,72,400 sqft and for three floors is 11,17,220 sqft.

‘Heritage status at risk’

The proposed underground parking project falls within the eco-sensitive zone around the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary that was notified in 2017. Also, the site is in the buffer zone of UNESCO World Heritage Site of Capitol Complex and many experts have warned that new construction in the complex may put its heritage status in jeopardy. The administration had recently decided to conduct an environmental impact assessment study of the proposed parking project. The study will include various aspects, including ambient air quality, vehicular traffic density, flora and fauna, water quality, socio-economic survey, among other factors.

Chandrapur: A six-month-old tiger cub was killed in a hit-and-run case near village Bamni Katwal under Kothari forest range on Friday. The injured cub was discovered by farmer Ashok Madavi in his farm on Friday morning, however, it succumbed to injuries before medical help could arrive.

Sources said that RFO Kothari Sandeep Langde rushed to the spot on getting information and simultaneously informed a veterinary doctor. By the time forest team reached the spot, there was quite a large crowd of villagers gathered around the tiger cub. Many of the onlookers were clicking pictures and selfies with the cub.

Forest team immediately cleared the crowd around the tiger cub, but it died before medical help could arrive. Officials claimed that the cub is a six-month-old female and belongs to a tigress having three cubs in the area. The dead body of the tiger cub was shifted to Jhari forest nursery for post mortem.

Initially, forest officials suspected that the cub might have suffered injuries while passing through a fence or in an attack by some other animal after straying away from the tigress. However, initial findings of post mortem revealed that at least six ribs on right side of the cub’s chest were fractured and it died of massive internal bleeding.

The farm of Ashok Madavi is adjacent to Kothari–Tohgaon road. Authorities suspect that the mother tigress might have been crossing the road with cubs when some speeding vehicle collided with one of the cubs that strayed behind. The injured cub crawled around 25 meter up to Madavi’s farm and lay there till it was discovered in the morning.

Aurangabad: The Beed district police have launched a system enabling direct video conferencing of the victims with senior police officers, including superintendent of police, to address complaints of victims, especially women and children.

AURANGABAD:

Beed district, with an approximate population of three million, it takes close to five hours to travel from one end to another. The use of technology will give relief to the complainants hailing from distant places in the district.

Earlier, they had to reach out to the district police headquarters to get their complaints heard. Now, they will have to reach out to the nearest police station and inform the police station in-charge about their grievance. Depending on the gravity of the issue, the complainant would be put across to the senior cops.

The facility to interact with the top cops via video conferencing has been made available at all the police stations through open source softwares and applications available for the police department.

To begin with, the initiative is being used for tackling complainants made during the weekly complaint disposal day at the police stations in the Aurangabad range. Following the instructions of Aurangabad range IGP Ravinder Kumar Singal , all 87 police stations in the range hold a grievance disposal day every Saturday.

Beed superintendent of police Harssh Poddar told TOI, “Using this video conferencing technology, the senior officers can reach a much larger number of applicants. So, we are dovetailing this into weekly takrar nivaran.”

The officer informed that the hardware is already available at the police stations because of the digitization initiatives earlier, so nothing had to be purchased and the latest project is being implemented with zero cost.

However, Poddar clarified that the usual avenue of meeting senior officers will continue. “This is for applicants, who either don’t want or cannot afford to travel, across the district. At the moment 25 police stations, offices of the two additional superintendents of police and six SDPO offices are already connected with this service.”

Beed cyber police informed that considering the bandwidth as well as the quality of the available open source software, 25 video conferencing windows can be addressed at a single go, without facing any technical glitch.

However, the rush is quite a bit when it comes to paediatricians, who are being visited by more people for consultation on seasonal viral fever.”He said this was happening due to the prevailing fear of Covid-19 among residents.“We have planned surgeries but even those are being postponed because of coronavirus fear. People wish to self-quarantine and not involve in group activities.

A stage was being erected in an open field with a seating capacity of more than 15,000 and parking arrangements were made for more than 2,000 cars.But the event could be a recipe for a disaster amid the pandemic. “This virus spreads by contact. We don’t know how many people in TN are carriers of the infection. In these circumstances, such large gatherings will provide a fertile field for an epidemic. No responsible government would do that,” said George Thomas, former editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics.During the review meeting, officials discussed the need to invoke provisions of the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act, 1938, Epidemic Act, 1897, and the Disaster Management Act, 2005. For the first time in eight weeks, the state decided it would invoke provisions under Disaster Management Act so they can get funds for contingency measures. The chief minister, who is the chairman of the State Disaster Management Authority, also agreed to release funds.On the ground, senior officials from schooleducation, municipal administration and transport departments said they did not have funds to buy disinfectants, soap and sanitizers. Disinfecting surfaces, using soap solutions and hand sanitizers would push back the virus. “But where is the money” asked a senior official. “Till date, we have not been given any money to buy disinfectants,” he said. The state health department needs funds to augment quarantine facilities and beds.Later, the commisionerate of school education announced that pre-KG, LKG and UKG classes in all schools across the state will remain shut from March 16 to 31. In border districts of Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Theni, Coimbatore, Tirupur and the Nilgiris, Classes I to V will remain suspended.“Even that is too little. When two neighbours Kerala and Karnataka have reported cases, why should we restrict prevention measures to just borders?” said former city health officer P Kuganandam. “Children are vulnerable to infection. We should ask children up to Class VIII to stay at home.”",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74621017,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-568774,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cm-chairs-meet-but-what-was-on-the-table/articleshow/74619399.cms

KOCHI: Though final exams have been disrupted with holidays for students up to class VII being advanced, a few city schools are giving them a chance to write the exams at home. The institutions are sending question papers online to students and asking them to write the exam within the prescribed time and self-evaluate the answer sheets in order to keep them engaged till the official summer vacation begins.

A few schools are also providing bridging classes, which are the sessions provided to present Class IX and XI students to familiarise them with Class X and Class XII syllabus, through online platforms.

“Most parents and students are unhappy having to miss the final exams despite having prepared for them. Theatres are closed, the malls cannot be visited, all gatherings have been stopped, so we felt it imperative that we as educators help and partner with parents to keep the students engaged. We will share their term-end question papers with parents. Parents can encourage the child to attempt the assignments at home. The papers will be sent as per the scheduled exam timetable. This is not an exam but more of students’ self-assessment of their own strengths. This will not be counted toward the overall grades,” said Sreekumar Kartha , principal of Global Public School .

118,['14/03/2020'],"Python suffers fractures, treated in Tirunelveli hospital","The snake suffered fractures at two places on its backbone, probably when someone beat it

MADURAI: A nine-month-old reticulated python that suffered two fractures on its backbone was rescued by a police inspector and treated in an orthopaedic hospital in Tirunelveli on Thursday.

It is suspected that the 4.5-foot-long reptile could have been beaten by someone. The snake would not have survived had it not got timely help, wildlife enthusiasts said.

A farmer spotted the female snake in distress in an agricultural land at Kilakulam near Veeravanallur on Thursday morning. “The snake might have got injured somewhere close by It managed to crawl to the farmer’s land,” Veeravanallur inspector and wildlife enthusiast E Samson told TOI.

Though rescuing pythons is an easy task, it was not so in this case. The snake was in pain and agitated. It was rescued after a 10-minute effort.

It was taken to Tirunelveli, around 40km away. Orthopaedic surgeon and Tirunelveli district vice-president of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals A Francis Roy was alerted.The snake suffered fractures on two places on its backbone, probably when someone beat it.

“With the help of a local snake rescuer, we administered plaster of Paris to ensure that it is immobile for a few days as movement of the backbone will hinder the healing process. It was handed over to the forest department where it would be under observation for 15 days,” said Roy.

“The snake could not be immediately released in the wild as it could become easy prey to bigger snakes or carnivorous birds. Snakes don’t eat when they are injured.

They have long starvation capability that would last for many days. An x-ray will be taken after two weeks to check the recovery status before taking a decision on releasing it,” the doctor added.

Wildlife enthusiasts said that reticulated pythons have a lifespan of more than 20 years in the wild.

They can live up to 35 years under captivity and can touch 15 feet in length. They appealed to the government to rehabilitate injured reptiles by keeping them in zoos and replace the healthy adult snakes that are under captivity in the wild.

119,['14/03/2020'],"Two forest guards get Rs 1 lakh each for tiger care, cracking crime","Nagpur: Two young forest guards have brought cheers to the state forest department by bagging Rs 1 lakh reward each, instituted by National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), a statutory body under MoEFCC that monitors all tiger reserves.

Both, Akash Sarda (28), Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR), and Pramila Sidam (28), Pandharkawda, are among the six outstanding frontline staff from across the country to get the reward.

The other four winners are: Niranjan Giri and Sukumar Mondol (Sundarban), Sreenivasan K (Parambikulam) and M Kethan (Anamalai). They will be felicitated on March 21 on World Forestry Day.

The proposal to give rewards to those in the rank of foresters, forest guards and forest watchers was recommended by a technical committee headed by NTCA inspector general of forest (IGF) on July 19 last and nominations were sought from those who worked extraordinarily.

While Pramila (28) effectively monitored the movement of Avni aka T1 and her two cubs in Pandharkawda forest division, Akash (28) was instrumental in tracking various gangs of wildlife criminals through cyber cell. He documented 16 wildlife crime cases, including tigers, and the accused were convicted in most of them.

Both were delighted after receiving the news of having been selected for the reward. PCCF (wildlife) Nitin Kakodkar has lauded them for bringing laurels.

The story of Pramila is interesting. She was a regular beat guard of Anji, but was posted in the office as a computer operator due to gender bias by the RFO concerned. However, when deputy conservator (DyCF) KM Abharna took over in September 2017, she posted her to the field.

“One evening when I was going to install camera traps in my beat, T1 was very close and I didn’t know about it. As I was at work, the tigress came out and left without harming me. This was for the first time I saw her from a distance of 20 metres,” recalls Pramila.

“After this incident, my fear of T1 vanished and I monitored her and later her cubs by laying baits, pug impression pads (PIPs) and foot patrolling. People dubbed these tigers man-eaters but they were like my family. I also proved critics wrong who thought tiger monitoring was a male-dominated job. I was inspired by my boss Abharna,” said Pramila.

Akash Sarda’s work is also exceptional. Working in MTR for the last seven years, he cracked at least 16 cases. In three tiger poaching cases, the accused were convicted.

“Though it was a team work, I especially thank field director MS Reddy and DFO Vishal Mali who is in-charge of the cyber cell. Both are my mentors. We took crime cases to their logical end due to intelligence network, proper documentation, collection of evidence, tracking culprits with the help of call detail records (CDRs) and decoy operations,” said Akash.

Akash also received a gold medal on July 1 from the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for his outstanding work in wildlife crime detection. He is also a good sportsperson. He bagged a silver medal in archery in the national games held in Odisha last week.

“Recently, the MTR cyber cell cracked an inter-state gang of tiger poachers by tracking culprits from Telangana and Chandrapur,” said Akash.

122,['14/03/2020'],Many unhappy with move to transform Tamukkam ground,"Madurai: Tamukkam grounds, the most prominent landmark of Madurai city, is to be concreted and the sprawling 6 acre area is to be one of the conference venues under the Smart City programme but many Madurai’s residents are unhappy with this development.

History has it that the Tamukkam ground was set up in 1670 AD to help Queen Rani Mangammal witness the games of valour and other sports activities from her summer palace at the other end of the ground. It has been witness to many historical events in Madurai, including the fifth World Tamil Conference convened in 1981 during the period of late chief minister M G Ramachandran. Many events like the 100th day celebration of Tamil movies and political events have been held here.

At present, the annual Chittirai festival and book fair are important events held at this venue. Its easy accessibility and vast parking area are the reasons why it is convenient for many. ``Any small event held in Tamukkam gives us an opportunity to have an evening out. It is usually free entry and children enjoy running about the ground. It is sad that the ground is being developed,’’ said Rajakumari of Anna Nagar. The ground is undergoing development under the Smart City programme at a cost of Rs 40 crore with parking facilities for over 200 cars and an equal number of two-wheelers and an auditorium. The old auditorium which now stands at the centre of the land is to be razed to the ground. Once it is rebuilt, the venue is expected to bring the Madurai corporation a revenue of not less than Rs 6 crore.

``The road leading to Gandhi Museum is one of the best to drive down in the city though it is less than one kilometre, but it is a pleasant drive. If this space is developed it will become one of chaos and crowding,’’ said T Thiagarajan of K K Nagar. “It is a place with memories for every person born in Madurai, be it a school function or a festival held there. The fact that it is going to be no more is depressing,’’ said S Usha of Athikulam.

INTACH Madurai chapter convener Aravind Kumar Sankar said they would make a representation soon against the move to transform Tamukkam as it had been the landmark of Madurai for nearly four centuries. City-based advocate Muthukumar has proposed to go to court against the corporation’s move. He is opposed to traditional and historical places in the city being destroyed in the name of development.

LUCKNOW: After the district administration installed hoardings of people accused of indulging in violence and damaging public property during anti-CAA protests, a Samajwadi Party leader put up a poster of two former BJP leaders, Kuldeep Sengar and Chinmayanand , who have been accused of rape.

The posters came up around Thursday midnight at five locations, including Lohia crossing, where it was put up next to the hoarding of anti-CAA protesters.

The poster mentioned the name of SP leader IP Singh, who also tweeted about it. The posters were removed after some time.

The posters, having black background, bore big photographs of Chinmayanand and Sengar and mentioned charges that the two leaders face.

“Ye hain Pradesh ki betiyon ke aaropi. Inse rahein saavdhan. (They are accused of harassing the state’s daughters. Beware of them.),” the poster read.

Talking to TOI, IP Singh said: “The state is trying to protect those who raped women. What is the harm in putting up pictures of those who have been convicted? If hoardings of people allegedly involved in violence is justified, then posters of two former leaders is also justified.”

Alleging that cops removed the posters, Singh said had the police shown the same promptness in controlling crime in the state, UP would have been safer for women.

Refuting claims, assistant commissioner of police, Gomtinagar , Santosh Singh said, “We were not even aware about any such poster and came to know about it only when IP Singh tweeted about it.”

Goyal said that these agents are no longer required when people can book tickets on mobile phone or can simply visit a common service centre for this.

Replying in Lok Sabha to a discussion on the demand for grants of the railway ministry, Goyal said, ""I feel there is no need of the current system of booking tickets through vendors and ticketing agents. I am considering to stop this. Today everyone has mobile phone and they can use it to book tickets. Those who need help can go to a common service centre where young people are eagerly waiting to help you book a ticket."" He urged people not to book their tickets from any illegal sources.

The minister highlighted how the ministry has cracked down on illegal agents and touts by arresting 104 persons who were selling illegal software to book tickets and 5,300 touts who were black marketing tickets. Even 884 booking vendors have also also been blacklisted.

Goyal slammed the opposition, particularly Congress, which raised the issue of merger of railway budget with general budget. He alleged that the earlier Congress-led governments used to present separate railways budget only to mislead people and compared the earlier practice with a ""balloon"" only to attract ""claps"" in the House.

The minister also highlighted how in its 166-year-long history, Indian Railways has for the first time not reported a single passenger death in this financial year as the government prioritised safety.

134,['14/03/2020'],Prayagraj student’s perennial jasmine promises 365-day income for farmers,"Chandra Shekhar has grown a fairly new variety of jasmine in the city’s near-zero winter temperatures

Prayagraj: An MSc student of Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences (SHUATS) in Naini seems to have turned the tables on the weather god. Chandra Shekhar has grown a fairly new variety of jasmine — a largely tropical plant that thrives in hot, humid conditions — in the city’s near-zero winter temperatures.

The star jasmine, as it is called, was developed by scientists at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) in 2019 and was meant to be a perennial variety that could be grown in every season in the southern state, where it is extensively used in temple rituals.

But, Tamil Nadu has an average minimum temperature of 21°C in December-January, which the plant can well handle. Prayagraj, on the other hand, sees a winter low of 3°C. The star jasmine was not expected to survive this bone-numbing cold until Chandra Shekhar used his ingenious technology to grow the plant in “controlled conditions”. Also, his tireless research revealed that the soil in Prayagraj is favourable.

“Winter temperatures in this Sangam City is drastically different from places in Tamil Nadu, which has tropical climate. After 10 months of trial and error, we were able to harvest the flowers in extreme winter, besides peak monsoon,” the student said, hoping his expertise would be a game-changer for flower farmers given the high demand of the fragrant jasmine that is also used to make essential oil for a wide range of cosmetic products.

Chandra Shekhar’s ‘all-season star jasmine’ boasts a long stem and bold buds with a pink tinge. The buds bloom into a white star-shaped flower with usually 10 petals that are leaner and longer. The flowers are mildly fragrant and the leaves dark green and glossy.

SS Saravanan, associate professor of horticulture at SHUATS, was Chandra Shekhar’s guide in the project. He agreed that longer life span and shelf life of the star jasmine promised farmers round-the-year income.

“The all-season star jasmine can certainly change the destiny of flower growers here and revolutionise the agriculture sector. It can replace the common jasmine because it is more affordable,” Saravanan said.

Those in the business say that the situation is no different for poultry farmers elsewhere in the state as well as across the country.Before the rumours started spreading on social media, a kg of poultry chicken was selling for somewhere between Rs 150 and Rs 200 in the market. Now, the price of poultry at farm-gate level has notched down to a record low of anything between Rs 10 and Rs 20 per kilogram.Those in the poultry business claim that in each of the eight districts, farmers have incurred an average loss of over Rs 100 crore due to the circulation of rumours and false messages on social media. Feroz Khan from Jalna, the region’s leading veterinary associated with the poultry business, said, “In a district like Jalna, about 300 poultry farmers have sustained a loss of around Rs 50 lakh each. Collectively, their losses stand at about Rs 150 crore.”A couple of days ago, poultry farmer Subhash Nirgude from Aundha Nagnath in Hingoli district buried 20,000 hens alive. “The poultry that we readied at a cost of about Rs 100 is now being purchased for Rs 10/kg because of the rumours. If the fully grown poultry is not purchased immediately by the traders, feeding the hens everyday starts punching deep holes in our pockets,” said Nirgude.Echoing concerns of those rearing poultry, farmer activists said that marginal farmers with little or no land holdings from the drought-prone region had recently switched to poultry farming. “The circulation of rumours has ruined the poultry businesses to such an extent that farmers have no option but to commit suicide,” said Vijay Patil, a poultry farmer.Taking cognizance of the circulation of false messages causing damage to the chicken, mutton and seafood industries, chairperson (CAC and CEO) of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) S S Ayangar said last week, “There is a misconception that coronavirus will spread through chicken, mutton and seafood. There is nothing like that. It is scientifically not proven. I am a scientist. I will not buy this argument.”Despite this statement coming from the country’s FSSAI chief, rumours are still afloat in social media platforms, taking a toll on the poultry, seafood and mutton industries.With no union or association of poultry farmers in the region, small groups of farmers have started coming together for making representations to the respective district administrations while demanding compensation and relief packages.Agitated farmers are even demanding registration of offences against those circulating and forwarding false messages on social media. “Offences should be registered against those spreading false rumours and creating panic among people, which in turn is eating into our businesses,” said Yashwant Jadhav , a farmer from Parbhani district",aurangabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74622416,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-97073,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/rumours-circulating-in-social-media-kill-regions-poultry-biz/articleshow/74618350.cms

“Conventionally, radiation therapy was being provided by using Cobalt-60 Bhabhatron for two-dimensional radiotherapy (2D-RT). We are now introducing Bhabhatron Multi Leaf Collimator, using which we can provide 3D CRT and IMRT. This treatment is far more advanced,” said Dr Ilamkumaran, medical director, Harshitha Hospital.

The use of patient-specific 3D images in the treatment planning process distinguishes 3D-CRT from conventional radiotherapy.

Meanwhile, IMRT uses advanced technology to manipulate photon and proton beams of radiation to conform to the shape of a tumor.

“The time is much less when using this advanced technology. IMRT takes only 15 minutes, while the conventional radiation therapy can take up to 45 minutes. This means, we can also treat more patients in a shorter time,” added the doctor.

The hospital said that the advanced radiation therapy will be available for patients free of cost, covered under the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme (CMCHIS).

While India confirmed 81 positive cases till Friday and UP 11, Prayagraj hasn’t reported a single victim yet. Nevertheless, the local administration is leaving no room for complacency. Isolation wards have been set up at all four government hospitals. SRN Hospital has 20 beds while Colvin, Beli and women’s hospital have 10 each.

District epidemiologist Dr Anshu Vaishya told TOI that the Centre had provided the fresh list of flyers and health officials were physically verifying the addresses. “Fifteen of these 35 passengers are from urban areas and the rest from rural pockets. Medical officers of the various blocks concerned have been alerted,” he said.

According to Dr Vaishya, the health department on Friday conducted a Covid-19 crash course for additional CMOs and medical and paramedical staff, besides ASHA workers. “They were apprised of their roles and responsibilities,” he said.

The district authorities have also restricted biometric attendance at many government offices till March 31 and several events, including Holi Milan progammes and seminars scheduled at Allahabad University, have been postponed.

Data released by the health department on Friday suggest 60 passengers returned to Prayagraj from countries like China, Hong Kong and Thailand since December 29. “While 47 were ‘released’ after 28 days in observation, 13 are quarantined at home,” Vaish said.

The department has appealed to residents to consult doctors or medical officials if they show symptoms like dry cough and fever instead of panicking over unconfirmed reports surfacing on social media platforms. It has floated two helplines — 0532-2640645 and 9415238998 — as well.

“If anyone wants to know about coronavirus, he or she can contact doctors at government hospitals. We also have helplines for information,” said a senior health official, stressing that no positive case had been reported in the city till now.

President of Allahabad Chemists & Druggists Association Anil Dubey said N95 masks and hand sanitisers were back in stock. “They can be easily bought at most pharmacies now,” he said.

“I have asked them to stop breathalyzer tests for drink and drive cases for the time being since it can lead to spread of Covid-19. We will soon implement an alternative system,” he told reporters here.

The commissioner said order had been placed for masks worth Rs 1 lakh to distribute to the traffic police.

He said there were around 10,000 CCTV cameras in the city. “They have helped in solving crimes, including murders,” he said and added that crimes during night time have decreased in recent times. Devasirvatham distributed road safety equipment -- including torches, baton lights, beacon lights, megaphones and others worth around Rs 14 lakh -- to police personnel.

The commissioner said that 16 women personnel have been shortlisted to form a Delta team, which would exclusively deal with women’s safety issues like eve-teasing and stalking.

Devasirvatham also promised to crackdown on food delivery partners who are over-speeding on roads and breaking traffic rules to deliver their orders faster. He added that the issue of Omni buses over-speeding particularly during night time inside the city will be looked into.

142,['14/03/2020'],Stranded Indians rush to return amid ad hoc coronavirus cancellations,"KOLKATA: Ad hoc cancellation of international flights by airlines struggling with India’s lockdown order has left Indians desperate to return and foreigners keen on exiting, bewildered and in extreme panic. Various airlines have already cancelled 22 flights over the next seven days. This is in addition to the 16 daily flights already suspended by a dozen carriers. The only international airlines that insisted they were still operating on schedule are Gulf carriers Emirates, Qatar and Etihad. But sources said the situation was fluid and could change dramatically within a couple of days when passenger load could experience a precipitous drop across sectors.On Friday, Bangladeshi passengers made a scramble to board flights out of Kolkata with fares for the hour-long journey touching Rs 15,000. With four Bangladeshi carriers suspending operations, only Indian carriers IndiGo, SpiceJet and Air India are operating flights on the sector. Fares on the return sector that has hardly any takers is selling at a third the price.Ahsan Rabi Mortaza, a Bangladeshi citizen who is in Kolkata for his son’s treatment, is among several thousand Bangladeshis who are uncertain about their status after India’s decision to cancel all visas issued earlier. “The doctor is supposed to see my son on Monday. I am unsure what to do and will drop in at the Bangladesh deputy high commission for advice on Saturday,” he said.In Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 40 people from Kolkata are stranded in a hotel for three days after the flight they were supposed to board on March 9 was cancelled. “On reaching the airport, we were told the flight had been cancelled. We were taken to a hotel, where we spent three days without any news of the flight,” wrote Ziaur Rehaman, one of those stranded.Two Kolkatans — Sanyam Surana and Shivangi Banthia — are holed up in Stockholm. On a Scandinavia trip, the tour was originally scheduled to conclude in Amsterdam on March 22 and they were to board a flight back home via Frankfurt and Delhi. Following the lockdown order, they wanted to cancel the tickets and book fresh ones that would avoid Germany. But the airline they are booked on has refused to waive cancellation charges. “We want to avoid Germany because it is one of the Covid-19-affected countries and if we fly through it, we could be quarantined for a fortnight. Since we had booked Air India tickets (the Amsterdam-Frankfurt leg was on a partner airline), we wanted to cancel them. But the call centre insisted the cancellation charges had to be paid and that it could only waive rescheduling fees. At an emergency as this, all other airlines are waiving cancellation charges,” said travel agent Payal Khandelwal. AI said it permitted one free change and would postpone any international or domestic bookings on the airline network but there was no case of waiving cancellation charges.The situation has been compounded by unannounced cancellation of flights by airlines. Aviation industry sources said both Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways had decided to rationalize their daily flight to four-a-week. In addition, SpiceJet and AirAsia had decided to cancel at least four flights to Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur in next 12 days. IndiGo has also suspended flights to nearly all international sectors till the end of next week.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74626495,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-216966,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stranded-indians-rush-to-return-amid-ad-hoc-ncov-cancellations/articleshow/74619455.cms
143,['14/03/2020'],Residents ask PDKV to fence entire Bharat Van,"Nagpur: After saving city’s urban mini forest Bharat Van from a developmental project, greens have now geared up to protect it from trespassers and other mischievous activities.

On Thursday morning, residents of Bharat Nagar caught hold of few trespassers inside the lush green patch which is owned by Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (PDKV). “There were few people who went inside the forest to burn electric cable wires. Apart from them, the area is frequented by nearby slum dwellers,” said Jaydeep Das, honorary wildlife warden of Nagpur.

In March last year, TOI had reported about thousands of uncounted trees mysteriously disappearing from the forest in the last few years. These included around 4,000 bamboo and over 200 fully grown trees of different species.

Following the Thursday incident, a delegation of activists and residents held a meeting with PDKV registrar AR Chavan, demanding immediate conservation of Bharat Van. “The forest needs urgent immediate protection from anti-social elements and illegal activities. The entire area should be fenced to stop trespassing,” their letter submitted to PDKV stated.

Residents have also demanded prevention of soil erosion in the forest. “The sewage line of Bharat Nagar which comes inside the forest should be diverted. Also, a ‘bandhara’ should be built downstream to increase water capacity,” the letter stated.

Apart from this, it added that tree plantation should be done in Bharat Van along with tree census. “The plantation drive should be carried out before monsoon. Small pathway should also be built for morning walkers,” said Das, stressing that round-the-clock security of the jungle should be given utmost priority.

Activists have also appealed to PDKV to refrain from giving away their lush green lands for developmental projects. More than 500 age-old trees at Bharat Van were facing axe from a proposed road project connecting Bharat Nagar square on Amravati road with MJP office to WCL Road.

Following immense public outrage, the civic authorities had dropped the plan.

He told reporters that the chief minister would decide on the matter on Saturday.“We are lucky that we have not got a single Covid-19 positive case till now and we must take stringent measures,” he said.The suggestion to suspend classes up to Class IX was made in light of queries and concerns by a growing number of parents, Rane said. He, however, said that the public examination for Classes X and XII should be conducted.The health minister, who has been persistently advising against mass gatherings in the state, said festival parades and even weddings in hotels should be called off. On Wednesday, he sought that the Ketevan Sacred Music Festival be cancelled on top priority in view of the exponential number of coronavirus cases worldwide. The following day, the organisers announced that the event which features artistes from various parts of the world was postponed.When asked if cinema halls and malls in Goa be shut down as is being done in neighbouring Maharashtra, Rane said the government would take a call after assessing the situation. He also advised minimal travel while replying to a query about the likelihood of border screenings.“A lot of people travel to Goa by road and rail, but logistic problems will make this (border screening) a difficult proposition,” he said. “Also, we can’t just shut down the borders,” he said.Responding to a question about the tourism industry in the state being badly hit, the health minister said, “Now is not the time to think of tourists.

The accused Rambhajan Patel had been cultivating poppy over an area of a three-bigha land.

Patel was booked under section 8\18 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.

SSP (Prayagraj) Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj said the accused was arrested on the charges of illegal cultivation of poppy and the entire crop was destroyed before the district authorities.

Last week, a joint team of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and Special Task Force (Prayagraj unit) had arrested a man for illegally growing poppy in Malaq Payagi village. The team had seized the plants which were being cultivated in a 4200-square feet area.

Police said that the cultivation of opium is permitted only in four districts of Uttar Pradesh — Barabanki, Budaun, Bareilly and Ghazipur.

Engineers found that it could be used with water and was pressed into service.Sprayers are used for the same purpose and can disperse particulate matter of up to 20 microns. “This is usually helpful because the disinfectant droplets need to spread properly and act on spit or phlegm droplets which spread the virus,” a senior official said.The mobile water wash is used to clean garbage vehicles of the civic body.

So far, 2,800 applications have been received.

The government had asked land owners and stakeholders to file their representations and objections against the inclusion of their lands in the private forest areas identified by the Thomas & Araujo Committee within a month from February 15 to March 15.

However, the short duration and a single location to receive the documents from the entire state had irked aggrieved land owners.

Hundreds had queued up in the last couple of days to submit their objections.

Further, keeping in mind difficulties people face in travelling to Ponda, private forest review committee, member secretary, Deepshikha Sharma said more submission locations have been included. These are the Panaji head office of principal conservator of forests, the Margao office of deputy conservator of forests and the Canacona and Mapusa offices of the sub-divisional forest officers.

All counters will remain open on Saturdays and Sundays too, Sharma said.

Further, she said, clerks have been instructed to accept all documents, even if they are not in a file, and file them later.

Prayagraj: After a sunny Thursday, the weather took the city by storm on Friday.

A thunderstorm, characterised by frequent flashes of lightning and its acoustic effect along with heavy rain and gusty winds, lashed Prayagraj for an hour in the intervening night. The shower show was back again in the evening. Several rural areas of Trans-Yamuna reported hailstorm too.

According to the Met department, the city recorded 15.2mm rainfall and the maximum wind speed was 23 knots, which is approximately 42kmph. The daytime temperature was a comfortable 27.1°C while the minimum reading was a cooler 19.7°C.

The wee-hour downpour flooded several localities, albeit for a brief while. Power supply was disrupted and trees were uprooted at a few places. Traffic movement was adversely affected during the day as these uprooted trees blocked roads.

Snarls triggered by slo-mo buses were reported in parts of the city.

“The rain and thunderstorm were triggered by a western disturbance, which is a normal phenomenon during this time of the year. However, snowfall in the upper Himalayan region and hailstorm are worrying,” said professor SS Ojha, department of geography, Allahabad University.

150,['14/03/2020'],"Covid-19 scare: When social distancing isn’t a bad word, but a vital health ploy","NEW DELHI: Schools, colleges and cinema halls have been shut in Delhi to slow the spread of the dreaded Covid-19 . People have started avoiding crowds, cancelling non-essential events, minimising travel, working from home where possible. Social contact is being reduced, as people avoid handshakes and hugs and greet each other from a wary distance. On public transport or in a restaurant, a sneeze can draw alarmed attention. Religious gatherings and pilgrimages have been cancelled. It is time to consciously go into screensaver mode, if not a full shutdown.This is not paranoia — because apart from protecting oneself from infection, this ‘social distancing’ is critical to slow the rate at which other people are infected. Even if you are young and healthy, you live in an inter-connected world and your actions right now can determine whether the novel coronavirus explodes or not.During the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak, the US cities that closed schools and discouraged gatherings, and did it early, like St Louis, contained the disease. Thousands died in the towns that didn’t, like Philadelphia. While that epidemic had a mortality rate of 2.5%, WHO estimates a 3.4% rate for the novel coronavirus.While the virus has already touched Indians, social distancing is now necessary to “flatten the curve”, say public health experts — to avert a crisis, and to buy time. “Right now the government’s focus is on quarantining those who have brought the virus into India and tracing their contacts to prevent community spread,” said public health expert Srinath Reddy. So far, 52 public hospitals are identified as testing centres. Places with organised primary health centres like Kerala and Tamil Nadu are better prepared to deal in a situation of community spread, Reddy said. Testing, counselling or triage or home surveillance need a primary health force that isn’t available in many parts of India, he added.“Everyone in the world is meeting this virus for the first time, and it has spread at a pace that nobody was prepared for,” said Reddy. Over time, he noted, we will be able to gauge if there has been community spillage, one can develop diagnostic tests, use artificial intelligence to detect patterns, and see if weather has an impact on the virus.In India too, containing coronavirus is a challenge. Neighbourhoods here are dense, families are tightly networked. “The correlation between epidemic diffusion and population density is not direct,” pointed out Olivier Telle, a researcher at the Centre de Sciences Humanities, who has studied disease diffusion in Delhi. But given urban India’s commuting patterns, diseases like the flu and coronavirus can spread easily, especially in places where there is no health infrastructure to break the spread, he said.Many citizens don’t have ready access to soap and water and they also need to earn a daily livelihood. The hardest hit of the population will also be the most vulnerable. The Kerala scheme of reaching mid-day meals to schoolchildren at home is a sensible and sensitive intervention in this context. Indian manufacturing units are largely informal where people work cheek-by-jowl and it won’t be easy to enforce separation. “The poor and the indigent will be particularly affected,” felt Deepak Mehta, sociologist at Ashoka UniversityThere will be other effects in India — citizen protests or demonstrations can now be seen as a public health problem, for instance, as can mass security deployments. During a public health emergency, it makes sense to pull together rather than sharpen divides between groups.“A pandemic in our networked age is entirely different from previous contagions,” explained Mehta. “When it ‘viralises’ as news, it can create great panic. When public spaces empty out, when you are confined or incarcerated at home, there are consequences in terms of social relatedness and economic activity. Teaching and learning, for instance, are complicated without face-to-face encounters,” he said.What are the emotional consequences to people shuttering themselves in? It can hurt those who already lead isolated lives, especially the old and lonely, those with mental or other disabilities. “On the other hand, the fact that people are confined at home and have to cut down on meetings might even make them focus on their family and friends. Maybe that is good from a mental health perspective as long as there is no alarm and panic,” Reddy suggested.Self isolation is not easy for a social species. Many of us are bunkering in, to find that staying home is no fun when it is imposed on us. Yet, social media and entertainment can help us endure the lockdown better. People have to make a conscious effort to maintain routines, get regular exercise — some are tuning into a scheduled yoga class through video-calls, for instance. Children, especially, get cabin-fever when stuck indoors.Actual quarantine, of course, can have greater psychological costs. The separation from loved ones, the confinement and uncertainty, and change in habits can have lasting effects, says a team from Kings College, London, which studied previous experiences with H1N1 flu, SARS, MERS and so on. Their study, published in Lancet, found that post-traumatic stress and depression can continue for up to three years after the episode. Sadness, anger and irritability run high. Economic loss and social stigma also worsen the situation.Fear and anxiety can make people turn on specific populations — there have already been attacks in India on those who ‘look Chinese’. “Outsiders are seen as the ones bringing in the disease,” said Telle. “But to tackle epidemics, the mindset needs to be one of collective solidarity — that it is not just your health, but your neighbour’s that needs to be protected.”We live in an integrated world, and it won’t be easy to reverse the economic and social flows. This situation can also prompt feelings of care and solidarity, and a realisation that harm to one is harm to all.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74622379,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-207852,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/when-social-distancing-isnt-a-bad-word-but-a-vital-health-ploy/articleshow/74620146.cms

But fumigation of aircraft is not part of the protocol even when a confirmed Covid-19 case is reported on the flight.Airlines are known to be cagey about disclosing their response to infectious diseases and threats they may pose to employees and passengers. But the situation has turned such that they seem to have shed the inhibition and are now reaching out to travel agents and flyers with preventive, containment and de-contamination measures they have adopted.National carrier Air India, which airlifted Indians stranded in China and Iran, has laid down protocols to deal with suspect cases. But fumigation is not one of the measures, even when a confirmed case is reported and the aircraft is on the ground for a few hours. Instead, it has advised cleaning of the aircraft interiors including seats, overhead bins and toilets with alcohol-based cleanser.Vistara, the Tata-SIA airline, has set up a specialized task force to deal with the challenges posed by the global outbreak of novel coronavirus . The airline said it was monitoring flights across the network for risks. If a suspected case is reported or detected, the affected row as well as three rows in front and behind are being sanitized, along with lavatories, sidewalls, tray tables, overhead compartments and carpets on the aircraft. “If any confirmed case is reported, we will carry out complete sanitization of the aircraft,” the Vistara spokesperson said, adding the situation was being reviewed daily and the airline was nimble in its approach to contain the virus.GoAir has enhanced overnight cleaning of its fleet and is spending six-seven hours to deep-clean each aircraft daily. “We have expanded the use of hospital-grade disinfectant to clean the cabin, elements in the flight deck, and lavatory,” a GoAir official said, adding all employees have been equipped with disinfectants, sanitizers, gloves and other protective equipment, particularly those who interact with customers.SpiceJet, too, has provided masks and gloves as personal protective measures against Covid-19. Cabin crew have been asked to wear masks in case they come across a suspect case. The airline said it had ensured sufficient availability of masks on each flight for passenger use in case of a suspect case on board. “We have been treating all international flights with disinfectants post disembarkation of passengers. During night halt of aircraft, extensive deep cleaning is being carried out,” a SpiceJet official said.All airlines have conducted training sessions for employees on WHO guidelines. IndiGo, which operates the largest number of flights in the country, said it was taking all precautionary measures to contain the spread of novel coronavirus as advised by the authorities, including screening at the airport and wearing of masks. “We are following all the prescribed Airport Health Organization (APHO) guidelines and are taking preventive measures for our crew operating flights to regions affected by coronavirus,” an IndiGo spokesperson said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74621318,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-194882,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/domestic-flights-deep-cleaned-following-corona-protocol-but-fumigation-not-on-list/articleshow/74619471.cms
152,['14/03/2020'],God’s act? Theories in time of coronavirus,"KOCHI: There is no dearth of superstition or conspiracy theories when a pandemic like Covid-19 strikes. Some Christians believe that the coronavirus is a forerunner to the first of the seven plagues mentioned in the Book of Revelations in the Bible.On Saturday, a sermon titled ‘Corona in the light of Bible’ was delivered by Pastor J Tito Arattukulam at the Seventh-day Adventist Church at Poonthopp, Alappuzha . Nearly 100 persons were in attendance as he delivered the hour-and-a-half-long speech, in which the pastor compared the Covid-19 outbreak to the seven plagues described in Chapter 16 of Revelations. Also, he drew parallels to the 10 plagues of the Old Testament sent down on Egypt.He said the world is being hit by the pandemic as it indulges in pagan worship, instead of believing in Jesus.“There are so many sinners in the world. There is idol worship all around, including in Christianity. Sunday, a special day in paganism, is followed by even Christians instead of the seventh holy day. Only Christ can redeem the world and we must pray and repent. Repentance and prayer should be given primary importance,” said Arattukulam.Interestingly, the pastor also advocates medical precautions and treatments even as they say that prayer and repentance is the primary solution. “Doctors, who have learned the physiology of the body, would be able to help us but only with the help of god . So, primarily we need to pray and repent,” he said.The first plague is described in Revelations as follows: “Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go, pour out the seven bowls of God’s wrath on the earth.” The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land, and ugly, festering sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshipped its image.”Even as the pastor associated the virus to be a prophetic warning from god, all those who attended the sermon on Saturday used precautions. Soap and water were provided at the church for attendees. Sanitary wipes used by members were later buried on the premises.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74635934,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-703804,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/gods-act-theories-in-time-of-corona/articleshow/74632351.cms

This is the first sentencing in the case that created a flutter across the country.

The minors have been sentenced on the basis of photographic and video evidence collected during investigations.

A total of nine people, including the two minors, had been accused for lynching the dairy farmer with six being acquitted by a trial court later. A seventh person had claimed to be a minor, but the JJB found him to be an adult. His trial is going on at a Behror court.

The JJB also rejected the minors’ application to suspend the sentence. Defence lawyer Adarsh Kumar Yadav told TOI, “The Board had the power to suspend the sentence, but it rejected the application. We do not agree with the verdict and will appeal against it in the coming week.”

Pehlu Khan (55), a dairy farmer from Haryana’s Nuh district, his two sons and some others were intercepted and attacked by cow vigilantes near Behror on April 1, 2017.

Pehlu succumbed to his injuries three days later at a private hospital in Alwar. Seven cases had been registered in the matter, including one against Pehlu and his sons for transporting cattle and against the mob for lynching him.

The families of the accused minors expressed their unhappiness over the decision. “Six of the accused have been acquitted, but my son, who was going to give a practical exam and was not part or present at the time of lynching, has been convicted. He was unnecessarily made part of the case,” said the parent of one.

A chargesheet against five of the accused was submitted before the trial court on May 31, 2017, and another against one more person in January 2019. A third chargesheet, which named Pehlu and his two sons, was filed in May, 2019. But the deceased’s name was dropped from it later.

On August 14, 2019, a trial court in Alwar had acquitted the six accused in the lynching case. The trial court had given the benefit of doubt to the accused, citing a botched investigation by the Alwar police and saying the prosecution had failed to furnish key documents in the court to prove the charges.

The acquittal had created a hue and cry following which the Haryana government formed a SIT to identify lapses in the investigation and fix the responsibility on individual officers who had conducted the probe. The SIT found many serious lapses in investigation.

Petitions were filed in the Rajasthan High Court, one by Pehlu’s family and another by the state government, against the acquittal of the accused in October 2019. In the same month, the HC ordered the quashing of the FIR and chargesheet filed against Pehlu, his two sons and the vehicle driver on the grounds of abuse of law.

LUCKNOW: The loss of Rs 15 crore to the promoters of Ekana stadium after the India-South Africa match was cancelled might just be the tip of an iceberg of economic losses the state is staring at.While earlier it was decided that the ODI on March 15 in Lucknow would be played without spectators, on Friday, the match was called off till further notice. The money for tickets sold will be refunded.As a result, the stadium is expected to incur losses of close to Rs 15 crore, a sports ministry official had said.Coronavirus outbreak live coverageA big jolt to UP has come from the halt in meat exports to China and Iran, the two countries which import the bulk of meat from UP. The state tops the list of meat exports in the country. “Both countries have told us to stop exporting meat for now,” lamented Fauzan Alvi, a meat exporter from the state. Apart from losses in trade and industry due to decline in economic activities, the state government is also set to suffer SGST decline in February and March. Since CGST will also witness the same trend, the state’s share in GST from the Centre will also shrink.“At a time when the nation is already witnessing an economic slowdown, the only option for the governments is to trigger demand by public funding. If required, from borrowings, to fulfil its flagship programmes and projects,” said noted economist Yashvir Tyagi. An officer in the Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority said that so far, India has recorded an export loss of about Rs 1,500 crore and UP is the main sufferer, being the highest meat producer and exporter.Besides, in view of travel restrictions to other countries and visa cancellations by India, travel and tourism companies are flooded with cancellation orders from their clients.“We are facing a difficult period as clients are demanding their payments back and airlines and hotel owners abroad and within the country are refusing to share the pain,” said Mohamed Asif Beg, who runs an international travel company.Agra has witnessed a sharp decline in footfall at Taj Mahal , the biggest attraction for foreigners. Travel advisories, stringent scanning and preventive measures have deterred international tourists from landing in Taj city , causing revenue loss to the state as well as industry.The biggest setback, however, has been to Uday Sinha, the managing director of Ekana stadium, which saw its last international match in November 2018.“In that match between India and West Indies, we sold tickets for about Rs 8 crore, apart from revenue through ads.All is lost this time,” said a dejected Sinha.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74620079,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-73178,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/match-tickets-to-meat-exports-corona-scare-leads-to-massive-financial-loss-for-up/articleshow/74620081.cms

The act empowers state health officials to admit any person and isolate him or her if he or she has history of visit to an area where Covid-19 is endemic and is found to be symptomatic.It allows an authorised officer to forcefully admit and isolate a suspect for 14 days from the onset of symptoms or till the laboratory report is received, or such period as may be necessary, if suspect refuses to be isolated.Health minister Vishwajit Rane said that the act has been invoked as a precautionary measure since there is an exponential increase in Covid-19 cases in other states.“The act has been invoked to allow notified officials to execute their functions in a much more effective manner and take preventive measures,” Rane told reporters on Friday.Chief minister Pramod Sawant has convened a high-level meeting on Covid-19 on Saturday to decide precautions to be taken following the Centre’s guidelines.The meeting will also deliberate on overall action plan to be adopted by the state in view of rising Covid-19 cases, a statement by the chief minister’s office stated.Secretary health, district collectors, director of health services, state surveillance officer, health and medical officers of community health centres, primary health centres, urban health centres in the districts and officers have been authorised officials under the Act.‘The Goa Epidemic Disease, Covid-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019)’ regulations came into force with the invocation of the act and will remain in force for a year.The health minister, however, said the government may withdraw application of the act if the spread of the disease is contained in the next two to three months.The regulations necessitate — government as well as private — hospitals to have flu corners that are segregated from the common out-patient department (OPD) area for screening of suspected cases of Covid-19. The hospital should identify separate beds for isolation if the need arises.The regulations mandate that all hospitals, private included, during screening of patients record their travel history and find out if the person had come in contact with suspected or confirmed case of Covid–19.In case the person has any such history linked to the last 14 days, and he/she is asymptomatic then a home quarantine of 14 days is recommended from the day of exposure.If person is found symptomatic, the person must be isolated in a hospital and tested for Covid-19. Information of such cases should be passed on to the health officers at community health centres, primary health centres and urban health centres.A separate notification was also issued on Friday making Covid-19 disease and H1N1, as notifiable diseases.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74622282,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-365870,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-invokes-epidemic-diseases-act/articleshow/74620128.cms
156,['14/03/2020'],Woman duped of Rs 55 lakh on promise of handsome returns,"Representative image

PUNE: The alankar police on Thursday registered an offence against a man and his wife for duping a 37-year-old Paud Road resident of Rs55 lakhs on the promise of handsome returns on her investment in their financial services firm.

The man was also involved in the multi-crore rupee bitcoin cryptocurrency fraud case.

“The cybercrime cell of the Pune police had arrested the suspect in the bitcoin cryptocurrency fraud case in 2018. He is currently out on bail. We are yet to arrest him and his wife,” assistant inspector Arun Ghodke of Alankar police told TOI.

Ghodke said the complainant and the suspect had come in contact at a meditation centre in 2014. The suspect had told the woman and her husband about handsome returns from money trading and invited them to a workshop. “The woman and her two friends attended the workshop. Under the pretext of counselling them, the suspect managed to obtain the details of their finances,” he said.

Ghodke said the suspect lured the complainant to invest in his newly-started financial services company and promised her 2.2% interest per month, or 30% interest per annum. He said, “The complainant on March 3, 2017, gave him a cheque of Rs55lakh. The complainant invested Rs25lakh at 2.2% interest per month and the remaining Rs30lakh at 30% interest per year.

The officer said the complainant had requested the suspects to draw up a proper agreement. The man had promised them that the agreement would be done immediately after the trading started. “The suspects had paid interest till February 2018 and stopped paying it lter,” he said.

Ghodke said the complainant became suspicious and started pursuing him to return the money. In April 2018, they came to know that the suspect was arrested in the bitcoin fraud case. “The suspect’s wife had promised the complainant that she would return the money after her husband was released from jail. She also told her that they had invested the money through a woman,” Ghodke said.

In August 2019, the suspect was granted bail by a court in the bitcoin fraud case. “Despite repeated requests when the suspect refused to return the money, the complainant lodged an FIR on Thursday,” Ghodke said.

The couple have been booked under sections 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code, the officer added.

157,['14/03/2020'],"Amidst coronavirus outbreak, they chose to ride out the crisis in Italy than head home","Mithun (left) and Girish

CHENNAI: The streets of Milan are almost deserted. Schools and universities are closed. Theatres, cinemas, museums, pubs, dance schools, game rooms, bingo halls, discos and other clubs are suspended. But, in his home in the city that is facing a complete lockdown, Mithun Thiyagarajan has decided to use the extra time to catch up on reading. For, early on, the 28-year-old architect and industrial designer, who hails from Vadapalani, had made the decision to stay and ride out the crisis rather than head back home, and risk spreading the virus.

“By travelling, I would be putting myself at a higher risk. Worse, I wouldn’t want to be someone responsible that brought the virus into another country with a lower number of cases,” says Mithun, who moved to Milan in 2016 to pursue his masters’ at the Politecnico di Milano. “I am young and may survive it, but without my knowledge what if I do contract it and transmit it to someone who may not survive? That was something I questioned and decided not to do. It seemed a bit selfish. Instead I keep my family informed about what is happening here every day,” says Mitun, whose job-hunting plans have been put on hold for now.

“Even if I do get back to India, how does one decide when to return? I understand this virus may not be eradicated entirely in a few months,” he says, adding that the government is doing all it can to ensure the general public is well taken care of.

“All the workplaces whose employees can work from home do so, others are required to take mandatory precautions. For example, at the pharmacies the queues have lines marked on the floor with one metre spacing and everyone is requested to maintain that gap,” says Mithun. In small stores, there are signs that specify how many people can enter the store at a time. “The calculation is based on the size of the store. A small bakery near my home, which is about 3m long and 3m wide, has calculated that only three people can stand in line at a time. And people respect queues.” The police force also ensures people do not crowd public places.

“Until last Saturday, before Milan and Lombardy was declared to be a red zone, restaurants and pubs were open provided they had only table service and all the tables were 1m away from each other,” says Mithun. “But now many establishments have closed until further notice, which ensures even the ones who do not want to respect the quarantine have less options if they step out.”

The lockdown has had a psychological impact as well. “Initially, there was panic. Staying informed is key. Technology really helps -- at the very least one gets to stay in touch with people they care about to keep oneself warm virtually,” he says, adding that you need to use the time imposed on one positively. “I spend it reading more than I ever did in the recent past,” he says.

In Albignano d’Adda, province of Milan, industrial designer Girish Gopalakrishnan, 27, has also decided to stay put as the project he is working on requires his physical presence. “I am not so worried about COVID-19 as I take all necessary precautions to protect myself,” says Girish, who originally hails from Ramapuram and moved to Italy two years ago.

“Life has become sober here. COVID-19 has really brought Milan down to its knees. No football matches (heart and soul of every Italian), no bars, no shopping. I don’t eat out as much, or meet friends, use self-billing counters when I go to supermarkets and don’t leave home until there is an exigency,” he says. “There is a severe shortage of sanitary masks and gloves but no shortage of any other supplies.”

Since it is also the season of common influenza, the symptoms of which are similar to COVID-19, all precautions are taken. “I was down with fever for two weeks. The doctors just put me on antibiotics and home quarantined me.”

Girish is only worried about family and friends in India. “They blindly follow what is shown on TV irrespective of what the real situation is here. And I don’t know how calm them down,” he says.

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court directed the state government, the home department to institute an inquiry against the Osmanabad superintendent of police for directing a police team to raid a premises in adjoining Latur district in 2019 without giving any intimation to the Latur police.

The bench also directed that an inquiry be made into the circumstances due to which the intimation was not given to the Latur SP before taking any action. The bench also ordered inquiry against the then special IG Police, “who had allegedly passed oral instructions to the Osmanabad SP for taking such action.” The inquiry report has to be submitted in the court in four months.

The Osmanabad SP had ordered a sub-inspector attached to the anti-dacoity squad to conduct a raid in neighbouring Latur district in January 2019. The police had arrested 36 people under sections 4 and 5 of Maharashtra Prevention of Gambling Act, 1887. The area falls under the jurisdiction of Latur MIDC police station.

The suspects, Balaji Arjunrao Zunjure and 35 others, approached the court through lawyer P P More seeking inquiry and appropriate action against the cops, who crossed their jurisdiction.

While disposing of the petition, the bench comprising Justices T V Nalawade and M G Sewlikar on March 6 observed “inquiry needs to be made as to what were the circumstances due to which such intimation was not given to the Latur SP before taking any action.”

It also observed that “if the superiors had no trust in Latur SP and wanted to take action against the inaction on his part, they should have taken action against him after the raid. Admittedly, such action was not taken by the officers superior to the SP Latur. This circumstance cannot be ignored and this circumstance creates a probability that there was some mischief and something was fishy.”

The bench also said the enquiry is to be made against the then special IG police, who had allegedly passed oral instructions to the Osmanabad SP for taking such action and that “during enquiry, the contentions of the sub-inspector that he had written instructions from the Osmanabad SP need to be kept in mind.”

The bench further observed though “it is true that there is material to show that illegal activity was going on in that building, when there are allegations of aforesaid nature against police of demand of ransom and when there is no written instruction on record, thorough enquiry needs to be made by the department. If that is not done, the similar-minded police officers will start thinking that they can do anything even by going to the other district and nothing can happen to them.’’

Incidentally, the Osmanabad district falls under the Aurangabad Range, while Latur comes under Nanded Range Special IGP. The additional public prosecutor Mahendra Nerlikar said on Friday that the affidavit filed in this petition by the then DGP, S K Jaiswal, didn’t clarify which of the two- Aurangabad or Nanded range IGPs -had issued oral orders to Osmanabad police for taking action in Latur.

Prayagraj: Hotels and restaurants in Prayagraj are busy counting losses as the recent novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is forcing organisers to cancel events and parties.

Hoteliers claim that several conferences and meetings scheduled to be held at their hotels have been cancelled due to travel restrictions imposed by several countries and the recent advisory urging residents to avoid gatherings and crowded places.

Hotel owners said that occupancy of rooms has come down by 30-40% within the past 10 days due to the fear of an outbreak.

A city-based hotelier said that the occupancy rates are likely to go down further over the next few days. He said that most of his clients are considering postponing conferences\seminars and parties in the wake of the health crisis.

UP State Tourism Development Corporation (UPSTDC) senior manager DP Singh said the occupancy in two hotels of the corporation has gone down to 20 -30% in past 10 days. “Our clients started cancelling reservations within a week after coronavirus cases were reported in the country.”

Many travellers have also cancelled their vacations, especially those who had planned to visit coronavirus-affected destinations.

“The virus outbreak has dealt a huge blow to the hotel industry in the city. Our international clients have almost stopped visiting the city and there is a drastic fall in our domestic business as well,” said another hotelier in the city.

AURANGABAD: Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel has demanded the formation of an independent Marathwada railway corporation on the lines of Konkan railway corporation .

He voiced this demand during the ongoing parliament session for entire Marathwada region. The MP demanded the construction of railway pitline, thus connecting Marathwada to several other industrial and tourist destinations across the country through long-route trains.

He said, “Entire Marathwada region, especially Aurangabad should be attached to Central Railways , instead of the current South Central Railway .”

While raising the demand of doubling the tracks and electrification for Parbhani – Manmad, Jaleel said, “SCR general manager has replied to us in written that preliminary engineering, traffic survey was completed and the report was submitted to the board with a cost of Rs 2,199 and the rate of return (ROR) at 2.12% in December 2017.”

He demanded laying of pitline with an investment of Rs 18 crores, having a capacity to cater trains with of 26 coaches. “Whenever we demand improved connectivity of the trains to Marathwada, our demands are turned down due to non-availability of coach facility at Aurangabad.”

He also demanded funds for the construction of railway under bridge (RUB) at Shivajinagar area. PWD has estimated the cost of bridge construction at Rs 38 crore while the railways have estimated the construction of this bridge with the cost of about Rs 6 crores.

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court on Thursday asked the state government to file its say on constitution of biodiversity committees in each district of Maharashtra.

The court has also asked the Aurangabad municipal commissioner to file an affidavit by March 18 on what steps the civic body has taken as per the resolution passed in the meeting of biodiversity management committee held on September 22, 2015.

The court has also instructed the municipal commissioner will have to remain present in court if the addidavit is not filed in the given time.

The matter came up for hearing before Justices Z A Haq and S M Gavhane on Thursday. Mahesh Bharaswadkar , the lawyer representing the petitioner Salim Ali Lake Conservation Forum, pointed out in the court that no steps have yet been taken by the state government to constitute biodiversity committees across the districts.

He also pointed out that no action has been taken by the AMC on implementation on expert committee report with respect to declaring Salim Ali Lake a biodiversity heritage site.

The forum, a non-government organization, through its coordinator Arvind Keshav Pujari , had in 2013 approached the high court seeking direction to the AMC to declare Salim Ali Lake in Aurangabad as a biodiversity heritage site. The petition pointed out that the forum members noticed that civic body was carrying out beautification and development activity in and around Salim Ali Lake and made a representation to the municipal corporation expressing the need to preserve the biodiversity at the site.

When the matter came up for hearing, Bharaswadkar said “No steps are taken as per the resolution passed in the meeting held on September 22, 2015. Even the affidavit sworn by the Aurangabad municipal commissioner on February 7, 2019, is silent on the point...’’

While placing the next date of hearing for March 23, the bench directed the state government to “file affidavit pointing out whether the grievance of the petitioner in this regard is proper or not. The affidavit shall be filed till March 18, 2020.”

168,['14/03/2020'],A walking talking map,"On Thursday, during a question and answer session held post the screening of Sindhustan at the Bangalore International Centre, celebrity stylist and filmmaker Sapna Bhavnani was asked a slightly unexpected question. The logic behind the question held ground though. “Why haven’t Sindhis who migrated from Pakistan fought for a state of their own in India?” “That is because we are true Sufis!” joked Bhavnani adding that till date her community had tried and failed in getting a Doordarshan channel in Sindhi, never mind a state. Deliberating on the question a whole day later, Bhavnani said, “I am quite amazed that we have not got anything. In India, states are based on languages spoken, and because the Sindhi language is dying, we don’t have a basis to fight for a state. We needed to have at least fought for a DD channel, at least then people would have had access to the language and a lot more could have been done,” Bhavnani said.

While she may not look it, since the launch of her documentary Sindhustan, Bhavnani has inadvertently become the flag bearer of Sindhi culture. “Google Sindhi and chances are my name will pop right on top!” she jokes. A documentary with a duration of a little over an hour, Sindhustan is unique because it brings together many threads of the Sindhi culture and then, like a jigsaw that finally falls into place, ties it up gloriously with tattoos Bhavnani got inked on her legs: tattoos which document the tales of Sindhi survivors of the partition in Ajrakh and Madhubani art. As the film’s concept note explains, ‘Sindhustan’ is the story of the largest migration of a culture in history told through ink (tattoos).’ “When I sat down to work on the story, I knew that I wanted to focus on memories that were personal, memories that wouldn’t be readily available on Google,” Bhavnani said. Which is why starting from a kitchen where her aunt is seen preparing for Sindhi kadhi, the film takes the viewer on an immersive journey, one that flows along through the stories the partition survivors – mostly in their late 70s and 80s –narrate. “Because we don’t have a language of our own, a lot of the stories of Sindhis migrating to India during partition have been forgotten,” says Bhavnani about why she chose to get the speakers to share personal tales. While the elders shared generously, it wasn’t enough for Bhavnani to just focus on the stories. She wanted to make the entire experience even more personal. That’s when a tale her grandmother narrated, “about older times when people tattooed themselves to identify their tribes struck her”. Bhavnani decided to ink the stories the elders shared. Today, she is a human map, with names of places like Karachi, Shikarpur, and Sindh etched on her legs.

For Bhavnani, the film has given her a sense of finally having found her roots. “I was lost for a long time, till I discovered the history of my community,” she said but there’s one unfulfilled dream. “I was so desperate to get to Sindh. Once, my open tweet to Imran Khan asking him to grant me permission went viral with Sindhis across the border sharing it. I have for now made peace with the fact that I may not be able to go there with things being the way they are,” Bhavnani rued.

NO PAIN, NO GAIN

The process of getting the tattoos is another aspect Sindhustan shows. Lack of budget and time meant that Bhavnani had to go under the needle for 10 days in Goa. “A process that would have taken five years was done in 10 days,” she says. “I took (medicinal) injection for the first six days and I sat for 30 hours, but after that, my body couldn’t take it, so I spent the last four days getting inked in a hospital’s operation theatre. I couldn’t walk for a month and a half after that,” Bhavnani recalled. While the tattoos, done by Yogesh Pawar, have inspired viewers around the world, for Bhavnani, the greatest gratification came from the reactions by her interviewees. “They were blown that I had tattooed their stories,” she said. As a walking history of the survivor tales of Sindhis, Bhavnani has plans to insure her legs. There’s more. “When I die, I actually want my legs to be taxidermied because they contain the history of an entire community,” she said.

178,['14/03/2020'],Seven hours of suspense and drama at airport over rebel Congress MLAs’ return,"Scindia supporters protest at Airport on Friday. ----- pics rajeev sarathe

Bhopal: The MP political drama may have more twists and turns ahead. Bhopal’s Raja Bhoj airport was the stage for one such scene in the power play on Friday when Congress and BJP workers confronted each other amid suspense over the arrival of the rebel Congress MLAs of the Jyotiraditya Scindia faction from Bengaluru.

After seven hours of yes and no, it finally became evident that the 22 MLAs won’t be arriving. They had reportedly gone back from Bengaluru airport to the resort where they have been holed up since March 9. But by then, BJP and Congress workers had nearly come to blows at the airport, forcing police to clamp section 144, deploy STF and remove both groups from the premises.

In the morning, word suddenly got around that 22 Congress MLAs would be arriving from Bengaluru at 11am. Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh remarked that if they arrive, all of them should be tested for coronavirus.

Mediapersons scrambled to the airport and found two buses duly parked there, with a couple of state BJP leaders flitting in and out. One of them said he had come to pick up some relatives. “A busload of them?” reporters asked. Another said he had come to pick up teerth yatris.

Soon, a group of around 50 BJP workers arrived, followed by a Congress crowd that outnumbered the saffron brigade three to one. They went eyeball to eyeball. Slogans were raised, and the two sides came uncomfortably close to each other multiple times.

Police had a hard time keeping the two sides at bay. DIG Irshad Wali then took charge and separated the rival groups. The administration imposed section 144 to ban large gatherings. The two sides dispersed, but the buses stood there. So did journalists.

The MLAs had to appear before assembly Speaker Narmada Prasad Prajapati to get their resignations accepted after Scindia joined BJP. The Speaker wanted them to tell him personally that they haven’t resigned under duress.

They were expected to arrive on three 10-seater charter planes from Bangalore. Since Scindia was in Bhopal during the day, it was expected that his loyalist MLAs would arrive here and he would meet them, possibly at the airport lounge, before leaving for Delhi in the evening. The airport witnessed heavy deployment of police and STF, apart from CISF.

Scores of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha workers, led by its state president Abhilash Pandey, thronged the airport. Two buses were brought by BJP leaders, fuelling speculation that the MLAs’ arrival from Bengaluru was imminent.

Soon enough, Congress workers arrived in strength, led by Guddu Chouhan.

A slogan-shouting match began. The two groups repeatedly came close to each other. Police acted as buffer and kept the two sides at bay. Security personnel locked the main exit of the airport from inside at 3.10pm, and at 3.45pm, police announced section 144 at the airport. Congress workers were taken in a police bus from airport.

Around 4.15pm, the two buses went off, empty.

It later came to light that the Congress MLAs had gone to Bengaluru airport, but did not board the planes and returned to the resort

State Congress media in-charge Shobha Oza went to the airport to ‘receive’ the six former ministers who were supposed to come from Bengaluru. “BJP has kidnapped our MLAs. Why aren’t they bringing them back?” she asked. Oza left an hour before Scindia arrived.

During the daylong drama at the airport, PWD minister Sajjan Singh Verma returned Bhopal from Jaipur, where Congress MLAs are lodged. “Congress MLAs are free and their phones are also with them, unlike BJP, which has forcefully kept Congress MLAs in Bengaluru,” he said.

179,['14/03/2020'],Tadipatri tense as tempers flare during filing of nominations,"Tadipatri remained tense on Friday after YSRC and TDP workers came close to exchanging blows.

On hearing that YSRC workers were preventing TDP candidates from filing nominations for the municipal polls at Tadipatri in Anantapur district, former minister JC Diwakar Reddy arrived at the local municipal office along with his followers.

But local police prevented Reddy from entering the office saying MLA Kethireddy Pedda Reddy’s son Harshavardhan Reddy was inside and that they would allow him in once Harshavardhan came out.

The former minister’s supporters objected to the suggestion and a minor altercation followed.

The TDP men and YSRC workers at the spot hurled abuses at each other.

Police, however, managed to thwart a clash by dispersing both groups from the spot.

However, the three male nurses who voluntarily opted to do this duty, which most of their colleagues have avoided, are not just battling a pandemic but also social stigma.On Thursday, they were politely told by their landlord to vacate the place they had rented out as the family turned apprehensive of their presence at the house. Though the trio, all in their early 30s, got a temporary accommodation in the hospital, they doubt whether anybody will provide them a place to stay in the future.“Our house owner’s wife told us on Thursday morning that their relatives and neighbours have raised concerns about her husband’s health as we were staying there,” said one of them.“She said that there was no medicine for Covid-19. We have been staying there since the deluge of 2018 and maintained a good relationship with them. So, considering their fear, we decided to move out ,” said the 31-year-old Pathanamthitta native.After moving out, they apprised the MCH authorities of the situation. They alleged that the Medical College principal initially said that he could not arrange any accommodation for them. They then had to run after the authorities to find a temporary place to sleep. Later, they were allotted two rooms in the same floor where the isolation ward functions. They then met MCH superintendent Dr T K Jayakumar , who promised them a staff quarters for two weeks. The quarters, which is in a dilapidated condition, is expected be readied soon.“This is a difficult situation. We have voluntarily taken up this duty. We are extending all support to the state government in its fight against the disease. But when in need, we are left on our own. By now, everyone in the locality has identified us. Who will give us accommodation after two weeks?,” said the youth who has been a staff nurse at the MCH for the last eight years.Meanwhile, the house owner’s wife said she had never asked them to vacate. “I just shared the concern raised by my daughter, who is a nurse in London, and another close relative, who is a nurse in Italy. They raised apprehensions about the health of my husband, who had undergone a bypass surgery four months ago. They told us that Covid-19 is dangerous for old and sick persons,” said the 54-year-old woman.Her husband, who is around 60, is a retired Navy officer. “We can’t ask them (nurses) to move out all of a sudden. They have been staying here for over one-and-a half years,” she added.Meanwhile, Indira P G, nursing officer, MCH, said that the nursing staff are under constant stress and they not only need the support of their families but also the society. “The society should realise what would be the world like if none of the nurses wanted to work in such situations,” she said.District collector P K Sudheer Babu said necessary action has been taken to mitigate the plight of the nurses. “The MCH authorities have arranged a temporary stay for them,” he said.

Kovelamudi Ravindra, a TDP functionary, moved the high court alleging that the SEC was not taking any action even after they submitted video evidence.

Arguing on behalf of Ravindra, senior counsel P Veera Reddy told the court that the ruling party members were influencing the voters by distributing sarees at Tadipatri in Anantapur district.

In Chittoor district, village volunteers are involved in the election campaign. Though complaints were lodged in both the incidents along with photos and videos on March 8 and 9, no action was initiated, he said.

The counsel for the SEC told the court that the commission has asked for reports from district collectors to initiate necessary action. Expressing displeasure over the reply, the high court asked why the has the election commission failed to get report from the collectors without delay.

The high court observed that the conducting elections in a free and fair manner was the primary duty of the election commission and it has failed to act accordingly even after the high court issued orders recently in other matter.

The HC asked why the elections were being conducted in very short span of time whereas earlier it was told to the court that 40 days were required to complete the process.

As the counsel for the SEC told the court that the fixing the schedule was in the ambit of the state government, Veera Reddy said that the state government was conducting elections in a hurry without giving ample time. While five days should be given to file nominations, only three was given this time, he said.

The HC asked the election commission to file the action taken report by Monday when the next hearing would take place.

The high court also directed the high court registrar to send the copy of the order issued in the matter of removing party colours on government buildings to the central election commission so as to monitor the functioning of the state election commission.

It is learnt that the party high command has not given the green signal as of now to Priyanka’s candidature but it is expected that party general secretary Vijayasai Reddy is likely to convince chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy.

Priyanka has been involved in social service for the last few years. She campaigned for her father during the Lok Sabha election in 2014 in Anakapalle. She was also involved in the campaign when he fought assembly polls from Bheemili in 2019.

Mangaluru: On August 9, 2019, when city police commissioner P S Harsha took charge, he backed the Mangaluru city police to be receptive to the people’s policing needs and to be people-friendly. Cut to the December 19 anti-CAA/NRC protest violence that left two dead in alleged police firing, and the city police has perceivably dragged itself into a deep hole and has gone into a shell .

This is evident from the fact that the Friday phone- in programme, where the public get an opportunity to raise their grievances with the top cop, has been put on hold for the time being.

The last phone-in programme was held on November 29, 2019. Former city police commissioner M Chandra Sekhar, along with the then DCP (crime and traffic) Dr Sanjeev M Patil had launched this programme so that people could directly interact with the cops.

Former police chief T R Suresh was part of the 100th Mangaluru city police phone-in programme.

The hour-long programme used to register an average of 15 calls that used to be answered in the presence of senior officers including traffic police personnel.

“Among issues raised by the public, civic issues used to outnumber policing ones. However, there were callers who would reach out to the department, and we have been able to solve several issues related to traffic. The programme has been put on hold for the time being,” a senior officer said.

Another major initiative launched by city police commissioner Harsha was ‘MyBeat, My Pride’, an upgraded beat system. Through this system, the commissioner would literally walk the beat with the designated beat constable to get a first-hand feel of people’s problems. As part of this, several WhatsApp groups were created. However, after the December 19 violence, several members have exited from the group and most groups have not been active. Not much information is being sent out by the police on the groups.

An officer said, “The department is busy with court and other related work. The commissioner appeared before the magistrate on Thursday, for the inquiry into the firing. Similarly, the top cop has to appear before the high court and national and state human rights commission.” The city police commissioner submitted a nearly 21-page written statement, with 936 supportive documents and evidence.

189,['14/03/2020'],IISER scientists bag Rs 11cr govt funding for research on quantum computing,"Thiruvananthapuram: Researchers from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Thiruvananthapuram, led by Dr Madhu Thalakulam and Dr Anil Shaji have jointly been awarded a research grant of Rs 11.38 crore under the Quantum Enabled Science and Technology (QuEST) programme.

QuEST is an initiative of the department of science and technology, government of India.

The grant is for developing a quantum computer and associated technologies as part of the overall mission of QuEST to jump-start research and development activities in quantum technologies in India.

The group led by Dr Madhu Thalakulam will focus on the design and realization of a quantum information processor based on electron-spins in silicon quantum dots.

Dr Anil Shaji’s group will focus on the theoretical aspects related this project.

“The computers we see today utilize principles of classical physics which is entirely based on the deterministic nature of the physical systems & macroscopic world. Quantum computers are radically different units altogether. The working principles are quantum superposition, particle-wave dual nature of physical systems. The basic units in a classical computer is a BIT. Information, written in the binary language, can be stored and manipulated on arrays of billions of BITS in a modern microprocessor. In quantum computing, the analogous basic unit is a Qubit (quantum-BIT) which can exist not only in the ON and the OFF state but in an infinity of states ‘in-between’ where it is both ON and OFF at the same time due to quantum superposition. Computers made with these Qubits come with enormous powers for various jobs. In a recent experiment in the quantum computer that Google built with 53 Qubits, a computational problem that is estimated to take 10,000 years to solve if it is run on the fastest supercomputer on earth, was solved within a matter of minutes,” Madhu said.

Quantum computing and quantum technologies can bring ground breaking changes in fields starting from everyday banking business to sensitive technologies in the health and medical fields and defence applications.

“For example, photosynthesis, the process by which plants prepare food from carbon dioxide and water using sunlight, is an intricate quantum mechanical process involving quantum entanglement and superimposition between the states of the light and the molecules involved in the process. Extraction of this ‘recipe’ is an unsolvable problem with today’s best computers. Quantum computers come with the potential to understand this process and this may lead to eliminate hunger in the world,” said Anil Shaji.

Until now as a country India has no notable footprint in the field of quantum technologies and lag by many years behind most of the developed countries.

Recently the Union government has identified this gap and declared the development of quantum-enabled technologies and quantum information processing machines as a priority area of research and the groups at IISER has been identified as one among the few groups in the country to carry out this research.

Nobody has to be scared,” said the 32-year-old coronavirus patient who returned from Italy and is under isolation at Medical College Hospital. While a Pathanamthitta family triggered a statewide scare by skipping screening, this man showed high levels of awareness right from the time of arrival, setting an example for all those returning from foreign countries.

“I had slight cough when I arrived. I was willing to go into isolation. The medical team told me to go on 14 days’ home isolation and asked me to report in case of any signs of infection,’’ he said, speaking to TOI by phone.

He had voluntarily reported at the screening centre and demanded that he be isolated. He then took a taxi to his house at Vellanadu after being directed for home isolation. Even before his arrival, he had asked his wife, his daughter and son to shift to their house in Idukki. He didn’t even get into direct contact with his father who stays in the house nearby. His father passed food through the window.

When he felt some discomfort, he rang up the Disha helpline, got in touch with the local ward member and proceeded to MCH alone in an ambulance. After giving samples, he again expressed willingness to be placed in isolation. From MCH, he minimized risk of public contact and didn’t take a bus. Instead took an auto rickshaw to his house, which is more than 20km away.

On the way he stopped at a wayside shop and bought a bottle of juice and made sure that he didn’t drink anything from the shop. He even made sure that he made his father give the fare to the auto driver to avoid any kind of contact with the driver.

“I was fully aware of steps to stay out of public contact and tried my best to comply with measures,’’ he said. According to him, the cough persists, though temperature is now normal and there is no fatigue. He is having trouble getting sleep at night and is on complete bed rest throughout the day.

Collector K Gopalakrishnan was all praise for the patient. “We would like to thank him, he showed extreme caution and distanced himself from all possible contacts. That is exemplary behaviour,” said Gopalakrishnan.

Vellanadu panchayat committee said that his responsible behaviour saved a village and many people from unnecessary scare. “He rang me up at 4am and told me about the need to be isolated. That was really commendable of him. We are able to do away with fear factor because of his caution,” says Vellanad Sreekandan, chairman, health standing committee, Vellanadu panchayat.

He has been settled on the border of Germany-Austria-Italy for the past nine years. “I am getting good care here, doctors and nurses check on me twice a day. I talk to my family over phone. I have asked for something to read and they said they will make it available soon,’’ he said. His brother, who returned from Italy, has been isolated at MCH.

Later traced to her campus and taken to the directorate of public health, she was let off with a ‘stern’ warning.The woman, Sujitha, later told TOI, “I was just playing with my friends. I did not realise the ramifications. Please don’t take this seriously.” She told officials that her friends, who were in a car tailing the bus, dared her to say she was Covid-positive and stop the bus.On Friday afternoon, the state nodal officer and joint director of public health received a call from a man saying his co-passengers on a bus had announced that she tested positive for Covid-19 three days ago. When she coughed, some passengers screamed, some called the state helpline and a few others called the state police control room. “As soon as we got the call we asked the bus driver and conductor to wait on the road,” said Dr Sampath P, joint director of public health (epidemic control). “He halted the bus near Melmaruvathur.”Eyewitnesses told police that Sujitha was on phone with her friends throughout the journey, and when the bus crossed Perungalathur, she asked the driver to stop the vehicle. When he refused, her friends, who were following the bus, challenged her to play the prank. “That’s when she announced that she was infected. During inquiry she told us that the bus ride and the lie were all part of the game they were playing. She was asked to dare,” the official said.A team of health department officials, including the deputy director of public health from Chengalpet and a medical team from Acharapakkam primary health centre, rushed to the spot. By then Sujitha had got into her friend’s car and left. The officials disinfected the bus, offered passengers hand sanitisers and counselled them.Later, police and state health officials took the address and contact details she had given to the transport company while booking the ticket. “We asked her to come to the DMS office for inquiry. When she refused, we told her we would have to initiate criminal action against her,” said another senior health official.Meanwhile, a team of officials were at the IIT because they received a call that one of the visiting professors staying on campus had symptoms of Covid-19. “We went there but realised it was not true,” a senior official said. By around 5pm, Sujitha appeared before the directorate and tendered an unconditional apology.

The minister stressed on timely completion of all works, adding that facilities like underground cabling, natural gas pipeline, water supply and sewer lines must be completed by June, so that there is adequate time for reconstruction of roads damaged in the process.

“Wherever the roads are damaged, an estimate of repair or fresh construction work should be prepared. The amount of repairs should be charged from the agency concerned. If the agency fails to do the repair works, it will be made to pay another agency to do it,” the minister said, adding that “locals should not be made to suffer because of uneven roads.”

IPDS executive engineer (EE) Pawan Singh said that underground cable work in the city will be finished by June, ahead of the November deadline.

“The completion of cable laying is scheduled for November but 80 per cent work has already been done. The service connection process, 20 per cent of which has been completed too, is also going steady,” Singh said. According to Amrit Yojna EE Sanjai Singh, 27 km of laying sewer lines has been completed. “The work largely involves replacement of old lines and laying a few new ones,” Singh said. “We have to change 40-km-long PVC water supply lines into ductile iron (DI) pipelines. 85 per cent work has been done. The project, which was to be completed in March 2021, will be completed by June this year,” he added.

A man sent back home by the doctors after collecting swab samples for testing was later tested positive for Covid-19.This person had come to the medical college hospital from the outskirts of the city in an ambulance since he had fever and throat pain. But after taking the samples, the MCH authorities informed him that ambulance was not available to take him back and was asked to return on his own. It is learned that he had informed the hospital authorities of his willingness to undergo isolation but the hospital staff did not accept that.He returned in an autorikshaw to his house, which is around 20km from the hospital, and en route he visited a medical shop too. Now, the autorickshaw driver and the medical store staff have been quarantined.The man reached Thiruvananthapuram airport on Wednesday morning by QR503 flight of Qatar Airways from Doha. He had mentioned at the airport that he was coming from Italy and went to Munich before catching the flight from Doha.As the man had no symptoms, he was asked to go for home quarantine. But he developed fever symptoms the very next day (Thursday) and immediately contacted the health helpline. The emergency wing sent an ambulance to shift him to the hospital. At MCH, the doctors sent him back after collecting the swab samples.“It is true that he was sent back. He was not given an ambulance since it was not readily available there.

198,['14/03/2020'],MP Kateel raises cancelled trains issue in Parliament,"Mangaluru: A move by Indian Railways to cancel the Bengaluru City-Karwar express (4 days in a week, 16513/14 via Kunigal-Hassan route) and Bengaluru-Karwar tri-weekly express (16523/24 via Mysuru-Hassan route) echoed in the Lok Sabha on Friday. Raising this issue was Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel , who was participating in a debate on demands for grants for the ministry of railways for 2020-21.

Nalin expressed his profound gratitude to the ministry for introducing a new train service between Yeshwantpur and Karwar (train 16595/16596).

This new train service will help people of coastal Karnataka immensely, as its departure and arrival timings are convenient for them. At the same time, Nalin drew the attention of the ministry, through the speaker, about the public demand in wake of cancellation of above-mentioned trains.

“The railway administration, while introducing the above mentioned train, had cancelled the existing two trains,” Nalin said.

These train services between Karwar, Mangaluru and Bengaluru were highly patronised since their inception.

Besides, this train was serving as a convenient commuter train between Karwar and Mangaluru, helping the working class, students and traders of the region. It was also serving as the connecting train for many outgoing trains at Mangaluru Central.

Cancelled trains were used by people since 8 yrs

“The cancelled trains were catering to the needs of the public of the region since the last 8 years. Withdrawing this popular train’s service at this juncture is not at all reasonable, especially when large numbers of passengers were using the train service. This decision has deprived the public of convenient connectivity between Karwar and Mangaluru in the morning and evening,” the MP said in his written submission in the debate.

He exhorted the ministry to review the decision of cancellation of the above two trains, and restore service of the same, duly maintaining connectivity via Mangaluru Central, in the interest of the people of the region.

Activists had alleged that the ministry took the decision by bypassing its own cancellation policy at the behest of KRCL, which maintained that the new train will affect goods traffic and result in revenue loss, while putting forth its case seeking cancellation of existing trains.

But there are many who are thronging the government hospitals and insist on testing.Government doctors said that around 25% of the visitors who approach the OP at the isolation wards in government hospitals are those who haven’t travelled abroad or those who aren’t primary or secondary contacts of Covid-19 patients. When doctors on duty try to explain the government guidelines on testing, they insist that it is their right to get tested.“Ordinary people are swarming hospitals claiming that they have corona. Just like walking into a lab for diabetes test, they walk into the isolation ward’s OP demanding Covid-19 test. They don’t need to rush to the hospital on suspicion but they can call the Disha helpline and take guidance,” said Dr Amar Fettle, state nodal officer (public emergency), currently in charge of anti-Covid-19 effort in the state.He said that people needn’t go to the hospital if they have common cold. Only those who have returned from abroad or are primary or secondary contacts of Covid-19 patients should go to the hospital. “If too many people come, there are chances of skipping genuine coronavirus cases. Too much of unwanted rush would also result in lapses despite the best efforts of the doctors. This is also essential to minimise community spread,” said Dr Fettle.The state government had revised guidelines for testing, quarantine, hospital admission and discharge for Covid-19 on March 12 and said, “Testing is not going to change either the clinical course or management of the patient with mild symptoms”.“Despite our best efforts, every day we have five to six ‘normal’ persons walking in to each hospital claiming that they suspect to have Covid-19.

BHOPAL: Chief minister Kamal Nath met Governor Lalji Tandon on Friday morning and demanded that Congress MLAs “imprisoned in Bengaluru” be freed. Accusing BJP of plotting an “unethical and illegal” conspiracy, Nath told reporters later that politics “has been infected by coronavirus”.At 11am on Friday, the CM’s convoy rolled into the Raj Bhavan compound, with him waving the victory sign to waiting mediapersons. During the hour-long meeting, Nath informed Tandon of the ongoing political upheaval in the state and submitted a memorandum, alleging “horse-trading of MLAs by BJP”.After leaving Raj Bhavan, CM Nath stepped out of his car to speak to mediapersons. Looking confident, he said: “I have met the Governor and greeted him on Holi. I gave him a letter on how Congress MLAs have been imprisoned, and demanded that all the legislators held captive in Bengaluru be freed and brought back to the state. The entire country has seen how Congress MLAs are being held hostage.” Asked about a possible floor test in the assembly, the CM said, “Floor test can be done after Governor’s address and budget. But that is only possible when MLAs are independent. You hold 22 MLAs captive and then ask for floor test, that is wrong. Let these MLAs come before the media and talk.”Replying to a question on spread of Coronavirus, CM Nath said, “Coronavirus is right now in the political situation here. politics “has been infected by Coronavirus.”In his letter to the Governor, the CM writes, “Our commitment to democratic process is unwavering. As a responsible leader of Indian National Congress, I invite and would welcome a floor test of my government in the forthcoming session of Madhya Pradesh assembly, already notified from 16th March 2020, on a date fixed by the Speaker. This is the minimum a Constitutional authority can offer to address the ongoing turmoil.”The CM leveled serious allegations at BJP. “I’m constrained to point out the immoral, unethical and illegal acts of BJP in Madhya Pradesh. In the first attempt, on 3rd/4th March 2020, the midnight drama leading to whisking away MLAs to Bangaluru is in public domain. Congress leaders foiled BJP’s attempt to keep in captivity the MLAs by using both allurement and force,” he wrote.“After the failure of the first attempt, BJP on 8th March 2020 arranged three chartered aircrafts to whisk away 19 MLAs of Congress to Bengaluru. Since then, these 19 MLAs, six of whom are cabinet ministers, are incommunicado in a resort arranged by BJP. Nobody is allowed access and /or any sort of communication with the 19 captive MLAs,” he has alleged.The CM expressed shock that senior leaders of BJP went to the Speaker’s residence and submitted resignations of the 19 MLAs. “This demonstrates the complicity of BJP leaders in the entire conspiracy and illegal action. It raises questions of Constitutional propriety and legislative procedure and transparency,” Nath points out.The CM also mentioned Thursday’s incident in Bengaluru when cabinet ministers Jitu Patwari and Lakhan Singh Yadav and Narayan Choudhary, father of an MLA Manoj Choudhary, were “manhandled” and arrested by police. Congress says Manoj wanted to return to Bhopal. “In these disturbing circumstances, the very edifice of democracy is in danger. Trust of a transparent democratic process seems lost.

The price of yellow metal stood at Rs 43,100 per 10 gram on Friday in the Ahmedabad market, showing a sharp fall of Rs 1,400 in just a day. Gold prices plunged against Thursday’s Rs 44,500 per 10 gram due to heavy profit-booking, said analysts

“Many investors have begun selling gold, in lieu of better returns. Moreover, heavy profit-booking of gold led to a significant fall in international price of gold which settled at $1,550 per ounce. As a result, the price in local markets fell,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA).

Gold prices remained high during the initial part of the week, as international gold prices soared. According to analysts, concerns over impact of COVID-19 outbreak in various parts of the world on global trade and economy, caused gold prices to increase significantly in the international market.

This coupled with the Indian rupee slumping against the US dollar past the Rs 73 mark caused gold prices to go up in Indian market.

202,['14/03/2020'],Death of Unnao rape survivor’s dad: Sengar gets 10-yr term,"NEW DELHI: Expelled BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar and six others were on Friday sentenced to 10 years in prison on the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder of the father of the Unnao rape survivor.

District judge Dharmesh Sharma compensated the deceased’s family with an award of Rs 10 lakh, to be paid by Sengar and his brother Atul, who is a co-convict in the case.

The court also directed the UP government to initiate disciplinary action against the doctors whose “gross negligence” that led to the death of the father. “The deceased was the sole bread winner of his family, comprising his wife, four daughters — two of whom are minors and a minor son. They have been uprooted from their native place and it would be difficult for them to go back,” the court said.

Sengar and his brother were consequently directed to pay Rs 10 lakh compensation to the wife and children of the deceased.

Apart from these two, the court sentenced Makhi police station in-charge Ashok Singh Bhadauria, sub-inspector K P Singh, and Vineet Mishra, Birendra Singh and Shashi Pratap Singh to 10 years in jail.

The 10-year jail term awarded under Section 304 (culpable homicide) Part (ii) (if act is done with knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, etc.), is the maximum among all punishments for the offences the convicts had committed. The CBI had argued for a maximum punishment for the convict a day ago.

In its conviction order, the court highlighted that the convicts demonstrated their “political and muscle power” in order to criminally intimidate the deceased and his family and deter them from pursuing the sexual assault case against 0Sengar.

While framing charges in August last year, the court had viewed the death as a “part of a larger conspiracy to deter, silence and prevent the father from pursuing the complaint” in the rape case of his daughter in 2017.

The convicted policemen in the culpable homicide case were stated to be “seasoned police officials”, who provided “protective police cover” to the convicts. “They disobeyed the direction of law to protect the life and liberty of the victim,” the court said. Four persons, including a UP police constable, were acquitted for want of evidence.

Among the various IPC charges, the accused will face punishment under Sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and Section 120B (criminal conspiracy).

“Bhadauria and K P Singh fabricated false evidence against the victim... causing him grievous hurt,” the court said. It came on record that the father was brutally assaulted and at the same charges of assault, criminal intimidation and possession of fire arms were slapped against him owing to a conspiracy on the part of the convicts. Four others — Shailendra Singh, Ram Sharan Sinigh, Sharadveer Singh and UP police constable Amir Khan — were given benefit of doubt and acquitted of all charges.

In December, 2019, Sengar was sentenced to life imprisonment till the remainder of his natural life and slapped Rs 25 lakh fine for raping a minor from Unnao in 2017. While awarding the jail term, the court observed that the survivor and her family had been “uprooted from their native village” and couldn’t even “dream of returning to their native place and live peacefully ever after”.

203,['14/03/2020'],Govt to disburse salaries of teachers,"Thiruvananthapuram: The government has decided to disburse the salaries for the teachers of single-teacher schools in the state that has been pending for months now.

The decision was taken at the discussion between the Alternative School Teachers’ Association (ASTA) and education minister C Raveendranath in the presence of former chief minister Oommen Chandy.

The issue was taken up by ASTA after teachers of single-teacher schools launched a relay protest after their salaries stood pending without disbursal for months.

On the basis of the discussion, the minister entrusted secretary (general education) A Shajahan to prepare the proceedings for disbursal of their salaries and forward it to the concerned education department offices.

Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac also agreed to consider providing wages to such teachers every month without fail.

The education minister also assured them that no teacher will lose his/her job and the government will consider taking the multi-grade learning centres as a cluster for administrative convenience.

It was also assured that the issues of teachers above 50 years of age will be leniently considered while preparing the report on taking decision about the issues of the teachers of single-teacher schools.

TOI had earlier reported about the plight of K R Ushakumari, the only teacher of a tribal school in Amboori in the hilly areas of the capital district. She was part of the protest being undertaken by the teachers of single-teacher schools.

Talking to TOI, she had explained how their wages were not given by the government for the last five months, and their demand for permanent posting as teacher was not considered by the government, despite putting in more than 20 years of service. After she launched an indefinite protest, two other teachers of such schools – Ajitha of Sholayur and Tinu of Marayur- also had launched similar protests.

204,['14/03/2020'],3 of a family found dead in house,"Thiruvananthapuram: A three-member family was found dead in their rented house at Kulathoor near Kazhakootam on Friday afternoon under suspicious circumstances. The deceased include a man, his wife and their son. Police suspect that the man might have murdered the wife and son and then committed suicide .

Kazhakkoottam police have registered a case and launched a probe. Suresh, 35, of Kanyakulangara near Vembayam, his wife Sindhu, 30, of Kulathoor and their son, Sharon, 9, are the deceased. They were living in a rented house located next to Sindhu’s ancestral home near Sri Narayana Library at Kulathoor.

Santhosh was an expatriate who had been working in a Gulf country for the past several years. It was only 20 days ago he returned home. Sindhu was working in a private firm at Muttada in the city for the past three months. Before that she used to work as a nursing assistant at a private clinic at Kulathoor.

Police suspect that Suresh strangulated the wife and son on Thursday night and then committed suicide by hanging on Friday morning. Sindhu’s body was lying in the kitchen while Sharon’s body was lying on the bed in the bedroom. Suresh was found hanging from the ceiling in the same room.

“We suspect that he committed both murders in the previous night and waited till morning to hang himself,” said Kazhakkoottam sub-inspector A Santhosh Kumar. If the bodies of Sindhu and Sharon were cold when found, Suresh’s body was still warm.

It appeared that Sindhu was strangulated from behind while she was doing the dishes in the kitchen sink. There were leftovers of previous night’s dinner on the kitchen floor and as a result, her body was infested with ants. It is also suspected that Suresh might have strangulated Sharon in his sleep.

The bodies were found by Sindhu’s mother on Friday afternoon.

According to police, Suresh had sent a WhatsApp message to his brother-in-law (Sindhu’s elder sister’s husband) requesting him to visit him at his house at 8am as he wanted to discuss something serious. But the brother-in-law, who lives at Kanyakulangara, saw the message only after 8am. Since then he tried to reach Suresh and Sindhu on phone several times but in vain. Following this, he called Sindhu’s mother and asked her to go and check the family. It was then the bodies were found.

The bodies were shifted to the mortuary after inquest. During the inquest, police found strangulation marks around the necks of Sindhu and Sharon. The postmortem will be conducted on Saturday.

New dates will be finalized later,” He went on to say: “Because of the current coronavirus situation and the recent central government advisory, we advise citizens to avoid organizing large gatherings.”Patel said that the state government is taking all necessary steps to avoid the spread of the virus as positive cases are reported from across India, including the neigbhouring Maharashtra.When questioned whether Gujarat will follow Delhi and Maharashtra in restricting the functioning of schools and theatres and in regulating crowds, Patel said that no such step has been taken because not a single positive case has been registered in Gujarat. “There is no need for such drastic steps yet. We are strictly following the Government of India’s directives to control the spread of the virus,” he said.Modi was to visit the Statue of Unity to inaugurate a clutch of new tourist attractions and also visit Ahmedabad to inaugurate the 800-bed UN Mehta Institute of Cardiology and Research Centre on the Civil Hospital campus.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74621122,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-376761,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amid-virus-war-viral-holiday-rumour/articleshow/74619589.cms

Consequently, there’s a shortage of branded sanitizers and alcohol-based hand rubs on the shelves.According to estimates by Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists Association (FGSCDA) against 10,000 units sold on a daily basis across Gujarat, the current demand is as high as 1 lakh units a day.When TOI independently checked with four chemists in different parts of Ahmedabad, none had branded hand-sanitizers available. “We just have a single brand of sanitizers. We used to keep other brands, but supplies are low as the stock is limited,” said the manager of a chain of medical stores near Panjrapole Crossroads.Yet another medical store owner in Prahladnagar claimed he had run out of stock completely. “People are asking for alcohol-based hand-rubs that have 60% or more alcohol content and those are not easily available. We have completely exhausted stocks and have placed order for sanitizers, but are not sure when they will be available,” said Manish Patel, a chemist.Industry sources also said that amid short supply and high demand, hand sanitizers are being sold in the black maret at high rates.“We have issued an advisory to all our members to not hoard stocks of hand sanitizers and masks which are currently in high demand, just to sell them at a higher price,” said Alpesh Patel, president, FGSCDA.A similar advisory was also issued by Gujarat Food and Drug Control Administration (FDCA).",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74621159,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-486299,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/neat-hit-demand-for-branded-hand-sanitizers-spikes-10-fold/articleshow/74619569.cms
208,['14/03/2020'],"Quid pro quo case filed at behest of TDP, Congress: Andhra Pradesh CM","HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy on Friday told the CBI court in Hyderabad that the quid pro quo case filed against him could be described as the sum total of the heartburn of TDP and Congress on one side and the ignorance of CBI investigators on the other.Putting forward Jagan’s case for the first time ever since the case was filed in 2011, senior counsel S Niranjan Reddy briefed the court that Jagan did no wrong in the case. “In fact, the quid pro quo case itself was filed at the behest of TDP and Congress which jointly went to the high court,” he said, terming the charges politically motivated.The Congress joined the TDP to suppress Jagan ever since he came out of Congress after his father YS Rajasekhara Reddy’s demise, the senior counsel said, while urging the court to intervene in the matter and discharge Jagan from the case, which he said will not stand any test and parameters laid down by the Supreme Court even with respect to framing of charges.Niranjan presented his arguments on the chargesheet filed against Jagathi publications, the publisher of Sakshi, a Telugu daily. He said that the CBI’s chargesheet is devoid of merit and is full of contradictions. “While the CBI claims that the projections made by Jagan to the investors about the future prospects of Jagathi were unrealistic, all projections on circulation figures were achieved by Sakshi on the first day of its launch,” he said, adding that the advertising rates were market-based and the CBI does not say that it is incorrect. Citing the case of the Jio experiment, he explained that the competitors feared Sakshi’s entry and slashed their prices, and hence, Sakshi could not achieve the estimated profits.Speaking about the allegations of the CBI that share premium paid by investors were nothing but bribes paid by investors to Jagan for the benefits they reaped from the state headed by his father, Niranjan said that the allegations were unfounded. Of the total Rs 1,246 crore invested in Jagathi, over Rs 844 crore (more than 2/3rd) were invested six months after the demise of YSR. Shares were purchased due to the record circulation figures achieved by Sakshi newspaper in a short span of time, he explained.The CBI failed to consider the fact that Jagan had been into various businesses even before his father was elected chief minister and the investments were made considering the potential of the businesses headed by him, the senior counsel said. Other allegations made by the CBI on Jagathi shares were made on account of fundamental misconceptions the probe agency has about the company law, he said, adding that they were contrary to the provisions of Companies Act, 1956.“The allegation that Jagan invited outsiders to invest in Jagathi in contravention of Section 3(1) (iii)(c) of Companies Act, 1956 and that this amounts to public offer is legally incorrect. The chargesheet betrays a total lack of knowledge of company law by the investigating officer,” Niranjan said. All the investors had, in fact, gained on account of their investment in Jagathi, he said, and added that investments, even in large companies, would become beneficial only after longer gaps. “Allegations that issuance of shares was contrary to Articles of Association (AoA) are in fact contrary to the actual facts and were issued without reading the articles. It anyways does not amount to a commission of offence since such a contravention only amounts to breach of contract (having only a civil remedy) since AoA is merely a contract between the company and its investors,” Jagan’s counsel said.Ridiculing the suggestion made by CBI that Jagathi should have bought back shares to make good the loss caused to the investors, he said the suggestion is contrary to Companies Act since the Act prohibits buying back of allotted shares by a company. The chargesheet is entirely based on the statements of 3 witnesses-cum-investors and these statements do not make a strong argument for the case, he said. “Since none of them had lodged any complaint despite claiming to have been victims of the alleged crime, no reliance could be placed on them,” he said.Niranjan said that the CBI does not claim that the projections of Deloitte report, alleged to have been relied upon by the witnesses before making investments, are incorrect.“The CBI, without method considered by Deloitte, makes vague assertions that the valuation figures of Deloitte are exaggerated,” he said, urging the court to discharge Jagan.",vijayawada,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74624661,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-191075,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/quid-pro-quo-case-filed-at-behest-of-tdp-cong-jagan/articleshow/74619568.cms

Secunderabad: To ensure reelection in the ensuing Cantonment Board elections, the SCB ward members have swung into action for completing the pending key projects. The ward members have six months for the work after the extension given by ministry of defence.

Construction has started on projects, including laying sewer trunk beside the century-old Ramannakunta Lake at Bowenpally, which was getting delayed for three years. The trunk is being laid to prevent sewage from entering the lake. The project had earlier seen hurdles like delay in persmission from defence authorities, fund crunch and the state government sanctioning the funds late.

“Completion of Ramannakunta project is my dream. I have faced numerous hurdles to get financial support and work has finally started on ground. Once the main sewer trunk has been laid, as many as six residential colonies abutting the lake would get rid of the stink and mosquito menace permanently,” ward no-VI member Pandu Yadav told TOI.

In ward no-VIII, there are two major projects including providing the Bollarum General Hospital with adequate services and reviving a major community hall.

“Though the general hospital was upgraded with 30 beds, patients are not coming here due to lack of medical services. In fact, the state government had earlier given assurance to provide enough medical staff and ensure better medical services, but the promise could not be materialised,” said Loknatham.

The revivial of the community hall will start soon and completed within six months, said Lokanatham.

A key project at Ward No-VII is shifting of a dump yard from premises of Mahatma Gandhi Community Hall at Trimulgherry.

“Though I have raised the concern several times during board meetings, the SCB officials have failed to shift the dump yard. However, the issue came to light recently when the DG, defence estates, Delhi, Deepa Bajwa visited SCB. She gave assurance to shift the dumping yard to some other defence land,” said Bhagya Shree.

The single bench of Justice Manoj Kumar Tiwari had on January 8 given the institute eight weeks to refund the money that they had charged from its students of Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medical Sciences (BAMS) after a Government Order (GO) increased the fee from Rs 80,000 to Rs 2.15 lakh.

However, on Friday the court was informed that the institute is yet to refund the money. Speaking to TOI, Vinod Tiwari, the lawyer appearing for petitioner said that the court has given the principal, DN Sharma, time till March 24 to show cause why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against him. “We informed the court that despite the court’s order of refunding the money within eight weeks, the students are yet to receive even a penny. The court has now issued a show cause notice to the principal and if he fails to respond, charges will be framed against him,” Tiwari said.

SK Tijarawala, a spokesman for Patanjali, told TOI that they will go through the HC order and take a decision on it accordingly. “We are yet to receive the order. However, we respect the court and as soon as we get the order we will go through it and file our response accordingly,” he said.

213,['14/03/2020'],Telehealth services bridge critical gap in medical sector,"Hyderabad: Telehealth— the technology to deliver virtual healthcare services to patients outside clinics and hospitals and in remote locations — has the potential to transform the future of healthcare.

Recently, through telehealth facilities, a Hyderabad-based doctor helped diagnose a 27-year-old man living in a village in AP with thyroid cancer. The absence of adequate checking in remote areas has led to several players offering telehealth services.

Ramulu (name changed) reported to an Apollo primary healthcare centre, complaining of pain in the neck with a small mass on the right side. At the telemedicine-enabled primary healthcare centre, the medical officer recommended tests, but was also in touch with specialists. In doing so, a diagnosis was arrived at early and the patient was treated.

City-based Pooja Singh, 54, has also reaped the benefits of telemedicine. “Being a diabetic, I need to monitor my blood sugar and electrolyte levels on a weekly basis. It used to be tough for me to go to hospitals every week. But that has changed now. I go to Tattvan’s e-clinic opened in Ramky Discovery City,” she said. The e-clinic seeks to provide comprehensive healthcare solutions to residents of the community.

Speaking about the need for expansion of telehealth facilities, Vikram Thaploo, CEO, Apollo TeleHealth, said, “A major problem with Indian healthcare system is its inability to diagnose serious diseases on time. Telehealth can fill the accessibility gap.” Tattvan’s CEO Ayush Mishra said, “Many physicians don’t practice in Hyderabad but can treat residents through our e-clinic.”

Within the telehealth space is CallHealth Services, which provides virtual e-consultations with doctors through audio and video mediums. “Our web and app platforms integrate all constituents within the ecosystem,” said Sony Agarwal, who works with the firm.

KOLHAPUR: Kolhapur airport which is connected to four international airports — Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Tirupati — has witnessed a drop in international travellers , said airport director Kamal Kumar Kataria amid the ongoing coronavirus situation.

He said that the number of travellers coming to Kolhapur from the said cities has dropped tremendously. “We are keeping a record of travellers who have foreign travel history and so far only two people have been named in the database,” he said.

“The creation of database is in accordance with the instructions from higher authorities so as to trace the travellers in case the need arises,” he said.

According to Kataria, the number of domestic passengers too is dwindling, but the impact is much lesser as compared to international travel.

On the safety front, the Kolhapur airport is equipped with hand sanitizers and frequent cleaning is on agenda, he added.

“Hand sanitizers are available in ample quantity in the frequently visited places,” he said.

From Kolhapur airport, flights to the Bengaluru, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Tirupati are operated almost every day by Air Alliance, Indigo, and TruJet.

Besides, a lot of developmental works, including the work of the air traffic control tower, runway extension, and new terminal building, among several others, is being carried out at the airport.

The airport is located in the Ujalaiwadi neighbourhood, around 9 km from the main city.

CHENNAI: Arrest drunk drivers, seize their vehicles and cancel their driving licences — this is the Madras high court’s prescription to tackle the menace in Tamil Nadu. The court has also directed the authorities to disqualify such offenders from holding a driving licence.

Categorically blaming the government’s retail liquor vending policy for drunk driving and deaths/injuries caused by it, a division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice Abdul Quddhose said, “Easy accessibility and availability of alcohol made by government is the main reason for increase in crimes in society. Many precious lives are lost, and many people are injured and crippled due to drunken driving.”

Heinous crimes are committed while drunk. Health of citizens consuming liquor is gradually affected violating fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution making it a dangerous social problem. Women and children are worst sufferers when men become drunkards, the high court bench added.

Pointing out that about 70 lakh of the 6.8 core population in Tamil Nadu consume alcohol daily, the court said 6,500 Tasmac shops catered to consumers, earning 35% of state’s income.

“Mostly the consumers are labourers, farmers, lower middle and lower strata people. Most of the daily wagers are stated to be spending 50% or more of their earnings on liquor, driving their families to abject poverty,” the judges said. The bench then directed the authorities to arrest drunk drivers under Section 202 of the Motor Vehicles Act and subject them to breathalyser test under Section 203 for alcohol detection as per Section 185.

This apart, the court also directed the authorities to invoke Section 279 (rash driving) of the IPC for the offence of drunken driving in addition to Section 185 of Motor Vehicles Act. For rash driving, a person can be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.

As a preventive measure, the court has directed the central government to consider directing automobile manufacturers to install ‘Alcohol Sensing Ignition Interlocking’ in vehicles. Such device would enable a person to start a vehicle only if they breath clean.

Police have appealed to the traders’ association to sponsor some CCTV cameras so that important places and roads would be brought under surveillance.

“Our road safety fund is not enough to get the required number of CCTV cameras. Next, we will concentrate in Kotagiri, Coonoor and Gudalur,” Sasi Mohan said.

Even the traders who have their own CCTV cameras have been asked to form groups to get suggestions from police on the location of cameras to benefit the public.

The schools said that they are making sure that high standards of hygiene are maintained and students are not allowed to leave the campus.

Piyush Malviya, director of public affairs at The Doon School, said, “In boarding schools, it’s best that we quarantine ourselves. So we have made a ‘No-Entry and No-Exit’ rule. Within the campus, we have placed sanitizers throughout the place. We have been talking to the students and staff and everybody is being apprised of the situation from time to time. They are also being informed about the various preventive measures against the virus. We have also cancelled all kinds of outings and students can’t leave the campus. We are not asking the parents to come here and take their children as the situation is well under control.”

The Welham Boys’ School has also decided not to allow any visitors and make sure that the students are not leaving the campus. M Kandpal, vice-principal of the school, said, “Board exams are going on and as per the government directive, we will continue with them. We are yet to take a call on students of the classes that are not appearing for board exams. The students who are appearing for their boards can’t leave the campus until exams are over.”

Meanwhile, authorities of many schools have appealed to the education department to let them conduct home examinations (exams of non-board classes such as classes VIII, IX and XI). They claim that most of the home exams will conclude by next week.

Prem Kashyap, president of Principal Progressive Schools Association of Uttarakhand, said, “The government has allowed the Kendriya Vidyalayas to conduct home examinations. So why can’t a similar arrangement be made available for other schools as well? We have written to the education director requesting him to allow us to conduct home examinations. However, we are yet to receive a confirmation from them.”

Meanwhile, an education department source told TOI that it is highly unlikely that the department will allow the schools to continue with home examinations and schools will have to postpone them. In another related development, the regional office of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in Dehradun on Friday issued a directive asking the authorities at the board centres and the students to take preventive interventions and ensure that proper hygiene is maintained.

Meanwhile, over 100 students and teachers of a private college in Dehradun that had gone on a study tour to Dubai were advised to stay at home for 14 days by the college administration as a precautionary measure.

“Mostly the consumers are labourers, farmers, lower middle and lower strata people. Most of the daily wagers are stated to be spending 50% or more of their earnings on liquor, driving their families to abject poverty,” the judges said. The bench then directed the authorities to arrest drunk drivers under Section 202 of the Motor Vehicles Act and subject them to breathalyser test under Section 203 for alcohol detection as per Section 185.

This apart, the court also directed the authorities to invoke Section 279 (rash driving) of the IPC for the offence of drunken driving in addition to Section 185 of Motor Vehicles Act. For rash driving, a person can be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.

As a preventive measure, the court has directed the central government to consider directing automobile manufacturers to install ‘Alcohol Sensing Ignition Interlocking’ in vehicles. Such device would enable a person to start a vehicle only if they breath clean.

CHENNAI: Soon, Tangedco consumers can pay bi-monthly power bills at their doorsteps. The discom plans to send assessors with a point-of-sale machine to consumers who are not able to pay through other sources.

An announcement in this regard was made by state power minister P Thangamani in the assembly on Friday after the debate on demand for grants on the energy department.

The discom has allocated Rs 1.75 crore to purchase point of sale machines. Now, there are several sources through which a consumer can pay the bills. “There are multiple channels of collection of current consumption charges. Consumers pay through net banking, debit/credit cards, mobile banking, mobile app, post office collection, bank counter collection, ATM collection, e-seva centres, Bharat bill payment system. Along with all this point of sale machines will be added,” said an official.

Of the total consumers, 34% use the above facilities to avoid standing in queue at collection centres. A total of Rs 1,626 crore has been collected from consumers through sale of power through these sources, said the official.

The government is also planning to use solar power at all traffic signals in the city as well as in all surveillance cameras installed across the city. “A total of Rs 7.4 lakh has been allocated to provide solar power to traffic signals as well as surveillance cameras in the city. But this is only a start and in phases more money will be allocated to provide solar power to these two,” said the official.

There are around 500 traffic signals in the city and at present all these draw power from the grid. Thus, if there is a power shutdown, signals will not work leading to traffic snarls. On several occasions, the Nandanam signal has gone on the blink due to power cuts. “Solar power panels above the traffic signals will have a battery so that power saved during the day can be used in the evening,” said the official. The project will be implemented by Tangedco along with the transport department.

The Delhi-based party aims to increase its foothold in the state and is going to focus on issues pertaining to the people of the state, especially in the health and education sectors.

State party in-charge Dinesh Mohaniya said, “We appeal to everybody to join the party by giving a missed call at 9871010101. If we are elected in 2022 assembly elections, then we will replicate the ‘Delhi Model’ in Uttarakhand too.

223,['14/03/2020'],Uttarakhand to formulate indicators to give financial value to ecology,"Dehradun: In a first, Uttarakhand is going to formulate indicators for analysing the 'economic value of ecology', or Gross Environment Product (GEP). The components that will be given economic value will primarily include water, air, forest and soil. The move is aimed at giving financial value to ecology so that it can be equated with GDP, said Doon-based environmentalist Padma Bhushan Dr Anil Joshi, who is spearheading the initiative.

""It will help the (central) government in understanding real time picture of its ecology and draw plans and give funds to each state based on its initiatives to safeguard the ecology. A committee of scientists, environmentalists and activists has also been formed in this regard recently under the aegis of K Vijay Raghavan, principal scientific adviser (PSA) to the PM,"" Joshi said.

The PSA suggested that a concept note on GEP measurement for Uttarakhand should be developed by Madhu Verma, chief economist at World Resources Institute (WRI), New Delhi, in consultation with the department of planning of Uttarakhand, said Joshi.

The concept note should incorporate suggestions of expert organizations, lay down relevant goals, responsibilities and timelines, said the PSA.

An 'operations committee' was proposed to be created for Uttarakhand that will be chaired by the principal secretary (forest department) Anand Vardhan. Additional secretary of the forest department Subhash Chandra will be the co-chair for the committee. The heads of state institutions will be part of this committee, with the department of planning being in the lead for GEP calculations.

Experts at a meeting held on March 5 at the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun , however, expressed concern regarding the lack of coordination between various agencies and, hence, said there might problems in getting data on a single platform.

Speaking at that conference, Raghvan had stressed the importance of having a pool of real-time data “and its analysis, which would help in policy formulation, followed by decision-making and final implementation. This requires continuous evaluation of data and identification of gaps for refining future policies.”

The committee will hand over the proposal to the principal secretary of forest by March 31, who will then take it up with the PSA.

The storm water drainage running along Vayalur road is for discharging rainwater into Kathiri Vaaikal from EVR road, Puthur and Bharathi Nagar. “The civic body should penalise the commercial units discharging waste water into the storm water drainage,” said S Pushpavanam, secretary of Tamil Nadu Consumer Protection Council.

Soon after Trichy was upgraded to corporation, ward 52, which includes Vayalur road, was facilitated with UGD and a pumping station was also established near the Bishop Heber College. Over the years, the residential locality witnessed robust growth attracting a lot of commercial units including hotels.

Though the commercial complexes were provided with UGD connections, locals lamented that the storm water drainage was being used by them to discharge waste water. Residents said that such practice is prevalent in other parts of the city including Cantonment.

Sanitary workers face routine hardships to clear the drains clogged with plastic waste and used flour from hotels. “When the drainage gets clogged, rather than placing a complaint with the corporation regarding it, commercial establishments request locals to register complaints so that their wrondoing is not exposed,” a source said.

The cleaning process also impacts the movement of pedestrians as the platforms covering the storm water drainages are frequently opened. When contacted, city health officer A Jaganathan said that action will be taken against erring commercial establishments.

CHENNAI: You can soon experience a wild experience at the Vandalur zoo, watching tigers and Indian gaur in the open.

The two safari parks will come up close to the existing lion safari enclosure, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami announced in the state assembly on Friday under Rule 110.

The proposal to set up the two parks at an estimated Rs 11.50 crore, as part of a safari world project, is aimed at drawing more visitors to the zoo, already the city’s top tourist spot, a senior wildlife department official said, adding that the it will be thrown open to the public in about five months.

The lion safari park, where visitors in vans can see seven big cats roaming in the open, will be the basis of the proposed safari parks, said the official.

Fifteen hectares have been set up for the Indian gaur facility and kept vacant. Clearing of undergrowth and laying of roads are to be taken up soon. A successful breeding programme has ensured that the zoo now has more than 25 of the animals including a few calves. Space for the tiger park is yet to be finalised along with the number of animals to be released in the open and the number of vehicles to take visitors inside.

No zoo in South India has a tiger safari and the one proposed at Vandalur could even be a first of its kind in the country, the official said.

The zoo, which sprawls over 6.03 sq km, is larger than most facilities in the country including in north India, he added.

The state government told the HC that it was seeking the presence of the accused including main suspect Safdar Nagori before the special judge in Ahmedabad so that the court can record their further statements under provisions of Section 313 of the CrPC. However, the court has already started recording statements of these accused persons through video-conferencing and therefore there is no need for directions to bring those accused to Ahmedabad prison.

The 10 accused were transferred to MP jail a couple of years ago after they were convicted in a terrorism related case in the neighbouring state.

The HC was also moved by the state government following the complication that arose after the MP government did not send these 10 accused to Gujarat on directions issued by the trial court last year.

The MP government did not send the accused to Gujarat citing Section 268 of CrPC, the provision restricting a prisoner’s movement outside the jail, as well as availability of video-conferencing for the trial in Ahmedabad.

When the MP government did not send the accused to Gujarat, the trial court threatened to initiate contempt of court proceedings against MP officials, including the jail authorities, for disobeying its orders. The MP government approached the high court, which stayed the trial court from issuing contempt proceedings. The HC had termed the trial court’s order as general and vague.

The government has introduced two categories of practising and non-practising faculty members with different pay scales, causing furore among the candidates. The fixed-pay appointments would be for 11 months.

According to the notification, the recruitment will be for the Gujarat Medical Education & Research Society (GMERS) colleges at Sola, Gotri, Gandhinagar, Valsad, Junagadh, Patan, Himmatnagar and Vadnagar.

“The professors who wish to practice medicine or surgery along with the job will be paid Rs 50,000 and those who will teach full time will get Rs 1 lakh. For associate professors, the figures are Rs 40,000 and Rs 65,000 and for assistant professors Rs 30,000 and Rs 55,000. Currently, about 400 posts are vacant in the state medical colleges,” said a government medical college official.

It’s likely that the model will also be followed for government colleges with non-clinical positions filled by contract system. “Whenever there is Medical Council of India (MCI) inspection, 250-plus professors, associate professors and assistant professors are transferred across the state. While the medical fraternity was waiting for the recruitment process, the fixed-pay system has discouraged many,” said the official.

Ever since the virus outbreak was reported from China, the movement of both has ceased. The lockdown has put aspiring entrepreneurs in the artificial gem cutting industry in a fix too.Trichy was once considered the capital of artificial hand-made gems or artificial diamonds supplied to jewelleries. These were used in the value-addition process of gold and imitation jewels. However, the rise of Chinese artificial gem cutting machines in the past decade had paved the way for the downfall of hand-made artificial diamonds in Trichy. Gradually, jewellers imported artificial diamonds from China while a few entrepreneurs imported the machinery itself to produce artificial gems here.Except for the few local gem makers, jewellers were importing artificial diamonds from China and other countries. Things were smooth until Covid-19 outbreak started to wreak havoc in the local artificial gem making industry. “We still depend on China for the cutting and polishing tools. We usually import on a monthly basis to cut the artificial diamonds. The clampdown on goods movement has kept our workshop closed,” T Rajasekar , leading artificial diamond maker from Karumandapam, said.Rajasekar is one of the few artificial gem producers with imported Chinese gem cutting machine worth Rs 30 lakh to produce 30,000 artificial diamonds a day. On seeing his success story, a bunch of conventional gem cutters mobilised fund and subsidies and were to follow suit. They are in a fix now as they could not launch production after the lockdown in China. “I mobilised Rs 25 lakh to procure Chinese gem cutting machines and was about to visit China. But Covid-19 scare has derailed our plans,” M Kalyani, a conventional artificial gem maker said.

KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation ( KMC ) is going to draft a policy to allow parking of vehicles on privately-owned spaces to avoid traffic congestion in the city, Sachin Jadhav, chief estate officer of the civic body said.

The municipal corporation is also going to hike parking fees for two-wheelers and four-wheelers at its sites. While four-wheelers will be charged Rs 40 per hour, two-wheelers will have to pay Rs 20 per hour once the proposal is approved by the general body.

In addition, parking of heavy vehicles will be banned on the KMC-owned parking sites .

For the sites managed by the Kolhapur Municipal Transport (KMT), parking charges for two-wheelers will be increased to Rs 10 per hour and Rs 30 for four-wheelers.

Sachin Jadhav, chief estate officer of the KMC, said, “Considering the increase in expenses to manage the parking sites, we have decided to hike the parking fees. The standing committee has submitted the proposal in the general body where the final decision will be taken. Currently, KMC has two parking sites whereas KMT has eight. Of these eight sites, four are currently operational while the rest are yet to be started.”

In total, six pay and parking sites are currently operational in the city. Recently, district guardian minister Satej Patil suggested developing parking sites in private spaces. Jadhav said that a draft policy regarding the same will be ready in a couple of weeks.

“Considering the limited staff and delays in getting private contractors on board, we have decided to ask the owners to allow parking of vehicles in their unused spaces. The charges for parking vehicles in private spaces will be fixed by us.

This means banks will remain closed for three consecutive days, March 28-29 consist the fourth-Saturday weekend, and therefore, banks will be closed on these days. Bankers will go on strike to protest privatization of nationalized banks.“Privatization and unwarranted merger of banks is taking place, despite our vehement protests. Besides, the issue of recovery of corporate bad loans is being ignored and concessions are being given to the corporates while service charges are increased for the common people,” said a statement issued by the bank employees’ association.Estimates by Maha Gujarat Bank Employees’ Association (MGBEA) suggest that transactions worth Rs 15,000 crore are likely to be affected with banks remaining closed for a day. Banking transactions such as cash withdrawals, cheque deposits in addition to issuing drafts, letters of credit, among others are likely to be hit. The decision to go on strike has irked trade associations and industry bodies, because closure of banks around the financial year-end will hit business activities hard. Bankers are protesting for wage revision and against privatization of nationalized banks.“March-end is a time when the entire year’s books of accounts are to be cleared, audits are taking place, payments are to be issued and all of this involves extensive financial transactions. Banks not functioning for three days at a stretch will only add to the woes of customers,” said Jayendra Tanna, president, Gujarat Trader Federation (GTF).In fact, the GTF along with several other trade associations, has already filed a petition in the Gujarat high court, over frequent strikes by bank employees which is hampering business activity.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74621098,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-99576,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/psu-bank-staff-to-go-on-strike-on-march-27/articleshow/74619619.cms

The woman’s husband alleged that his wife was killed by their neighbour while the neighbour claimed that the woman’s husband killed her after he came to know about their extramarital affair.

Police have filed an FIR against her paramour, Krishan Kumar, and two of his brothers under IPC sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 452 (house trespass with intent to hurt) and 302 (murder) at Nigohi police station on the complaint of woman’s parents.

Dr Ajay Nagar, a member of autopsy team, told TOI, “The woman’s body bore nearly 40 injuries. She was hit repeatedly on the face with a blunt object and later, strangled to death. It is likely that she was tortured before being killed.”

People on the side of the husband claimed that the victim and her sister-in-law were alone at home when their neighbour, Krishan Kumar, who was inebriated, barged into their house and locked himself with the victim in a room. Those supporting the neighbor, alleged that when woman’s husband came to know about her affair, he and his family members thrashed her in a fit of rage.

SHO Indrajeet Bhadauria told TOI, “We have registered an FIR against Krishan and his two brothers but we are also investigating the other aspects of the case. None of the neighbours saw the accused entering the victim’s house and someone told us that there was an argument between the couple over her affair.”

241,['14/03/2020'],"‘Make the machines here, revive industry’","Trichy: With no possibility of sourcing their tools from China, artificial gem cutters are now seeking the help of domestic fabrication industries to produce them. MSMEs said if fabrication units here can manufacture low-cost gem cutting and polishing machines as replacement for Chinese machinery, it will help revive the artificial gem cutting industry.

“Trichy’s MSMEs are known for skilled replication of machinery and components. Domestic production of gem cutting machines will also bring down the machine’s cost compared to the imported one,” N Kanagasabapathy, past president, Trichy District Tiny and Small Scale Industries Association (Tiditssia) said. Presently, artificial gem cutters purchase the machines for Rs 25-30 lakh. If domestically produced, the cost of the machine can be limited to Rs 10-15 lakh, MSME sources said. Due to the lockdown in China and unavailability of spare parts, artificial gem cutters have approached industries in Hosur to produce gem polishing tools. However, the quality of the tool produced locally has to be refined further to be on par with the Chinese tools. “We can check one imported gem cutting machine and consider it as a prototype to be emulated. Some of the fabrication units are already producing semi-automatic gem cutting machines here,” R Ilango, president, Tiditssia said.

Since the huge cost of importing machines deters artificial gem cutters, entrepreneurs said that local production of low-cost gem cutting machines will revive the dormant domestic industry. Artificial gem cutters said they are paying 18% GST for importing the gem cutting machines. Local production if encouraged will defeat the Chinese monopoly, they added. TNN

The health authorities have made it mandatory for travellers from seven countries – France, Spain, Italy, South Korea, Japan, Iran and Germany -- to get themselves tested if they arrive in Meerut.

The 21 travellers identified had visited one or more of these countries and China over the past few weeks.

So far, not a single case has been left unattended to. Meerut has sent samples of nine people so far for testing, out of which eight have tested negative and the report of one case is pending, said health officials.

The Union government has suspended visas for visitors from all other countries for at least a month in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The suspension came into effect on Friday.

“As many as 21 people who have travelled from other countries to India are under surveillance for coronavirus. Not just this, it is mandatory to get the travellers from seven countries -- France, Spain, Italy, South Korea, Japan, Iran and Germany – tested for the disease,” said Dr Rachna Tandon, Meerut district epidemiologist.

Meanwhile, as many as three new swine flu cases were reported in Meerut on Friday, taking the total number of patients to 101.

“Testing of samples for coronavirus is absolutely free for those with suspected symptoms and travel history. We, in fact, send a team of health officials to take samples of all the suspected patients and sent them to Delhi for further testing,” said Dr Tandon.

“There is nothing to panic about. City residents should take care of their hygiene and cleanliness to ensure that they do not get infected. Only people whose immunity is compromised are at risk, while others shall focus on improving their immunity and hygiene,” said Dr Raj Kumar, Meerut chief medical officer.

“The isolation wards are necessary for treatment of Covid-19 suspects. So far, we have set up a 48-bed facility in five different locations across Kolhapur district. We have scouted a few more private hospitals in the city and the number of beds will increase by 50. A total of 98 beds will be available in isolation wards in Kolhapur,” said B C Kempi Patil, district civil surgeon, Kolhapur.

The boat was carrying over 12 people, mostly women, when it capsized in Yamuna. The body of a 15 years old girl was fished out later, but the rescue operation was called off as darkness fell on late Thursday evening.

On Friday morning, when the operation resumed, the rescuers brought to safety another nine people who were stuck in the river. By Friday evening, the two missing women were feared dead. They were identified as Rajesh Devi and Moni Devi. The boat was returning from neighbouring Haryana.

“A 16-member NDRF team re-launched its search operation, but could not locate the two missing women. Meanwhile, the family of one dead, 15-year-old Nasreen, will be given Rs 4lakh as compensation. Out of nine saved by the divers, four have been discharged while five are still in hospital under observation. The injured will also be given monetary assistance of Rs 4,300,” said Shakuntala Gautam, district magistrate of Baghpat.

The NDRF team has arrived from Ghaziabad and is scanning the area in 5 km length.

Meanwhile, a hunt is on for the boat owner.

“It has come to our notice that the owner of the boat belongs to a village in Sonepat and teams have been sent to arrest him. Preliminary investigation has revealed that water had entered the boat after which it capsized. The depth of Yamuna is uneven and there is usually not much water at this time of year. But, because of continuous rains in the hills and western UP plains for the last couple of days, river had substantial water,” said SP Baghpat Gopender Yadav.

According to locals, ferrying of boat is an illegal activity, but is a common sight here. “Boats run on this stretch unhindered and are used to ferry villagers and farmers who have their crops on the other side. Besides, these boats also ferry illicit liquor,” said a local villager who did not wish to be quoted.

DM Shakuntala Gautam has also admitted there was no “contract or permission given by the administration to ferry boat in Yamuna.”

The project would be taken up under the hybrid annuity mode (HAM), according to NHAI sources.While the first package would cover 23 km between Neraluru in Karnataka and Thorapalli Agraharam in Tamil Nadu, the second and third packages of the project — Thorapalli Agraharam to Jittandahalli, and Jittandahalli to Dharmapuri fall in Tamil Nadu.Nearly 550 hectares is required for the road project in TN. Of this, NHAI had completed declaration of land acquisition for 80% of the land, said a senior NHAI official. “We are identifying an agency to fix compensation for the land, which will be acquired for the project,” added the official.Once the road is converted into four-lane, it would give a relief to the regular commuters to Hosur and Bengaluru from Salem and beyond. “It will also bring down travel time to Hosur airport from Salem and neighbouring districts. They can take NH 844 and reach their destination quicker. Apart from skipping Krishnagiri and the long stretch, the proposed road will help the road users avoid Hosur town as it will be connected to the Satellite City Ring Road, which is under process,” added the official.Apart from this, four-laning of the 51-km stretch of the Chennai-Bengaluru National Highway 44 between Krishnagiri and Hosur will be taken up under the Bharatmala project. At present, 40,000 to 45,000 vehicles pass through the Krishnagiri-Hosur section of NH 44 and widening the road will ease congestion.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74621080,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-434305,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rs-2000-crore-plan-to-construct-shorter-salem-bengaluru-road/articleshow/74620239.cms

Sample this: Describe the art form in which characters like Rangalo and Rangali depicts the content through their peculiar style?

Another gem of a question with a black and white picture said the photo was of a popular food grain crop of India and students were asked to identify and write a descriptive note on it. Then there were others like “write a note on the temple in North Gujarat which has its carvings in Persian style” and “write a note on the monument which has found its place on the new five-hundred rupee note as a cultural heritage.” “My son knew the answer, but it was asked in such a twisted manner that he was confused. They could have directly asked students to describe the Red Fort instead of asking it in such a roundabout way,” said a parent. Another parent claimed that the trend of asking questions using photographs was a new one and the use of black and white photograph made it tougher.

On Friday, about 30 students were caught cheating in the Class X and Class XII board exams. Of these, 27 were Class X students. In Dahod, 14 cases of copying were registered for Class X social studies exams while three were registered in Junagadh and two in Vadodara, among others.

256,['14/03/2020'],Agri dept urges farmers to take up millet cultivation,"Trichy: The agriculture department urged paddy farmers to switch to millet cultivation and earn good profits by adding value to their produce, here on Friday. The instruction came on the sidelines of a one-day seminar on ‘National food security mission (Nutri Cereals) 2019-2020,’ organized to persuad farmers to switch to millet cultivation.

“The central and state governments schemes are aimed at increasing the area of millets cultivation. Though our district reached the target area of 52,000 hectares for millet cultivation this year, farmers ti have the the awareness on millet cultivation,” said joint director of agriculture department, Trichy P Ashokan.

Experts from Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU) spoke about methods of millet cultivation in the event. The agriculture department asked the farmers to cultivate finger millet (Ragi or Kezhvaragu), little millet (Saamai), kodo millet (Varagu), foxtail millet (Thinai), barnyard millet (Kudhiraivaali) and proso millet (Pani Varagu).

Trichy agriculture deputy director S Shanthi said that the millet cultivation rquires one third of the water used for paddy. Taking into consideration their apprehension over marketing the produces, the agriculture marketing and agriculture business department helped the farmers with technical inputs to value added products from the millets.

“Value added products of the millets have its own share of market in the growing health conscious world. Millets added with values will fetch good income,” said JD Ashokan

C Gnanasambandan, head of central integrated pest management centre (CIPMC), advised the farmers to restrict the use of pesticides. Gnansambandhan said the millets can grow in rain-fed conditions and have lesser production cost. The chances of pest attacks and diseases are narrow.

Millets are cultivated in Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Salem (finger millet), Madurai and Virudhunagar (barnyard millet), Cuddalore and Villpuram (kodo millet), Vellore, Thiruvannamalai, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri (little millet), Salem (foxtail millet and Proso millet).

BAREILLY: Don’t believe in rumours as all Indian poultry products are safe, said scientists at the country’s Central Avian Research Institute (CARI), dispelling fears among the people on whether consumption of chicken and eggs would transmit the deadly novel coronavirus (Covid-19) to humans. Fears and rumours have severely affected poultry industry across the country.

There have been widespread rumours and debates on poultry products in the country since the Covid-19 outbreak in China’s Hubei province last year. Acknowledging that livelihood of small and marginal farmers have suffered immensely due to such rumours, the scientists at CARI stated that poultry has not caused spread of virus anywhere.

On Friday, officiating director of Bareilly-based CARI, Sanjeev Kumar, told TOI, “Poultry are not found to be involved in transmission of Covid-19 to humans in any report across the globe so far.” While CARI’s principal scientist AS Yadav said, “No global institute has found any evidence that consuming poultry products will transmit Covid-19.”

Another CARI principal scientist, Sandeep Saran, said, “People should not believe in rumours as there is no connection between Covid-19 and poultry. Consumption of Indian poultry products is safe.”

Saran added, “People should maintain proper hygiene as a precautionary measure. The spread of rumours has affected poultry farmers as the sale of eggs and chicken has declined drastically. Farmers who are dependent on poultry farming are staring at a huge loss.”

CARI has been running a project development action plan for some people in UP , Saran said, adding that under the project, “we give chicks to contractual farmers for rearing. After birds are reared, we purchase them from farmers at market price and later sell it back in the market. We sold the last batch of broilers for Rs 75 per kg in the market but this time, there are hardly any takers even for Rs 43 per kg”.

Even joint secretary, ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying, OP Chaudhary, had issued a statement on March 5 stating that “the consumption of Indian poultry and poultry products, including eggs, is safe. A general hygiene, however, should be followed”.

Ghazi Khan who owns a poultry farm in Bareilly said, “A broiler chicken is currently priced at Rs 32-35 per kg in markets in Bareilly while its cost of production is Rs 75/ kg. For small farmers, the cost of production of broiler chicken can go as high as Rs 82-85 per kg. Though the cost of production of egg is Rs 3.80 per piece, it is currently being sold for Rs 2.80 per piece.”

Khan added, “Every year, the demand of chicken and eggs usually go up around Holi and poultry farmers make preparations of excess supply in advance. However, due to rumour-mongering, the demands of chicken and eggs have decreased. For instance, I usually supply 220 to 250 egg trays per day but following the spread of rumours, the sale has now decreased to 15-20 egg trays per day in the last fortnight. It has become difficult to pay salary to staff. Worst affected are small farmers who don’t have money to feed or vaccinate chicks.”

We are also waiting for clear directives from the state government in regards to Coronavirus,” said Satyajit Gaekwad, chairman, BCA press and publicity committee.

The association wants to hold its pending AGMs of 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 on March 19 as it would pave the way for BCA to get Rs 100 crore grant from the BCCI.

Among the idols were those of Perumal, Sridevi and Boomadevi apart from Ram, Shiva and Hanuman.

While there is no clue about the temple from where these idols were stolen, Karur town police have handed them over to the Karur district court. They have also written to the idol wing police on the recovery of the idols. As for the jewellery found, it was On February 5 that Madhumitha of Vadivel Nagar reported the theft of 54 sovereigns of ornaments from her house to the Karur town police.

The special team formed to nab the perpetrators scanned the CCTV footage and active mobile numbers at the scene of the crime. The footage revealed involvement of a gang which came in a car in the theft incident. While the police were unable to track down the perpetrators for a month, a breakthrough came in the form of S Rathina Kumar from Kulithalai of Karur district who was detained by police on suspicion during a routine vehicle check in Karur.

He confessed to have orchestrated the theft along with three others identified as P Karuppasamy alias Sivabalan from Madurai, P Mohanraj from Tiruchengode and Boopathi Prabakaran. “We came to know that the main accused Karuppasamy died on February 16 over ill health,” said inspector K Udaya Kumar of Karur town police station.

Rathina Kumar took them to a spot at Vadipatti in Madurai district along the Dindigul - Madurai road from where the 35 sovereigns of stolen jewellery were recovered. Besides, seven panchaloha idols stolen by Karuppasamy on an earlier occasion were also recovered from an adjacent spot, he said. While Rathina Kumar doesn’t seem to have been involved in the theft of idols, there is no clarity on the temple to which the idols belong, added Udayakumar. One of the accused in the theft, Mohan Raj is in Salem jail in connection with a different case. The special team is searching for Prabakaran who is absconding.

This caused inconvenience for both motorists and pedestrians.

Vandana Kanyal, a resident of EC Road, told TOI, “I had gone to Buddha Chowk with my daughter for some important work but we had a tough time treading on waterlogged streets.”

Traffic cops struggled to maintain smooth flow of traffic across the city as more and more people took out their cars to avoid getting drenched.

Arun Chamoli, a resident of Rajpur Road, said, “I went out shopping on Friday but the volume of traffic was much more than my expectation. Waterlogging on roadside made it difficult for me to move out of the car.”

Miyawala area was among the worst hit as rainwater filled pot holes on the road and in absence of a proper drainage facility, locals had to struggle to even get out of their homes.

TOI had earlier reported the lack of sanitation facilities and the water logging issue faced by residents of Vanaspati Puram society in Miyawala locality.

Meanwhile, Jagmohan Chauhan, executive engineer at Public Works Department, Dehradun , told TOI, “The problem of waterlogging in certain areas is due to some ongoing maintenance works. Once the works are completed, the situation will improve.”

267,['14/03/2020'],Chainsnatcher who jumped parole held after five years,"Vadodara: Five years after he jumped parole and remained underground, the detection of crime branch (DCB) on Friday finally caught up with the 44-year-old criminal Kishor Maachi, a resident of Kishanwadi, who has 35 cases of chain snatching filed against him.

Cops nabbed Maachi on basis of a tip off and will now hand him over to the police stations where the offences have been registered against him.

According to cops, Maachi snatched 35 chains in different cities of Gujarat even while evading arrest. “Maachi was jailed on charges of committing nearly a dozen-odd chain-snatching in Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar and Anand. He got parole in 2015 following which he went missing,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime).

The police have recovered seven gold chains worth Rs 4.28 lakh, a two-wheeler and two mobile phones from him. “Maachiwas a casual labourer and used to operate alone. He targeted women in isolated areas in different cities and then disappear for a few days,” the police said and added that he may have committed other crimes too.

The police said that the accused, who originally hails from Navsari, employed a modus operandi of changing his location frequently. “He used to visit a city for a day and target a few victims there. After snatching the gold chains, he would leave the city immediately making it difficult for cops to identify him,” Jadeja told TOI.

The police said that Maachi admitted to have one chain snatching in Godhra, five in Bharuch, two in Navsari, one in Surat, four in Valsad, three in Idar, one in Mehsana, one in Himmatnagar, one in Unjha, one in Patan, three in Siddhpur, two in Palanpur, one in Deesa, one in Surendranagar and one in Borsad. “Apart from this, seven other offences of chain snatchings were registered against him at Nadiad, Godhra, Patan, Palanpur, Himmatnagar and Mehsana,” Jadeja added.

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has announced compensation of Rs 4 lakh for the kin of the victims.

According to UP officials, one person each died in Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Siddharthnagar, Ayodhya, Chandauli, Kanpur Dehat , Mirzapur and Balrampur, whereas three people each were killed in Jaunpur and Barabanki, two people died in Sonbhadra and six each in Sitapur and Lakhmipur Kheri.

In Kheri, a farmer from Sikandrabad village, was struck by lightning when he was working in his field. And Lal Mohammed (8) died after an electric pole fell on him in Dudhwa Midania village of Phoolbehad area of the district.

Apart from that, two houses were damaged due to lightning while trees fell on three houses in Kheri district. All the victims have sought compensation from district administration for their losses.

Three cattle were also killed by lightning and power supply in many rural areas was disturbed as trees fell on the electric lines.

Speaking to TOI, district magistrate Kheri Shailandra Singh said, “We are assessing the losses suffered by the farmers and family members of the people who have lost their lives. We will make sure that they are awarded compensation at the earliest. SDM and district agriculture officer have been advised to ensure that relief is provided to every victim.”

Meanwhile, the incessant rain also caused widespread damage to crops. Wheat, mustard, maize, peas, potato and cauliflower damaged due to hailstorm. Among the districts that were affected due to hailstorm include Muzaffarnagar, Bijnor and Rampur.

A Muzaffarnagar-based farmer, Babli Sharma, said, ""Mustard crop has been completely destroyed due to hailstorm and rain. We want the government to come forward with a compensation soon.”

My department is making a report from the affected areas in the entire district. I have assured the farmers' delegation that no affected farmer will be left unattended.”

In Bijnor, however, farmers complained that the agriculture department did not carry out any survey to assess the damage of crops. The district recorded 13.8mm rain on Friday.

Deputy director of agriculture, Bijnor, JP Chaudhary said, “It is difficult for us to assess the real damage caused to the standing wheat crop. I have instructed the officials to go to the fields and get accurate information.”

A group of 60 farmers under the banner of Tamil Nadu Banana Producers Association, Trichy district staged a sit-in protest on the campus of the office of the RC division near Trichy district court on Friday morning.

They demanded the PWD to release water from the barrage so that their seven-month-old banana crop in around 10,000 acres in Pettavaithalai, Perugamani, Sirugamani, Analai, Thirupparaithurai, Kodiyalam, Puliyur, Kuzhumani, Ettarai, Koppu, Mullikarumbur, Vayalur, Adhavathur and Somarasampettai areas, which are under threat due to lack of water, are benefited.

Timely release of water will save the crops and preventing the farmers from incurring a huge loss,” said district secretary of Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam affiliated to the CPI, Ayilai Sivasuiyan.

Aggrieved farmers said the RC division has stored certain quantity of water in the barrage during the recent release of water from Mettur dam.

272,['14/03/2020'],"TDP leaders on defection spree, party hit in 3 dists","Hyderabad: With defections from the main opposition TDP to the ruling YSR Congress continuing unabated in Andhra Pradesh, there has been a significant change in the political scenario of Kadapa, Kurnool and Prakasam districts. Four former ministers and five former MLAs recently quit the TDP and Jana Sena, respectively, and joined YSRC.

In Kadapa, the home turf of AP chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy, former minister P Rama Subba Reddy resigned from the TDP and joined YSRC. Another political leader, Adinarayana Reddy, who was with TDP, joined the BJP. The steady wave of defections from TDP to YSRC is also evident from the shifting of loyalties by ex-MLCs Dokka Manikya Varaprasad and KE Prabhakar, ex-MLAs Kadiri Babu Rao, Rehman and T Vijay Kumar, K Balaram and his son Venkatesh. Apart from these names, former MLC Satish Reddy, who had contested against Jaganmohan, quit the TDP and is expected to join the YSRC.

Political analyst Prof. K Nageshwar told TOI, “YSR Congress was against defections. Only thing is it took the moral high ground that if any sitting MLA or MP wants to join YSRC they have to resign and contest the elections again,” he said. He added that 23 MLAs of YSRC had defected to the TDP when TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu was the CM. “Jagan was criticising him for the defections then, and he doesn’t want TDP to criticise him now. Defections are continuing due to polls. They are engineered to demoralise TDP ahead of polls,” he said.

Prof. Nageshwar opined that when the three-capital decision was taken by the AP government, three TDP MLAs had revolted against their own party. “YSRC wants to send a message that even TDP MLAs are in favour of the decision,” he alleged.

Meanwhile, the TDP took to social media to post old and new clippings of Jagan speaking on defections. Senior YSRC leader S Ramakrishna Reddy told TOI, “All politicians joining the party are doing so of their own volition. We are not making any efforts to get them in. All of them are ex-ministers and ex-MLAs, so where is the question of defections.”

Besides, shoe exporters, some of whom tested positive for Covid-19 following their visit to a recent leather trade fair in Italy, are looking at cancellation of orders with several countries closing their borders.Tourism Guild of Agra vice-president Rajiv Saxena said that the industry is “witnessing nearly 40-50% cancellations and this is only going to increase further as more restrictions are announced by governments across the globe”. With markets crashing and tourists demanding refunds, it is a double whammy for the tourism industry, he said.Agra’s Jaypee Palace Hotel vice-president Hari Sukumar said, “Due to continued visa restrictions and travel ban, we are looking at an early onset of the sluggish summer season here as far as travel and tourism is concerned.” He added that even domestic tourists are scared to travel due to coronavirus scare . “Tough days are ahead. I hope that the climate will bring things back to normal and we can all get back to being busy again,” he said.The hotel alone received requests for cancellation of bookings for 800 rooms in a week.Clarks Shiraz chief operating officer Debashish Bhowmik agreed that it’s a bad time for hoteliers. “Every year, around 600 rooms are booked by Chinese tourists after the Chinese new year starts. This year, it started on January 25 and not a single room was booked by them due to Covid-19. Besides, domestic tourists stopped travelling too due to panic across the nation. We have estimated a 50-60% drop in the business in the next two months as compared to last year,” Bhowmik said, adding that he has seen 30% loss in the business since January.Agra Footwear Manufacturers and Exporters Chamber (AFMEC) president Puran Davar said visa restrictions, uncertainty and panic across the world will “impact the shoe industry hugely as our main buyers are mainly from Central Europe including Italy, Germany and France”.Shoe exporter Gopal Goyal said, “The entire leather industry has been badly hit by the coronavirus. Import of footwear components from China has completely stopped since January. Now, the supply of components from Italy and Spain are not possible. We are running out of stocks. Soon, it will start affecting manufacturing of finished footwear.”Industry sources say raw material worth Rs 15 crore for manufacturing finished footwear is imported from different parts of China to Agra every month, which has completely stopped.AFMEC vice-president Rajesh Sehgal said he fears 50% drop in the export business. “Probably, many of us would end up being bankrupt if the situation continues like this for next few weeks and our orders are cancelled,” he added.Agra had exported footwear worth Rs 4,000 crore in the last financial year. Out of these, around Rs 3000 crore exports were to the European countries and remaining to the US and several African countries. According to AFMEC, Agra has around 10,000 micro-size units, 30 medium-scale units and around 15 large-scale units. On an average, more than two lakh pairs of shoes are manufactured in the city every day and there are over 3.5 lakh people employed in the footwear segment in Agra.",agra,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74625983,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-376761,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/with-8-covid-19-cases-agra-hoteliers-bizmen-say-virus-will-surely-bankrupt-them-if-not-kill/articleshow/74618653.cms

Dehradun: Panic struck the historical Jhanda Mela celebration in Dehradun when the flag pole that was being installed broke and fell on the people gathered at the spot, injuring around eight.

The incident took place around 4.30 pm on Friday when a new flag was being mounted on the pole. Eyewitnesses said that such an incident has never occurred before and that it took place this year because of the heavy downpour.

Talking to TOI, Bhupinder Ratudi, senior public relations officer at Mahant Shri Indiresh Hospital said, “The incident is unfortunate, but right now the situation is under control. The ceremony resumed later in the evening and the flag was mounted after administering treatment to the injured.”

Surjit Singh, 50, a resident of Solan, Himachal Pradesh, was among the people injured. “We were celebrating unaware what was coming up. We did not have a scope react or even run away when the pole fell on us. However, with the blessings of our Guru no one was severely injured and the celebrations went well.”

According to an old tradition, a new flag is hoisted on the 105-feet-long pole every three years to mark the beginning of the Jhanda Mela.

One of the largest fairs of Northern India, Jhanda Mela begins on the fifth day after Holi. It is celebrated as the birthday of Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji who travelled to Doon valley from Punjab and established his settlement ‘Dera’. Also, the city got its name “Dehradun” from thereon. Gurudwara Durbar Sahib where the fair takes place now was built by Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji. Thousands of devotees (known as sangat) come from neighbouring states and foreign countries to pay reverence to Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj.

The body was found near Bhimpura canal 5km away from the spot of drowning by the rescue team that had been searching for him since Tuesday. Fire officials later handed over his body to the grieving family.

“The water flow dragged him far away from the spot. On Friday morning, we got a call from a local that he had spotted a body floating near Bhimpura gate of the canal,” said Om Jadeja, fire officer.

The locals fished out the body and handed it over to the police and fire brigade. A resident of Navayard, Pathan was a Class X student who was appearing in his Board exams. He had gone to the canal on Tuesday afternoon with his friends on the occasion of Dhuleti. While recording a video standing on the canal’s bank, he accidentally stepped on a slippery surface and lost balance and fell into the gushing waters.

His friends who were sitting nearby, rushed in to help and when they couldn’t rescue him they called the fire brigade. Pathan’s father drives an auto rickshaw while his mother is a homemaker.

The notice follows Narmada superintendent of police filing a complaint against Lakhan Musafir, a resident of Garudeshwar taluka of Narmada, accusing him of spreading misinformation and creating roadblocks in government works.

Musafir has also been accused of raising slogans against the government that is executing different tourism projects near the Statue of Unity (SoU) in Kevadia. The complaint states that the activist with the help of some anti-social elements has also attacked people who have opposed his actions.

Musafir has been accused of targeting SoU and also picking up fight with the government as well as the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNL) employees. The complaint also mentions two FIRs registered against him at Kevadia police station last year for criminal conspiracy, assaulting public servants and provoking breach of peace.

The activist has been asked to appear for hearing before the SDM in April.

PSS activist, Rohit Prajapati, however, has rubbished the accusations levelled against Musafir and termed him as a Gandhian. “Lakhan has done lot of good work for the locals by helping them in organic farming, bio-gas plants, education and supporting rights of the tribal families affected by Garudeshwar weir and SoU tourism projects,” Prajapati told TOI. “Musafir is opposed to displacing villagers for SoU tourism projects,” Prajapati added.

288,['14/03/2020'],"Factory, scrap godown go up in flames","Ludhiana: A factory and an adjoining scrap godown on Tibba Road were reduced to ashes in a major fire that broke out early on Friday.

Nobody was hurt in the incident as the unit was closed at that time and the factory owner and his family who lived on first floor of the premises managed to come out safely.

The exact cause of fire and its origin are yet to be ascertained.

The fire officials claimed that they received a call at 4.40am about fire in Sharma Processor in Guru Gobind Singh Nagar near Satsang Ghar on Tibba road. The firemen claimed that when they reached, the flames had already spread in the unit and scrap items kept in the adjoining plot had caught fire. The fire in the factory was controlled in a few hours, but fire fighters had to put extra efforts to douse flames in scrap godown. It took a long time to arrange earthmoving machines to remove scrap.

Fire tenders made 30-35 rounds to fetch water. There was arrangement for water in the factory.

Sub-fire officer Aatish Rai said, “When we reached the site, the flames had engulfed the ground floor of the unit completely and spread to scrap godown. The fire in unit was controlled, but it took long to douse flames in the scrap godown as it had flammable material.”

He said it is not clear how fire started, but there is a possibility that sparks might have started from a mobile tower installed on the terrace of the factory because of thunderstorm and lighting on Thursday night.

The fire was controlled in almost seven-and-a-half hours.

Panic in the area

The incident triggered panic in the locality as it was a residential area. People gathered near the incident site and even recorded it in their mobile phones. The firemen had to make extra efforts to keep people away from the site.

Refilling of fire tenders took a long time

The fire incident took place on Tibba Road and the nearest fire station was in Sunder Nagar. The fire officials claimed that in the early morning, it was still easier to refill the fire tenders due to lesser traffic at Basti Jodhewal chowk, but the day progressed, fire tenders took almost 40 minutes to again the spot from Sunder Nagar fire station. After the Basti Jodhewal flyover has become operational, there is no median or cut from Tibba Road up to Samrala Chowk. So, fire tenders had to take U-turn from Samrala Chowk to reach Sunder Nagar and then Tibba Road.

The trio sat in the car and after they reached Waghodia crossroads, one of the accused told Soral to turn the car towards Goraj village.

After travelling for sometime, one of them asked Soral to stop the car as he wanted to buy tobacco from a roadside stall. Later, the accused asked him to stop the taxi again as they wanted to relieve themselves. The trio returned within few minutes and suddenly accosted Soral with two of them forcing Soral to sit in the passengers seat while the third drove the car.

293,['14/03/2020'],"Bengaluru: Not paid during maternity leave, say pourakarmikas","BBMP’s foot soldiers complain of a raw deal

BENGALURU: BBMP women pourakarmikas have alleged that they aren’t being paid salaries during the six-month maternity leave that they are eligible for.

Pregnant women pourakarmikas are allowed leave, two months before delivery and four months after. Though they are eligible to be paid during the period, most go without salary, a pourakarmika union leader said and added that BBMP officials claim they don’t have enough funds to pay employees on maternity leave.

Also, when these civic workers want to rejoin work post maternity leave, they are made to run from pillar to post.

“A colleague of mine has gone to her mother’s place for delivery, but she has not been paid for the last two months. I have been told it is our right to receive salaries when we are on maternity leave,” a pourakarmika said on condition of anonymity. “We don’t know who will resolve our grievances,” she added.

According to the pourakarmika, many of her women colleagues hide their pregnancies till the last minute as they want to reduce the leave period so that they can keep drawing salaries, keeping in mind the expenses that follow childbirth.

“Many pregnant women do not get paid. We all know that a pregnant woman should eat nutritious food, for which you need money. Then there are ceremonies post childbirth, which too require money. The authorities should consider these factors.”

However, a BBMP official said there could be a few cases of pourakarmikas not being paid salaries during the maternity leave period, but nothing has come to their notice as of now.

The pourakarmikas are broadly divided into two categories — ‘permanent’ and ‘contract’ employees. Employees who were under the ‘contract’ system earlier are now classified as ‘direct’ staffers by the Palike. “Pourakarmikas classified as ‘permanent’ get paid without any hassles as per BBMP rules. There are about 15,000 ‘direct’ pourakarmikas and are the ones who might be facing this maternity leave related issue. However, all these employees can avail maternity benefits at ESI Hospitals. A part of their wage goes to these hospitals,” the official said.

S Vanajja, a pourakarmika, however, insisted that they aren’t paid while on maternity leave. “After some of us took up the issue, wages were paid to two of our colleagues. But why should we fight for it? It’s our right,” she said.

S Balan, president of Guttige Pourakarmikara Sangha, said no pourakarmika has received maternity leave benefits. “They tell them they’d provide them with insurance cover but in most cases the payment is not done. These civic workers aren’t treated well,” he added.

HYDERABAD: Suicides by doctors in the city in the last one-and-a-half months continued with another doctor — a cardiologist at a hospital in Secunderabad — taking his life at his Kompally home on Friday.

Dr G Subhash (33) was found dead in his room by his parents at around 9 am. Cops, however, are not sure about the cause of death. Petbasheerabad police, who registered a suspicious death case, suspect he might have taken the extreme step owing to differences with his wife who, in the past few months, had been living separately.

When Dr Subhash’s parents went to his room to wake him up, they found him lying in an unconscious state. They rushed him to a nearby hospital where doctors declared him brought dead.

Police said the doctor did not leave behind any suicide note. “There were issues between him and his wife. We suspect that was the trigger for Dr Subhash to end his life,” Petbasheerabad sub-inspector M Parasuram said. Police said Dr Subhash got married in Arya Samaj in 2017.

Police did not find poison or any other substance in the room. “Also, he did not froth at the mouth,” the SI said and added they can confirm the cause of death only after receiving the post-mortem report.

Dr Subhash had been working as an assistant cardiologist in the hospital for more than a year.

His suicide was third such instance by a doctor in Hyderabad in recent times. Last week, MD of a multi-speciality hospital Dr Ravindra Kumar shot himself with his licensed pistol in his Dammaiguda home . On February 4, MD of Vaishnavi Hospital Dr K Ajay Kumar ended his life in his hospital cabin in LB Nagar. The doctor reportedly left a note naming seven persons, including a former sarpanch, responsible for his suicide.

Meanwhile, some doctors have voiced concerns over work pressure and long working hours. “We worked together for 18 hours a day, most of the time in the ICU. His suicide has left us all in a shock,” said a woman doctor.

Recalling his association with Dr Subhash, president of resident doctors’ association, NIMS, Dr G Srinivas urged the corporate hospitals and the government to introspect on the spurt in suicides by medical professionals.

“Since doctors in corporate hospitals put in longer hours of work, stress levels are very high. If they have personal problems, it gets worse,” he said.

According to an estimate by fishermen’s associations in the state, sales have decreased by at least 30 per cent in the last couple of months.“Just like chicken there’s a lot of misconception over consumption of fish. People are apprehensive they might get affected if they consume fish. Sale of fish has reduced drastically,” said Arijili Dasu, executive director of Fisherfolk Foundation, a community-based fishermen’s association in the city.Every year, Andhra Pradesh exports in bulk a portion of its marine catch to Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka, and even parts of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra.Since January, wholesalers supplying fish to neighbouring states have been reluctant to place bulk orders. At local markets across the state, wholesalers have reduced the number of orders.“Our estimate suggests that sale of marine fishes has dipped by at least 30 per cent and soon it will have an immense impact on the livelihood of the fishermen,” added Dasu.Andhra Pradesh has around 3,55,000 fishermen, of which around 75,000 are deep sea fishermen.Amidst fears surrounding the consumption of fish, fishermen added that the lack of storage facilities is compounding their problems. Apart from the fishing harbour in Visakhapatnam, no other fishing centre in the state has storage facilities.“If we cannot sell fish in bulk it becomes very difficult for us to keep the fish fresh. Many of us have stopped venturing out into the sea. Even if we are going to the sea our catch is lower than our usual catch,” said S Buliya, a fisherman.Fishermen’s associations who were planning to organise awareness camps for wholesalers and customers have now had to postpone their plans in view of the upcoming elections to local bodies in the state.“This is not the right time to organise such awareness programmes.

After Thursday’s scuffle between students and vigilance staff, a group of students led by general secretary (GS) of MSU Students Union (MSUSU) Rakesh Panjabi on Friday had again reached university head office to resolve the long pending issues related to declaration of result.

But when the students group started raising slogans, members of the vigilance staff entered into heated arguments with them and allegedly started pushing the students which aggravated the situation.

Two syndicate members – Mayank Patel and Dinesh Yadav – who had reached the head office to resolve the problems faced by the students were also annoyed with the aggressive behaviour of some of the vigilance staff members who kept on pushing the students group in the presence of MSU’s officiating registrar K M Chudasama.

“In the melee, one of our students was even slapped multiple times by a personnel of a private security agency,” alleged Panjabi.

Both Patel and Yadav too issued a stern warning to vigilance staff members asking them to handle such situations with utmost care, especially when students come to make genuine representations before the university officials.

Later, the syndicate members took a couple of students representatives for a meeting with MSU vice-chancellor (VC) professor Parimal Vyas, who assured them of all the co-operation.

Vyas has decided to constitute an exam reforms committee with representation of MSUSU GS and vice-president.

The students have been demanding declaration of results of the semester end results that ended on December 9. “It has been agreed that the results will be declared latest by March 24. Also, after declaration of results, students will get enough time before the next exam session begins,” said Panjabi.

“We are resolving whatever issues have cropped up and we will have a committee to find a fruitful solution,” said Chudasama.

PUNE: The Regional Transport office ( RTO ) on Friday said it would not register any new vehicle of the Bharat Stage IV (BS-IV) emission standard make after March 31, 2020, in accordance with the Supreme Court’s order.

“This is in line with the Supreme Court order. So, people should exercise caution,” a senior RTO official said.

Addressing a news conference on Friday, Pune regional transport officer Ajit Shinde said people buying new BS-IV vehicles should complete their purchases a week before March 31, 2020, to ensure timely completion of the registration.

“Unlike, what happened during the migration in March 2017, people cannot buy BS-IV vehicles till the last date and register later. The process of registration has to be completed by March 31, 2020,” Shinde said.

In March 2017 (see box), vehicle sales had increased by about 4-6 times compared to usual office days on the count of unprecedented discounts. “The new BS-IV vehicles not registered by March 31, 2020, will directly go for scrapping,” he said.

BS-VI standard vehicles and renewal registrations of all old vehicles will continue as per the usual process. On an average, about a 700-1,000 two-wheelers and about 200-300 four-wheelers get registered at the Pune RTO every day. A majority of manufacturers have already migrated their fleet to BS-VI.

However, in the prevailing slow market, dealers have been left with a sizable BS-IV stock, which might prompt the dealers to resort to deep discounts to sell the BS-IV vehicles. “People should check with the dealer on assurance of registration before March end. Only then should they make their purchase,” Shinde said.

311,['14/03/2020'],New IIIT-H gizmo for personalised AC temp,"Hyderabad: People at workplaces will no longer have to deal with a uniform air-conditioning temperature as researchers at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H) have invented a method that will enable co-workers to have personalized temperature as per their comfort.

In a bid to provide user control, Prof Vishal Garg and his student Sam Babu Godithi from the IIIT-H invented the mechanism iSPACE (Intelligent System for Personal Ambient Control and Energy Efficiency), which was recently patented in the US.

Funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) under the US-India Joint Center for Building Energy Research and Development (CBERD) project, the mechanism consists of a SmartHub and a smart power strip that enables networking of all personal environment devices, providing a unified interface to the user with the building level control systems.

For example, a person having a workstation facing a window may have higher sunlight versus some sitting away. This means that a uniform air conditioning temperature set for the floor will not provide the same level of comfort to the window-facing occupant (who would need a lower setting) and the occupant sitting further away.

The mechanism invented by the IIIT-H researchers will optimize the load of devices such as table lamps, air-conditioner, table fans etc. “We are letting users have a say in the manner in which loads can be optimized while exercising a choice on their comfort parameters at the work stations,” said Prof Garg.

The mechanism is currently being evaluated for two scenarios. In the first scenario, the building publishes the electricity price without any constraint on the load whereas in the other every individual gets a load limit within which she has to operate. The research team at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and IIITH are exploring how the technology can be commercialized.

PUNE: A 53-year-old woman from Wanowrie has filed a suit in a city civil court against D S Kulkarni Developers Limited and its jailed top bosses D S Kulkarni (DSK) and his wife, Hemanti, for the recovery of Rs40 lakh she had invested in 2016 with the firm keeping in view her daughter’s future education and marriage.

The woman (name withheld) had received the money from a family court in Mumbai as a permanent alimony in a divorce proceeding against her estranged husband. Post-divorce, she shifted from Mumbai to Pune and was looking for an apt avenue to invest the money. She came across an investment scheme offered by the D S Kulkarni Developers Limited with interest at 18% per annum and opted for making the investment.

Her lawyer, Milind Pawar , told TOI, “We have preferred moving the civil suit to stake our claim on priority over any recovery made by the government from DSK and others. The ongoing proceeding before a designated sessions court under the MPID Act regarding the multi-crore rupees economic fraud by the developer and other accused is more of a criminal proceeding. There is no clarity yet as to when money will be recovered and distributed among the affected depositors.”

In her plaint, the woman stated that she invested Rs15 lakh with the developer’s company on May 5, 2016, and another Rs25 lakh on June 9, 2016, both as loans to the firm for receiving 18% per annum interest every quarterly term. As per a mutual agreement between her and the defendants (DSK, Hemanti and their firm), the quarterly interest was to be paid in advance, the plaint stated.

314,['14/03/2020'],Series of events at MSU rescheduled,"Vadodara: COVID-19 has impacted activities at M S University campus. Several events or programmes that were scheduled this weekend are either being cancelled or postponed as part of precautionary measure.

On Friday, the university’s women’s grievance prevention, counselling and redressal cell (WGRC) had organised a programme on ‘sensitisation on prevention of sexual harassment at workplace’ which was cancelled at the last moment.

The programme was scheduled on Friday morning at the Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhayaya Auditorium located in the premises of Faculty of Management Studies.

Sources said that earlier the plan was to convene the programme with precautionary measures like providing masks to the participants but later as the logistics did not work out the programme was cancelled.

The university has taken the policy decision of cancelling major seminars, conferences and workshop at least till March 31 as a measure to safeguard against the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus.

“For almost all the programmes, we have sent an advisory that we have received from the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD),” said MSU’s officiating registrar K M Chudasama.

“We will continue with the routine things like classroom teaching with sufficient precautionary measures. But wherever mass gathering is expected such programmes or events should be avoided,” he said.

“This will be applicable till we get further orders from the UGC or MHRD and till the time there is improvement. Once, there is an improvement, things will be relaxed,” he said, adding that for smaller events, the decision has been left on the discretion of head of departments and deans of faculties.

PUNE: A 12-year-old boy was killed after he accidentally fell from a pickup truck while returning from Shivneri fort on Thursday afternoon on Junnar-Bankar Phata Road, around 110km from the city.

The boy — Pratik U Shingote of Khamundi village in Junnar — had gone to the fort with a group from his village to celebrate Shivjayanti. The group members took Pratik to a hospital in Otur, where he died, an officer from the Junnar police said.

“The entire group had gone to the fort in a pickup truck. They were returning to Khamundi after the celebrations. Pratik was sitting on the edge of the vehicle,” the officer said.

When the pickup truck crossed a pothole on Junnar-Kamshet Phata Road, Pratik lost his balance and fell off the truck. “He suffered severe head injuries,” the officer said. The group members rushed him to the hospital in Otur. “Pratik succumbed to injuries during treatment,” the officer said.

Pratik was a Standard VI student of a private school in Yedgaon in Junanr taluka, the officer said.

On February 19, a trekker (20) from Thane, Siddhi Kamate, died after she fell off the Hadsar fort, around 13km from Shivneri fort.

Kamate had gone to the fort to conduct a cleanliness drive to mark the birth anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj .

316,['14/03/2020'],Dwarka may get Delhi’s second BRT for smooth travel to airport,"NEW DELHI: To ease the traffic congestion in Dwarka, Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is mulling creating Delhi’s second Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor connecting Dwarka to Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA).Delhi’s first and much maligned Ambedkar Nagar to Moolchand (5.8km) BRT corridor came up in 2008 during the Congress regime, which was criticised for causing major traffic snarls on the stretch. The corridor was eventually dismantled by the AAP government.A DDA official said the authority would ensure the ‘mistakes’ of the first corridor were not repeated in Dwarka. “The School of Planning and Architecture had been studying the traffic situation in the sub-city, and based on its interim report, the idea of BRT corridors and a proposal for Light Rail Transit (LRT) came up. We will ensure the width of the road is sufficient to avoid congestion,” the official said.A BRT corridor is of no benefit if it’s a standalone corridor that does not connect two major areas, he said, adding that, “If you do a half corridor, it will not work for any public transport project.”A source said DDA was likely to work on the Dwarka-IGIA BRT corridor, which would then be linked to Delhi Metro network for seamless integration. The second corridor connecting Dwarka to Bijwasan is also being planned, but no concrete steps have yet been taken.The official added that currently, the availability of buses in Dwarka was insufficient and more buses were required to ensure adequate frequency on the proposed corridors. “The bus frequency needs to be 2-5 minutes during peak hours. The bus routes also need to be changed and rationalised for better availability on key routes,” the official said, adding that better frequency will ensure last-mile connectivity from metro stations and bring down use of private vehicles.DDA is also planning to improve the connectivity between Dwarka and Gurgaon, but is not clear if it will be done through a BRT or an LRT corridor. “Any project to connect these two areas will require collaboration with the Haryana government. It is not going to be a simple project, but we are trying to come up with a plan,” he said, adding that the overall plan involves remodelling of road intersections, improving parking facilities, better accessibility in all areas, etc.As per the directions of lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, an inter-disciplinary sub-group under chairmanship of principal commissioner (land disposal), DDA was constituted to prepare a strategic plan dovetailing all projects optimising available land and building on the latest policy framework to develop complete ecosystem for Dwarka. The plan was presented to him on February 18. It focusses on issues related to regional connectivity of Dwarka, among others, and recommended exploring BRT or LRT corridors in the sub-city.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74620883,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-278865,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dwarka-may-get-citys-second-brt-for-smooth-travel-to-airport/articleshow/74619851.cms

PUNE: A speeding truck mowed down a 23-year-old man while he was crossing the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass opposite High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL) at Bavdhan on Thursday evening.

The Hinjewadi police said the man, Suresh Chavan , was a resident of Mhaske Vasti in Ravet. The truck driver left the vehicle at the accident spot and fled.

Assistant inspector Anand Pagare of the Hinjewadi police said Chavan was a tractor driver. “He was on his way to Katraj to drive a tractor for a Shivjayanti procession when the accident occurred,” he said.

A friend of Chavan had dropped him opposite HEMRL along the carriageway of the bypass towards Chandni Chowk around 6.30pm.

“Chavan had crossed half the carriageway and was in the first lane nearest to the divider, when the truck knocked him down. He died on the spot,” Pagare said.

“The truck was carrying watermelons. We have seized the vehicle and will soon arrest its driver,” Pagare said.

Chavan’s elder brother, Dhauji, has lodged an FIR with the police.

VADODARA: Officials of the animal husbandry department in Santrampur found themselves in a sticky situation with locals of an area where they had taken five horses to be euthanized and buried after they tested positive with the dreaded glanders disease. The test results of one more horse is awaited as officials were asked to conduct the tests again.

The disease was diagnosed among horses owned by one Abdulsattar Pathan, a resident of Santrampura in Mahisagar district. One of his horses took ill earlier this month and was initially taken to the Santrampur veterinary hospital and then to Anand for treatment.

In wake of the horse showing symptoms of glanders, a test was conducted on the horse along with other horses in the same stable. It came to light that five of the horses were suffering from the disease. Officials told media persons that the test reports arrived on Thursday following which the decision to put them down was taken after necessary clearances from top officials of the animal husbandry department.

Officials identified an isolated place to euthanize the horses and bury them there. The horses were taken to the site in a goods carrier by the officials. However, a group of people staying in the area gathered at the site and objected to the horses being buried there.

The villagers even roughed up a couple of officials of the department who had to be taken to the Santrampur referral hospital for treatment. “The procedure to be followed in case of the disease is clearly laid out. Some misinformation spread regarding the disposal of the dead horses. We are trying to convince the people,” said Mahisagar district development officer Neha Kumari. She added that the option of choosing an alternative site was also being examined.

Meanwhile, the officials were also ordered to repeat the test for the sixth horse. A decision regarding this horse will be taken at a later stage. The veterinarians will also be conducting tests on donkeys, horses and mules in the area to rule out spread of the disease.

320,['14/03/2020'],Turbid water raises a stink again,"Localities have been receiving brackish and yellow water

Vadodara: The old city seems to be mired in the menace of contaminated water supply. Residents here have been receiving dirty, stinking water for more than a week now which often flows out of taps as discoloured fluid.

Various localities of the city had been receiving brackish and yellow coloured water throughout the year. While the major issue of supply of turbid water from Nimeta filtration plants was taken care of by the aithrities during June-July 2019, other parts of the city continued to receive contaminated water due to local problems.

Sewage contamination remains a major issue in the old city as most drainage as well as water supply pipelines are old crying for replacement. Some of these areas have been facing the problem on and off for several years now with Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) having no permanent solution to nip their woes.

Both elected representatives from the affected areas as well as citizens have been taking up the issue with the civic body, but to no avail. Corporator from ward 13 Balasaheb Surve said, “I have been raising the issue repeatedly which only gets solved temporarily. Presently Rajratna Society, Goyagate Society, Shraddha Society, Vijay Society, Jawahar Society, Upla Falia and other areas are getting contaminated water.”

Hemangini Kolekar, corporator from ward 16, said, “The VMC clears drains and manholes in my locality to ensure sewage does not mix with drinking water, but the problem does not get solved. Sewage is flowing even in storm water drains in the area. There is some major fault that the officials are unable to take care of.”

VMC standing committee chairman Satish Patel said that he had ordered officials to take care of the contamination issue at the earliest. He said that the civic body had already sought aid from the state government to change the water supply network in the old city.

They met collector Ravindra Thakare and handed over a representation to him opposing any such move.“As the city has found more cases of coronavirus, we the residents are obviously in the grip of fear. After coming to know about setting up of isolation wards, we’re more worried as the virus could be transmitted from the patients to nearby areas.

JAIPUR: The Walled City ’s parking problems do not seem to be ending anywhere soon. The Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) in a meeting in January had agreed to the demands of Johari Bazaar Vyapaar Mandal to find a solution for the problems within a month. However, no concrete step has been taken by the JMC till now.

In the meeting it was decided that JMC will create sideways parking area along with automatic receipt through machines. Traders of the market specifically asked for proper implementation of rules in the market.

Kailash Mittal, general secretary of Johari Bazaar Market Association , said that parking has become their worst problem. “Most of the businessmen working in the market keep their vehicles parked in the market throughout the day. As per rules no one can park vehicles for more than two hours. After two hours extra charge should be paid but the corruption is such that anyone can park a vehicle with monthly payment to the contractor illegally. This is taking a toll on our business as customers do not get space for parking,” said Mittal.

Traders also demanded that the contractor’s workers should be in uniform so that they can be easily identified. In addition to this the traders should be allotted space for vehicles. All the demands were supposed to be fulfilled within a month, however, nothing concrete has been done so far. The traders say that now the JMC officials do not respond to their calls. TOI also tried to contact the officials, but no one was available for comment.

There are many wide lanes in the Walled City but illegal parking has made driving through the roads impossible. Haldiyon Ka Rasta, Gopalji Ka Rasta, Nahargarh Road, Baba Harish Chand Marg and Khazane Walon Ka Rasta are a few such examples. Residents of the area claim that due to parking issues many people are moving out of the area.

The order followed Jai Mahal Hotels Pvt Ltd appealed against the National Company Law Tribunal order.

“Maharani Gayatri Devi on the death of Maharaj Jagat Singh on February 5, 1997 became his sole legatee by ‘Will’ on June 23, 1996. Therefore, Rajkumar Dev Raj and Rajkumari Lalitya cannot claim inheritance on original 5050 shares to be legal heirs of Late Maharaj Jagat Singh on his death on February 5, 1997,” said the appellate order.

It added, “Once the claim of Rajkumar Dev Raj and Rajkumari Lalitya on the total original 5050 shares of Late Maharaj Jagat Singh are determined by high court and Supreme Court based on ‘Will’ in favour of Maharani Gayatri Devi and giving legatee herself bequeathed her rights in favour of Rajkumar Dev Raj and Rajkumari Lalitya, they cannot claim their right on such shares by way of inheritance on the death of Maharaj Jagat Singh.”

The Tribunal failed to consider the above said aspects and wrongly held that Rajkumar Devraj and Rajkumari Lalitya inherited the shares of Late Maharaj Jagat Singh on his death. Earlier, tribunal has ""restored the position ante immediately upon the death of late Maharaja Jagat Singh"" in terms of strength and directors of the board of Jai Mahal Hotel Ltd.

National Company Law Tribunal in its order had said that Maharani Gayatri Devi grandchildren’s majority shareholding in the hotel have been converted in to a minority by the overt and covert acts of Jai Mahal Hotel management including Gayatri Devi’s step son Maharaja Prithvi Raj and his son Vijit Singh.

COIMBATORE: This is that time of the year when travel company offices in the city gets flooded with summer vacation enquiries and bookings. The picture is altogether different this year. Most of the travel firms are empty, except for a few trying to work out cancellations.

Travel agents in the city say the industry is facing its worst crisis in three decades, much worse than the lull after the first H1N1 outbreak. According to them, domestic tourism has also been hit as almost every state in the country, including neighbouring Kerala and Karnataka and other popular destinations such as Jaipur and New Delhi, has begun recording coronavirus (Covid-19) cases.

While schools have declared holidays for children in lower classes from this week till April first week, the kids are forced to stay indoors. Sushmita Khanna, a resident of R S Puram, says, “My daughter has been pestering me to go to my mother’s place in Mumbai. But I can’t promise her anything, because of the virus outbreak. Maharashtra has four cases and we have been advised to stay away from airports, especially since I also have a four-year-old son.”

As on Friday morning, the country has reported 76 cases of Covid-19. While stockbrokers and investors watched glumly the bearish run of the stock market, travel agents were busy marking the destinations hit by the virus to exclude them from their offerings.

R Krishnaraj, president, Travel Agents’ Association in Coimbatore, says, “The city residents usually travel to hill stations in South India and North India. However, with all the popular holiday destinations such as Jammu and Kashmir, Kerala, Maharashtra and Karnataka recording Covid-19 cases, no one is coming in or calling up for enquiries.”

Expressing a similar view, Nirupa of city-based Ashok Travels, said people were scared to travel. “They are not only completely avoiding flights unless necessary, like business or medical reasons, but also afraid to travel by road. This includes even bold honeymooners, because their families advise against it. Holiday planners are almost nil.”

Indian luxury resorts are, however, yet to slash their rates, with top players sticking to their peak season rates in April and May. “While we are seeing some cancellations by foreigners, we are getting new bookings from foreigners who are forced to extend their stay due to Covid-19 outbreak. We are hopeful that the business would pick up by April-end,” said a manager of a star hotel on Avinashi Road.

State representative of PFI A Fayaz Ahamed, who addressed the cadres, said that PFI had no hand in the Delhi violence. “But the Delhi police, which are functioning under the Union government, arrested PFI leaders and members in connection with the violence. Sangh Parivar and Delhi police are behind the fake cases and arrest of PFI cadres and leaders. The Union government has been working to defame PFI. It is targeting the organisations that are fighting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, national population register (NPR) and national register of citizens (NRC). We request all those who believe in democracy and civil rights to oppose the Union government for targeting Muslims in Delhi.”

General secretary of Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam Ku Ramakrishnan said that the state government put NPR on hold after Muslims organisations intensified the protest against CAA and NPR. “Hindu Munnani was planning to attack some shops during the one day shutter-down protest. However, Muslim organisations also announced a protest on the same day. So, no violence was reported in the city. More than 95% of shops were closed. The shopkeepers closed the shops as they were afraid of the Hindu outfits. But the Hindu outfits thought that the shopkeepers were supporting the protest,” he said.

More than 150 police personnel were deployed to prevent any untoward incidents.

Expecting a good business, more than 1,000 cottage units that are involved in jaggery manufacturing in these two districts have upped the production volume. Presently, they are producing more than eight tonnes jaggery a day.

According to industry sources, there are more than 800 jaggery cottage units in Paramathi-Velur taluk in Namakkal district alone. They usually produce up to 2,000kg jaggery a day in non-peak season and 8,000kg during peak season such as Pongal.

K S Srinivasan, a jaggery manufacturer from Paramathi, said, “After the Pongal festival, there was no remarkable sale across the state. After a lull, the jaggery production has picked up pace now as we have started getting orders from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana ahead of the Telugu New Year, which falls on March 25.”

The increase in jaggery production has helped the sugarcane farmers in Erode and Dharmapuri districts as well, from where these manufacturers are procuring the raw material.

K Shanmugam, a merchant in Salem, said, they were doing a brisk business. Pointing out that the jaggery from the Namakkal units would first reach Salem, which is the main market, he said, “From here, we will transport them to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana through trucks. We are presently sending nearly 50 tonnes jaggery to the neighbouring states daily.”

The jaggery price has also shot up in tandem with the increase in demand. While a pack of 30kg jaggery was priced at Rs 900 after the Pongal, the same now costs Rs 1,230. “1kg jaggery will be sold at Rs 45 in retail shops in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana,” Shanmugam said.

NEW DELHI: Delhi may soon see deployment of over 25,000 civil defence volunteers and ex-servicemen as ‘mohalla marshals’ who will act as a security layer between the police and the citizens to help women and senior citizens feel safer.

Delhi government had asked its revenue department to make a plan for deployment of these marshals, which was among the 10 promises the chief minister had made in his guarantee card released in the run up to the Delhi assembly polls.

Since the plan was conceived to make the city safer for women, the government had initially tasked women and child development (WCD) department to prepare an action plan. WCD minister Rajendra Pal Gautam had even convened a couple of meetings to roll out the scheme where it estimated that a force of about 25,000 people would be required to man the city in shifts. But because monitoring a team of thousands of civil defence staff and ex-servicemen was a huge task which WCD was ill-equipped to handle, the government handed over the responsibility to the revenue department.

A revenue department official, however, said the scheme was currently at a nascent stage.

337,['14/03/2020'],‘Regular screening only way to guard against glaucoma’,"Madurai: As ‘World Glaucoma Awareness Week’ comes to an end on Saturday, doctors from the ophthalmology department at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) stressed that regular screening is the only way to prevent loss of vision due to glaucoma.

Glaucoma is an eye disorder caused by an increase in the eye pressure, which causes damage to the optic nerve. “The condition leads to defective field of vision and blindness if not treated on time. As there are no alarming symptoms like eye pain, redness or irritation, most patients delay in approaching an ophthalmologist. Screening is the only way to detect glaucoma,” said Dr U Vijaya Shanmugam, HOD, Department of Ophthalmology at GRH.

The disease is diagnosed by simple, non-invasive investigations like intra ocular pressure measurement, Optic nerve head analysis, Field test and Eye scan test. “Regular screening is recommended for risk populations, with gaps varying from once in two months to once in two years. There needs to be more awareness,” said Dr R Saravanan, associate professor, glaucoma Unit at GRH.

Risk populations include those who are above 40 years of age, frequently change glasses, have family history of Glaucoma, have diabetes or hypertension.

Treatment involves eye drops, laser treatment or surgical management, aimed at lowering the intraocular pressure. At GRH, last year, the glaucoma unit at the Department of Ophthalmology has treated 847 patients with eye drops alone and performed surgery for 324 patients.

For ‘World Glaucoma Awareness Week’, GRH has conducted an awareness rally, a CME program, free drug distribution, and various awareness programs addressing public during the course of the week. “We are also trying to hold mass screening for Glaucoma for all our employees. We are screening around 25 people a day and hope to first cover screening all our staff during the course of the next week,” Dr Saravanan said.

On Friday, a division bench of justice P N Prakash and justice B Pugalendhi gave the direction to the police officials to amend the report by including IPC section 109 for abetment of crime.

During the previous hearing, the court directed the state government to complete disciplinary proceedings against the erring officials and further directed to complete the investigation into the case registered by the Pamban police within three months.

Sanga Sirantha and Mohammaed Saffras, who were involved in murder, rape and gang war in Sri Lanka, had come to India in 2019 to escape punishment. The Kenikarai police in Ramanathapuram district arrested and got them remanded in judicial custody as they had entered the country without valid documents.

When the duo filed a habeas corpus petition seeking to deport them back to Sri Lanka, the court sought a status report from the Ramanathapuram judicial magistrate II regarding the case and subsequently directed to deport the duo to Sri Lanka.

Since the Kenikarai police filed a withdrawal petition, the Ramanathapuram JM II discharged the duo from the case. When the order was communicated, the SP of the Puzhal Central Prison misconstrued the said order as if the two Sri Lankan nationals had been released on bail and accordingly released them from prison on August 18, 2019.

The court took serious view of the inadvertent release of the duo. The central and state governments informed the court that the duo had surrendered before a court in Colombo.

The three were arrested on Friday morning.

Senthamangalam police inspector (incharge) Pon Selvaraj identified the deceased as P Kandasamy, 45, a building contractor.

The officer said the incident took place while he was sleeping outside the house after his 40-year-old wife Angammal, along with daughter Shanthi, had gone to visit her 65-year-old mother Ellammal at her house in the same village on Wednesday night.

“Around 4am on Thursday, Kandasamy woke up in flames, crying for help. Neighbours immediately rushed to the spot and extinguished the fire by pouring water on him. They then took him to the government hospital in Namakkal town,” the officer said.

When alerted, district superintendent of police (SP) R Arularasu, deputy superintendent of police Gandhi and Selvaraj met the victim at the hospital. “In his dying declaration, Kandasamy told us that some unidentified people had doused him with petrol and set him ablaze. Based on this, we started our inquiry,” the inspector said.

During inquiry, the victim’s wife, daughter and mother-in-law confessed to the crime. In her confessional statement, Angammal said her husband was in a relationship with a woman in Salem city . “He had decided to live with her after April. And Kandsamy and Angammal have been fighting over this issue for the past three months,” the officer said quoting Angammal’s statement.

Infuriated, Angammal hatched a plan to finish off her husband and sought the help of her mother and daughter, who backed her. “Angammal purchased five litres of petrol, which she used to douse her husband, from a petrol bunk. She, along with her daughter, left the house to create the impression that the incident took place when he was alone at home. After setting him on fire, the trio left the place immediately,” the officer said.

Based on their confessional statement, the trio were arrested on Friday morning and lodged in the Salem Central Prison under judicial custody.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Pollution Control Committee has lifted the ban on use of generator sets, which was in place since October 15.

DPCC clarified in a notice, a copy of which is with TOI, that the ban on generator sets, which is a part of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), was scheduled to continue till March 15, 2020. The only exception was essential services like in medicine (hospitals or nursing homes or healthcare facilities), elevators and escalators, railway services and stations, DMRC services, airport and interstate bus terminals.

However, looking at the prevailing air quality after the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) recommendations, the ban had been lifted with effect from March 11, the notice stated.

Due to a western disturbance (WD), which led to windy days and good rainfall over northwest India, Delhi recorded three satisfactory air quality days and one of the cleanest spells yet this year during March 5-7. The last time the city witnessed satisfactory air was on March 1, with an AQI of 90, due a spell of rain and windy conditions. Last year, Delhi recorded a lone ‘good’ air day on August 18 as the average AQI touched 49.

“On the recommendation of the task force constituted for GRAP and improving the air quality, EPCA has decided to lift the ban on operation of diesel generator sets in Delhi. In view of the above, the earlier direction issued by DPCC dated October 11, 2019 banning operation of DG sets is withdrawn with immediate effect,” it stated.

The generator set ban had also included those that run on diesel, petrol and kerosene. “While diesel gensets are the most common, the ban had included any fuel-based generator set,” said a DPCC official.

Earlier, before last winter, EPCA at a meeting with Delhi government officials and other agencies announced that a ban on generator sets would come into effect from October 15. It had clarified that weddings would not be allowed exemption, stating that temporary connections could be provided just like last year. For housing societies, however, the generator sets could only be used for services like lifts.

344,['14/03/2020'],Petitioner fined Rs 50K for false allegation,"Madurai: Madras high court has imposed a cost of Rs 50,000 on a petitioner for making false allegation before the court that his mother, an AIADMK ward member, was abducted by rival party members in an attempt to prevent her from contesting in the indirect election conducted for the post of chairperson of Chinnamanur panchayat union in Theni district. The court gave the direction after the state government informed that the woman was at her relative’s house and was not abducted.

The petitioner, R Vimaleswaran, stated that his mother R Shanthi was elected as ward councillor of Chinnamanur panchayat union. She filed her nomination for contesting in the election for the post of chairperson of the union. Due to the ruckus created by rival party candidates, the indirect election for the post of chairperson and vice-chairperson was postponed twice and election was scheduled on March 4.

He stated that his mother, who went to her relative’s house went missing on March 3. Since her mother went missing before the day of election, he suspected that she might have been abducted by the rival party members to prevent her from participating in the election.

During the previous hearing, the court had granted interim injunction restraining the functioning of chairperson and vice-chairperson of the panchayat and further directed to trace the petitioner’s mother.

When the case was taken up for hearing on Friday, the state informed the court of the woman’s presence at her relative’s house. Taking note of it, a division bench of justice P N Prakash and justice B Pugalendhi vacated the interim injunction as the allegation made by the petitioner turned out to be false. The judges also directed the petitioner to pay Rs 25,000 each to the chairperson and vice-chairperson of Chinnamanur panchayat union.

The encroachers are demanding land and patta for those being removed, instead of accommodation in the multi-storied apartments built by the Tamil Nadu slum clearance board (TNSCB) at Keeranatham.

Several encroachers, who agreed to move to Keeranatham a few months ago, have returned to the banks of the lake as the tenements are unlivable, Velmurugan of CPM said. “The buildings have developed cracks and may collapse during rain and earthquake. Coimbatore has been marked an earthquake-prone zone,” he said.

Authorities had promised that the area will have government schools, colleges and work opportunities, Velmurugan said. “There are no schools, colleges or work opportunities for the hundreds of women working as domestic maids and men who work as masons, and sanitary workers,” he added.

Nagpur: The pre-primary school where wife of Nagpur’s first coronavirus patient worked, has been shut till March 21 by its owners as a precautionary step. She is the first woman patient in Nagpur to test positive for coronavirus.

The woman is working as a training coordinator at a montessori school and was present on March 7, a day after coming in contact with her husband upon his return from the US.

TOI got in touch with the school’s director who, to her credit, responded clearly to all queries in detail without being evasive. “We also came to know about her being positive on Friday only. Government officials got in touch with us and asked if any of our staff or students showed any symptoms, to which the answer was negative,” she said.

“If one looks at the timeline, it is very unlikely that anybody from our school would have got infected. In fact, I am very convinced that she too was not infected while in school,” she said.

Explaining the sequence of events from her point of view, the director said, “The woman’s husband returned on March 6 and the next day she was at our training centre. On March 7 she showed no signs of infection and after that day she has not been in school at all most probably to take care of her husband. So there seems to be no chance of any other staff member getting infected.”

On March 7, there was an exhibition at the school premises which was attended by teachers from around a dozen schools. “Authorities have not asked us for names and details of the participants, but I am assuming that will happen soon. Regardless, we will try to inform them by collating contact data,” the director said. She has not ruled out keeping the school closed beyond March 21, but is confident that it would not be needed.

Nainital: The Nainital zoo administration is in talks with the authorities of Kashmir to bring a snow leopard to the zoo.

The Nainital zoo, also is known as GB Pant High Altitude Zoo, is one of the very few places in the country with optimum temperature required for snow leopards to survive. Earlier, the zoo had a snow leopard but it died a few years ago.

Speaking to TOI, Biju Lal, director of the zoo and divisional forest officer (DFO), Nainital, said that the final decision on bringing the snow leopard will be taken in the annual general body meeting (AGM). “We have talked to the authorities in Kashmir and a final decision on the process will be taken at the AGM which is expected to be held next month. As soon as the AGM approves the proposal we will initiate the process,” he said.

Meanwhile, the zoo authorities are also planning to conduct mating of animal species at the zoo. “We are planning to conduct mating of several animals inside the zoo. However, our focus will be on tigers. Though it was tried once before as well but the project didn’t succeed. If everything goes as planned, we aim to initiate the process in the next mating season. If the project succeeds, it will be a big achievement for us,” Lal said.

At present, there are three tigers at the Nainital zoo, including the recently brought Vikram. Vikram was shifted to Nainital zoo from Corbett Tiger Reserve after it turned a maneater.

These initiatives are part of the 10-year master plan, which was recently certified by the Central Zoo Authority, of the Nainital zoo.

Apart from bringing the snow leopard and initiating the mating process among animals, the zoo will also host research programmes that will focus on exploring the facts behind increased man-animal conflicts in the state. “The programmes will start at the zoo in the next financial year. Our aim is to bring in researchers to find reasons behind man-animal conflict and to also propose solutions for this,” the DFO said.

348,['14/03/2020'],"Sales down, poultry farmers to cut down on production","Namakkal: The spread of coronavirus and outbreak of bird flu in Kerala have impacted chicken production in poultry farms in the district.

Poultry farmers have decided to reduce the chicken production due to crash in prices.

“The price of 1kg of chicken has come down to Rs 27 from Rs 72,” executive member of National Egg Coordination Committee ‘Vangili’ Subramaniam said.

He said the impact has been felt in retail markets as well with 1kg of chicken being sold for Rs 60.

Worse, fake messages doing rounds on social media that coronavirus spreads through chicken and eggs have also compounded poultry farmers’ problems.

“When the poultry industry has been grappling with problems arising out of coronavirus, the bird flu outbreak worsened the situation further,” Subramaniam said. People are showing reluctance to eat chicken for these two reasons. Following this, the committee has decided to reduce the chicken production in the district, he said. “We will take a concrete decision on this after convening a meeting with other poultry farmers,” he added.

Namakkal district is the major hub for chicken and egg production in the state. The district produces 4 crore eggs and 20 lakh chickens daily for sales. “Of them, 40 lakh eggs and 10 lakh chickens will be sent to Kerala daily,” Dr P V Senthil, secretary of Livestock and Agri Farmers Trade Association (LIFT) said.

The district has nearly 988 poultry farms and all the major farms were following bio-security system. “Though there is no avian flu outbreak in Tamil Nadu, poultry farmers across the district have taken precautionary measures,” Senthil said, adding that they have ensured chicks are vaccinated without fail. “In the wake of the bird flu outbreak in Kerala, we have tightened biosecurity in all farms,” he said.

“While 13 new centres were opened in Tirupur, four were opened in Coimbatore. With this, there are 21 such centres in the region. As many as 374 children aged between nine and 14 years are studying there,” NCLP project director D V Vijayakumar said.

The centres were set up based on a survey conducted by NCLP members, school education department and volunteers last June, the official said. “The survey identified 317 child labourers – 179 boys and 138 girls. Most of them are children of labourers from states including Bihar , Odisha, West Bengal , Uttar Pradesh and Assam.”

“The children will be shifted to mainstream schools after spending six months to two years at the centres, which is required to make them adapt to the school environment. We had shifted students of 17 special centres to mainstream schools last year,” Vijayakumar said. “The number of child labourers, especially those from Tamil Nadu, has come down drastically in the last few years. Surveys conducted in the previous years used to find over 1,000 child labourers, half of whom used to be from Tamil Nadu. But this year, only 46 of them were from the State.”

Rehabilitating children of migrant labourers is a difficult task, Vijayakumar said. “The labourers keep shifting often. We had to close three centres – two in Valparai and one in Dharapuram – where close to 50 children were studying until a month ago, after their parents migrated.”

NCLP rescued five children after conducting awareness sessions at 599 industries and other commercial establishments in February, the official added.

COIMBATORE: The district administration has formed District Task Force (DTF), a 16-member committee, to check child marriages.

The initiative is a part of the adolescent empowerment programme launched with the support of the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) in the district.

DTF consists of the collector, superintendent of police, chief medical officer, district social welfare officer, chief educational officer and a member of NGO Child Rights and You (CRY).

As per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) – 4, the district has 19.9% of women who were married before 18 years.

A senior official with the district social welfare department said that they are preparing a strategy work plan for the committee. “As many as 62 child marriages reported in the district since January 2019 were stopped by the department. People came forwarded to report them to authorities as they are aware that child marriage is an offence,” the official said.

“In most cases, children living with guardians or single parents and those who are in a relationship, are married off before the legal age. But we interfere as soon as the issue is reported,” she said. “Even though child marriages are taking place in rural as well as urban areas in equal numbers, we have been concentrating in areas in and around Karamadai, Madukkarai and slum areas in the corporation limit.”

An official with the district administration said that they have been working along with officials in panchayat unions and had taken a resolution to stop child marriages during gram sabha meetings.

The court also directed the Madurai district collector to examine the possibility of disbursing financial support to the woman and providing temporary government job to her husband.

The petitioner, a 35-year-old woman who was married in 2007 had three daughters and a son. On April 14, 2014, she underwent family planning surgery at a primary health centre in Virudhunagar district. Recently, when the petitioner underwent medical examination, she learnt that she was pregnant.

The petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking compensation for medical negligence and also sought termination of pregnancy. Hearing the plea, Justice C V Karthikeyan suggested counselling to the woman.

Pursuant to the counselling, the doctor submitted a report stating that the petitioner had agreed to have her fifth child.

Taking note of the report, the judge observed that the court shall take up the responsibility of her family since the family planning surgery which she underwent voluntarily ended in failure.

353,['14/03/2020'],Kolkata: Tidal traffic on Lockgate flyover from today,"Kolkata Police to allow tidal traffic on Lockgate flyover

KOLKATA: From Saturday, Kolkata Police will introduce tidal traffic movement along Lockgate flyover , parallel to Tallah Bridge that is under demolition, to facilitate faster movement of directional traffic during peak hours. The move will help Higher Secondary examinees to reach their exam centres without much hassle.

From 6am to 1pm, the peak directional traffic on Lockgate flyover will be south-bound while it will be north-bound after 1pm. This will ease traffic congestion to a great extent, a senior traffic police officer said.

While the flyover is meant for the peak directional traffic, its parallel level crossing will serve the traffic moving in opposite direction (off-peak directional traffic). That means north-bound vehicles will ply through the level crossing from 6am to 1pm. The vehicles coming from Central Avenue-Girish Avenue will run via Prankrishna Mukherjee Road, Jagannatha Ghat Road and Khagen Chatterjee Road to reach BT Road at Chiria More. From 1pm to midnight, the level crossing will be used by the south-bound traffic. However, traffic will move both ways on Cossipore Bridge.

From Thursday afternoon till Friday evening, Kolkata Police ran a trial of the tidal traffic movement and the result showed a considerable ease in the traffic movement, according to the police.

Kolkata traffic police have been experimenting with traffic flow in this zone ever since the demolition work of Tallah Bridge began.

Initially, the Lockgate flyover was used for north-bound throughout the day, while the south-bound traffic took a long detour along the Northern Avenue, Belgachia Road and R K Kar Road to reach Shyambazar.

355,['14/03/2020'],Schools under NMRDA to be closed till March 25 only,"Nagpur: While schools and colleges under Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) limit and rural area will remain closed till March 31, but the schools that come under Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority (NMRDA) will be closed only till March 25 only. The decision to this effect was taken after a meeting of district collector, education officials and ZP CEO, creating a lot of confusion among several schools.

NMRDA covers everything under the 25km radius area which starts right after city limits. So in a simplified explanation, it is the area between Nagpur city and rural areas. Koradi, Hingna, Kamptee, Khapri etc are some examples of the places that come under NMRDA.

The entire confusion started with the state government circular which said that areas under corporation, council and panchayat will be shut down till March 31. This circular missed mentioning the areas under NMRDA which is why the local authorities were in a fix. They raised the issue with higher-ups and were informed that it can be sorted out at local level.

Speaking to TOI, resident deputy collector Ravindra Khajanchi said, “The collector held meeting with Zilla Parishad CEO in this regard today. Then, he took decision for restrictions in the NMRDA area only up to March 25 as of now. It is because there are no cases from the NMRDA area. Further decision to extend the closure will be taken well before March 25 after a formal review of the situation.”

A principal, whom TOI spoke to, said the decision does not make sense to them. “Maximum schools of CBSE are in rural areas because they are located just outside the city. But majority of students there come from Nagpur. So, in any case, maximum students have to come to their schools or colleges from Nagpur, which is under lockdown. There is no point in such decisions,” he said.

Another principal said it is tough for them to explain this to parents. “On Saturday and Sunday morning, we sent SMS to parents announcing closure of schools till March 31. Now, this decision will change everything and put us in a fix. Parents will also be livid with us when the next date goes out,” she said.

After filing his nomination for a Rajya Sabha seat from Rajasthan, Venugopal told reporters, “BJP is trying to sabotage the entire democratic system in the county. Horse-trading is going on in Madhya Pradesh, but we are confident that the Congress is dealing with the challenge and will succeed.”

The two Congress nominees for the Rajya Sabha seats from Rajasthan, AICC general secretary K C Venugopal and Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) general secretary Neeraj Dangi, filed their nominations on Friday.

The biennial elections for Rajya Sabha will be held on three seats in the state on March 26.

Venugopal, who reached here on Thursday night, said he is thankful to party president Sonia Gandhi and former party president Rahul Gandhi for giving him an opportunity to serve as a Rajya Sabha member from Rajasthan.

On the issue of BJP fielding a second candidate, AICC general secretary incharge, Avinash Pande said, “We are confident of victory of the two candidates with a comfortable majority.”

Scrutiny of nominations will be held on March 16 and nominations can be withdrawn on March 18. Polling will take place from 9am to 4pm on March 26.

Rajasthan has a total of 10 Rajya Sabha seats and at present nine are held by BJP, including three whose tenure ends this month.

The Congress’ only Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan is former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who was elected unopposed in the Rajya Sabha bypolls held last year after the seat fell vacant following the demise of BJP’s Madan Lal Saini, who was also the party’s state president.

A student on condition of anonymity said, “The last date for paying the semester fee was December 13 and we were told that penalty would not be slapped against us even if we pay half of the fees. I had paid half of the amount before the deadline and the remaining amount a few days after it. About a week ago, the college management had informed me that I had to pay Rs 2,750 as penalty for the delay in paying the fee and other pending fee. My semester fee itself is Rs 5,000.”

Another student said penalty up to Rs 10,000 was slapped on most of the students in BBA, BCom (CA) and BCom (IT) and how could they pay such a huge amount in such a short period. About a week ago, 17 students were suspended from the college without any reason and when a reason was sought, the management remained tip-lipped, he added.

Seeking the intervention of the district administration, the students had submitted a petition at the office of the district collector and officials had assured to investigate it.

He was speaking after inaugurating the Chief Minister’s Trophy for the state-level kabbadi tournament for 2019-2020 at the open air auditorium in Tamukkam, which is going to be the last official event to be held in this historical site before it is closed for developmental activities. The minister said that steps were being taken to enhance job opportunities for sportspersons both in the public and private sectors. In a recent conference of the CII in Chennai, Sengottaiyan said that he urged industrialists to sponsor sportspersons who won gold medals at the national level in tournaments.

It was under the AIADMK rule that sportspersons were being awarded high cash prizes. Those participating in this tournament stand to win Rs 12 lakh collectively, he said.

Concerns were raised by some public against the large gatherings at the venue during the weekend, amidst Covid-19 fears. Participants also said that they were not supplied with any precautionary measures yet, though some of them had brought their own hand sanitizers. Sarathi, who had come to witness the event, said the government should ensure screening for spectators and players.

Minister for co-operatives Sellur K Raju and minister for revenue, disaster management and IT R B Udaykumar, said that chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami was taking many steps to develop sports in the state. Fund allocations were being made and playgrounds established in all panchayats across the state, they said. tnn

NEW DELHI: From April 1, Delhi government schools will have zero paperwork as even attendance will be marked through tablets and the whole process will be digitised. Education minister Manish Sisodia has also announced that the schools will have video-conference facilities so that meetings can be held easily.

In a meeting with the deputy directors of education (DDE) on Thursday, Sisodia said the gounment would “digitise the process of exam result tabulation and attendance records. All teachers will be given tablets”.

Referring to the assembly elections, the deputy chief minister said, “This is the first time in the history of India that education has become a significant electoral issue. We have have to work really hard in the next five years.”

Everyone associated with education “should not have any arrogance”, Sisodia said, adding that other states and countries were reaching out to learn the way Delhi had changed its education model. “We should not be swelled up with arrogance while sharing our educational practices and model with them.”

He asked DDEs to ensure every teach in all zones had a tablet. “I want zero paper work. Section-wise attendance should be marked by teachers. We are aiming to build a robust software for the attendance system so that every DDE gets a notification by 9am every day about students’ attendance in each section of each school within their zones.” Examination results also have to be uploaded and maintained online on tablets, Sisodia suggested.

He also asked DDEs to keep a track on the installation of CCTV cameras on the premises. “Each DDE should know whether CCTVs are functional and if password has been provided to the parents to access them,” he said.

Video-conference facilities will ensure easy access at the zonal and directorate levels, the minister said. Meetings of the heads of school with DDEs and their senior officials can also be conducted online. “This will save time consumed in commuting.” The deputy CM also asked DDEs to work on improving the aesthetics of the school buildings, boundary walls, gates and nameplates within their zones. They should also take step to keep the premises clean.

362,['14/03/2020'],Drop move to merge ICMR: Su Venkatesan,"Madurai: Su Venkatesan, MP, has urged the Union health minister to drop the move to merge the Madurai Centre of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) with the one in Jipmer, Puducherry.

In a letter to the council’s director-general, he said that a recent report in the leading medical research journal Lancet titled “health and climate change’’ has stated that climate change will nullify the progress achieved in the field of public health so far. It also states that children will be the most affected by vector-borne diseases.

Opening more laboratories to expand research in the field of such diseases and microorganisms has become very important in the wake of the spread of diseases like Ebola, Saars and now Covid-19.

The success of the ICMR centre in Madurai is evident from the fact that it was the nodal centre dealing with diseases such as Japanese encephalitis, which was prevalent in the districts of Thiruvannamalai and Villupuram. The spread of these diseases was controlled and eliminated to a great extent by the ICMR centre in Madurai. Shifting the unit and merging it with the one in Puducherry would affect this work greatly.

Administratively also, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu are two different administrative units and state-level coordination for study, control and management would be difficult. It would affect the management of vector borne diseases.

Hence, the move to merge the centre in Madurai with the one in Puducherry should be dropped and more funds allocated for its functioning in Madurai, he said.

Earlier this year, the forest department had for the first time announced its plans to collect an entry fee of Rs 30 per person and Rs 50 per vehicle during the festival that is scheduled to take place on March 15 and 16.

B Kumaran, vice-chairman, Tea Board of India, said, “It is one of the important festivals of the Badaga community in the Nilgiris. The annual festival of Siriyur Amman is decades old tradition. We were taken aback by the decision to impose entry fee during the two-day festival.” A native of the Nilgiris, he has made a representation to the field director of MTR on Friday to scrap the entry fee. “This will cause long queues at the check post, hindering the smooth flow of the festival. Also, devotees are upset over the introduction of the entry fee to the temple.”

Meanwhile, Nakkubetta Farmers’ Association and other forums in the Nilgiris have written to the forest minister and chief minister to cancel the entry fee system.

When contacted, a senior forest official said the devotees would be allowed as usual without any entry fee.

364,['14/03/2020'],Delhi high court refuses to interfere in religious conversion issue,"Delhi high court (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Religion is a personal belief and to convert to a different faith or not is an individual’s choice, Delhi high court remarked on Friday, declining to entertain a plea for stopping or regulating religious conversions .

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar asked the petitioner — lawyer and BJP member Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay — to withdraw the petition as it did not want to reject it. Subsequently, Upadhyay withdrew the matter.

When the petition came up for hearing, the court said professing a religion was a matter of personal belief and whether to convert to a different religion was an individual’s choice. “Tell us how can we regulate it? What will we regulate? If someone is threatening someone or intimidating someone, it is an offence under the Indian Penal Code,” the bench said and added there was no reason for an individual to succumb to threats, intimidation or allurement to convert to a different faith.

Upadhyay, in his plea, had contended that many individuals, NGOs and institutions are converting downtrodden persons, particularly of the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe community, by “intimidating, threatening, luring by monetary benefits and by other acts, including miracle healing, black magic and more.”

The petition further claimed that “Many individuals/organisations have started conversions of SC/STs in rural areas and the situation is very alarming. The mass religious conversion of the economically downtrodden men, women and children, and, in particular of the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe community, is on the rise in the last 20 years.”

It had also claimed that as per the 2011 census, Hindus constitute 79 per cent of the population down from 86 per cent in 2001 and if no action is taken “Hindus will become minority in India”. Upadhyay had suggested enacting of a law to prevent conversions by force or deceit and to award jail term for any violation.

365,['14/03/2020'],"Fewer cases, but India becomes 5th country to isolate corona virus","New Delhi: India has become the fifth country to successfully isolate a strain of the novel coronavirus . China, Japan, Thailand and the US did it before.Simply put, it means that scientists have been able to obtain a pure sample of the virus that has been contained outside the human body.The scientific success is important because it will help in developing drugs, vaccines and rapid diagnostic test kits, the director general of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Dr Balram Bhargava, said.He added that the isolation of the novel coronavirus, the agent responsible for the ongoing outbreak of Covid-19, wasn’t easy as India had fewer positive cases when they started the project.“Total 21 throat swab and nasal swab samples were examined for this purpose. Of that, 11 tested positive and eight strains could be isolated from among them. They are 99.98% identical with the strain of the virus that led to outbreaks in Wuhan in China,” said Dr R R Gangakhedkar, chief epidemiologist at ICMR. He added that now scientists can test whether a drug will work against the virus or not to develop rapid diagnostic kits.The isolation of this virus will also help in understanding the biology and evolution of the novel coronavirus, say ICMR experts. Till date, there is no cure for Covid-19. Also, there is no preventive vaccination.Anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir have been tried on some Covid-19 patients, including the Italian national admitted at Sawai Man Singh hospital in Jaipur, with promising results. But the scientists said it is too early to conclude the efficacy.Most patients are only receiving symptomatic treatment, they added.Recently, in a draft report made public by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the experts claimed that Remdesivir, a drug developed for use against ebola, which caused major outbreaks in remote villages in Central Africa in 2014, is most promising for treating Covid-19.This is because the in-vitro (tests performed in test tube) and in-vivo (tests performed in living organism) data for the drug is available for coronaviruses. “Further, studies in mice using Remdesivir showed superior efficacy over Kaletra+IFNbeta,” the draft report said.The report added that a clinical trial is being planned in China to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug in association with optimised standard of care, as the next step. Remdesivir slows the infection of healthy cells by blocking viral replication.The WHO expert also reviewed drugs used in HIV treatment — lopinavir and ritonavir — either alone or in combination with IFNbeta. It stated that among the repurposed drugs under consideration, this would be the suitable second option for rapid implementation in clinical trials.The use of convalescent sera-serum obtained from someone who has recovered from an infectious disease and considered to be especially rich in antibodies against the infectious agent of the disease could also be an option, said the expert group. However, the report added: “...but it remains to be defined if sufficient amounts of sera with high antibodies titres could be feasibly collected, using concentration and purification processes.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fewer-cases-but-india-becomes-5th-country-to-isolate-corona-virus/articleshow/74619894.cms

KOLKATA: Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation has planned to conduct structural health and fitness tests of 15 overhead water tanks located across Salt Lake . The move comes a day after the collapse of a 33,000 gallon capacity overhead water tank inside the Post and Telegraph housing quarters in Salt Lake’s CC Block on Thursday morning.

From these 15 overhead water tanks, filtered water is supplied twice a day to about 26,000 households in the township with a population of about 2.16 lakh.

“We have decided to get a fitness test of the overhead water tanks conducted across Salt Lake by the structural engineers of Jadavpur University . It is not possible to know the condition of the tanks by looking at them from outside. We have already held talks with the JU experts and we will show them all the 15 tanks that will undergo the fitness test. We will take further steps following their recommendations,” said Bidhannagar mayor Krishna Chakraborty on Friday.

The civic authorities have already conducted tests on three tanks like 3, 7 and 10 as they had some doubts over their conditions. “We will work as per the suggestions of the JU experts. Our civic engineers are keeping in touch with them,” said the mayor. The civic officials said that in the Rajarhat area, there are two overhead water tanks, which are relatively new and in good condition.

Chakraborty said that the civic body is sending water tankers to Post and Telegraph housing quarters where the overhead tank had collapsed on Thursday. “We will supply water to the housing complex as long as it is required. The buildings are in terrible condition. We have already talked with the authorities of the complex in this regard,” the mayor added.

However, when the postal and telecommunications officials inspected the collapse of the water tank, residents of the complex protested against the lack of maintenance of their buildings in the past 15 years. The civic authorities are already taking steps to store surface water from the New Town water treatment plant. Two new overhead tanks and two new underground water reservoirs are coming up near tanks No. 5 and 13.

368,['14/03/2020'],"Sanitizers, masks in short supply; rates shoot up","Nagpur: The corona scare has cleaned up sanitizers from the market, literally. There has been a sudden rise in demand for chlorhexidine and ethyl alcohol based hand sanitisers after the outbreak of Covid-19 infections throughout the country.

Taking advantage of the situation, manufacturers and stockists have nearly doubled their margins, allege retailers who cannot sell the product above the MRP.

So far, the product was largely procured by hospitals only. The demand from hospitals has now gone up after the coronavirus outbreak. Stockist say they are giving priority to hospitals first, after which retail sellers are being supplied.

According to manufacturers, earlier there was hardly any demand for the product from the retailers but now it has gone up by as much as 10 times. They are hardly able to meet the demand, the manufactures said.

TOI scanned nearly 10 medical shops in different parts of the city and found a bottle of sanitisers only in one. There is a similar shortage of masks too and their rates too have gone up.

There are 4 to 5 manufacturers of sanitisers in the city apart from some of the multinationals also supplying the product. “Our monthly sale in the city, including that to some major hospitals in neighbouring Wardha, came to 3,000 litres during normal times. This has gone up to 5,000 litres in less than a month now,” said a representative of multinational company having a manufacturing facility in Pune.

The situation has led to problems in procuring raw material and items like containers and dispensers, say manufacturers. “Normally, the total demand was not more than 4,000 litres a month, but in a week there is a demand for as much as 50,000 litres. The manufacturers have a limited capacity,” said Deepak Kukreja whose firm makes the Adroit brand of sanitisers.

Ethyl alcohol, one of the basic ingredients that goes into making sanitisers, is available on a fixed quota basis to each manufacturer, due to which even the production cannot go beyond a certain level, he said.

Deepak Jinturkar of M/s Deepti Pharmaceutical that makes sanitisers using isopropyl alcohol said that raw material suppliers have increase the chemical’s cost to Rs150 a litre from Rs100 earlier. This is reflected in the end-price of the product too, he said.

“The retail demand cannot be met also because of an acute shortage of plastic containers. The retail market is supplied in smaller plastic bottles which are almost out of supply,” he said.

“It is expected that the supplies will normalize in a couple of days. However, it must be understood that there is no need of panic buying as well,” said Mohan Abhyankar, the Vidarbha zone president of Maharashtra Chemists and Druggists Association.

Rates of masks have gone up from Rs10 to Rs15 to as much as Rs30 to 40 a piece. The standard N-95 masks are being sold in the range of Rs230 to 250 a piece. Many retailers are hardly finding any margin in the product and have stopped procuring masks, said a source.

“We have proposed three greenfield airports and revival of three brownfield airports in Telangana. The greenfield airports at Bhadradri-Kothagudem, Jakranpally in Nizamabad district and Gudibanda village at Mahabubnagar district. The brownfield airports are at Mamnoor village in Warangal Urban district, Basanthnagar at Peddapally district and at Adilabad,” he said while delivering the inaugural address at Wings India 2020.

He said the state government has appointed Airports Authority of India (AAI) as consultant for preparing techno-feasibility studies for the existing airstrips as well as the greenfield ones.

The minister said the state government is betting big on the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) sector to attract big-ticket investments in the state. “We are in active discussion with various OEMs and operators and are told that our ecosystem offers the best infrastructure and skill base for MROs in India,” he said, adding that Telangana currently has two MROs operated by GMR and Air India.

He also added that the decision to slash VAT on ATF from 16% to 1% during Wings India 2018, has resulted in leading operators such as Spice jet and Indigo expanding their operational base in Hyderabad.

He also added that Telangana is the first state to come up with its own drone policy and it is actively working with startups and industry partners to pilot drone use cases in diverse sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, mining and law enforcement, among others.

In Coimbatore, the public health department has set up two more exclusive isolation wards for Covid-19 suspected and confirmed patients.

On Wednesday, the department set up two more exclusive Covid-19 treatment wards—one at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital and the other at Pollachi Government Hospital. This is in addition to the first such ward set up at ESI Hospital. While the ESI Hospital ward has around 20 beds, the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital ward has around eight beds and Pollachi GH too has another eight. “Our Covid-19 ward is like an intensive care unit set up, equipped with centralized oxygen supply, ventilators, mobile X-ray units along with face masks, gloves and a set of fever treatment equipment that will not be used in any other ward,” dean Dr B Ashokan said. “Our ward is specifically for Covid-19 positive patients,” he added.

Comparatively, the 20-bedded coronavirus ward at ESI Hospital is meant for quarantining. “That ward actually requires only television and access to food and books for patients to relax and wait it out. So, we plan to send suspected patients to ESIC Hospital and keep only positive and treatment requiring patients here,” added the dean.

Besides this, the medical services department has asked every GH to keep a small ward aside to be ready to be converted into a Covid-19 quarantine ward. In Mettupalayam GH, they have set up a 10-bed isolation ward. This has centralized oxygen supply, beds, screen between beds, giving quarantine patients privacy, and a toilet. “We want people not to be afraid of quarantine, but to volunteer and come forward. We can only do that with presentable quarantine wards like that of private hospitals,” a health department official said.

Meanwhile, the 60-year-old woman who returned from Umrah with a cold, tested negative for the virus on Friday. She is the fifth person in the district to be tested for the virus and turned out negative.

KOLKATA: Forty-five slum dwellers were shifted to hotels on Wednesday evening after cracks surfaced in the walls of their homes at 3, Gour De Lane.

Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation ( KMRC ), the implementing agency of East-West Metro, has started extensive repairs of the rooms located opposite 5/2 Gour De Lane, from where 36 residents had been evacuated the previous midnight as the fissures on the structure started expanding. The building was constructed with steel beams and extensive grouting is being done to strengthen it.

On Thursday morning, the slum dwellers living on the opposite side of the narrow bylane called in the engineers of KMRC and ITD ITD-Cementation, contracted to build the last 2.45km of underground tunnels between Esplanade and Sealdah. They showed them the gaping cracks and demanded to be relocated. The Metro authorities shifted them to two central Kolkata hotels around 9pm.

Prasanta Jana, 48, said, “Around 8.30pm, I and my son were told to pack our bags. Cracks developed in our room. We have been told that we can return after our home is repaired.”

Nagpur: As expected, attendance at the school and college of daughter and son of Nagpur’s first coronavirus patient remained low on Friday. At the son’s engineering college, a holiday had been declared on Friday specifically for the first year batch in which he studies and the building was disinfected.

At daughter’s CBSE school, attendance had dipped sharply with parents preferring to play it safe before the weekend. Both the children have tested negative for the virus, which came as a big relief to teachers and their classmates.

The college’s principal told TOI that attendance was on the lower side but he would not call it a sharp fall. “I actually though that it would be much lower, but that was not the case. The first year batch anyway had a holiday on Friday while the other batches had a slightly lower attendance. We are taking all precautions regarding coronavirus,” said the principal.

The CBSE school’s director said the latest medical report has come as a relief. “It is good to know that the girl is medically fit and not infected with the virus. This is also good news for all others who were in contact with her and were worried,” said the director.

The low attendance can also be attributed to results of coronavirus test not released till late night, thus not giving parents time to make up their mind about sending kids to school.

One parent whose child studies in the same school as the patient’s daughter said, “We just thought there was no point in attending school on Friday with the weekend coming. My son is in primary section so it really was not a big deal. I do believe the government should close down all schools for a week.”

Nagpur: Perturbed after receiving numerous calls and messages from his near and dear ones after he was mistakenly declared as coronavirus patient, district collector Ravindra Thakare on Friday said he will take police action against the media company that published the misinformation.

“On Thursday, I hadn’t thought of taking cognisance but when I started receiving calls from across the country, I thought of correcting the blunder. Some news portal had wrongly displayed my name as coronavirus patient. Media shouldn’t carry any news without verification, as it can lead to harassment of the person concerned. This is very irresponsible journalism. I have already told police to inquire into the source of this news,” he said.

Thakare said that he couldn’t focus on his work after receiving several calls. Slamming social media users who spread such fake news, the collector said it often leads to unnecessary panic. “They should resist from forwarding such news without verifying its source. Media shouldn’t believe in such rumours,” he said.

376,['14/03/2020'],JMC polls: Candidates focus on door-to-door campaigning,"Representative image

JAIPUR: With the announcement of the urban local bodies’ elections, people aspiring to become councillor have started making strategy for poll campaigning. Most of the candidates are planning to focus on door-to-door election campaigns, due to the small size of the wards.

After the new delimitation of Jaipur city was completed, Jaipur has now been divided into Jaipur Municipal Corporation – Greater and Jaipur Municipal Corporation – Heritage . There will be total 250 wards. More wards means smaller geographical area and population. Unlike last year, when wards used to have 30,000 people in their area, now the population has gone down to 8,000 people. The number of voters will be less than that. Hence, this year, votes will be given on the basis of the reach of the candidates amongst the people.

A former Congress councillor anonymously said that they have planned to reach out to as many people as possible. “We have to go and meet each voter. Last time, we had organised road shows and had banners of party symbol on it. This year it won’t work. Your liaison will work in your favour,” he said.

BJP has already begun a survey in every ward to shortlist the people who are influential and financially sound and can be given tickets. Workers of the party have been asked to figure out the Congress vote bank in the wards and to chalk out strategies to break their vote bank. A voters’ list will be prepared for the number of people residing outside the district or ward.

In the outskirts of the city like in Kho Nagoriyan, the rural population is higher. People who are eyeing for the seat of a councillor are trying to keep good terms with the elders of the family.

“In rural settings, the heads of the family are always taken seriously. WhatsApp groups are being formed where we are trying to connect with the people directly. The elections will be fought on local issues and allegiance to any party will not matter a lot,” said former BJP councillor anonymously. As per the new delimitation, Hawa Mahal constituency with 16,199 people is the most populated ward in Walled City and ward 75 in Kishanpole constituency is the least populated with 8,800 people. Both the wards fall under Jaipur Heritage Municipal Corporation (JHMC) jurisdiction.

However, public places like theatres, malls, gyms etc will be closed as per state government orders.

While advising citizens against spreading panic, the duo reassured them that the situation was in complete control and the administration was ready to tackle any emergency.

Thakare, however, advised citizens to avoid visiting public places like theatres, malls and others, or attend events with mass gatherings. “Those arriving from abroad should strictly avoid going outside home, and should keep themselves under self-isolation for two weeks. If any of them is infected, there’s every chance that the disease would spread to others, as it’s highly contagious.”

On parents demanding closure of schools and colleges, the collector clarified that the administration didn’t want to spread panic and the situation wasn’t that bad. “The government would ultimately take a decision in this regard if the situation worsens, but we wouldn’t be shutting any academic institution from our side, as of now,” he reiterated.

When informed about a slew of socio-cultural events taking place over the weekend, Thakare said those at risk should avoid visiting there. He also ruled out screening of railway passengers, stating that only places where international tourists would be arriving like airport would have such facility.

“We’re searching only two international flights that arrive in the city. International passengers arriving from Delhi, Mumbai and other cities have already undergone screening at airports there. We will work as per the advisory issued by the government,” he said.

Action against officials revealing patient’s name

The collector, who was earlier reluctant to take action against senior officials from the health department who revealed the coronavirus patient’s name, assured action against them. “We will inquire and act against them. It was wrong on the part of officials to disclose name of first coronavirus patient. We assure you that such mistakes wouldn’t be repeated in future,” he said.

After the name of the patient was revealed by a section of media, his family faced troubled times. The school on Katol Road where his daughter was studying, was thronged by parents wanting to take their wards back home due to panic. Even the engineering college his son studies in had declared one-day holiday for first-year students on Friday.

JODHPUR: Large crowds of party workers converged at the BJP and Congress offices on Friday to collect the applications forms for contesting the municipal election scheduled for April 5.

Distribution of forms started Friday and will continue till March 18.

According to the divisional spokesperson of Congress Ajay Trivedi, a total of 397 candidates willing to contest the election obtained application forms on the first day on Friday from the party office.

He said the last date of submission of application forms is March 18, after which no forms will be accepted.

Similarly, the BJP workers also obtained forms from the party office on Friday. But the party has also given forms to the mandal presidents in order to avoid rush at the party office.

“We have given 50 forms each to 12 mandal presidents and have advised them to arrive at a consensus on potential candidates with senior leaders on every booth,” said party spokesperson Jagdish Dhanadia .

Meanwhile, with the declaration of the date for election to six municipal corporations in three districts, parties have swung into action for fielding candidates and campaigning.

The BJP has appointed Union cabinet minister Arjun Meghwal as the election convener for both the North and South municipal corporations of Jodhpur city , while Jaitaran MLA Avinash Gehlot has been roped in as coordinator for North and Jalore MLA Jogeshwar Garg will be the coordinator for South.

The party has begun Holi meetings in all the 12 mandals of the city, wherein all the party workers will bring meals from their respective houses and dine together while discussing the election planning with focus on their respective wards.

Similarly, Congress has also begun preparation for the election, but not as aggressively as the BJP. A committee has been constituted by the party’s city unit for election management, but it will remain restricted to the party office just to look after the form distribution.

Jodhpur has been divided into North and South zones, bifurcating hitherto one municipal corporation with 80 wards each in North and South municipal corporations. The city earlier had only 65 wards, which has, post delimitation, shot up to 160 wards.

NEW DELHI: A group of eminent economists , lawyers, political and social activists , academics, health professionals and women’s organisations issued a statement on Friday calling on governments to do justice in the aftermath of the riots and attacks in northeast Delhi . Trouble in the neighbourhoods started on February 23, stretched to February 26 and sporadic incidents were reported even after. The statement also counters the misinformation campaign designed to malign the women-led anti-CAA protests .

The over 100 all-women signatories include Devika Jain, Uma Chakravarti, Tanika Sarkar, Jayati Ghosh, Kamla Bhasin, Annie Raja, Farah Naqvi and Amrita Johri.

The statement said, “Delhi struggles to recover from the terrible violence… which hit some of the poorest people — tailors, scrap dealers, carpenters, and daily wagers... Both (Hindu and Muslim) communities bear the sorrow of lives and livelihoods lost in this senseless violence.”

It rebuts the campaign to “criminalise” protesters and demands governments do justice. “We need governments to give us justice, reassurance and relief.”

Talking of the ground reality of the anti-CAA protests, the statement said, “Muslim women led these protests, in the best tradition of our freedom struggle… and proud we joined this struggle with them, in full measure as Indians — as students, women’s rights activists and queer groups, people’s movements, farmers and workers collectives, and as ordinary citizens; to fight for justice, harmony and peace for all. Clearly, something resonated… which is why in over 300 places, women sat and many still sit… to be heard, be visible as democratic citizens.”

As Delhi assembly met for a special session on NPR, the women’s statement called on it to “delink the NPR from the Census”. It sought expedition of the “time-bound relief and compensation to families of all who lost lives in the Delhi violence, and full rehabilitation to those displaced.”

It condemned threats to the protests. “The rainbow that is India is being targeted. There is intimidation, FIRs based on falsehoods, threat of arrest against protesters and those who stood with the protests. This politics of intimidation threatens all women, it threatens each citizen, and it must end. Now. This vicious campaign against citizens… must stop immediately.”

The statement added: “We say, across identities of religion, caste, class, gender, sexuality and ability that we oppose the proposed NPR, CAA and NRC. We stand by the protestors and the right to protest.” The statement emphasised continuity of the “struggle to preserve constitutional values, against NPR-CAA-NRC, and protection of the people’s rights to live, speak, believe, work, protest without fear.”

They have also been asked to keep close watch on the possible spread of infection in their respective areas.“Social distancing is the most effective way to stop the spread of Covid-19 in Delhi and India. So it is important to avoid any big event that sees huge public gatherings,” Sisodia said. Delhi has so far reported six cases of positive cases of nCov infection.During a discussion in the special Delhi Assembly session later in the evening, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that the coronavirus outbreak was at the containment stage and the Centre and state government had been working together to deal with it. “We have closed schools, cinema halls, universities to contain the spread of infection. The people have supported us in all the precautionary measures we have taken,” Kejriwal said.The CM also emphasised that healthy people shouldn’t use masks but rely on regular washing of hands and use of hand sanitisers to avoid infection. “If you wear a mask, you may touch it get infected.

392,['14/03/2020'],"This spring, coronavirus leaves Mount Everest out of bounds for mountaineers","KOLKATA: Expedition dreams of scores of mountaineers from Bengal and other parts of India have come to a grinding halt after Nepal government suspended all permits for missions to Mount Everest and other peaks for this season in the wake of the worldwide nCoV outbreak.In a notification issued on Friday afternoon, the mountaineering section of Nepal’s tourism department stated: “This is to notify that climbing permits for expeditions that have already been issued or to be issued for the Spring Season 2020 have been halted at present.”The decision, first in recent memory, left mountaineers like school teacher Rumpa Das in a fix, who had been saving for the last two years and had taken a personal loan of Rs 10 lakh, along with training herself rigorously, to leave for the expedition in three weeks.“It’s like there has been a sudden halt in everything I have done over the years. I still can’t believe it. But there is nothing we can do in situations like these where global safety is the priority. But I will not back down and would continue to train myself harder to either leave for the expedition on August this year or during this time next year,” said Das, who teaches English at a Krishnagore school.Veteran Everester Debashis Biswas, too, had planned an expedition next month to celebrate 10 years of his first feat and this time, he had planned to climb from the China end of the mountain. “Since last month, climbers had started opting out of the expedition on account of worldwide regulations on coronavirus . I was mentally preparing myself for the worst and on Thursday night, I was informed that my permit was officially cancelled,” said Biswas, who now plans to climb the Shishapangma mountain in China some time between August and October if the situation becomes better by that time.Mount Everest lies on the border between Nepal and China-controlled Tibet. On Thursday, the Chinese government had announced that no expeditions would be allowed to run on the Tibet side.According to climbers, this year will be the quietest on the mountain since 2015, when a 7.8 magnitude earthquake had struck the region just as climbers were settling down at Base Camp. But this year, the climbers have been stopped even before setting foot, the first time since 1974. Nepal’s economy depends heavily on the tourism industry. According to an estimate, Everest permits earn the government around $4 million each year.“The cancellation will have a huge impact on the tourism industry in Nepal. It is a testing time for us. Sherpas and other people involved with this industry wait for the entire year for these two months and if there is no expedition, their entire family income is at stake. Even if the government allows permits post May, we can conduct some short expeditions and treks but an Everest expedition is not possible this year,” said Keshab Paudyal, the director of Peak Promotional Hiking agency in Nepal.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74626395,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-197608,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/this-spring-ncov-leaves-everest-out-of-bounds-for-mountaineers/articleshow/74619088.cms

PUNE: The opening of Jagtap Dairy flyover last week, followed by its closure from Monday has left the commuters irked.

Pimpri Chinchwad mayor and BJP leader Usha Dhore inaugurated the flyover on Saturday last week. Barely two days after its unveilin, barricade tapes and debris welcomed the commuters at the entrance of the flyover.

Pimpri Chinchwad New Town Development Authority (PCNTDA) officials alleged that the inauguration was done without their knowledge. “A few technical checks are pending, which will be completed in next 10-15 days,” PCNTDA CEO Pramod Yadav said.

Mayor Dhore said she had inaugurated it due to the pressure from citizens. “I do not know who closed it,” she added.

As per ward corporator Shatrughna Kate , the flyover was thrown open to traffic for the convenience of people.

Sources in the political circles said, the flyover’s inauguration has become a issue between the BJP and the NCP, with the latter wanting the deputy CM Ajit Pawar to unveil the structure. “This politics over who opens the flyover is shameful,” a Pimple Saudagar resident said.

Nana Kate, the leader of opposition in PCMC, said, “There is some work pending. There are loose ends to be tied up. The officials have also requested the deputy CM to come and inaugurate it. So, it will be done hopefully by this weekend.”

As the nomination process for municipal elections concluded on Friday, a huge rush of candidates was noticed across offices of returning officers (RO) in the city.

The nomination process went on at a slow pace on Wednesday and Thursday, with only 150 candidates filing nominations on the first two days for 64 election wards in the city. A huge number of candidates arrived at RO offices on Friday to file their nominations. The nomination process which started early on Friday continued till late night. VMC authorities issued tokens to candidates who reached RO offices by 3 pm. Special forces were deployed at municipal offices to control followers of political parties.

City roads were crowded with followers of different political parties conducting huge processions as a part of nomination rallies. Despite political parties announcing their nominees, many rebel candidates filed nominations. YSRC, Telugu Desam and Jana Sena faced severe problems with rebel candidates. As many as 15 rebel candidates from YSRC filed nominations. Lack of coordination between Jana Sena and BJP has caused rifts in the alliance. Many BJP candidates filed nominations in wards where Jana Sena is contesting.

Vijayawada MP Kesineni Srinivas (Nani) along with other local TDP leaders staged a protest at Bhavanipuram police station opposing attacks on their party’s 39th ward candidate Kappaganthula Shiva Sharma. They demanded that the police book YSRC workers.

BJP state in-charge Sunil Deodhar and other leaders met governor Biswabushan Harichandran and complained about the attacks on Jana Sena and BJP candidates who filed nominations in local body elections. He requested the governor to take necessary action and pass directions to the police.

HYDERABAD/KALABURAGI: India’s first Covid-19 death has triggered a blame game between states and exposed the state of surveillance of suspected patients. While Telangana authorities blamed Karnataka for letting the “suspected patient” travel, authorities in Kalaburagi maintained he had left “against medical advice”.A day after tests in Bengaluru confirmed that the 76-year-old man, who died on March 11, was positive for coronavirus, it emerged that he had left a private hospital in Kalaburagi two days before his death and travelled to Hyderabad. District authorities said he left without their knowledge even as his samples had been sent for testing.In the Telangana capital, the man went to a state-run hospital but left without testing. The patient and his family moved about in the central part of the city and reached Old City where they stayed with a relative. Over the next two days, he got himself admitted to a private hospital, after having visited two others. When he was once again urged to go to a government hospital, he headed home instead. The man died within an hour of leaving the Hyderabad hospital.At the state-run Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad, which is the nodal centre for treating coronavirus patients in the city, the patient reportedly waited in the car while his family made enquiries about testing.Dr G Srinivas Rao, director of public health, said, “Only the patient’s attendants went up to the seventh floor. Then they left for another hospital. They only requested for testing and wanted to take the patient to a private hospital.”On Friday, Kalaburagi authorities said samples of four family members have been sent for tests; one of them has shown flu symptoms.Rao blamed Karnataka and the patient’s family for the breach of protocol. “This is a major blunder by the Karnataka government. How can they allow the patient to leave, knowing he was a suspected coronavirus patient? The attendants did not reveal the travel history to our (state) hospital when asked. The patient was old and had co-morbidities, no one would have guessed that he was a Covid-19 suspect unless the travel history was known,” he said.The man flew into Hyderabad from Jeddah on February 29 and was screened at the airport but showed no symptoms then although he had a history of hypertension and asthma. From Hyderabad he went to Kalaburagi. On March 6, he complained of cough and fever and was taken to the OPD of a private hospital in Kalaburagi. He was admitted on March 9 after which his swab samples were sent to the Viral Research Diagnostic Laboratory of Gulbarga Institute of Medical Sciences for testing. GIMS, which does not have the facility to test for Covid-19, sent the samples to Bengaluru.An official statement said Kalaburagi deputy commissioner Sharath B and the district health officer met the man’s relatives and told them to shift him to GIMS but the “attendees of the patient, without waiting for test results, shifted the man to a hospital in Hyderabad against medical advice”. It is, however, unexplained how he left without the knowledge of the authorities and why no efforts were made to track him.Mubeen Ahmad, general manager of the private hospital where the patient was treated, told TOI, “Hospital authorities and the district administration asked the man’s family to move him to GIMS, but they refused. We had no option but to discharge him.”On Friday, the man’s son countered that the district administration had kept them in the dark. “The administration did not inform us about the quarantine ward. We would have moved to GIMS had the DC informed us. The administration neglected the case and the private hospital forcibly sent us to Hyderabad, saying the patient cannot be treated there.”",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74620693,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-96333,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/death-exposes-gaps-in-corona-surveillance/articleshow/74620644.cms

NEW DELHI: Desperate to get the execution date deferred yet again, one of the four death row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya case , Vinay Sharma , approached Delhi high court on Friday claiming there were procedural lapses and “constitutional irregularities” in the rejection of his mercy plea by President Ram Nath Kovind .

The petition on Sharma’s behalf was moved by his lawyer AP Singh who said the matter had been filed in the high court registry. However, there is no clarity yet on when, if at all, it will be listed or heard by the court.

As per the petition, the recommendation sent to the President to reject the mercy plea did not contain the signature of Delhi home minister Satyendar Jain, and it was directly dispatched from the Lt Governor’s office.

Sharma’s mercy plea was rejected by the President on February 1. According to the petition, when the issue was raised before the Supreme Court, the Centre had contended that Jain’s signature was obtained. The plea also claims that when the mercy plea was moved the model code of conduct was in force and Jain “was only a MLA candidate at that point of time”.

“To reject the mercy petition, the powers used are illegal, unconstitutional, a miscarriage of justice and also miscarriage of constitutional values of Election Commission of India,” the petition alleged. “...Please (take) appropriate legal cognisance on the petitioner’s petition as soon as possible, because the motto of our Constitution is access to justice for all,” the plea urged.

Two days ago, the TDP leader had come under attack at Macherla in Guntur district. Rao told the commissioner that there was threat to his life. Meanwhile, the accused in the Macherla attack, Turaka Kishore, was released on station bail. Former home minister Nimmakayala Chinarajappa criticised the police move and asked how could the police give station bail to a person accused in an attempt to murder case. He said YSRC cadres were threatening rival candidates all over the state and preventing them from filing nominations.

D Gautam Sawang, director general of police (DGP), however, denied allegations of not filing a case under Section 307. He said the accused were arrested and remanded in judicial custody. Earlier, the police had booked a suo moto case. Later, the police recorded the statements of the injured, took a complaint and made the arrests.

KOTA: The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Friday arrested an enforcement officer (EO) and information assistant, posted at the district supply office (DSO) in Jhalawar after the duo had allegedly accepted a bribe of Rs 10,000 from a government fair price shop dealer.

The role of Jhalawar district supply officer (DSO), who fled after the report of ACB trap in the office, is also under scanner.

The enforcement officer had demanded the bribe to sort out an issue of irregularities found during a sudden inspection by the EO when he was holding the charge of the district supply officer in Jhalawar in October 2019.

Additional superintendent of police (ASP), ACB, Jhalawar, Bhawani Shankar Meena said EO Prashant Yadav and information assistant Ravindra Bairwa, both posted at Jhalawar district supply office, were on Friday arrested after Yadav allegedly accepted a bribe of Rs 10,000 from a ration shop dealer identified as Rajaram of Piplaj village in Khanpur tehsil of the district. The bribe amount was recovered from Yadav’s pocket, he added.

Rajaram had approached the ACB on March 6 and filed a complaint following which the ACB carried out a verification on the same day when the EO asked the dealer to hand over the bribe amount to Bairwa, the ASP said. Accordingly, a trap was laid, and the duo was arrested.

The role of district supply officer Alok Jharwal, who was not present in the office at the time of the incident, is also under scanner as he absconded soon after he received the report of the ACB action, the ASP said.

During a search at the rented house of EO, cash of over Rs 1 lakh rupee and gold jewellery and a few cancelled cheques were recovered, he added.

The two accused will be produced before a special ACB court in Kota on Saturday, he said.

409,['14/03/2020'],Jaipur metro phase II to bypass M I Road,"Representative image

JAIPUR: The Jaipur Metro phase II, proposed between Sitapura and Ambabari, will be diverted from MI Road after a decision was taken to construct its corridor above the ground level.

To make the project feasible, the Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation (JMRC) had decided not to construct any underground tunnel as that would increase the project cost.

Sources said, elevated corridor cannot be constructed on MI Road and near Ajmeri Gate as there are heritage buildings and structures.

The JMRC has, therefore, proposed to divert the corridor towards Ashok Marg and the train would reach Maharani’s College and SMS Hospital on Tonk Road via Ahinsa Circle.

A JMRC official said, “Earlier, the crossover of two trains was proposed at Sindhi Camp Metro Station , where construction of an underground metro station was proposed. Now, the elevated corridor will be constructed between Ahinsa Circle and Government Hostel. From here, the corridor will be diverted towards Sansar Chand Road to connect the existing Chandpole station, where the trains are proposed to intersect as per the revised DPR.”

Sources further said, the proposed phase-II will not connect to airport as elevated road construction is restricted in the area for security reasons. “Between airport and Sanganer station, there will be a distance of at least 600 metre. It is proposed to develop a dedicated corridor between Sanganer station and airport on surface where battery operated vehicles could be made operational,” a source added.

According to officials, the number of stations in the revised DPR remain 20, as mentioned in the previous proposal. However, in the earlier DPR prepared in March 2012, stations including SMS Hospital, Government Hostel, Sindhi Camp, Subash Nagar, Pani Pech, which were proposed underground earlier, will now be elevated.

Chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) Samit Sharma said, “We are examining the DPR to bring down the cost of the project. We would soon send our suggestions to DMRC. At present, our focus is on the commissioner metro railway safety (CMRS) inspection, which will start on March 17 for phase I(B) corridor in the Walled City area.”

The JMRC had earlier appointed Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to review the detailed project report (DPR) of Jaipur Metro Phase-II. “After terminating the contract of French company EGIS Rail SA, the corporation appointed DMRC for reviewing a revised DPR and bring down the cost. In the DPR, DMRC has mentioned an estimated cost of Rs 5,500 crore,” an official said.

In a nutshell, all these people had recently gone abroad and visited destinations where the chances of infection were high,” he said.These people would now be tracked to find out if they have been experiencing any flu-like symptoms. It is a general observation that those who have come from Abu Dhabi seem to show a higher incidence of infection.“If they are experiencing any flu-like symptoms, they would be quarantined, while those who were exposed to these people will also be tracked. We have noticed after the spread of Covid-19 in Pune that a high number of travellers had gone to international destinations recently,” said Ram.The travellers’ data only pertained to figures furnished by the city-based tour operators to the district authorities. The numbers will add up to a higher count when hoteliers in the city furnish the figures on the number of international guests checking into the hotels in the past 30 days.The maximum number of travellers had gone to Dubai, followed by Thailand, the data showed. Close to 57 people had gone to and returned from Dubai alone in the past one month, while another 44 had gone to and returned from Thailand. The data also showed that around 19 people had visited Phuket and returned recently, while eight had been to Bangkok and Pataya.The district collector said, “This (Friday’s) figure of 170 people is excluding the 40-member group that visited Dubai between February 23 and 29 (which included the first positive cases of Covid-19 in Pune).

JAIPUR: Three persons arrested for kidnapping a businessman for ransom, were on Friday sent to police custody till March 17. The three accused had abducted the diamond merchant Prakash Chopra from Bajaj Nagar police station area on March 11 and the cops found him 12 hours after the investigation was initiated.

The accused were identified as Vikram Gujjar, Rakesh Gujjar and Harish Singh. The victim’s son had lodged a complaint at the local police station that Vikram, who managed a PG hostel owned by his father, had called him on Wednesday afternoon to come to the hostel. Chopra went there but did not return home. The same evening, his wife received a phone call from the victim’s mobile number claiming that Chopra had been abducted and if a ransom of Rs 5 crore was not given, then the accused would bury him alive.

“Seeing the gravity of the situation, we immediately constituted teams and started the investigation. Based on the complaint, we started looking for Vikram and found him. Initially, he denied any knowledge about the abducted, but finally admitted to the crime,” said a police official.

Vikram managed the PG hostel with his cousin Rakesh. The two hailed from Sikar and decided to make quick money by kidnapping their employer. They also roped in Harish and called him from Sikar to Jaipur on March 5. They had been planning the crime for nearly a month.

Elaborating further, the official added, “After questioning Vikram through cyber intelligence, we found the other accused as well. The three accused after kidnapping Chopra had taken him to an isolated location in Shivdaspura following which they took him towards Sikar. Due to the fear of being caught, they left him in the forest area of Nechwa in Sikar. They left him there with his hands and feet tied as well as mouth taped. The teams managed to rescue Chopra within 12 hours of abduction and arrest all three behind the crime.”

According to officials, the accused did not have any significant criminal records and were looking to become rich overnight. Police are interrogating them further and also found the vehicle in which the victim was taken to Sikar after abduction.

NEW DELHI: Family members of a 21-year-old law student who was run over by an SUV scanned footage from about 30 CCTV cameras and managed to identify the car and its owner. The driver, identified as a businessman from West Delhi, was later arrested by police.

DCP(west) Deepak Purohit said that the accident took place near Tihar Jail’s gate number 4 around 12 noon on Wednesday. Ayush Grover, the victim, was returning from his coaching classes when a brown Creta car being driven by the accused, Sharad, hit his bike from behind.

The car dragged Grover and his bike for a few metres before the driver reversed and fled, eyewitnesses told the cops. Grover managed to pull himself up, but later collapsed due to excessive bleeding from his mouth. He was taken to a private hospital by a woman paaserby, but was declared dead there.

Doctors later told the family members that Grover’s rib had fractured and pierced his lungs leading to excessive internal bleeding.

An FIR was registered for causing death due to negligence and dangerous driving.

Baljeet Singh, a family friend who helped the family track down the driver, said that while the cops were probing the case, Grover’s relatives started scanning for CCTV camera footage from the area. ""We scanned through several cameras some of which showed the car. We managed to track down the owner from the vehicle number using an app,” Singh added.

The data was shared with police following which a team tracked down the owner of the car and nabbed him.

During interrogation, Sharad told the cops that he had panicked after the incident. He had returned to check on Grover and found him sitting on the footpath. He presumed that the victim would recover and hence left the spot.

Occupancy at hotels had dropped slightly following booking cancellations amid the coronavirus crises during the last fortnight, but the latest development has compelled hotel operators to cut tariffs even further to keep them afloat for the next two months.While five-star hotels have reduced their rates by 25-30 %, the drop in tariffs of three-star properties is sharper. Non-starred hotels and guest houses have gone ahead and halved their rates. To stay afloat in these distressing times, some hotels operators have even chosen to woo the local population by offering attractive packages.Confirming this, Travel and Tourism Association (TTAG) president, Savio Messias, said while starred hotels always offered brunch deals aimed at locals, the packages have been broadened to include overnight stays as well.Francisco de Braganca, a hotelier based in North Goa, said ‘rationalisation of tariff’ was now the mantra. “Hotels that reacted immediately after the Centre suspended all tourist visas will be able to safeguard their interests to some extent,” he said. Braganca also said that although the situation is fluid, it remains difficult to predict if the condition will improve or only deteriorate further.Over the past decade, Goa has also become popular as a meeting, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) destination. Corporates events that have been held here during the monsoon have resulted in a considerable spike in hotel occupancy during the lean period. But Ralf de Souza, another North Goa-based hotelier, said this segment did not do well itself during the last monsoon, thanks to the economic slump. “As corporates cut costs, fewer conferences and exhibitions were held in the state,” he said.Under normal circumstances, Goa sees good tourist footfalls in April and May. While the domestic and foreign tourist flow generally ebbs by the first week of May, de Souza feels that the number of domestic holidaymakers, too, will dwindle earlier than usual due to Covid-19 fears.“The government has advised against mass gatherings, and we haven’t received many booking inquiries from domestic visitors so far,” he said, indicating that the next three months could be bleak for tourism-dependent trades.Braganca, however, said a lot will depend on how the Covid-19 scenario unfolds across India. “A cautious approach is the need of the hour during these trying times,” he said.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74622752,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-593702,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/to-stay-afloat-hoteliers-slash-tariffs-woo-locals/articleshow/74620000.cms

MUMBAI: Mumbai University deposited Rs 142 crore in crisis-ridden Yes Bank— all in February in three instalments, a decision that has drawn flak its senate members. The last deposit of Rs 37 crore was made on February 29, barely four days before Reserve Bank of India imposed a moratorium on withdrawals from the bank.

Senate members alleged “misappropriation” of funds and sought an immediate inquiry into the matter during the university’s budget meeting on Friday. Nagpur University is another public varsity to have parked Rs 193 crore in the bank.

The matter was brought to light by Supriya Karande, a senate member, on the second day of the senate’s budget session. The university has invested around Rs 697 crore across banks, of which Rs 142 was parked in Yes Bank as it offered the highest interest rate of 8.05%, said university officials. Members, though, said the bank was in the grips of a crisis for several months and it made no sense to deposit funds as late as in February this year.

They said though RBI has assured that depositors’ money is safe, investment policies need to be investigated. The funds are money collected as development fund, revaluation fees, exam fees and affiliation fees from colleges.

In a statement issued by the university, it said the money was deposited in 12 banks in 2019 and nine in 2020. During a senate proceeding, a university official said the varsity deposited Rs 45 crore on Feburary 11, Rs 59 crore on February 20, and the last instalment of Rs 37 crore on February 29 this year in Yes Bank. Senate member from Yuva Sena , Pradeep Sawant, alleged it was a scam.

“They claimed that a resolution was passed in a management council meeting in September 2018. However, that meeting was based on the government’s directive asking universities to invest in banks with a net worth of Rs 4,000 crore. Yes Bank was not mentioned specifically in the government directive. They could have invested in public sector banks,” said Sawant.

A senate member said even if a decision was taken earlier, it should have been revised, considering the bank’s status. On members’ demand, vice-chancellor Suhas Pednekar decided to form a fact-finding committee and appointed senate member Sanjay Shetye as its head. The committee will probe the decision and the varsity’s investment policies to suggest measures.

Late at night, the university senate passed a budget outlay of Rs 809 crore for 2020-21—Rs 114 crore more than last year. It set aside Rs 22 crore to make the campus disabled-friendly and Rs 40 crore for the sub-campuses.

According to immigration experts, India is likely to continue to be the top source country as a large number of skilled workers, especially in the tech sector, will be drawn from India. The Canadian PR is akin to a US green card , with the family acquiring the right to live, work or study anywhere in Canada with a subsequent path to citizenship.

The multi-year immigration plan was tabled in Canada’s Parliament recently, by IRCC minister Marco Mendicino.

“Our immigration system benefits all Canadians by strengthening the middle class, keeping families together and building strong and inclusive communities. This increase in immigration levels supports a system that will help Canadian business create good middle class jobs and grow the economy while ensuring Canada continues to meet its humanitarian obligations around the world,” he stated.

Over the past few years, Canada has increasingly widened its doors to welcome immigrants, especially skilled ones, to meet the demographic challenges of an ageing population and to compete and win in a competitive global marketplace.

More than half of the new immigrants will be via the economic class, such as through the Express Entry programs and the Provincial Nominee Programs. Canada’s immigration system is point based — the most recent round in March had seen a cut-off score of 471 points and 3,900 invitations for permanent residency will be issued.

NEW DELHI: Four men on two motorcycles chased, shot at and then stabbed a 54-year-old businessman before fleeing with a bag containing Rs 60,000 near a Delhi Metro station in west Delhi on Thursday night.

The incident took place near Ashoka Park metro station around 9.45pm. The victim, Alauddin, is a resident of Sadar Bazar in old Delhi but runs a business from west Delhi’s Madipur. On Thursday evening, he shut his shop as usual and got into an Eeco car with his brother and two staffers. He was seated in the rear and had a bag containing the day’s collection of around Rs 60,000.

The robbers began following the Eeco. The car was crossing Punjabi Bagh when the robbers opened fire. When the driver had to stop at the traffic signal at Ashoka Park metro station, four men on two bikes intercepted the car and threatened the occupants with a pistol.

One of the men opened fire, but the bullet hit the car’s panel. When Alauddin tried to open the door to escape, the robbers caught him and stabbed him with a dagger. The four men also assaulted one of the persons accompanying the victim.

As the businessman fell down bleeding, an assailant grabbed the cash bag from under the seat. The quartet then rode away waving their pistols and threatening the victims if they dared follow them.

Alauddin and the other men were rushed to the hospital and admitted for treatment. Their statements were recorded and a case lodged. DCP (West) Deepak Purohit said, “An FIR for armed robbery under IPC sections 392 (punishment for robbery) and 397 (robbery, or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) was registered at Punjabi Bagh police station.”

Sources said that the Crime Branch and special staff unit of the district police will assist in the investigation. They are already probing the role of criminals of outer and southwest Delhi. CCTV footage from cameras around the metro stations on the route taken by the robbers is being checked for clues. The staffers who accompanied Alauddin are also being questioned.

A similar incident had taken place on February 29 in southeast Delhi’s Amar Colony and an employee of a businessman had been shot dead during a robbery bid. Contrary to earlier reports that Rs 2.7 lakh had been robbed, police recently arrested three men in the case and claimed Rs 16 lakh of the actual Rs 73 lakh looted had been recovered.

JAIPUR: The condition of the Italian tourist, who was the first positive case of Covid-19 in the state, is improving day-by-day.

The oxygen saturation level without the BiPAP and other equipment is been maintained by the patient at regular intervals. Doctors treating him are now mulling over removing the lifesaving equipment if he continues to show similar signs in the coming days. Likewise, there was no further deterioration in the condition of the 84-year-old Indian who was tested positive when he arrived in Jaipur from Dubai. Till Friday, Rajasthan has registered three positive cases and 370 negative cases.

Health officials said the situation is under control and many who were quarantined have been discharged. “There is a patient from Jodhpur, whose reports are also negative. Also, the Italian tourist is gradually improving as per the doctors. His wife has already been shifted to the Rajasthan University of Health Sciences (RUHS) Medical College since she was tested negative on Thursday,” Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary (ACS), medical and health, told TOI on Friday.

Now, the state has only two patients undergoing treatment as coronapositive cases — the Italian tourist and an 85-year-old Indian who returned from Dubai.

About the clinical condition of the Italian tourist, Dr D S Meena, superintendent, SMS Hospital , said, “We are removing his BiPAP mask on and off for two hours.

NEW DELHI: The 23-year-old woman pharmacist, who had gone missing from South Delhi’s Ambedkar Nagar area on February 5, was murdered and her body dumped in Rampur, Uttar Pradesh . After her body could not be indetified, the cops in the neighbouring state had cremated her on February 6.

The body of Priyanka was found with a rope in her neck. Her face was bludgeoned several times using a blunt object to conceal her identity.

A police probe has revealed that she was in a relationship with her distant relative, Harish, who also worked as a pharmacist at a hospital in South Delhi.

“We suspect Harish murdered Priyanka as his wedding was getting fixed elsewhere. He was earlier called for questioning after his calls surfaced in Priyanka’s call log, but he was not co-operative. He had also applied for anticipatory bail on February 22 which was dismissed by the court. He is absconding since then,” said a senior police officer.

The officer added that on the day of the crime, the mobile phone location of Harish was also near his ancestral home, which is hardly 100 kilometres away from the spot where the victim’s body was found. Priyanka’s mobile phone was switched off 50-60 kilometres away from that place.

On February 9, one of her uncles had reported about her absence. On February 18, another uncle of the victim gave a complaint to police. A case of abduction was subsequently registered. On March 10, Delhi Police received an information from a Rampur police station about an unidentified body found in their area. Priyanka’s photograph matched with that of the victim. Her parents who stay in Uttarakhand also confirmed the same. A team of Delhi Police officers, along with the parents of the victim, later left for Rampur.

Meanwhile, Priyanka’s roommate as well as the woman whom Harish was supposed to marry have also been questioned in this regard.

446,['14/03/2020'],Schools shut down on their own as govt delays decision,"Nagpur: Even as government remains non-committal, several schools are taking the lead and shutting down their pre-primary sections with plans to go for an early vacation for all classes.

A Nagpur-based group, which has more than a dozen branches in and around the district, has closed down their pre-primary section till further notice. The school’s director told TOI it was a preventive step taken for safety of kids even though they had no direct connection with patients who tested positive in Nagpur.

Independent English Schools Association (IESA), a pan-Maharashtra group of school owners, has decided to go in for an early vacation in their over 4,000 schools. Rajendra Dayma, president of the association, said, “For classes up to Std IX, all exams are held internally. We requested our members to conduct them as soon as possible and wrap up the academic session by March 25.” He added otherwise the academic session will go on up to second week of April.

IESA urged all its members to first focus on exams so the logistical challenges are taken care of. “Board exams will obviously continue as usual and a dedicated staff is available for it. The gap days can be used to get over with the internal exams so there is no unnecessary stretching of schedule,” said Dayma.

District collector Ravindra Thakre has said any school closure decision will have to come from the government. Many principals expressed shock the government has decided to close down malls, theatres, gyms and swimming pool but no decision has been taken for schools. A principal said, “Don’t they realize schools are the biggest hub for spreading infection? Thousands of students together for almost six hours in confined spaces is a breeding ground for virus. They should shut schools down for at least a week so the spread of infection is slowed down.”

NEW DELHI: Investigation in cases of riots often hits a roadblock due to lack of evidence. It becomes even more difficult to ascertain the correct sequence of events, let alone identifying the rioters. However, thanks to the video footage available with them, Delhi Police is sure that the perpetrators of the recent riots will be brought to books.

Apart from the CCTV footage from the affected areas, mobile videos shot by the residents have also helped the cops join the missing dots and place a verified sequence on record .

Soon after formation of the SIT in the riots, Delhi Police had appealed to people to share whatever video evidence they had recorded during the riots. According to additional commissioner, Mandeep Singh Randhawa, Delhi Police has till date received as many as 2,162 videos from public.

Police are carefully examining the authenticity of the videos before using them to identify the rioters, said a source. “The videos are carefully examined for any tampering by our video experts and then inventoried and categorised based on areas and case FIRs,” he added.

Of the 2,162 videos received, police have filtered out only 1,330 usable videos. Many of the videos received were similar too. “After categorisation, the videos are manually analysed by showing them to locals and informers. They are then run through a software, which uses facial recognition technology, to identify the suspects.”

Police are also selecting the videos sent by people who had recorded them themselves on their mobile phones. ""These videos are being sent for forensic analysis and can be used as an evidence in the court as well. Forwarded videos can aide in investigation, but not be placed on record in court,” a senior cop said.

From the sensational murders of head constable Ratan Lal to the killing of IB official Ankit Sharma - the videos have played a crucial role during the probe. The mystery of four bodies recovered from the drains in northeast Delhi was largely solved using the video footage. Police had also managed to solve the case of arson at a house, in which a 85-year-old woman died of asphyxia, using video footage.

448,['14/03/2020'],Coastal body seeks green study for laying gas pipeline,"Panaji: The Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority ( GCZMA ) told Goa Natural Gas to conduct a rapid environment impact assessment (EIA) after the latter sought an NOC to lay gas pipelines across three water bodies.

Goa Natural Gas has sought permission to use the horizontal directional drilling (HDD) method to lay pipelines across the Ribandar creek, the Banastarim river at Banastarim, Old Goa , and across the Mhadei river at Khandepar, Ponda.

“HDD utilises a drill to install the pipe. No excavation is necessary. The depth of the pipelines at each location will be 4m-5m below the bed of the water body,” Goa Natural Gas told the GCZMA.

The coastal authority then inspected the sites with a surveyor and, following its meeting in January, decided to ask Goa Natural Gas to conduct a rapid EIA and approach it again for approval.

“All three waterbodies are ecologically sensitive and come under tidal influences. The mangroves along the Ribandar creek and Banastarim river provide breeding/nesting grounds for various life forms such as fish, birds and crocodiles etc. Slight disturbance to the ecology by way of drilling and creating vibrations may negatively impact these species,” the GCZMA said.

To study the impact of drilling, Goa Natural Gas must study all the water bodies for their physical (including geotechnical), chemical and biological parameters, the authority has suggested.

“The Ribandar creek has well-established mangroves and is used by the locals for fishing. During the process of laying the pipeline, there are high chances that vibration may lead to disturbance of the delicate ecology. The distance the pipeline needs to cover is about 100m-120m,” the GCZMA said.

The Banastarim river is an ecologically sensitive zone too, and connects to the Cumbharjua canal, which is one of Goa’s known crocodile habitats, it has stated. “A stretch of well-established mangroves have been observed on both the sides of river. The pipeline distance to be covered is about 150m-170m,” the authority has observed based on the report of its expert member.

In the case of the Mhadei, the Goa Natural Gas pipeline is set to be laid between the old and new bridges at Khandepar. “The tidal influence reaches till the place where the proposed pipeline is marked,” the GCZMA stated.

The authority has also asked the company to refer to a report by the Mangrove Society of India on mangrove risk assessment and restoration plan for rivers. “The proponent must follow all the recommendations,” it told Goa Natural Gas.

PATNA: A 14-year-old boy committed suicide in Gopalganj district on Friday morning allegedly after being scolded by his family members for playing online game PUBG.

Police said the Himanshu Kumar, a Class IX student of Gopalganj Kendriya Vidyalaya, was found hanging with the ceiling fan in his room at Rajendra Nagar under Town police station of Gopalganj town.

The victim’s relatives told the police that Himanshu was spotted playing the online game till 1am on Friday. He was very upset over frequently losing the game and was subsequently scolded by the parents. “Prima facie it appears that the boy took the extreme step in frustration,” an investigating officer said.

No suicide note was recovered from the room, which was found locked from inside. “The family members are not cooperating with the police in the investigation and not willing to share more information. They are trying to conceal something,” the officer said.

Town police station house officer (SHO) Prashant Kumar Rai said police would quiz Himanshu’s father Pappu Kumar once the situation becomes normal in the family. A case of unnatural death (UD) has been lodged, the SHO said, adding that an FSL team collected samples from the spot.

Gopalganj sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Naresh Paswan said it was a case of suicide. The locals told the police that Himanshu was addicted to the online game and his parents used to scold him for wasting time and spoiling his career. “He had started showing indecent behaviour with some of his close relatives and preferred to live in solitude,” a police officer quoted a close relative as saying.

In another incident, a 22-year-old man was admitted to the Sadar hospital at Buxar on Wednesday after showing violent behaviour with his family members and close relatives. “The man’s father revealed that he was addicted to PUBG and had been upset after losing the game over the last three consecutive days,” a doctor attending on the boy said.

Expressing concern over the rise in the cases of addiction among children to the online game, an anthologist, Prof. S Narayan, said, “The parents must pay attention to the changes in the behaviour of their wards.”

He, however, attributed the reason for the rise in addiction cases among the children to parents’ time crunch and lack of interest among students in extracurricular activities.

Pune: The theme of this year’s annual installation at the Film and Television Institute of India ’s (FTII) will be “Prabhat to FTII”.

The installation, to be inaugurated on Saturday, will be on the institute’s historic journey from Prabhat Film Company to FTII as a part of its diamond jubilee year celebrations.

The installation will be jointly inaugurated by the FTII alumni of its oldest batch and family representatives of the owner-partners, Prabhat Film Company, at 2.30pm on Saturday, read a statement issued by the institute on Friday.

FTII alumni Kuldip Sud (sound recording, 1961), Mehboob Khan (editing, 1961), R M Rao (motion picture photography, 1961), Yogesh Mathur (editing, 1962) and Suresh Naik (motion picture photography, 1962) will be present during the occasion.

The original Prabhat partners were V Shantaram (fondly called Anna), Keshavrao Dhaibar, Sitarampant Kulkarni, Vishnupant Damle (also known as Damle Mama) and Sheikh Fattelal (popular as Saheb Mama).

The installation comprises two giant cameras covering a century of transformation, from Mitchell (20th century) to ARRI Alexa (21st century) representing Prabhat and FTII, respectively.

The replica also represents the technological changes from the early era of Indian cinema (Prabhat) to the present Indian film industry (FTII) .

“To absorb this experiential journey, the visit will start with ‘entering’ into the Mitchell camera through its lens and lens hood, which would lead into the instrument’s body. Glimpses of the Prabhat Film Company and Prabhat era will be displayed through a photographic exhibition in the camera body chamber,” FTII director Bhupendra Kainthola said.

“Further inside the exhibit, Maharashtra’s unique ‘wada’ interior has been created inside the camera body to enhance the overall environment. When exiting the exhibition during the Prabhat era, a narrow passage will lead to the FTII era. Several iconic moments of the institute since 1961 will be on display as part of a photographic exhibition,” he said.

The concept, design and execution of this installation is by Ashutosh Kavishwar . He is part of the FTII’s department of art direction and production design.

454,['14/03/2020'],Four held for attacking man over dispute during Holi revelry in Pune,"PUNE: The Koregaon Park police on Thursday night arrested four youths for abusing and attacking a 32-year-old hardware shop employee with a slab over a dispute during Holi revelry at the Residency Club here on Tuesday evening.

Zubair Kadlagi from Pargenagar in Kondhwa sustained serious injuries on his head and suffered two fractured ribs. He is recuperating in a private hospital.

A magisterial court on Friday sent Sikander Shaikh (21), Atique Sayyed (21), Allahbaksh Jamadar (18) and Rohan Reddy (22), all from Keshavnagar , in police custody remand till March 16.

The club’s general manager, Sanjay Singh , told TOI, “The security officials told me that no such incident had taken place inside the club on March 10.”

When TOI contacted Zubair over phone, his brother said, “My brother is not keeping well. He is suffering from severe pain and is not in a position to talk.”

Sub-inspector Shrikant Gaurav from Koregaon Park police said, “The suspects are all known to each other. They had visited the club to play Holi even though they were not official members. They got access inside the club because of a reference given by a club employee, who is a common friend of complainant Zubair and the suspects.”

Singh claimed, “No such employee has worked in the club in the past six years. We don’t know why the club’s name has figured in the police complaint. The police have not visited the club to conduct an inquiry.”

Zubair, in his FIR, said, “I had visited the club to meet my friend around 4.30pm. I played Holi with him and his other friends (suspects). My friend left the club about 7.30pm. I then washed the colours and was leaving the club when my friends urged me to play Holi with them. I requested them not to throw colours at me but they picked up an argument with me and hurled abuses at me.”

“The suspects beat me and hit me with a slab (tile) on my head and ribs and fled. I then called my friend who rushed me to the Sassoon General Hospital. My family members later shifted me to a private hospital,” the FIR stated.

Sub-inspector Gurav said, “The incident happened because the complainant had refused to play Holi with the suspects for the second time and one of them attacked him with a slab. We are questioning the youths to establish their individual role in the crime.”

“We have arrested the four for voluntarily causing grievous hurt among other charges of the Indian Penal Code ,” he added.

According to guidelines set by the ministry of housing and urban affairs, which releases these pan-India rankings, the more projects a city completes within stipulated time, the higher position it secures.

Lucknow Municipal Corporation officials said, following the Union ministry guidelines, the civic body had set for itself a target of 10 Smart City projects between October 1, 2019, and March 1, 2020.

Among these, the LMC completed seven — a smart bus shelter, a command and control centre, smart roads, pelican crossings, an e-library, compactors at open dumping points and merchandised sweeping of roads. The three other projects underway are area-based development of Kaiserbagh, smart parking and installing automatic variable signboards to guide commuters.

“Area-based development in Kaiserbagh is going on at a rapid pace. Also, we are going to float tenders for automatic commuter signboards by the end of this month,” said general manager, Smart City projects, Fareed Zaidi.

In terms of UP cities, Lucknow has dropped a rank though. Compared to its fourth position in the state in the last assessment, the city stands fifth this time after Agra (1st), Kanpur (3rd), Varanasi (7th) and Prayagraj (12th).

KOCHI: The high court on Friday asked why the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General ( CAG ) pointing out missing of bullets and rifles from Kerala Police was handed over to the central government.

Considering a public interest litigation seeking a CBI or NIA probe, a division bench comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly asked under what circumstance the report was handed over to the home ministry. The report should have been handed over to the legislative assembly of the state as per Constitutional provisions and the CAG should not have tried to overcome the powers of the legislative assembly, the bench said. CAG’s reports on finance, performance, and compliance are to be submitted to the respective legislative assembly as per law, the court said while pointing out that there is a Supreme Court order specifying so.

During the hearing, assistant solicitor general had submitted to the court on behalf of the central government that the CAG report was handed over to the home ministry. State government had contended before the court that no other authority, including the court, can intervene in a matter that is under consideration of the legislative assembly.

State government had also informed the court that a crime branch probe launched on the basis of the allegations in the CAG report is progressing. The investigation is going in the right direction. The CAG report is being considered by the public accounts committee of the legislative assembly, the government had submitted through an affidavit.

In the PIL filed through advocate R Krishna Raj, P P Ramachandra Kaimal of Changanassery had contended that the alleged missing of 25 rifles and 12,061 live cartridges is a matter affecting the security of the citizens and national security. It was alleged by the petitioner that no steps have been taken by the authorities to trace and recover the missing rifles and bullets.

According to the PIL, the report by the CAG had mentioned a shortage of 25 5.56mm INSAS rifles and 12,061 live cartridges, which includes 1,835 cartridges for INSAS rifles and 1,578 cartridges for AK-47 rifles. It was also found out that out of the missing cartridges, 250 9mm drill cartridges were replaced by dummy bullets, the petition had stated. However, state government had replied in court that no rifles are missing. By Friday, the hearing on the PIL was completed and the case has been reserved for pronouncing orders.

AURANGABAD: Among the allegations of over a lakh names missing from the voters’ list, MIM group leader and Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) corporator Gangadhar Dhage said that his and the names of 24 of his family members are missing from the first voters’ list.

On March 9, the AMC had published the draft voters’ list for the civic elections to be held in April. According to the election department of the AMC, the draft voters’ list was the same that was used for the state assembly elections which were held in October 2019. The list was broken down into 115 wards of the municipal corporation.

Dhage said that he was shocked when he found his name missing from the list. He belongs to ward no. 31 — Jai Bhim Nagar, Asifiya Colony. However, his astonishment knew no bounds when he found out that the names of 24 of his family members were also not in the list. “I have been living in Jai Bhim Nagar, Asifiya Colony ward with my family for the last 65 years, but could not find our names in the voters’ list published by the AMC,” Dhage.

Earlier, he had raised objections to the draft voters’ list stating that 1,500 names from Jai Bhim Nagar, Asifiya Colony ward have been moved to ward no 12 Aref Colony, Pragati Colony. However, he could not find his or his family members names in the list of that ward either, he said. Dhage demanded that the officials responsible for the botch up be suspended.

Earlier, former corporator Sameer Rajurkar had alleged that more than 1 lakh voters have been omitted from the voters’ list by the AMC’s election department. Sitting corporators Shabnam Kaleem Qureshi, Malika Habib Qureshi and Khatija Qureshi of the same family, including activist Kaleem Qureshi, were left out of the voters’ list.

Later during the day, municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey suspended four employees of the municipal corporation, including Sudarshan Ghule , assistant teacher, Ajay Yara , junior clerk, Syed Javed, Syed Chand, teaching staff and Vilas Badghane , health worker, for failing to execute their duties properly. The action has been taken under section 4 of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act.

The municipal commissioner also issued showcause notices to deputy municipal commissioner Ravindra Nikam, sectional engineer KN Katkar and junior engineer Jagdish Padalkar for discrepancies in voters’ lists.

PUNE: Mahatma Gandhi ’s views and philosophy, old films and web series have come to the rescue of the Covid-19 patients quarantined at Naidu Hospital .

The first Covid-19 patients in Pune, a couple and their daughter, are waiting patiently for their isolation period to get over. The couple has spent over four days while their daughter has spent three days in isolation at the facility.

Doctors have been visiting them regularly for two days and on Friday, a panel of doctors and experts came for a check-up. They were told that their cases would be studied and decisions made.

Since they have the time, the husband has requested friends for books and is currently reading the biography of Gandhi while his wife has downloaded old films on her cellphone. The daughter has also renewed her Netflix subscription to watch web series.

The quality of food they get has improved and since they are maintaining good health, the family is now waiting to be discharged. They hope the two tests coming up are favourable.

“It is our fourth day in the hospital. We have organised ourselves and found ways to keep ourselves engaged. In the last two days, my wife downloaded some movies on her cellphone and has been watching them. I speak to my friends and colleagues on social media, some call me and check on our health status. They dropped some books at the hospital and I am reading the biography of Mahatma Gandhi,” the man added.

Their daughter had downloaded a web series from Netflix and is watching the episodes apart from the routine like taking medicines, having food on time and doing the health checks.

Their son who tested negative but was quarantined as a precaution was in another building of the hospital. He too had his cellphone and was watching web series.

The quality of food had improved, the bed covers and linen were up to the mark and there was no reason to complain, they said. The husband said, “ Our samples will be sent once again for testing in 3-4 days and after that report, another sample will be sent to double check our recovery. Only then will they plan to discharge us.” Doctors have instructed them about the care and precautions they should take after discharge from the hospital.

The cab driver who drove the couple and their daughter from Mumbai to Pune on March 1 and another patient quarantined at the same hospital have been exercising regularly in the evening to improve their immunity.

The fifth positive person, who was admitted in Pune, said, “I did not even have any symptoms and I feel fit now. I came here since I was in contact with a person with Covid-19 and I tested positive, but healthwise I am just fine.”

He said, much of his time is spent on the phone as he gets numerous calls from colleagues, friends and family.

Some of them, who came in contact with him, are calling to ask about the symptoms while friends call to check on his health status. He said his colleagues had tested negative for the contagion. “I am avoiding the news channels. I’d rather spend time exercising so that I feel healthy and fit,” he said.

460,['14/03/2020'],Hyderabad: Chance to run PM Narendra Modi’s twitter handle a nod for my work says Kalpana Ramesh,"Kalpana at an interactive session

HYDERABAD: City-based architect and a volunteer with SAHE (Society for Advancement of Human Endeavour) Kalpana Ramesh , who was recently selected as the PM’s ‘magnificent seven’ on Women’s Day, says she felt empowered by the oppurtunity and saw it as an acknowledgment of her work.

“I have been working on this mission to conserve water for the last eight years and to be selected to be a part of a small group of seven persons came as a huge surprise and honour. I also think water conservation is very close to the PM’s heart,” she said.

The dependence of people on water tankers was something that worried her after she moved to Hyderabad from the US more than a decade ago. “I noticed that residents in my locality in Gachibowli were heavily dependent on tankers. I began harvesting rainwater. In 2016, despite four months of intense summer, we did not requisition a single tanker. ”

The ‘Save 10k Bores’ initiative that was spearheaded by her has also helped revive defunct borewells with the help of rainwater. By directing rainwater to a harvesting pit, several borewells have been revived through community initiatives.

Taken aback by the condition of the lakes in the city, the water warrior says that most of the lakes have turned into cesspools. “During the TedX Salon event, I saw Gandipet lake which was sufficient to meet the city’s water requirements. With the lake going dry during summer, we are moving from one water body to another to meet our needs. We cannot go on sucking out the resources,” she said.

The Panaji parade was cancelled last year following the demise of chief minister Manohar Parrikar.The Panaji Shigmotsav Samiti decided to go ahead with the parade on Saturday evening. When asked about health issues in the wake of the Covid-19, ex-officio chairman Sanjit Rodrigues said precautions and advisories issued by the health ministry and disseminated to people must be followed.Following a meeting held by the Panaji Shigmotsav Samiti with all troupe leaders on Friday morning, Rodrigues said the Shigmo parade should abide by rules and avoid any violation of the code of conduct currently in force due to the zilla panchayat elections scheduled for March 22.“In the midst of an election code, timing is a serious issue. We should abide by the timing. We would not be able to support any violation of the timings with the code enforced. In the meeting with all troupe leaders, we impressed upon them to start at 4.30pm sharp and finish at 10pm - the time allotted by the administration,” Rodrigues said.Addressing the media after the meeting, Rodrigues said that lack of discipline on the parade route as well as delay in timing will destroy the charm of the festival. “It’s almost inhuman to keep people - elders and young kids - waiting beyond midnight. The committee took this into consideration. A lot of representations have been received regarding timings and discipline along the route,” he said.Each troupe will have one volunteer and police constable with them to maintain the time and rhythm of the parade flow, he added.“Members of the committee are also keen that timing is followed because this inconveniences everybody, both the organisers and spectators,” Rodrigues said.The parade route has been shortened by 1km and will follow the Caculo island - 18th June route, and turn left on the Azad Maidan stretch along Swami Vivekananda road from Panaji municipal corporation office junction. The old route along Panaji municipal garden and MG road to Azad Maidan will not be used.The committee instructed those transporting floats from South Goa to bring their floats past midnight to avoid any traffic congestion on the Zuari bridge that is already stressed with ongoing work and single laning.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/organisers-to-go-ahead-with-panaji-shigmo-amid-covid-19-concerns/articleshow/74620032.cms

KOCHI: The high court on Friday granted three-months’ bail to CPM local leader P K Kunhananthan , who is serving life term for the murder of party dissident TP Chandrasekharan .

Kunhananthan, 73, a native of Kunnothparamba panchayat in Kannur , was the Panoor area committee member of CPM. He was sentenced in January 2014 for the murder that took place on May 4, 2012.

A division bench comprising justices A Hariprasad and MR Anitha granted bail after considering Kunhananthan’s plea claiming that he is suffering from serious ailments and needs treatment outside jail. The court relied on a report by a medical board that said Kunhananthan is suffering from ailments. While granting bail, the high court has directed Kunhananthan to be present at the jurisdictional police station once in two weeks and to sign a register there.

An appeal filed by Kunhananthan, who was convicted by a trial court for conspiracy, is pending before the high court. The trial court had sentenced him to life imprisonment and fined Rs1 lakh.

In his plea, Kunhananthan had sought to stay his sentence in view of his health condition and to allow him bail. He has already served a jail term of seven years and seven months and availing treatment outside the jail is essential for saving his life, the plea had stated.

The Indian Institute of Technology ( IIT ), Goa, for instance, has decided to conduct classes online from March 16-31 for all its BTech, MTech and PhD students, and the Goa Institute of Management (GIM), Sakhali, has postponed its convocation ceremony.

Both, IIT and the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Goa, have also restricted student movements outside campus.

“Disinfection of the canteen, the mess, the academic buildings and all such commonly used areas has already begun. Students and faculty are not allowed to travel internationally and have been also told to reduce their domestic travel. Sports events, conferences and any activity that involves a group gathering at one place have been cancelled, too,” IIT Goa dean Sachin Kore, said.

He also said that a health check-up for all students on campus is ongoing and self-service of food in the canteen has been discontinued to ensure hygiene. The institute has even restricted campus entry to visitors.

Director of NIT Goa, Gopal Mugeraya, said students have been told to restrict their movements within the campus at Farmagudi. They’ve also been instructed not to venture outside.

GIM, in a statement, said it has postponed its convocation ceremony that was slated to be held this month. It has also suspended all student exchange programmes to universities abroad and international internships.

“The institute will assist with identifying summer internship opportunities within India instead. All international travel is to be reviewed and decided upon keeping in mind the advisory issued by the central health ministry. Remote meeting arrangements using secure, approved technology is advised,” GIM has said.

If anyone has recently returned from international travel, they must self-isolate for 14 days, the institute has told its students and faculty.

Power distributions companies in the state are running into huge losses and have demanded a 15% tariff hike in domestic power consumption.

While transmission and distribution losses continues to be the cash-strapped discom’s Achilles heel outstanding payments from government bodies is another major problem. Earlier, in reply to a question on the issue by BJP MLA, Ajay Bishnoi, during the last session of MP assembly, energy minister Priyavrat Singh had said, “The demand letters of Rs121.41 crore, Rs330.31 crore and Rs152.98 crore for the years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 (till August) had been issued to the railways, but we are still waiting for the payment. Overall, Rs882.03 crore is outstanding with railways since January 2016 when permission for open access was given to them. ”

There are provisions in the Electricity Act that if any industrial consumer is procuring power from open access, then the consumer is liable to pay a cross-subsidy, as determined by the regulatory commission of the respective state.

The concept of cross-subsidy is very simple. In normal tariff determination, the domestic and agricultural consumers are provided tariff at low rates, and the industrial consumers get power at higher rates.

For example, if the power procurement rate is Rs5 per unit, then the discoms can sell it to domestic and agricultural users at rates which are 20% lower than the procurement rate which comes around to Rs4 per unit, and the same is recovered from the industrial consumers by selling power at 20% higher rates. Thus, the effective rate of power sales comes to Rs5/unit said sources.

Besides these, there is an additional surcharge, which is recovered from open access consumers. Power discoms have industrial consumers and on the basis of existing consumers, discoms go into long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). But if the same consumers opt for open access, then discoms lose the consumers. But the PPAs, which are long-term, are legally bound, hence discoms have to pay the fixed charges against the PPAs even if it does not buy power because its industrial consumers have shifted to open access.

Thus, to recover this loss, there is a provision of additional surcharge, added sources.

472,['14/03/2020'],Sensors in Kaiserbagh sewers to prevent overflow,"Lucknow: If Jal Sansthan has its way, Kaiserbagh will boast a ‘smart sewage system’ by April-end that will not only prevent overflowing of sewers, but also detect leaks.

A sensor-based underground drainage monitoring system is being procured for Rs 3.12 crore and will cover a 4.5km stretch in Kaiserbagh as a part of area-based development under the Smart City mission.

According to Jal Sansthan officials, the network of sensors will be installed along sewers and on manhole covers. If a sensor detects a leak, it will transmit an alert to the Smart City control room with the exact location of the damaged pipe, thus enabling authorities to fix the problem at the earliest and helping them prevent sewage spill.

Sensors under manhole covers will also detect rising level of sewage owing to blockage or excess water inflow, if any. As soon as sewage crosses a danger mark, the control room will receive an alert. This will once again help the authorities to take swift remedial measures before roads are soiled.

The underground drainage monitoring system in Kaiserbagh is a pilot project and will later be introduced in other Old City areas such as Daliganj, Golaganj, Wazirganj and Nazirabad.

“The new system is expected to start from April-end. At present, we are laying sewer lines. After that, we will install the sensors along with a private agency hired for the job,” said Jal Sansthan project manager Piyush Kumar. Once the project is commissioned, Lucknow will become the second city in India after Visakhapatnam to have a smart sewage system.

“The prime minister must make a public statement on his assurance of protecting Goa’s interest on Mhadei and resumption of mining, as claimed by Sawant after his meeting,” state Congress president Girish Chodankar said.

A day earlier, Sawant met Modi in Delhi and said the prime minister had said that both these issues affecting the state would be addressed.

Calling Sawant’s meeting with Modi “another jumla to woo voters” ahead of the March 22 zilla elections, Chodankar said, “BJP has mastered the art of fooling people and this visit to Delhi is part of the same. In his meeting with the prime minister, Mhadei and mining issues were never discussed as mischievously disclosed by Sawant.”

He said Sawant and BJP expect “imminent defeat in the ZP polls” since both the Central and state governments have failed to resolve issues pertaining to the state.

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has said that water collection has increased significantly over the last few days even as almost half of the water consumers do not pay taxes.

Incidentally, the water tax recovery over the last three years was affected as the data of water consumers was not shared by the Aurangabad City Water Utility Co. Ltd (ACWUCL) which managed water supply of city for two years until September 2016.

In January, the civic body received data of 1.35 lakh water consumers of the city from the water company in exchange of the payment of the company’s outstanding dues.

According to AMC tax officer Karan Chavan, the data has allowed the civic body to issue water bills to the consumers and, subsequently, the tax recovery has increased. “For financial year 2019-20, the AMC has registered a recovery of Rs 26.18 crore towards water tax. The collection is expected to increase by another Rs 10 to 15 crore,” Chavan said.

The data from the water works department of the municipal corporation shows 1.35 lakh registered water consumers. However, the actual number of water consumers is much higher. “There has not been any survey to bring all the water consumers on record,” Kiran Dhande , head of water works department, said.

The number of illegal water connections are estimated around 1.2 lakh.

Those paying taxes regularly have expressed discontent over the biased approach of the civic body in tax recovery.

The last drive against illegal water connections was carried out by the AMC in June 2019. When asked about the action on illegal connections, Chavan said that due to financial year-end, most staff is engaged in tax recovery work. “The drive can be conducted after March-end when the staff is available,” Chavan said. He said that the self-assessment drive of the municipal corporation has also reaped good response. The drive has seen 20,000 property holders pro-actively declaring their property details under which there is a section for tap water connection too.

BHUBANESWAR: Amid public outcry over deposit of Rs 545 crore of Puri Jagannath Temple in the crisis-hit Yes Bank, an assembly committee was constituted on Friday. It would submit a memorandum to the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India governor regarding release of the temple money.

The committee is expected to meet soon to discuss its course of action.

Though the opposition members demanded a House committee probe into the deposit of Rs 545 crore of Jagannath Temple fund in Yes Bank, there is no clarity on whether the committee would inquire into the matter or only submit memorandum to seek release of funds. “Once all the 12 members of the committee meet, they would discuss the areas on which the committee will work in the days to come,” said committee member and government chief whip Pramila Mallik.

Earlier when the House assembled at 10:30am, members of the opposition BJP stalled the question hour, demanding formation of a House committee to take a call on the deposit of the temple funds. As the opposition members continued sloganeering in the well of the House, speaker Surya Narayan Patro adjourned the question hour till 11:30am.

Majhi said the state government is trying to run away, apprehending more criticisms over deposit of the temple funds in the crisis-hit bank. Senior Congress leader Suresh Routray said the Congress party take to the the streets if the state government fails to release the Jagannath Temple funds from the Yes Bank within a month. Both BJP and Congress had cornered the state government over the issue during an adjournment debate in the assembly on Thursday while state finance minister Niranjan Pujari had clarified that the money was deposited in Yes Bank after the it had agreed to give highest interest rate. A number of outfits on Friday hit the streets at the state capital and in Puri over the issue.

and came down heavily on the state government. The Puri district Congress committee members also met governor Ganeshi Lal, demanding safe release of the temple funds.

479,['14/03/2020'],Airport operators seek to levy ‘corona surcharge’,"More on Covid-19

NEW DELHI: In a controversial move, private airport operators have sought levy of a corona surcharge to cover for the extra expenses being incurred by them on screening passengers amid a massive decline in air traffic — and hence their revenues from both aeronautical and non-aero streams — following the outbreak of the epidemic.The Association of Private Airport Operators (APAO) represents the PPP airports at Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Cochin, and greenfield airports coming up in Navi Mumbai and Mopa in Goa.However, International Air Transport Association (IATA) slammed this demand. “India’s private airports need to do a reality check on their suggestion to impose a new levy at a time when passenger demand is plummeting on account of the Covid-19 outbreak. What is needed now are relief measures to help the aviation industry, and eventually when the situation is resolved to look at ways to grow demand, instead of a self-serving interest in protecting profits without recognizing what is happening in the world around us. It is imperative that we focus on reducing the overall cost of travel and work collectively to identify mutual cost saving opportunities,” said Amitabh Khosla, IATA country director for India.Given the large-scale cancellation of flights by airlines globally due to travel disruptions caused by Covid-19, the European Commission (EC) has temporarily suspended the 80/20 “use it or lose it” rule for airport slots till June 2020. Under this rule, if an airline doesn’t use 80% of slots allotted to it the airport operator may give them away to other carriers.Citing difficulties faced by Indian airport operators, Airport Council International (ACI) director-general Stefano Baronci wrote to aviation minister HS Puri on Friday seeking relief: “Reduce airport taxes on a per passenger basis … consider on a case-by-case basis to waive concession fees that the private airport operator has to [pay] to government.”In his letter, Baronci requested “a more pondered approach with respect to the airlines’ proposal to waive the 80/20 rule for current winter and forthcoming summer season. We are sympathetic with the airlines’ needs to avoid flying empty airplanes simply to retain airport slots … this should not jeopardise connectivity of passengers.”The APAO has written to aviation secretary PS Kharola, seeking levy of “a nominal passenger facilitation charge as part of airline fares to cover increased operating expenses being incurred by the operators.” The ACI World Airport Traffic Forecasts 2019-2040 projects revenue loss of $3 billion globally due to Covid-19.While revenues are falling, “ensuring compliance with government advisories on screening of passengers has required airports to significantly beef up its manpower deployment at airports as well as make expenditure on various items like masks, sanitizers and floor cleaners,” Nayar’s letter said.“This is unlike airlines which have got one major compensatory stream in terms of significantly reduced (more than 50%) crude oil prices,” it said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74620676,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-119331,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/airport-operators-seek-to-levy-corona-surcharge/articleshow/74620669.cms

The rush piqued with around 900 people submitting their nominations.

The first day of the nomination filing process, March 11 had seen a paltry 24 nominations being filed. On March 12, more than 300 candidates submitted their nominations.

The delay in filing nominations and the consequent rush at the last minute is being ascribed to the reservation process put in place by the district administration.

With 49 of 98 wards of GVMC allocated to women, political parties found the search for suitable candidates a herculean task. This led to a delay in selection and thereby filing of nominations.

Moreover, the parties also sought to maintain confidentiality, apprehensive that those who don’t get tickets might rebel.

With political parties releasing their list of candidates at the last minute, there was a huge inflow of candidates at GVMC offices to file nominations.

The degree of the rush can be ascertained by the fact that officials had to give tokens to around 300 candidates, who could not file nominations before 3pm (the deadline), but had arrived in the offices. GVMC officials processed nominations till ______pm.

VMRDA metropolitan commissioner P Koteswara Rao, who is also the GVMC commissioner in-charge, said that GVMC has set up 1,712 polling stations for municipal polls.

“A total of 204 routes have been identified for the smooth conduct of elections. 234 route officers, including reserve officers, will oversee proceedings in all these 204 states,” Koteswara Rao said.

The nominations will be scrutinised on March 14, while deadline for the withdrawal of candidature is March 16 (till 3pm). The elections will be conducted on March 23 where over 17 lakh people are expected to vote.

“I request route officers to visit the poll stations assigned to them and get acquainted with the routes ahead of the elections,” he said while adding, “Coordination with zonal officers and other election personnel is crucial in order to make sure that there are no glitches in the election process.”

Koteswara Rao asked officials attending to election duties to apply for postal ballots. The officials will have to submit Form-XXI to the concerned returning officer a week before the elections (March 23), he informed.

Meanwhile, GVMC additional commissioner Thameem Ansariya visited zone-1 and zone-2 to monitor election arrangements. She asked polling personnel to arrange the election material ward-wise in order to easily identify shortages.

During the meeting, members of the trust board spoke about issues regarding the annual Kalyanotsavam and the Chandanotsavam events. Chairperson Sanchaita stressed upon the need to provide better amenities to visiting devotees.

Speaking on the occasion, Sanchaita said, “We wish to do away with the VIP culture and give greater importance and better facilities to common devotees. One must not forget that the Simhachalam deity is revered by the people of north-coastal AP as well as others.”

With regard to the arrangements being made for the annual Kalyanotsavam and Chandanotsavam, the newly-constituted board gave inputs of how to better manage the festivities.

All 16 board members were present on the occasion. This is the first board meeting after over a decade. The Simhachalam Devasthanam did not have an appointed board for a while. The new board was sworn in on March 3 this year after a major reshuffle which had taken many by surprise.

YSRC’s local bodies’ elections in-charge Dadi Veerabhadra Rao had already announced 40 names earlier. The remaining 58 names were announced on Friday. YSRC reportedly conducted surveys twice at wards before finalising the list.

Dadi Veerabhadra Rao and tourism minister M Srinivasa Rao (Avanthi) asked candidates and party cadre to work hard to ensure a clean sweep for the party. They asked aspirants whose names did not feature in the list to not get discouraged.

Party sources said that the YSRC is fielding people from backward classes (BCs) and scheduled caste (SC) communities for general seats as well.

Now, there are at least half a dozen candidates from YSRC in the race for the mayor’s post including tourism minister M Srinivasa Rao’s daughter Priyanka, Tippala Nagireddy’s son Vamsi, Saragadam Chinaappala Naidu and Vamsikrishna Srinivas.

Meanwhile, sources within TDP said that the names will be released within a day or two. Sources further informed that Pendurthi MLA Gandi Babji has filed the nomination from ward number 95 and senior TDP leader Peela Srinivas has filed nominations from ward 97. Both candidates are apparently in a race for the mayor’s post.

There was some tension at the Madhurawada zone 1 office on Friday when tourism minister Avanthi’s daughter Priyanka entered the office directly while candidates of other parties were waiting their turn with tokens in their hands. Gajuwaka MLA’s son Vamsi also filed his nomination on Friday.

Till the end, the number of nominations is expected to reach 1,500. BJP has announced 49 candidates as their share. Jana Sena, its alliance partner is yet to make the names of their candidates’ public.

Very few people were found wearing masks in Kalaburagi city.Most small traders and merchants kept their stores open, and did not register a marked dip in their turnover despite the panic over the outbreak of the disease.The only discernible difference was in the turnout at the Sharanabasaveshwara Mela, a religious fare that is attended by nearly one lakh devotees every year. However, following restrictions clamped down by the district administration – the officials also appealed to the temple authorities to scale down the affair – the ritual was a markedly low-profile affair on Friday. Despite the temple authorities reaching out to the people to avoid coming to the fair, there was a considerable turnout.Shivalingappa H, one of the devotees who turned up at the Sharanabasaveshwara shrine on Friday, said that he had been coming to the temple for the ritual for the past many years, and did not want to snap the tradition owing to Covid-19. “To me, seeking the Almighty’s blessings is more important than the virus,” he said.Revanna Siddappa, who lives in a village not very far from Kalaburagi city, said, “I come to the city every day.

492,['14/03/2020'],PeTA asks Karnataka government to take cognisance of cruel methods used to kill poultry,"Belagavi: Gripped by panic over the outbreak of the novel coronavirus or Covid-19, coupled with reports of bird flu in the country, poultry farmers across the state have taken to culling their livestock en masse. Taking cognisance of this panic-driven activity, People for Ethical Treatment for Animals ( PeTA ), India on Thursday wrote to the Karnataka government, seeking directions to stop culling of livestock using cruel and illegal means.

Among the more shocking incidents reported in the state was from Gokak in Belagavi, where a farmer buried 6,000 chickens alive on March 9. In all, roughly 16,000 chickens have reportedly been culled across Karnataka in the past week, and in many cases, the methods used to end their life have been brutal. Under these circumstances, PeTA India has urged the Karnataka department of animal husbandry to take note of the scale of the problem, and pursuant steps to put an end to the same.

Stressing the need to cull livestock in a humane manner, wherein they experience the least amount of pain possible, PeTA, in its letter, stated, “The department must promote methods of culling recommended by the Animal Welfare Board of India, the central government’s advisory body and the World Organisation for Animal Health, the international agency responsible for keeping a close watch on animal health across the world, and India is a member nation of this body.”

The animal rights body pointed out that killing of poultry using methods such as burying them alive was in violation of Sections 3 and 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, and Section 429 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Violation of these laws can invite punishment as stringent as imprisonment for up to five years.

Veterinarian and PeTA India chief executive officer Dr Manilal Valliyate, in a mail to TOI, wrote, “The savagery displayed by the farmers is yet another stark reminder to the public that, regardless of how one goes about it – burying them alive or slitting throats – chickens are always killed in a cruel manner. Poultry farms breed bird flu and other diseases. Chickens used for production of eggs are also commonly mutilated, starved and severely confined. The condition of those used for the meat industry is worse as they are housed in filthy sheds. They are fed, and bred in such a manner that they grow to be so large wherein their bones cannot take the load, and they grow more prone to heart attacks. We urge the public to spare themselves and the chickens this misery by choosing to eat only vegan food.”

PeTA India has also interacted with the authorities concerned to communicate to farmers the need to report outbreak of diseases in their barns. “They must visit the nearest government veterinary hospital so that methods animals are killed in accordance with the rules of the Animal Welfare Board of India,” Dr Valliyate added.

493,['14/03/2020'],Price of jackfruit spirals up in Mysuru,"Mysuru: Amid a fall in chicken rate, the price of tender jackfruit has increased four folds in the city market in the past few days. An average sized tender jackfruit, which was sold for Rs 5-10 two weeks ago, is now being sold for Rs 20 to 40.

According to the vendors, the sudden spike in the rate is due to a huge demand for the tender jackfruit from neighbouring states including Maharashtra while others feel that a low yield resulted in the price hike.

G Karunakaran, principal scientist & incharge head, central horticultural experiment station, Hirehalli, Tumakuru, confirmed the sudden spurt in the rate. “The tender jackfruit, which was available for Rs 5 and 10 have reached Rs.40,” he said.

“The tender jackfruit have several health benefits. That could be the reason for the huge demand in the market,” he said.

“I don't know the exact reason for the rate increase. But from Tumakuru market, tender jackfruit is supplied in huge quantity to Maharashtra,” he said.

Even local growers in Mysuru said that there is a sudden increase in the demand for the tender jackfruit and the rate is also very attractive. “Earlier, we used to sell them through vendors. But now the agents are approaching us. For a kilogram, we are offered nearly Rs 20-.25. Earlier, it was just Rs 5. The agents are saying that the demand has increased in Tamil Nadu, Andhra, etc, said Siddramappa, a farmer from Kemmanahalli on Bogadi-Gadige Road.

A few experts feel that the sudden jump in the rate may be the result of low yield. “Compared to previous years, this year, the yield is less. That may be the one of the reasons for the rate increase,” said G Krishnaprasad of Sahaja Samrudha organisation.

494,['14/03/2020'],Rangayana seeks Kukkarahalli Lake land to hold events,"Mysuru: Citing shortage of space to host various camps, Rangayana , the theatre repertory, has requested University of Mysore to provide the adjacent Kukkarahalli Lake land for the events .

Every year, Rangayana hosts a summer camp after completion of schools exams in April.

The camp is generally held for children in the age group of 7 to 14 years where only 300 children are admitted under first-come-first basis. During the camp, children are exposed to theatre, acting, singing, folk, painting, games, environmental issues and various others activities.

While Rangayana hosts various activities during the summer camp for children, the authorities claim that it is facing shortage of space to host all the events.

As the lush green Kukkarahalli Lake area is maintained and managed by University of Mysore, the theatre group has requested the university authorities to provide nearly an acre land of the lake on the south part of the Rangayana premises near Bhoomigeetha auditorium.

Rangayana director Addanda C Cariappa told TOI that they have requested the university authorities to provide lake area which is adjacent to the Rangayana.

“We have requested the area near the food gallery. We conduct Chinnara Mela and there will be huge crowd. Children who participate in the summer camp should not feel congested. So, we have requested some space which will be used only during the Chinnara Mela. University of Mysore vice-chancellor Hemanth Kumar has assured to provide the land,” he said.

When TOI contacted registrar R Shivappa, he said that the university has received the request from Rangayana seeking Kukkarahalli Lake land for hosting Chinnara Mela. “We have to think on the issue, ”he said.

However, environmentalists and morning walkers at the lake expressed disappointment by the demand by Rangayana. Morning walker Sunil said that the Kukkarahalli Lake area is the lung space where hundreds of people walk morning and evening time.

“It should be preserved and protected. There is enough space in Rangayana to host big events. University authorities should not permit to use the lake area as it will disturb the birds and animals but also damage the vegetation,” he said.

No decision yet on Chinnara Mela

The Rangayana is yet to take a decision on conducting Chinnara Mela this year due to coronavirus scare. The summer camp for kids is from April 11 to May 10. Rangayana director Addanda C Cariappa told TOI, “We will wait till March 25, watch the development on coronavirus situation, consult the government and take a call on whether to conduct Chinnara Mela or not.”
