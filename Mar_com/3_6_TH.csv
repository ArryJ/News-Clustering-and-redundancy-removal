0,2020/03/06,ISSF alerts about uncertainty of Delhi World Cup,"The international Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) has alerted the member nations about the proposal from the organisers of the World Cup in Delhi, scheduled to be held from March 15, to postpone the event to May/June, so as to help them plan their travel.

According to one of the points in the Indian government advisory, the visas of persons who have travelled to China, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Japan on or after February 1, 2020, and who have not entered India as on March 3, “stand suspended with immediate effect.’’

Keeping in mind the many travel restrictions following the outbreak of the coronavirus, and with the hope that the situation would be under control at a later stage, the organisers have proposed to hold the rifle and pistol World Cup from May 5 to 12, and the shotgun events from June 2 to 9.

Withdrawals

In a press release, the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) president Raninder Singh stated that 23 nations, 240 shooters and 114 accompanying officials had withdrawn from the confirmed original list, owing to the situation caused by the virus that has spread to 93 countries.

The NRAI stressed that it was compelled to suggest the postponement, especially owing to the possibility of some of the visiting shooters being kept in quarantine.

The ISSF stated that it was waiting for the approval of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the extension of the Olympic qualification period.

“In case of the IOC approval, the World Cups in Munich and Baku, can also influence the outcome of the Olympic qualification’’, said the ISSF statement, even as it reiterated that all Olympic quota places would be allocated by May 31.

Only the 12 quota places to be decided on world rankings and a possible small number of unused quota places would require reallocation after May.

The ISSF cautioned the members, about the need to be “very careful with air tickets bookings, hotel reservations and other travel expenses due to the uncertainty of the situation in order to avoid possible financial losses.’’",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/kcwk91/article31003622.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07RANIN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/issf-alerts-about-uncertainty-of-delhi-world-cup/article31003623.ece
1,2020/03/06,"Coronavirus impact: Delhi shooting World Cup postponed, Olympic test event cancelled","The World Cup will now be held in two parts before the Olympic Games - Rifle and Pistol competitions on May 5-12, 2020; Shotgun competitions - on June 2-9, 2020

The upcoming combined shooting World Cup in the national capital was on Friday postponed to May, while an Olympic test event in Tokyo stood cancelled due to the global novel Coronavirus outbreak.

The tournament, sanctioned by the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF), was to be held from March 15 to 25 in Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range. The Olympic Test event was scheduled to be held from April 16.

The World Cup will now be held in two parts before the Olympic Games.

“It is proposed to divide the World Cup in two parts and hold Rifle and Pistol competitions on May 5-12, 2020, while Shotgun competitions - on June 2-9, 2020,” the ISSF said in a statement.

The decision was taken after the tournament organisers National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) approached the ISSF with a proposal to postpone the event.

The development comes after the government imposed several restrictions on the entry of travellers from affected countries such as China, Italy, South Korea, Japan and Iran, in a bid to contain the coronavirus outbreak.

Internal Olympic qualification period

Considering the extraordinary situation, the ISSF has also requested the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to prolong the internal Olympic qualification period in order to ensure all shooters get equal chances of making it to the Games.

“In case of the IOC approval, the World Cups in Munich, Germany, and Baku, Azerbaijan, can also influence the outcome of the Olympic Qualification,” the ISSF said.

“It must be noted that all Qualification Quota Places, as planned, will be allocated by May 31, 2020,” the sport’s apex body added.

In all, 22 countries had pulled out of the Delhi event, an official in NRAI had earlier told PTI.

“While 22 was the last count till Thursday night, some counties who had withdrawn, have also reapplied for visas,” he said.

The Indian government’s list of guidelines states that the visa of all foreign nationals, who have visited the affected countries in the year 2020 and have not yet landed in India, will be cancelled.

The Delhi event was to be a combined World Cup for rifle/pistol and shotgun shooters.

In the wake of the Coronavirus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year, many sporting events across the world have been either cancelled or postponed in recent weeks.

Last week, India pulled out of the ISSF World Cup in Cyprus, citing the coronavirus threat.

The outbreak has so far claimed more than 3000 lives and infected close to 100,000 people across the world.

The ISSF had on Wednesday announced that the World Cup in Delhi won’t carry ranking points because athletes from all countries cannot participate following the health advisory issued by the Indian government.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/wyybt6/article31001964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHOOTING,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/coronavirus-impact-delhi-shooting-world-cup-postponed-olympic-test-event-cancelled/article31001965.ece

Poonawalla, who was handed over the baton in a colourful ceremony, assured the racing fraternity that he will strive his best to help racing in India in whatever capacity he can and work to get the GST reforms done.

“In this new atmosphere of friendship amongst the six turf authorities and to see that racing comes out of its dark moments in the quickest possible manner, we have pledged to help each other and look at personal advantage for our own centres,” said Poonawalla.

“All clubs have pledged their indulgence and total support to the Bangalore Turf Club who is going to Supreme Court in the month of May to save the race course land from a takeover effort by the Karnataka Government. This is the way forward in the new friendly atmosphere, which is one of my main endeavours, and it certainly will help racing to progress.

“For example, as regards regional totes and subsequently national tote, the Madras, Mysore and RWITC chairmen have decided to accommodate each other by setting aside whatever difficulty that may arise in the combined regional tote. Hitherto these things were not happening.

Tech giant Intel and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Friday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to digitally empower nearly 1 lakh students with Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration in India’s education system.

Initiatives include the roll-out of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) curriculum framework for grades VIII, IX and X for 22,000 schools, with the aim to empower 1 lakh students within 2020, the company said in a statement.

The curriculum is based on ‘Intel AI For Youth’, which is an immersive, hands-on learning programme using experiential methodologies covering both social and technological skills.

“AI has become a strategic imperative for worldwide economic growth and will continue to be one of the most crucial technologies of the future,” said Shweta Khurana, Director-Programmes, Partnerships and Policy Group at Intel India.

“Our collaboration with CBSE is a meaningful step towards enabling our youth to become digitally-empowered and effectively utilise emerging technologies such as AI to solve pressing local and global challenges,” Khurana added.

The MoU also stated that Intel along with CBSE will soon be launching a ‘National AI Olympiad’ to motivate young students to showcase their meaningful social impact solutions as evidence of achievement.

According to the company, it has been estimated that by 2030, AI, in all its applications, is predicted to contribute US$15.7 trillion to the global economy.

India’s own AI strategy identified artificial intelligence as an opportunity and solution provider for inclusive economic growth and social development.

The comprehensive programme called ‘Intel AI For Youth,’ aimed at empowering the young generation to become AI-ready.

Together with CBSE, the chip-making giant has curated an outcome-oriented AI curriculum for students of grade VIII and above.

The curriculum was piloted with eight schools, training youth to create AI projects focused on social impact in 2019, with the aim of empowering 1,00,000 students with AI-readiness skills in 2020.

“Our collaboration with Intel has helped us empower the youth with AI skills in an inclusive way and we hope to take this journey ahead in a big way in the coming years,” said Biswajit Saha, Director, Skill Education and Training, CBSE.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/i7y1b9/article31000162.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06NETINTEL,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/intel-joins-cbse-to-empower-1-lakh-indian-students-in-artificial-intelligence/article31000163.ece

A coronavirus themed Android app is on the prowl to infect mobile devices, according to cybersecurity solutions firm SonicWall.

The company said its research team observed malware writers misusing the coronavirus scare to propagate their malicious creations.

“An Android app that goes by the name Coronavirus has been spotted that requests the victim to re-enter the pin/pattern on the device and steals information, while repeatedly requesting for Accessibility Service capabilities,” it said in a statement.

With additional capabilities based on traces present in the code, the attacker can control the device remotely making this malware a RAT (Remote Access Trojan), the statement pointed out.

“This malware persistently tries to invade/embed itself in the device through multiple means,” it said.

Apple is reportedly planning to launch a 12.9-inch iPad Pro and multiple notebook models with Mini-LED backlit displays by the end of 2020.

Known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also mentioned that the company is developing six products with Mini-LED displays for release by the end of 2021 — 12.9-inch iPad Pro, 10.2-inch iPad, 7.9-inch iPad mini, 27-inch iMac Pro, 14-inch MacBook Pro and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, Mac Rumors reported on Thursday.

The report claimed that the iPhone maker would also adopt Mini-LED backlighting for “a few models of LCD monitors”, but it was unclear if that referred to the iMac/iMac Pro or standalone displays.

Earlier, Kuo had revealed that the iPhone maker was expected to release new iPad Pro models with rear 3D sensing in the first half of 2020.

Kuo in a research note with TF International Securities said the iPad Pro models will gain 3D sensing through the rear-facing camera system.

Apple is expected to use a time-of-flight system, which measures the time that it takes for light to bounce off objects in a room to generate a 3D map.

Meanwhile, the upcoming MacBook may be 5G-enabled models.

The Cupertino-based company is reportedly considering using a ceramic material for the 5G antenna board in its upcoming MacBook, although they cost six times more than metal ones. This would dramatically improve cellular reception and transmission speed.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/bspu90/article30998288.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06NETAPPLELOGO,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/apple-to-launch-129-inch-ipad-pro-macbooks-by-2020-end/article30998289.ece
10,2020/03/06,Robotic arm designed in China could help save lives on medical frontline during coronavirus outbreak,"The machine consists of a robotic arm on wheels that can perform ultrasounds, take mouth swabs and listen to sounds made by a patient’s organs, usually done with a stethoscope

Researchers at one of China’s top universities have designed a robot they say could help save lives on the frontline during the coronavirus outbreak.

The machine consists of a robotic arm on wheels that can perform ultrasounds, take mouth swabs and listen to sounds made by a patient’s organs, usually done with a stethoscope.

Such tasks are normally carried out by doctors in person. But with this robot, which is fitted with cameras, medical personnel do not need to be in the same room as the patient, and could even be in a different city.

“Doctors are all very brave,” said Tsinghua University Professor Zheng Gangtie, the robot’s chief designer. “But this virus is just too contagious ... We can use robots to perform the most dangerous tasks.”

The idea came to Zheng around the turn of the Lunar New Year. Wuhan had just been put on lockdown and the number of cases and deaths was rising rapidly every day.

As an engineer, Zheng wanted to do something to contribute to the relief effort. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, he heard from his friend, Dong Jiahong, executive president at Beijing’s Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, that the biggest problem was that of frontline workers getting infected.

If all goes to plan, the robot may be put to use on coronavirus patients in Wuhan from Sunday | Photo Credit: REUTERS

Gathering a team, Zheng set to work converting two mechanised robotic arms with the same technology used on space stations and lunar explorers. The robots were almost entirely automated, and could even disinfect themselves after performing actions involving contact, Zheng said.

“But the feedback from doctors was that it would be better for there to be less automation, as a personal presence would comfort and calm the patient,” he said.

The team now has two robots, which have been trialled by doctors at hospitals in Beijing. One is still at the team’s lab at the university, but the other is at the Wuhan Union Hospital, where doctors started training to use it on Thursday.

If all goes to plan, the robot may be put to use on coronavirus patients in Wuhan from Sunday, Zheng said. It would be joined on its ward rounds by a nurse or other member of staff.

Zheng would like to build more such robots but funding from the university has run out. The robots cost RMB 500,000 ($72,000) a piece to make. He does not plan on commercialising his robot design but hopes a company comes along to take that on.

China has sent tens of thousands of medical workers to the epicentre of the outbreak, Hubei province, state media say. More than 3,000 medical workers had been infected by late last month, including whistle-blower Li Wenliang, whose death in early February sparked a brief and rare outpouring of grief and rage on Chinese social media.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/p6uwq9/article30998157.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06NETROBOTCORONAVIRUS1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/robotic-arm-designed-in-china-could-help-save-lives-on-medical-frontline-during-coronavirus-outbreak/article30998159.ece

Chinese smartphone maker Realme on Thursday launched its Realme 6 series smartphones powered by 90Hz “ultra-smooth display” at a starting price of ₹12,999 — in an empty Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in the capital as the company took extra precaution and did not call the public owing to the growing coronavirus concerns.

Realme also unveiled its smart band in India with features like 2.4cm large colour display, real-time heart rate monitor, USB direct charge, smart notifications, intelligent sports tracker personalised dial face, sleep quality monitor and Realme Link App.

“Both Realme 6 and Realme 6 Pro have been manufactured in India based on our customer’s feedback,” said Madhav Sheth, CEO, Realme India.

“Thanks to our ‘Made in India’ capabilities, both Realme 6 and 6 Pro will be available not only online, but also offline across our preferred partners at the same time,” he added.

There are a total of six variants in the Realme 6 series.

While the 4GB RAM + 64GB storage variant of Realme 6 is priced ₹12,999, the 6+128GB variant will cost ₹14,999, while the 8+128GB variant is available at ₹15,999.

The Realme 6 Pro will cost ₹16,999, ₹17,999 and ₹18,999 for the 6+64, 6+128 and 8+128 variants respectively.

Realme 6 is powered by MediaTek Helio G90T chip, which will be available in two colour options — comet white and comet blue.

This smartphone, which will be equipped with three-card slots for two SIM cards and one SD card (up to 256GB), will go on sale from March 13, the company said.

Realme 6 Pro is the world’s first smartphone to come with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G mobile platform and is also equipped with three-card slots.

The Realme 6 Pro features 6 cameras in total, including dual wide angle front cameras and 64MP quad rear camera with 20x hybrid zoom capabilities.

Realme 6 Pro is available in two colour options — lightning blue and lightning orange.

Realme also unveiled its first-ever smart Band in its segment in India with features like 2.4cm (0.96-inch) large colour display, real-time heart rate monitor, USB direct charge, smart notifications, intelligent sports tracker personalised dial face and sleep quality monitor.

The band is priced at ₹1,499 and comes in three stylish colour strap options: black, yellow and green. Realme Link app is the central software platform for connecting smartphones and AIoT products, including four important terminal entrances: smart screens, smart speakers, smartwatches and smart headphones.

“Today, we are also introducing and adding Realme Band to our portfolio. This is our first wearable device in India, (aimed at) enhancing the health of our users and their daily lives. This will be one of the most complete and functional smart bands at its price,” Sheth said.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/ai33wp/article30998098.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06NETREALME,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/realme-6-series-with-90hz-display-smart-band-launched-in-india/article30998099.ece

The British government has called a meeting with sports governing bodies and broadcasters on Monday to discuss how they would cope with a broader outbreak of COVID-19, two people familiar with the situation said.

The department in charge of sport will meet with sporting officials to discuss all outcomes including the possibility that some events could be held behind closed doors, one source said.

The department declined to comment. A third person said they have been in regular dialogue with the government for some time.

Britain's four-phase plan for dealing with the virus is currently in its initial “containment” stage but preparations for the next phase - known as “delay” - are advanced.

A planning document published earlier this week said that in the delay phase government would consider taking action to reduce the number of large scale gatherings to help slow the spread of the disease throughout the population.

15,2020/03/06,Respect people’s rights during quarantines: United Nations,"UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet said the response to COVID-19 must place human dignity and rights at its centre.

Governments using lockdowns and quarantines to fight the deadly new coronavirus (COVID-19) must ensure people’s rights are respected and avoid unintended consequences, the UN rights chief said on Friday.

Michelle Bachelet said the response to COVID-19 must place human dignity and rights at its centre. Her office said lockdowns, quarantines and similar measures “should always be carried out in strict accordance with human rights standards and in a way that is necessary and proportionate”.

Ms. Bachelet’s comments came as the number of people infected worldwide neared 1,00,000 across 85 nations, with more than 3,300 lives lost.

Most deaths and infections are in China, where the virus first emerged late last year, prompting the country to quarantine entire cities, temporarily shut factories and close schools indefinitely.

The epidemic has since reached almost 90 countries, wreaking havoc on international business, tourism, sports events and schools – with almost 300 million students sent home worldwide.

“As a medical doctor, I understand the need for a range of steps to combat COVID-19, and as a former head of government, I understand the often difficult balancing act when hard decisions need to be taken,” Ms. Bachelet said. “However, our efforts to combat this virus won’t work unless we approach it holistically.”

16,2020/03/06,Coronavirus outbreak: China may soon lift quarantine in Hubei,"Ding Xiangyang, Deputy Secretary-General of China's State Council stressed that cases in Hubei still made up a huge proportion of the national toll.

China may soon lift the quarantine imposed on the province at the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak which has been under lockdown for more than a month, a senior government official hinted Friday.

India yet to share genome sequence data

Asked about the draconian measures taken in central Hubei province to contain the spread of the virus, Ding Xiangyang, Deputy Secretary-General of China's State Council, told journalists “the day everyone is waiting for will not be too far away”.

But Mr. Ding stressed that cases in Hubei — and its capital Wuhan where the virus emerged — still made up a huge proportion of the national toll.

Some 56 million people in Hubei have been effectively quarantined since late January, to stop the virus from spreading across the country when people returned to work from their hometowns after the extended Lunar New Year break. But new cases in Hubei and Wuhan have been on a downward trend.

For the first time since China started publishing cases of new infections, on Friday there were no new cases reported in Hubei outside Wuhan, with 126.

“I believe the day everyone is waiting for will not be too far away,” Mr. Ding said.

As the situation improves, the authorities will make adjustments, he said.

His remarks are the latest in a number of signs that life in China may soon begin returning to normal.

The small Hubei city of Chibi, south of Wuhan, removed road blocks on Friday after 19 days without new infections, allowing freer movement of traffic inside – but not out of – the city.

It also comes as some regions prepare to reopen schools from next week, after more than a month of closures across the country.

Qinghai province, spread across the Tibetan Plateau, announced in late February that high schools and vocational schools would resume gradually from March 9 to 13.

Middle schools would reopen later in the month.

Mountainous Guizhou province in southwest China has also said some students in high school and middle school would resume classes from March 16.

Mr. Ding said Friday that some have questioned if it was necessary for so many people in Wuhan to be quarantined in their communities.

He likened the struggle against the epidemic to “armies fighting in a state of war”, where people have to hide in underground bunkers or risk casualties.

The coronavirus has killed over 3,000 people in China and infected more than 80,500.

But officials noted the situation was improving and that Hubei now had enough medical protection materials, key treatment drugs and equipment – after facing severe shortages earlier.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jg9fg7/article31003265.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06IN-VIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-may-soon-lift-quarantine-in-hubei/article31003266.ece
17,2020/03/06,"Attack in Kabul kills at least 27 people, wounds dozens","The Taliban, the largest Islamist militant group in Afghanistan, said in a statement they were not involved in the attack. A top Afghan political leader, Abdullah Abdullah, was present at the event but escaped unharmed.

Gunmen attacked a ceremony in Kabul on Friday, killing at least 27 people in the first major attack on the Afghan capital since the United States reached an agreement with the Taliban to withdraw U.S. troops.

The Taliban, the largest Islamist militant group in Afghanistan, said in a statement they were not involved in the attack. A top Afghan political leader, Abdullah Abdullah, was present at the event but escaped unharmed.

Fifty-five people were wounded, according to the Afghan ministry of health.

“The attack started with a boom, apparently a rocket landed in the area, Abdullah and some other politicians ... escaped the attack unhurt,” Mr. Abdullah's spokesman, Fraidoon Kwazoon, who was also present, told Reuters by telephone.

Broadcaster Tolo News showed live footage of people running for cover as gunfire was heard.

A health ministry spokesman said the casualty toll could rise. Dead and wounded were being ferried from the site by ambulance.

A NATO source said that the death toll was slightly higher: more than 30 killed, with 42 wounded, 20 of whom were in a serious condition.

A ministry of interior spokesman said that operatations were continuing to secure the area around the attack.

Death anniversary of Abdul Ali Mazari

The gathering marked the anniversary of the death of Abdul Ali Mazari, an ethnic Hazara leader who was killed in 1995 after being taken prisoner by the Taliban. Several people were killed in a similar attack on the same commemoration last year, which Islamic State said was carried out by its militants.

President Ashraf Ghani tweeted that the attack was “a crime against humanity and against the national unity of Afghanistan”.

Mr. Abdullah, who escaped, was runner-up in the last three Afghan presidential elections, each of which he disputed. He has served as chief executive of a coalition government since 2014 and is also a former foreign minister.

Mr. Ghani said he had telephoned Mr. Abdullah, his longtime political rival. Mr. Abdullah is contesting an Electoral Commission announcement last month declaring Ghani the winner of September's presidential election.

Hazaras are mostly Shi'ite Muslims. Minority Shi'ites have been repeatedly attacked by Sunni Muslim militant groups in Afghanistan.

The United States has been trying to spearhead efforts towards a lasting peace arrangement. Violence decreased during a seven-day hold-down agreement with the Taliban leading up to last Saturday's deal, though the Taliban has since resumed attacks on Afghan forces.

A senior Western security official said all checkpoints in Kabul were on high alert.

Iran on Thursday announced it would put checkpoints in place to limit travel between major cities, hoping to stem the spread of the virus.

Iran cancelled Friday prayers across its major cities. Elsewhere in the region, Iraq cancelled Friday prayers in Karbala, where a weekly sermon is delivered on behalf of the country’s top Shia cleric. Authorities in the United Arab Emirates, meanwhile, limited prayers to two verses of the Quran so they lasted no longer than 10 minutes, over concerns about the virus.

17 more deaths

On Friday, the Iran government announced 17 more deaths from the virus, as the overall number of cases soared. “We have confirmed 1,234 new cases, which is a record in the past few days,” Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told a news conference, raising the total number of infections to 4,747.

The new cases “are probably those who had been infected with the virus two weeks ago and... just came to us with symptoms,” he added.

Iran has been scrambling to contain the rapid spread of coronavirus, which has infected people in all 31 of its provinces.

The official said Tehran has 1,413 confirmed cases so far, which is the highest among all provinces and makes it an “epicentre” for the virus.

In Tehran, firefighters sprayed disinfectant on an 18-km length of famous Valiasr Avenue, some from fire-trucks and others walking along its sidewalks, spraying ATMs and storefronts.

Adviser to FM dies

An adviser to Iran’s Foreign Minister has died from coronavirus, the official IRNA news agency reported. Hossein Sheikholeslam, “a veteran and revolutionary diplomat” died late on Thursday, IRNA said.

Six of those who died from coronavirus are politicians or government officials. A former Ambassador to Syria, he also served as Deputy Foreign Minister from 1981 to 1997. He was also one of the students involved in the 1979 Iran hostage crisis.

19,2020/03/06,Pakistan does not want any security role for India in Afghanistan,"Addressing the Senate on Wednesday, Mr. Qureshi said that Pakistan neither desires any security role of India in Afghanistan nor wants presence of militant organisations — Al-Qaeda and the ISIS — in the landlocked country, The Nation reported.

Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has said Pakistan does not want any security role for India in Afghanistan as he accused New Delhi of playing the role of a “spoiler” in the war-torn country, according to a media report.

After months of negotiations, the U.S. and Taliban signed a landmark peace deal in Qatari capital Doha on Saturday, effectively drawing curtains on the United States’ 18-year war in Afghanistan since 2001.

Addressing the Senate on Wednesday, Mr. Qureshi said that Pakistan neither desires any security role of India in Afghanistan nor wants presence of militant organisations — Al-Qaeda and the ISIS — in the landlocked country, The Nation reported.

The Foreign Minister told the Upper House that India had always played role of a spoiler, the report said.

There were spoilers in the past and they are even today, within and outside Afghanistan, who want to get their own objectives,” Mr. Qureshi said.

India has been a key stakeholder in Afghanistan as it had already spent around $2 billion in reconstruction of the war-ravaged country.

India has been maintaining that care should be taken to ensure that any peace process does not lead to any “ungoverned spaces” where terrorists and their proxies can relocate.

Ahead of the peace deal, India conveyed to the U.S. that pressure on Pakistan to crack down on terror networks operating from its soil must be kept up though Islamabad’s cooperation for peace in Afghanistan is crucial.

Mr. Qureshi on Sunday also warned that “spoilers” could try to sabotage the peace process in Afghanistan.

He also said that Pakistan wanted to resolve all issues with Afghanistan bilaterally.

Reiterating that Pakistan was never part of the peace talks and their role has always been and will always be that of a facilitator, the minister said Pakistan cannot give guarantee or take responsibility to peace in Afghanistan.

“This is a shared responsibility, and all [stakeholders] will have to play their role. There are many powers, interests and motives [involved], he said.

20,2020/03/06,Meet the female squad who clear out Vietnam’s unexploded bombs,"Medic and safety officer Nguyen Thi Ha Lan supervises her teammates, the “landmine girls” as they are known, preparing to detonate a cluster bomb left behind from the war with the United States that ended in 1975.

Two petite women in protective gear walk slowly down an empty field in Vietnam, carrying a large metal detector that clicks and whirrs, searching for unexploded ordnance.

Medic and safety officer Nguyen Thi Ha Lan supervises her teammates, the “landmine girls” as they are known, preparing to detonate a cluster bomb left behind from the war with the United States that ended in 1975.

It is one of many underneath the soil in Quang Tri province, north-central Vietnam.

Once the team is ready to detonate, Ms. Lan warns people to clear the area. A siren goes off and then an earthshattering boom.

Ms. Lan is part of an all-woman explosive disposal team working under project RENEW (Restoring the Environment and Neutralising the Effect of War) -- to help rehabilitate more than 60,000 hectares (150,000 acres) of agricultural land.

The area was one of the most heavily bombed of the war and the U.S. Department of Defence estimates that 10 percent of the 80 million tons of munitions used by the U.S army in Vietnam failed to detonate on impact.

For Ms. Lan, being part of the 16-member team has a special meaning.

At the age of 12, her mother Hoa lost both legs and an arm due to unexploded ordnance (UXO), while playing in her front yard.

She has spent most of her life in a wheelchair, but still raised two children. Ms. Lan's younger brother works as a deminer in another RENEW team.

“When I look at the kids playing in my front yard, it reminds me of my mother and I used to cry silently inside,” Ms. Lan says.

“My job now enables me to have a stable life and the kids are able to play around me on Quang Tri soil and all over Vietnam too.”

In Quang Tri alone, there have been over 8,500 casualties from accidents involving UXO.

Nearly a third of the victims are children who mistake the round, tennis-ball sized cluster bombs for something to play with.

EOD teams such as Ms. Lan's have helped clear over 5,600 hectares (14,000 acres).

Demining work is gruelling and dangerous. Working under the scorching sun and temperatures that can reach 42 degrees Celsius (108 Fahrenheit) means that skins tan no matter how much sunscreen they use.

“It is an honour to wear the uniform of the project everyday, so even if we aren't able to wear make up or a beautiful dress like everyone else, we all feel proud from the bottom of our hearts,” says Ms. Lan.

Ms. Lan also appreciates the camaraderie that the landmine girls share, working in such dangerous conditions.

There are still many explosives to be cleared. In August 2018, more than 1,400 items were found in an underground cache. But Quang Tri had no accidents last year. The plan is to clear the province of unexploded ordnance by 2025.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/arwmdn/article30998497.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WOMENS-DAYVIETNAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/meet-the-female-squad-who-clear-out-vietnams-unexploded-bombs/article30997633.ece
21,2020/03/06,The failed escape: Sheikha Latifa's doomed flight from Dubai,"A UK court ruled that Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum had abducted his daughter Latifa.

Three years ago, in secluded corners of a sprawling mall in Dubai, Sheikha Latifa, the daughter of the emirate's ruler, plotted with close friend Tiina Jauhiainen to escape her father's clutches.

Their eventual plan was like a plot from a movie: Ms. Latifa disguised her appearance as the pair fled Dubai by car to the coast, took a dinghy and rode jet skis to a waiting boat which was to take the princess and her companion to freedom.

But it failed. They were captured off the coast of India after an operation by special forces and taken back to Dubai.

“The last time (I saw her), she was kicking and screaming and she was dragged off the boat. Her pleas for asylum were ignored,” Ms. Jauhiainen told Reuters in an interview in London in late January.

In a judgment published on Thursday, a British judge ruled that Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum had abducted Ms. Latifa — just as he had her elder sister Shamsa from England almost two decades earlier — and subjected her to inhuman treatment.

Ms. Jauhiainen gave a witness statement as part of the case and briefly appeared in court in London to confirm it was true.

“In making an overall assessment of the evidence relating to Latifa, I regard the evidence of Tiina Jauhiainen as being of singular importance,” the judge, Andrew McFarlane, said in his ruling, which described her as a “wholly impressive individual.”

The fitness instructor first met Latifa in late 2010 when she started giving her lessons in capoeira, a martial art, about five times a week.

They became close friends but she said Ms. Latifa was quiet and private. It was years before Ms. Latifa confided in her, revealing she had tried to escape Dubai in 2002 when she was a teenager and that she had subsequently spent three-and-a-half years in prison.

Reuters was not able independently to confirm Ms. Jauhiainen's version of events, which she has recounted to media before.

“It was only around 2016 when she started telling me about her sister Shamsa and her escape and her own imprisonment,” said Ms. Jauhiainen, a Finnish national.

“I think she was very scared. She could have been imprisoned again.”

The government's Dubai Media Office did not respond to a Reuters request for comment for this story.

Former French spy

In the summer of 2017, Ms. Latifa, who told Ms. Jauhiainen that she had not been allowed to leave Dubai since 2000 and had no passport, asked Ms. Jauhiainen for help in trying to leave her homeland again.

Ms. Latifa had read the book Escape from Dubai by former French naval officer and spy Herve Jaubert some years before and wanted to contact him.

Ms. Jauhiainen went to the Philippines to meet Mr. Jaubert and the three of them began plotting the escape. For the two women, that meant clandestine discussions in the glitzy Dubai Mall, one of the world's largest shopping centres.

“We would find a corner, we would switch off our mobile phones. So we were taking all the precautions,” said Ms. Jauhiainen, adding that Ms. Latifa would regularly change her email address to avoid detection.

“It was a bit scary so we didn't want anyone to overhear the conversations or follow us or anything like that.”

Mr. Jaubert told Reuters that he planned the escape with Ms. Latifa and subsequently asked Ms. Jauhiainen to meet him in the Philippines on six or seven occasions to train her.

After six months, they were ready to put their plan into action. On Feb. 24, 2018, Ms. Latifa was dropped off by her driver at a cafe in downtown Dubai where she and Ms. Jauhiainen had been meeting regularly for breakfast.

Inside, she went to the bathroom to change her clothes, dumped her mobile phone and the pair set off on a six-hour drive from Dubai through Oman to its coastal capital Muscat.

“I didn't sleep for two nights before the day of the escape,” Ms. Jauhiainen said. “Latifa was sitting next to me in the front seat – she had never sat in the front seat of a car, she was excited, happy.”

At Muscat, they met a friend of Ms. Jauhiainen, got in a dinghy, clinging to the sides in stormy conditions, to reach international waters where they got onto jet skis and boarded the U.S.-flagged boat Nostromo.

Commando operation

They were heading for Goa on India's west coast where Ms. Latifa hoped to journey on to the United States to seek asylum.

But on March 4 they were intercepted by commando units from India and the United Arab Emirates, Ms. Jauhiainen said.

“We had Indian coastguard boats surrounding us, there were helicopters, aeroplanes, the whole boat was filled with smoke,” she said. “They looted the boat, they beat the crew. Latifa was kidnapped kicking and screaming and the rest of us were kidnapped as well and taken to UAE.”

Mr. Jaubert said he captained the vessel and witnessed the raid. He said Indian navy commandos attacked and Ms. Latifa was taken off the boat by an Emirati officer. He added that he was beaten for 45 minutes, but did not specify by whom.

Reuters could not independently confirm his account.

Raveesh Kumar, a spokesperson for India's foreign ministry, did not respond to a request for comment on India's alleged role in the operation.

Ms. Jauhiainen did not see Ms. Latifa again. In Dubai, she said she was threatened, held in solitary confinement and interrogated. She did not specify where or by whom.

“I was told I had stabbed the ruler of Dubai in the back by helping (his) daughter escape,” she said.

Two weeks before the attempted escape, Ms. Latifa made a 45-minute video recording in Ms. Jauhiainen's apartment which she passed to supporters outside Dubai in case she failed to get away.

That video, in which Ms. Latifa launched an excoriating attack on her father, was made public after it went to UK-based campaign group Detained in Dubai and was posted on YouTube.

Three weeks after being taken back to Dubai, Ms. Jauhiainen was released and left.

Despite having lived in Dubai for 17 years, those who knew her no longer stay in contact, Ms. Jauhiainen said.

Ms. Jauhiainen said that most visitors to Dubai lived in a bubble of sun, sea and shopping malls, and did not know the truth about the country.

22,2020/03/06,Tense calm in Syria's Idlib as ceasefire comes into effect,"Turkey, Russia leaders said after talks in Moscow to contain a conflict that has displaced nearly a million people in three months.

Syria's Idlib region was quiet but tense on Friday with a lull in Russian and Syrian air raids that have pounded the last opposition-held enclave in Syria, residents and opposition sources said, after Turkey and Russia declared a ceasefire.

Turkey and Russia agreed to the ceasefire deal Idlib on Thursday, their two leaders said after talks in Moscow to contain a conflict that has displaced nearly a million people in three months.

Residents and fighters in the region said main front lines that have seen heavy air strikes by Russian and Syrian jets, and intense Turkish artillery and drone strikes on Syrian President Bashar al Assad's forces, were quiet hours after the ceasefire came into effect at midnight.

Witnesses said there was only sporadic fire from machine guns, mortars and artillery by Assad's forces and Iranian militias on some front lines in northwestern Aleppo province and southern Idlib province.

In other areas, scattered fighting began to subside, activists said.

“In the first hours we are witnessing a very tense calm from all warring parties,” Ibrahim Al-Idlibi, an opposition figure in touch with rebel groups on the ground said.

“Everyone is aware that violations by any side would be met with a response. But this a very fragile truce.”

Syrian state media did not report the latest ceasefire deal and the opposition cast doubt it would last amid criticism that it does not address a main Turkish demand that Syrian forces withdraw to the edge of an Idlib buffer zone agreed in Sochi between Russia and Turkey in 2018.

This time, they agreed to establish a secure corridor near the M4 highway, which runs east to west through Idlib, and hold joint patrols along the road from March 15.

Wresting control of the highways in the northwest, two of Syrias most important pre-war arteries from insurgents has long been a main goal of the Russian-backed campaign in a bid to shore up Syrias sanction-hit economy.

To the dismay of Assad's opponents, the agreement did not mention a safe zone where millions of displaced people could shelter and from where they could return to the homes they fled to escape the Russian-backed offensive.

“No one has mentioned a safe zone or areas of withdrawal. There is no pullout and where will the displaced go?... they would never accept going to regime areas. What we have heard today is not comforting,” said Ahmad Rahhal, a former general in Syrian government forces who defected to the opposition.

The United Nations says the offensive has uprooted nearly a million people, the largest exodus of the nine-year war.

“These are modest results compared to the massive buildup in Turkish troops along the border and inside Syria,” Rahhal said referring to more than 15,000 troops that Syrian opposition sources say Ankara had brought in to halt advances deep into Idlib province by the Russian-backed offensive.

There have been several ceasefires over Idlib. They collapsed after the Russian-backed forces pressed their offensive and gained ground.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wcoryy/article30997597.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TURKEY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tense-calm-in-syrias-idlib-as-ceasefire-comes-into-effect/article30997598.ece
23,2020/03/06,Pregnant women scared to give birth in virus-hit China,"State media propaganda videos show volunteers in hazmat suits driving pregnant women to hospitals.

Scared of the deadly new coronavirus that has swept China, pregnant women and new mothers are giving birth alone, keeping their newborns inside and switching to pricier private hospitals to avoid the risk of infection.

One new mother, surnamed Xie, told AFP she gave birth to her baby girl in Wuhan earlier this month alone, because nobody from her family was allowed to come with her to the hospital in the quarantined city where the outbreak emerged in December.

With roads blocked, she had been unable to attend pre-natal checks and was afraid to go to hospitals for fear of cross-infection.

“They let you out when you are delivering a baby,” Xie said, saying she had chosen a special gynaecology hospital to give birth.

“When I got there, there was only one ward left,” she said.

“During my time in the hospital I wore masks and gloves all the time and washed my hands very often. I seldom left my ward.”

Some 56 million people in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province have been under quarantine since late January.

State media propaganda videos show volunteers in hazmat suits driving pregnant women to hospitals.

But Xu Tingting from Huanggang told AFP she struggled to find a vehicle to get to hospital when she went into labour two weeks before her due date.

“I was having contractions every 10 minutes, and asked my parents to take me to the hospital. It took them nearly two hours to find a car and I was panicking, thinking I’d have to deliver at home without assistance,” Xu told AFP.

“My husband was in another city and wasn’t allowed to enter the town. It was the grocery store owner in our compound who finally agreed to take me in his delivery van.”

Xie and Xu — who had a healthy boy — are also nervous about going out to vaccinate their newborns.

“I still don’t know what to do yet. There’s still 20 days left for my baby to get vaccinated, I hope by then the situation is under control,” Xie said.

‘I am afraid’

With some 80,000 infections nationwide and over 2,900 deaths, it isn’t just in the virus epicentre where new mothers are scared.

Beijing-based Angelika Fu, whose baby is due in two weeks, has chosen a private hospital despite the cost being 10 times higher.

“We opted for a private hospital, although costlier, because we wanted to avoid crowds and feel safe,” she told AFP.

She says she’s been trying to remain calm but that she had had “some hysterical moments”.

“I think the situation is getting better and better and the risk of being infected in the hospital is much lower than a month ago. At least, that’s what I want to believe,” Fu said.

Mental health service providers have also seen an uptick in the number of calls from anxious new mothers.

“Over the last month, dozens of pregnant women and new mums have been calling us with stress or anxiety related concerns,” said a volunteer at Beijing International Christian Fellowship, which runs a mental health hotline, who wished to remain anonymous.

“The uncertainty and disruption to normal life created by the epidemic was weighing down on many, in addition to the usual baby blues.”

Parenting groups and play areas have also been closed.

Theresa Ying delivered her baby in Beijing two days after Wuhan was placed in lockdown.

“I was very nervous. We didn’t have enough information at the time about this virus and that caused a lot of stress,” she said.

“For the baby’s first month vaccination, we asked a friend to buy the vaccine from Singapore and paid a nurse to come home and administer it.

“It’s costly, but I am afraid to take my baby out.”

Falling birth rates

The outbreak comes as China’s marriage and fertility rates decline, despite the introduction of a two-child policy.

Yi Fuxian, senior scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the virus chaos will likely impact on demographics.

“The coronavirus epidemic will lead to a further decline in GDP growth, an increase in unemployment, a decline in household income, and a decline in the ability to raise children, so the fertility rate will continue to decline,” said Yi.

But others have suggested the long time trapped at home could outweigh this risk, though, with a cheeky banner widely shared on Weibo reminding residents in a Henan province city that “making a second child is a good way of making a contribution to the country.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ed2jla/article30997521.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/pregnantwomen,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pregnant-women-scared-to-give-birth-in-virus-hit-china/article30997522.ece
24,2020/03/06,Malaysia anti-graft chief who probed 1MDB scandal quits,"Latheefa Koya of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission said there was no pressure on her to resign and that new Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, who is backed by UMNO, understood her decision to put in her papers.

Malaysia's anti-corruption chief who investigated the 1MDB fraud said on Friday that she had resigned, the second such exit in the last few days after a party that was defeated in the 2018 general election came back to power.

Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who unexpectedly resigned last month after his coalition collapsed, has accused the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) of orchestrating a return to power so that its officials escape conviction in the alleged theft of billions of dollars from state fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).

The party denies the charges.

Latheefa Koya of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission said there was no pressure on her to resign and that new Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, who is backed by UMNO, understood her decision to put in her papers. She said she wanted to return to her practice as a human rights advocate.

“I also briefed the prime minister about our ongoing actions and efforts for the recovery of the stolen 1MDB monies from abroad,” Ms. Latheefa said in a statement. “He was fully supportive of these actions.”

In January, Ms. Latheefa revealed audio clips at a news conference that she called proof of a high-level criminal conspiracy to cover up wrongdoing in the 1MDB case for which former Prime Minister Najib Razak is facing trial.

Mr. Najib denies the charges.

25,2020/03/06,"Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed abducted daughters, threatened former wife, finds UK court","Sheikh Mohammed, who is the Vice-President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates, tried to prevent the court rulings being made public.

Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum ordered the abduction of two of his daughters and subjected his former wife to a “campaign of fear and intimidation”, forcing her to flee to London with their two children, according to a British court ruling made public on Thursday.

Princess Haya Bint Al Hussein, 45, fled the United Arab Emirates last April having become “terrified” of her husband, who is also the vice-president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates.

Soon afterwards, the 70-year-old Sheikh applied for their two children — a son aged eight and a 12-year-old daughter — to be returned to the Gulf kingdom.

Also read:

But Princess Haya, a half-sister of Jordan's King Abdullah II, applied for the children to be made wards of court and filed a non-molestation order for herself.

She asked during a London hearing for a judge to make findings of fact about the kidnapping and forced detention of two of the sheikh's adult daughters from a previous marriage.

She also alleged she had faced a “campaign of fear and intimidation” since she left last year.

Seized and detained

Sheikh Mohammed, who owns the Godolphin horse racing stable, tried to prevent two of the court rulings being made public.

But the Supreme Court rejected his application on Thursday morning, allowing them to be published.

Judge Andrew McFarlane, who heads the Family Division of the High Court of England and Wales, found Sheikh Mohammed “ordered and orchestrated” the abduction of Sheikha Shamsa from the UK city of Cambridge when she was 19 in August 2000.

She was forcibly returned to Dubai and “has been deprived of her liberty for much, if not all, of the past two decades,” he said.

He also found Shamsa's sister, Latifa, 35, was seized and returned to Dubai twice, in 2002 and again in 2018.

She was held “on the instructions of her father” for more than three years after the first attempted escape. Her second made global headlines in March 2018.

Claims by a friend of Latifa who helped her escape that Indian special forces boarded a boat off the Indian coast on March 4, 2018 before she was returned to Dubai were also found to be proven.

“She was pleading for the soldiers to kill her rather than face the prospect of going back to her family in Dubai,” McFarlane said.

“Drawing these matters together I conclude, on the balance of probability, that Latifa's account of her motives for wishing to leave Dubai represents the truth. She was plainly desperate to extricate herself from her family and prepared to undertake a dangerous mission in order to do so,” the judge said.

Secret divorce

Lawyer Charles Geekie, representing Princess Haya, said at a hearing last November that his client had been left anonymous notes threatening the lives of her son and daughter.

She also told the court of “deliberate threats” and even of a helicopter landing outside her house when the pilot told her he had come to take a passenger to a desert prison.

The court was also told the sheikh divorced Princess Haya without her knowledge on February 7, 2019 — the 20th anniversary of the death of her father king Hussein of Jordan.

Judge McFarlane said it was “clear the date will have been chosen... to maximise insult and upset to her”.

He agreed with Geekie that events since 2000 showed “a number of common themes, at the core of which is the use of the state and its apparatus to threaten, intimidate, mistreat and oppress with a total disregard for the rule of law”.

“I also accept Mr Geekie's submission that these findings, taken together, demonstrate a consistent course of conduct over two decades where, if he deems it necessary to do so, the father will use the very substantial powers at his disposal to achieve his particular aims.”

One-sided

In a statement after the publication of the rulings, Sheikh Mohammed strongly denied the claims and said the case involved “highly personal and private matters relating to our children”.

He said he appealed to the Supreme Court “to protect the best interests and welfare of the children”.

“The outcome does not protect my children from media attention in the way that other children in family proceedings in the UK are protected,” he said, calling the process one-sided. “As a head of government, I was not able to participate in the court's fact-finding process.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vx3oc4/article30997456.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAIN-DUBAICOURTTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dubais-sheikh-mohammed-abducted-daughters-threatened-former-wife-finds-uk-court/article30997457.ece
26,2020/03/06,Australia closes first school after pupil contracts COVID-19,"Australia has recorded 60 cases of the COVID-19 while two elderly people have died from the virus.

Australia ordered its first school closure on Friday after a 16-year-old pupil tested positive for the COVID-19, as the country's Prime Minister warned the public bill for treating infected patients could top A$1 billion ($661 million).

Also read: COVID-19: New Zealand confirms first case

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he has written to Australia's state governments to create a A$1 billion fund to treat COVID-19 patients, though he cautioned more money may be needed.

Australia has recorded 60 cases of the COVID-19 while two elderly people have died from the virus as authorities struggle to contain the outbreak.

Mr. Morrison in late February said a global pandemic of the COVID-19 was likely, and on Friday he detailed the healthcare costs for the first time.

“We are estimating based on the advice that we have at the moment that this could be as much as about A$1 billion,” he said.

Watch | COVID-19: Dos and don'ts from the Health Ministry

“I hope it is not that much. It could be more.”

While the majority of those infected in Australia contracted the virus overseas before returning home, the outbreak is now spreading locally.

A 16-year boy in Sydney, Australia's largest city, became the latest to be diagnosed.

Desperate to ensure the COVID-19 doesn't spread, the New South Wales government ordered the closure of Epping Boys High School in the city's north for at least one day, the country's first school closure as a result of the outbreak.

Watch | Why is COVID-19 not a pandemic yet?

Health officials said the nearly 1,200 pupils and staff will need to quarantine themselves.

“Students at the school are advised to stay at home and self-isolate over the weekend,” the NSW state government said in an emailed statement.

“Staff are also asked to stay at home and self-isolate. The school will provide a further update over the weekend about next steps.”

NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the teenager is believed to have contracted the virus through contact with another COVID-19 patient, making his a case another local transmission.

The spread of the COVID-19 is expected to have a significant economic toll with the government on Thursday warning the crisis would subtract at least half a percentage point from first quarter growth.

Australia's government is poised to announce a stimulus package to cushion the economic hit of the virus.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the multi-billion dollar package would target sectors most affected by the COVID-19.

Local media on Friday reported the government was considering subsidising wages for small- and medium-sized businesses amid fears of widespread job losses that could lead to a recession.

Australia's A$2 trillion economy has already hit turbulence after 29 years of recession-free growth, with many economists predicting a contraction in the current quarter.

Treasury Secretary Steven Kennedy said it was too early to determine the long-term economic toll of the epidemic, but it was clear it would have immediate and significant effects.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has already cut interest rates four times in less than a year to a record low 0.50%, in response to a range of growing economic challenges.

Deputy Governor Guy Debelle said late on Wednesday the central bank has the capacity to reduce its cash rate one more time to 0.25% before deploying quantitative easing.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sufici/article30997443.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUSTRALIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/australia-closes-first-school-after-pupil-contracts-covid-19/article30997444.ece
27,2020/03/06,"US announces $8bn COVID-19 funding, testing underway on cruise ship","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has surged bringing the U.S. death toll to 12.

U.S. lawmakers passed an emergency $8.3 billion spending bill to combat the COVID-19 on Thursday as health workers boarded a cruise ship held off the coast of San Francisco to test sick passengers and crew.

The Senate gave sweeping bipartisan support to the funding a day after the House passed the bill, so that it could be quickly sent to the White House for President Donald Trump's signature.

“The American people are looking for leadership, they want assurance their government is up to the task of protecting the health and safety,” said Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy.

The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has surged, particularly in northwest Washington state where another person succumbed to the illness, bringing the U.S. death toll to 12. There have been more than 180 confirmed cases nationwide, according to an AFP tally.

Health workers meanwhile began testing 35 or so people on board the Grand Princess cruise ship who have shown flu-like symptoms, after one 71-year-old man who was on a previous voyage died from the virus.

There are nearly 3,500 passengers and crew on the vessel, which cut short its voyage back from Hawaii after the passengers began to fall ill.

Though not everyone was being tested, they will be isolated once the ship is finally allowed to dock, an official said.

One of the passengers contacted by AFP said there was no panic on board and people seemed to be taking the setback in stride.

“I can't get over how the news is sensationalizing our ship,” said Carolyn Wright, 63, a professional photographer from New Mexico. “There were two cases on the previous cruise and they act like everybody on board has the plague.”

She said passengers were told around midday on Thursday to remain in their cabins and that test results would be released early Friday.

The Grand Princess belongs to Princess Cruises, the same company which operated the Diamond Princess — the COVID-19-stricken ship held off Japan last month from which more than 700 people tested positive and six died.

School closures and teleworking

On Thursday, Washington state officials announced a jump in cases, from 39 to more than 70. Eleven of the 12 deaths have been reported there, with the other in California.

Tech firms in Seattle like Amazon, Facebook and Google were telling employees to work remotely, as was Microsoft in nearby Richmond.

Some schools in the state have also decided to close for a couple weeks and hold classes online.

Vice President Mike Pence, the White House pointman on the crisis, was due to visit the state.

US officials continue to stress that the overall risk to the public remains low and are urging people not to panic or buy masks — which could create a shortage for those who require them.

The scientific data so far shows that elderly people and those with underlying conditions are most at risk of serious illness and the majority of deaths have occurred in a Seattle-area nursing home.

Nurses union slams preparation

But the largest nursing union in the US denounced Thursday the “disturbing” lack of preparation at many hospitals.

Nurses are working without necessary personal protective equipment and lack education and training for handling the disease, said National Nurses United director Bonnie Castillo.

“It is not a successful strategy to leave nurses and other health workers unprotected,” she said.

Earlier, a top health official said the overall mortality rate for the novel coronavirus was lower than previously thought.

“The best estimates now of the overall mortality rate for COVID-19 is somewhere between 0.1 percent and one percent,” Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary of health said at a news briefing.

He explained the new figure, far lower than previous estimates of 2 to 5 percent, by saying that there had been a significant underreporting of cases.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/w7gj4i/article30997440.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/US-COVID19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-announces-8bn-covid-19-funding-testing-underway-on-cruise-ship/article30997441.ece
28,2020/03/06,Harvey Weinstein moved to NYC jail after heart procedure,"Weinstein, 67, was originally supposed to go to Rikers Island immediately after his Feb. 24 conviction, but he was detoured to Bellevue Hospital amid concerns about high blood pressure and heart palpitations

Harvey Weinstein was moved on Thursday to an infirmary unit at New York City’s notorious Rikers Island jail complex after undergoing a heart procedure at the hospital where he’d been held since his conviction last month on rape and sexual assault charges.

Weinstein’s spokesman, Juda Engelmayer, said that the former film producer’s procedure on Wednesday at Bellevue Hospital was “deemed successful,” but Engelmayer wouldn’t go into further detail. Weinstein was taken by ambulance to the North Infirmary Command on Rikers Island after doctors at the hospital deemed him fit enough to be moved there.

Weinstein, 67, was originally supposed to go to Rikers Island immediately after his Feb. 24 conviction, but he was detoured to Bellevue Hospital amid concerns about high blood pressure and heart palpitations. He was at the hospital for more than a week.

Weinstein’s lawyer Arthur Aidala, who saw him at the hospital on Thursday morning, said his client is “obviously not the picture of health.”

In addition to the heart issues, Weinstein’s lawyers have said he was also dealing with the ramifications of unsuccessful back surgery stemming from a car crash last summer and a condition that requires shots in his eyes so he does not go blind.

Weinstein used a walker to aid his movement in and out of the courthouse.

""He’s obviously not happy where he is. But he’s lucid and realistic about everything. He’s still in a state of disbelief,” Aidala said.

Weinstein is due back in court on Wednesday for sentencing. He was convicted on one count of criminal sex act for forcibly performing oral sex on a woman in 2006 and one count of third-degree rape for a 2013 attack on another woman.

On the criminal sex act count, he faces a minimum of five years in prison and a maximum of 25 years in prison, while the third-degree rape count carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison. The judge could have the sentences run concurrently.

Weinstein was acquitted of predatory sexual assault charges that carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.

After revoking Weinstein’s bail when he was convicted, Judge James Burke made a judicial request to place him in the North Infirmary Command. There, the judge said, he’d have “something tantamount to protective custody.”

Martin Horn, a former city corrections commissioner, said that despite its name, the infirmary is more like a regular jail than a hospital unit.

Built in 1932 as the original Rikers Island Hospital, the infirmary now has smaller, 10-cell blocks that are used for protective units for inmates who might be targets in general population, such as sex offenders and former law enforcement officers.

A plan approved last year calls for closing the Rikers Island complex by 2026 and replacing it with four smaller jails around the city. Rikers has become synonymous with violence and neglect, while the new jails are intended to be more modern and humane.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ukii7y/article30997374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILES-US-ENTERTAINMENT-ABUSE-RIKERS-WEINSTEIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/harvey-weinstein-moved-to-nyc-jail-after-heart-procedure/article30997375.ece
29,2020/03/06,Bloomberg to fund anti-Trump operation in 6 critical states,"Bloomberg will dip into his vast fortune to pay for field offices in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, campaign aides said

Mike Bloomberg is out of the Democratic presidential race, but he’s not done trying to beat President Donald Trump. The billionaire businessman is funding an anti-Trump operation in six battleground states in an effort to oust the Republican president in November.

Bloomberg will dip into his vast fortune to pay for field offices in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, campaign aides said on Thursday. It will be done through some type of independent expenditure committee that won’t be able to coordinate with any campaign, though aides are still figuring out the legal details and what the name and budget of the organization will be.

Bloomberg, a former New York City mayor, exited the race on Wednesday after a dismal performance in the 14 Super Tuesday states. He immediately endorsed Joe Biden.

""We’re not done with you yet, Donald,” he tweeted Thursday along with an anti-Trump video that said “GoJoe” at the end.

It’s unclear when Bloomberg’s new operation will launch and how it will shift if Biden is not the party’s nominee.

Aides to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is battling Biden for the nomination, have said they do not want Bloomberg’s money, and Bloomberg has said he may not spend to help him.

Bloomberg is worth an estimated $61 billion and has already spent more than $500 million on his own campaign. The 78-year-old head of Bloomberg LP, the financial data and media company, has been one of the biggest donors to Democratic campaigns as well as causes such as gun control and climate change in recent years.

Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are the six states that Bloomberg and his team believe will be pivotal in determining who wins the White House in November. Trump won all six in the 2016 election.

Although only one of those states, North Carolina, voted on Super Tuesday, Bloomberg’s campaign had already built an extensive organization in the other five in anticipation of remaining in the race longer.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/snbnxu/article30996779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-ELECTIONBLOOMBERG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bloomberg-to-fund-anti-trump-operation-in-6-critical-states/article30996780.ece
30,2020/03/06,Biden’s comeback leaves Sanders little time to expand appeal,"In an unexpectedly strong night for Joe Biden, the former vice president won 10 of the 14 states up for grabs on Super Tuesday

After losing the momentum in the Democratic presidential race, Bernie Sanders has work to do - and little time to do it - to build the “multiracial, multigenerational movement” he says will propel him to victory over Republican President Donald Trump in November.

In an unexpectedly strong night for Joe Biden, the former vice president won 10 of the 14 states up for grabs on Super Tuesday, confirming suspicions that Sanders was struggling to expand his base, particularly among older voters and African Americans.

Sanders’ supporters said on Wednesday the disappointing results were no cause for panic but showed that the democratic socialist senator from Vermont still needed to prove he could broaden his base enough to capture the Democratic nomination.

Sanders was strongest on Tuesday among young and Latino voters, according to exit poll data, and scored a major victory winning California, the state with the most delegates.

But a far wider coalition fuelled Biden’s victories, with some of his biggest support coming from African Americans - a key Democratic voting bloc - and white voters over 60 - a group that regularly turns out in large numbers.

In Texas, where Biden narrowly beat Sanders, Biden won among black voters by 60% to 17%, according to exit polls.

“I won’t absolve the Bernie campaign of not doing the deeper work around the black community,” said Natalia Salgado, national political director at the Center for Popular Democracy Action, which endorsed Sanders in December. “I think if the Bernie camp wasn’t paying attention before last night, they’re paying attention now.”

Larry Cohen, chairman of Our Revolution, a progressive group founded by Sanders but which operates independently from the campaign, said time was short to stage a turnaround. A majority of delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination will have been awarded after primaries next Tuesday and on March 17.

Biden led Sanders in the delegate count by 526-463 on Thursday afternoon, with final results from California still outstanding.

“With this time frame, the key is to stay positive about the kind of nation that we can have and to really continue to screw down on turnout,” Cohen said. “The turnout of younger voters wasn’t as good as it could have been.”

Kyle Kondik, an elections analyst at the University of Virginia, said with Biden looking strong in upcoming contests in Florida and Georgia, Sanders would need to exceed expectations in the Midwest to “regenerate” his campaign.

Ten days ago, Biden needed to change the race, and now Sanders needs to do the same,” Kondik said.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll of registered Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents taken on March 4-5, after the Super Tuesday results, found 55% would support Biden in a two-man race over 45% for Sanders.

Sanders said he had not had time to analyze all the results but pointed to his success among people of color in California, including Latinos and Asian Americans, as well as African Americans. Exit polling showed Sanders won among all non-white voters in the state.

“We’re going to do better with the African-American community and we continue to try to do that,” Sanders told reporters on Wednesday in Vermont, without offering specifics.

Sanders’ campaign sees Michigan, which votes on Tuesday, as the next major battleground, and launched TV ads there attacking Biden’s support of trade deals that Sanders says sent jobs in the industrial Midwest overseas.

Sanders cancelled a speech in Mississippi planned for Friday to schedule more events in Michigan, an aide said.

A lingering question was whether Senator Elizabeth Warren, who ended her campaign on Thursday, would throw her support behind her fellow liberal. Warren was not expected immediately to make a formal endorsement, but Sanders said he spoke to her by phone on Tuesday.

Progressive groups said they hoped Sanders and Warren would find a way to work together. But such a partnership is no slam dunk after a tough race between the liberal allies and will not guarantee a rush of new supporters for Sanders.

“It’s not a fait accompli that all of her support goes to Bernie Sanders,” said Neil Sroka, communications director for Democracy for America, a political action committee that endorsed Sanders on Monday. “If Senator Warren departs in the race, I also think Bernie Sanders is going to have to earn her endorsement.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rs2ts2/article30996614.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILES-US-POLITICS-VOTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bidens-comeback-leaves-sanders-little-time-to-expand-appeal/article30996615.ece
31,2020/03/06,U.K. airline Flybe shuts as demand drops over virus,"The struggling British airline Flybe collapsed on Thursday amid drops in demand caused by COVID-19 epidemic, leaving passengers stranded and threatening the viability of regional airports across the country.

Flybe’s fall highlights the damage that the virus outbreak has had on the airline industry, which has cut back on flights around the world as people avoid flying out of precaution.

The British regional airline narrowly avoided bankruptcy in January but had continued to lose money. Unions and the opposition attacked both the airline’s owners and Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government for failing to act to save it.

“We’re all a bit gutted — Flybe is a household name, we’ve been flying with them for 40 years and we really tried to do everything we could back at the turn of the year,” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uk-airline-flybe-shuts-as-demand-drops-over-virus/article30993388.ece
32,2020/03/06,Facebook decides to take down Trump 2020 campaign’s ‘census’ ads,"The ads, which come from the pages of the Republican president and Vice President Mike Pence, link to a survey on an official campaign website and then to a page asking for donations

Facebook Inc. on Thursday removed ads by President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign that asked users to fill out an “Official 2020 Congressional District Census” because the ads violate the company’s policy against misinformation on the government’s census.

The ads, which come from the pages of the Republican president and Vice President Mike Pence, link to a survey on an official campaign website and then to a page asking for donations.

“We need Patriotic Americans like YOU to respond to this census, so we can develop a winning strategy for YOUR STATE,” the ad read.

The online newsletter Popular Information, which first reported on the ads, said Facebook had originally said they did not violate its policy.

Civil rights advocates said they pushed Facebook to remove the ads and Facebook confirmed it re-reviewed them.

The social media company, which has come under fire for allowing politicians to run misleading advertisements, said in December it would ban ads that aim to limit participation in the U.S. census, which officials and lawmakers fear could be targeted by disinformation aiming to disrupt the count.

“There are policies in place to prevent confusion around the official U.S. Census and this is an example of those being enforced,” Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement.

Earlier on Thursday, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, slammed Facebook before it decided to remove the ads.

“I know the profit motive is their business model. But it should not come at the cost of counting who is in our country, so that we can provide the services and the rest,"" said Ms. Pelosi, speaking at a press conference.

The Trump campaign and the Census Bureau did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The 2020 census became a political lightning rod when the Trump administration announced plans in 2018 to add a question asking respondents if they were U.S. citizens. The move, which was blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court, was criticized by some states and civil liberties groups who said the question was meant to deter immigrants from participating and help Republicans gain seats in the U.S. Congress.

Members of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform wrote a letter to the Republican National Committee on Thursday, requesting that it stop sending communications that resemble official census documents, citing news reports of fundraising mailers sent by the RNC that say “2020 Congressional District Census” and include questionnaires.

""These mailers are fully compliant with the law, clearly marked as a fundraising solicitation from the Republican National Committee, and in no way resemble the official government census. We are adding language to future mailers to make it even more obvious,"" said an RNC spokeswoman.

The count, which takes place once a decade, is expected to be filled out largely online for the first time in 2020.

Census officials have been concerned that the census, whose data is used to allocate seats in the U.S. Congress and state legislatures, and to guide the federal government in allocating $1.5 trillion a year in aid, could be a target for disinformation.

The Census Bureau has purchased dozens of web addresses with ”census” or other keywords in the title, to make it harder for potential imposter sites to operate, and held numerous meetings with Twitter, Facebook and other social media sites, in hopes of getting some help monitoring for bad actors.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/b2oiov/article30996530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSUSA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/facebook-decides-to-take-down-trump-2020-campaigns-census-ads/article30996531.ece
33,2020/03/06,"Nearly everyone is biased against women, U.N. research finds","More than a quarter of men and women also think it is justified for a husband to beat his wife, found the Gender Social Norms Index by the UNDP

Nine in 10 people are prejudiced against women, such as thinking university education is more important for men or that men deserve jobs more if work is scarce, the United Nations said on Thursday.

More than a quarter of men and women also think it is justified for a husband to beat his wife, found the Gender Social Norms Index by the U.N. Development Programme (UNDP), designed to measure how social beliefs obstruct gender equality.

“Today the fight about gender equality is a story of bias and prejudices,” Pedro Conceicao, head of UNDP's Human Development Report Office, said in a statement ahead of International Women's Day on Sunday.

Using data from more than 80% of the global population, the index found some progress, including an increase in girls enrolled in primary school and a drop in maternal deaths, but also deeply ingrained prejudices.

It said 91% of men and 86% of women held at least one clear bias, such as thinking men make better political leaders or better business executives.

Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator, said tackling such biases was the next goal for equality advocates.

“The work that has been so effective in ensuring an end to gaps in health or education must now evolve to address something far more challenging: a deeply ingrained bias among both men and women - against genuine equality,” he said in a statement.

The report was released ahead of Monday's meeting of the U.N.'s Commission on the Status of Women, which has been shortened to one day due to the spread of coronavirus.

Deeply-held biases could be addressed through education, raised awareness and incentives such as tax structures that encourage equally shared childcare or by encouraging women to enter male-dominated job sectors, the UNDP said.

35,2020/03/06,Britain’s Prince Harry and wife Meghan begin farewell royal events,"The couple stop their royal duties at the end of the month as they seek to carve out “a progressive new role”

Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife Meghan appeared together at an official engagement on Thursday for the first time since January’s announcement that they would step away from their royal duties.

The appearance by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as Queen Elizabeth’s grandson and Meghan are officially known, at an awards ceremony for wounded service personnel will also be one of their last before they quit as working members of the royal family.

The couple stop their royal duties at the end of the month as they seek to carve out “a progressive new role”, mainly based in North America, which they aim to finance themselves.

While Harry remains a prince, they have agreed not to use the HRH titles — His or Her Royal Highness — and will not use ”royal” in their branding, even though they said there was no jurisdiction by the monarchy or the government to stop them using the word overseas.

The couple have spent most of their time in Canada since January’s shock announcement.

Meghan’s last official engagement was to visit Canada House in London days before that announcement. The prince returned to royal duties at the end of last month, when the host at the event said people should just “call him Harry”.

On Thursday, they attended the annual Endeavour Fund Awards at Mansion House which acknowledges the achievements of wounded or sick servicemen and women who have taken part in remarkable sporting and adventure challenges.

There was one loud boo from the crowd outside as the smiling couple arrived clutching an umbrella amid rainfall and a blaze of camera flashes from massed photographers.

Harry, sixth in line to the throne, will carry out a solo engagement on Friday when he opens a new museum dedicated to British motor racing where he will be joined by Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton.

Next week, Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, will carry out what is expected to be their last official appearance alongside other senior royals including the 93-year-old queen, Harry’s father and heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, and his brother Prince William at the annual Commonwealth Service at London’s Westminster Abbey.

British newspapers have reported that the queen has been saddened that she has seen so little of Harry and Meghan’s son Archie, her eighth great-grandchild who has remained in Canada.

Harry and the queen had a meeting to discuss his future at her Windsor Castle home last weekend, a royal source confirmed, with the Sun tabloid reporting it had been a “heart to heart” talk at which she said he would always be welcome to rejoin the royal fold.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ar0lja/article30995632.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAIN-ROYALSSUSSEX,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/britains-prince-harry-and-wife-meghan-begin-farewell-royal-events/article30995633.ece
36,2020/03/06,COVID-19 | U.S. Senate passes $8.3 bln spending bill as New York state cases double,"More than $3 billion of the approved funds would be devoted to research and development of coronavirus vaccines, test kits and treatments

The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed an $8.3 billion bill to combat the outbreak of COVID-19, a day after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved it. The bill will now go to President Donald Trump for his signature.

More than $3 billion of the approved funds would be devoted to research and development of coronavirus vaccines, test kits and treatments. There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for the illness that began in China and has infected more than 95,000 people in some 80 countries and territories.

Meanwhile, the number of people who have the novel coronavirus in New York state doubled to 22 following an increase in testing, as Tennessee and the city of San Francisco reported cases of the fast-spreading illness for the first time.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told a news conference testing expanded after the federal government approved its use of additional laboratories, boosting capacity. He said more testing would inevitably identify more cases.

“Those numbers are going to keep going up,” Mr. Cuomo said.

Of the new cases in New York, eight are connected in some way to a Manhattan lawyer who lives in Westchester County and was previously diagnosed with the virus, two are in New York City and one in nearby Nassau County.

Mayor Bill de Blasio told a news conference the new cases in New York City - a man in his 40s and a woman in her 80s - were critically ill and being treated in hospitals. Both had ”substantial” pre-existing conditions, he said.

Neither person had recently visited any other affected countries or had any connection to other confirmed cases, suggesting the city is confronting local person-to-person spread. “Our level of concern is rising for sure,” Mr. de Blasio said.

A pair of new cases in San Francisco also were deemed likely to be a result of “community transmission,” local health officials said.

Tennessee became the 14th state to report a case, an adult male in Williamson County. Williamson County schools will be closed for a deep cleaning on Friday and Monday, according to its official Twitter page.

The U.S. death toll from the COVID-19 respiratory disease caused by the virus stands at 11, all but one them in Washington state, which has a cluster of at least 39 infections in the Seattle area. The other death, announced on Wednesday, was in California.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday reported 149 confirmed and presumed U.S. cases. They do not necessarily include new cases reported on Thursday.

U.S. health officials say they expect to be able to get enough privately manufactured coronavirus tests - around 1 million - to public laboratories this week with the capacity to test about 400,000 people.

CDC official Anne Schuchat said her agency would also supply testing kits by the end of the week that could test around 75,000 people.

“Right now, it is a challenge if you are a doctor wanting to get somebody tested,” U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters following a briefing with lawmakers.

Markets tumble

Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the U.S. response, visited mask-manufacturer 3M Co. He urged Americans not to purchase masks if they are healthy to free up supply for healthcare workers and people who are sick.

“Unless you are ill, you have no need to buy a mask,” Mr. Pence said at the Minnesota company, which has ramped up production to help respond to the coronavirus.

“The risk to the average healthy American from contracting coronavirus remains low,” Mr. Pence said, adding that “there will be more cases,” especially among more vulnerable populations such as seniors and those with chronic health conditions.

Pence was scheduled to visit Washington Governor Jay Inslee later on Thursday.

Global equity markets tumbled as coronavirus cases outside China mounted, fuelling warnings that world growth is likely to reach its weakest level since the global financial crisis a decade ago.

In late afternoon trading, the main U.S. stock indexes were down 4%.

Corporations have begun issuing profit warnings and curbing activities.

Alphabet Inc's Google on Thursday joined Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Microsoft Corp in recommending employees in the Seattle area work from home, after some were infected with the coronavirus.

The companies' work-from-home recommendation will affect more than 100,000 people in the area, as both Microsoft and Amazon employ over 50,000 each. Facebook employs more than 5,000 in the area and Google about 4,500, according to media reports.

The epidemic of COVID-19 coronavirus infection spreading around the world can be contained and controlled, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday, but only with a concerted response by all governments.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus voiced concerns at the growing number of countries with cases, especially those with weaker health systems and called on governments to harness all ministries to tackle the virus.

He said the current situation did not amount to a pandemic but his United Nations agency would use the term if and when the time came.

“I also agree that the situation could be worse than what we have now, and it could be at pandemic level. But what at the same time we are saying is there are countries that with this situation that have shown that it can be contained so we should not give up.

“If we get there, we will say it - no problem at all. Based on science and evidence,” Mr. Tedros told a news briefing in Geneva.

On Jan. 30 the WHO declared the outbreak that originated in China an international emergency. It does not have a formal classification for declaring a pandemic for diseases other than influenza. COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus, not flu.

“We are calling on every country to act with speed, scale and clear-minded determination,” Mr. Tedros said.

He voiced concern that “some countries have either not taken this seriously enough, or have decided there is nothing they can do” but named no names.

In Iran, 107 people have died and 3,513 have been infected with coronavirus in Iran, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur announced on state TV on Thursday.

Dr. Mike Ryan, the WHO's top emergencies expert, noting that a WHO team of experts arrived in Iran on Monday, told reporters on Thursday: “I think what is happening now in Iran is good. They are beginning to really identify what is the depth of this problem in order to address this problem.

“Every country gets caught behind at the beginning of an epidemic...And we are there with the Iranian authorities now looking at the response and seeing what more needs to be done.”

In an apparent reference to international sanctions on Iran for its nuclear programme, which have complicated imports of humanitarian supplies, Mr. Ryan added: “And a lot needs to be done, quite frankly. And Iran has suffered in the last number of years.

“We are having to send in supplies, in a strange situation that we have to fly supplies in military planes borrowed from the UAE (United Arab Emirates) into Iran,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/d8v81m/article30994423.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SWITZERLAND-HEALTH-EPIDEMIC-VIRUS-WHO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-epidemic-can-be-pushed-back-with-concerted-approach-says-who/article30994424.ece

The final results from Israel’s election have confirmed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has again fallen short of a parliamentary majority with his hard-line allies.

The results, released late Thursday, signal further political deadlock. Monday’s election was the country’s third in less than a year. Previous elections in April and September also ended in deadlock.

Exit polls late Monday had indicated that Netanyahu’s Likud Party, along with his religious and nationalist allies, had captured 60 seats, putting them on the cusp of a 61-seat governing majority. Netanyahu triumphantly declared a “huge victory.”

Likud emerged as the largest single party, with 36 seats, according to the final results. But his right-wing bloc captured only 58 seats, well short of the hoped-for majority.

39,2020/03/06,COVID-19 | First death in Britain confirmed,"The patient, who was being treated at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, was an older patient who had underlying health conditions, said England’s Chief Medical Officer

Britain is moving into the second of four phases in its plan to tackle the spread of coronavirus, England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said on Thursday, as the UK recorded its first death of a patient and confirmed cases rose.

Britain has so far registered 115 cases of the coronavirus known as COVID-19, which started in China, but has held off from introducing measures to restrict movement or cancel large gatherings for fear of hurting the economy.

Mr. Whitty said in a statement later that the person who died was an older patient with underlying health conditions.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is optimistic that Britain is well prepared to cope with the spread of the virus, but early on Thursday regional airline Flybe became one of the first big corporate casualties of the outbreak.

Health minister Matt Hancock said the coming weeks would be tough. But with calm heads and clear determination, together we can see it through”.

The government set out its action plan earlier this week based on four stages: containing the virus; delaying its transmission; researching its origins and mitigating its impact.

Questioned by lawmakers earlier on Thursday, Mr. Whitty said Britain had mainly moved into the second stage and was now considering measures to try to delay the peak of an epidemic which officials are anticipating in the coming weeks.

“The original plan ... was very much predicated on the idea of 'if it could be controlled in China and contained everywhere else, this virus might go away'. I think the chances of that happening are now very slim. Slim to zero,” Mr. Whitty said.

“As time goes by, we then may start to move into the more socially determined actions ... We've moved from a situation where we were mainly in contain ... to now we're basically mainly delay.”

Mr. Johnson was briefed after a meeting of Britain's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, his spokesman said.

“It is now highly likely that the virus is going to spread in a significant way,” the spokesman said. “Officials will therefore accelerate work on preparations for the 'delay' phase of the government's plan, focusing on steps we could take to seek to delay the spread of the virus.”

The government has said it could encourage home-working, cancel large-scale gatherings and possibly close schools to slow its spread and delay the peak of the outbreak until later in the year, when the health service is under less pressure.

Mr. Whitty also said that with older people more vulnerable to the virus, there may be measures announced to encourage them to stay away from public places, such as the upper house of parliament, the House of Lords.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lxdyzl/article30994213.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAIN-HEALTH-VIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-first-death-in-britain-confirmed/article30994214.ece
40,2020/03/06,Turkey-Russia agree on ceasefire in Syria’s Idlib,"Putin, Erdogan also agree on security corridor

Turkey and Russia agreed a ceasefire deal on Thursday in Syria’s Idlib region, their two leaders said after lengthy talks in Moscow to contain a conflict which has displaced nearly a million people in three months.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, standing next to his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan, said he hoped their agreement would lead to a halt of military action in Syria’s last rebel stronghold in the far northwest of the country.

“I express hope that these agreements will serve as a good basis for a cessation of military activity in the Idlib de-escalation zone (and) stop the suffering of the peaceful population and the growing humanitarian crisis,” Mr. Putin said.

Mr. Erdogan told reporters the truce would come into effect at midnight on Thursday. “We will work together to supply aid for the Syrians in need,” he said, adding that Turkey retained the right “to respond to all (Syrian) regime attacks in the field.”

Russia and Turkey back opposing sides in Syria’s nine-year conflict, with Moscow supporting President Bashar al-Assad and Turkey backing some rebel groups. They have in recent years reached several ceasefire deals in Idlib which have collapsed.

Russian air strikes have propelled an offensive by Assad’s forces in Idlib that sparked what the United Nations says may be the worst humanitarian crisis yet in a war that has driven millions from their homes and killed hundreds of thousands.

The Russian military has, however, repeatedly played down any talk of a refugee crisis and accused Turkey of violating international law by pouring enough troops into Idlib to make up a mechanised division.

Turkey, which has the second largest army in the transatlantic NATO alliance, has funnelled troops and equipment into the region in recent weeks to resist the Syrian government advance and prevent a wave of refugees over its southern border.

Russia also raced to reinforce its troops in Syria by sea and air before the Putin-Erdogan talks.

MORE DEATHS

The Kremlin said the two leaders had spoken for three hours on their own before being joined by their officials.

The two leaders also agreed to establish a secure corridor near the M4 highway, which runs east to west through Idlib, and hold joint patrols along the road from March 15.

In a joint statement read out by the Turkish and Russian foreign ministers, the two sides said the corridor would stretch 6 km to the north and 6 km to the south of the M4 - effectively advancing Russia’s presence further north into Idlib.

They said their defence ministers would agree on the parameters of the corridor within seven days.

The fighting, which has raised the prospect of a direct clash between Russia and Turkey, has killed 60 Turkish troops in the region since last month, including the death of a Turkish soldier reported by a regional governor on Thursday.

Mr. Putin expressed his regret to Mr. Erdogan about the recent killing of 34 Turkish troops in an air strike, saying the Syrian military had not known of their location.

Ahead of the talks, at least 16 civilians were killed when Russian air strikes hit a gathering of displaced people near the town of Maarat Misrin in Idlib, according to civil defence workers helping clear the rubble and search for survivors.

Russia denies targeting civilians.

Two witnesses also reported seeing more Turkish military reinforcements deploying into Idlib, and Russia’s RIA news agency said rebels had resumed shelling the strategic town of Saraqeb in Idlib where Russian military police are based.

The Turkish defence ministry said it had destroyed four tanks, five rocket launchers and a dozen military vehicles in artillery and air strikes in the last 24 hours.

Turkey hosts some 3.6 million Syrian refugees and says it cannot handle more. Seeking to extract more funding and support from Europe over Idlib, Ankara said last week it would no longer abide by a 2016 deal in which it stopped migrants crossing into the European Union in return for billions of euros in aid",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/31irf1/article30994202.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RUSSIATURKEY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/turkey-russia-agree-on-ceasefire-in-syrias-idlib/article30994203.ece
41,2020/03/06,Uncles in the hot seat in a podcast that debunks nonsensical forwards and political myths,"Two former journalists debunk popular political myths and nonsensical WhatsApp forwards in a new podcast

Game of Thrones fans everywhere felt second-hand embarrassment for Edmure Tully when his niece, Sansa Stark, said, “Uncle, please sit,” following his miscalculated shot at claiming the Iron Throne for himself in the series finale. “We all have uncles who’ve given us these long sermons in our drawing rooms,” laughs Tushar Abhichandani, a journalist-turned-stand-up comic. He, along with another former journalist Joel Pereira, took the meme-worthy retort and made it the title of their new IVM podcast, which brings reckless WhatsApp forwarders to task.

The idea behind Uncle Please Sit is to fact-check and debunk popular opinions around pressing topics of our times. The title is a metaphor, not just for older people, but also youngsters who don’t question these opinions simply because they conform all too well with their own set of prejudices. “We’re living in a world where there’s news for every ideology,” adds Abhichandani. As for Pereira, podcasts like this aim to fix the gaping fact-to-information disconnect. “Some of it is benign, but when the disinformation is given out intentionally, it becomes dangerous,” he says.

Responsible humour

The first episode discusses the Indian middle class — the definitions around it and why you may not really be as middle class as you claim to be. According to Pereira, they will also be discussing the idea of privilege that underlines this common claim, and the consequent victimisation trump card. “We’re looking at all the myths, including a lot of conversations about taxes,” says Abhichandani.

One of the primary markers of our times is the pandemic potential of social media to bolster a movement, irrespective of its nature. Both Pereira and Abichandani are no strangers to the drill themselves, having dabbled with various satirical and comedy shows earlier. How different is this outing? “It is just two guys having a relaxed, fun conversation on the lines of what you might have at a party,” explains Pereira.

But the duo has ensured their research isn’t half as casual as the façade of their podcast. Their conversations are laced with references from trustworthy sources such as official government statistics. For instance, they refer to the Global Wealth Report 2019 published by the Credit Suisse Research Institute for their discussion on the parameters for being middle class. “If you position [yourself] from a place of fact, your explanation is credible. The opinion may vary, but the root remains unquestioned,” concludes Pereira.

Uncle Please Sit will air on March 9, on the IVM app and on iTunes, Spotify and Google Podcast streaming services.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/r6xkg5/article31000819.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07WKIllustration,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/uncles-in-the-hot-seat-in-a-podcast-that-debunks-nonsensical-forwards-and-political-myths/article31000820.ece

Social media giant Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google on Thursday recommended their San Francisco Bay area employees to work from home to minimise the risk of spreading Covid-19.

Facebook said it is “strongly recommending that all Bay area employees and contingent staff work from home starting Friday.”

The decision is “based on the guidance from Santa Clara County on Thursday”, Anthony Harrison, Facebook spokesperson, said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

Employees and contractors involved in the site’s safety and security will continue to work on site, while all the Bay Area events will remain cancelled, according to the statement.

Separately, Google has offered work-from-home option to employees in Bay Area offices , a spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement.

44,2020/03/06,Facebook removes Donald Trump campaign ads around 2020 US census,"The social networking giant said the action was taken to “prevent confusion around the official U.S. census” that begins from March 12, CNN said in a report

Facebook has removed several advertorials run by U.S. President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, which were promoted as 2020 U.S. census ads.

The social networking giant said the action was taken to “prevent confusion around the official U.S. census” that begins from March 12, CNN said in a report on Thursday.

“This survey is ESSENTIAL to our team’s 2020 campaign strategy. We need Patriotic Americans like YOU to respond to this census, so we can develop a winning strategy for YOUR STATE,” some of the ads read.

The questions on the survey include asking users about their views of President Trump as well as their age, name and contact information.

The survey asked people if they “think Nancy Pelosi and the Radical Left are putting their personal anti-Trump agenda ahead of what’s best for the American people.”

Facebook said that there are “policies in place to prevent confusion around the official U.S. census and this is an example of those being enforced.”

The social media giant has often been criticised by the Democrats for not fact-checking ads run by politicians especially by the Republicans.

House Speaker Pelosi also slammed Facebook for allowing the Trump campaign to run the ads, calling the advertisement “an absolute lie.”

The U.S. census has political implications as it is used to determine the number of seats each state holds in the House of Representatives.

Facebook has come under fire for not taking down political ads with fake information but it said it would take stringent actions on misinformation about the 2020 U.S. census.

“We have to be more vigilant about protecting against census interference across posts and ads on Facebook and Instagram and help promote an accurate count of every person in the country,” said Kevin Martin, Vice President of the U.S. Public Policy and Samidh Chakrabarti, Director of Product Management, Civic Engagement.

The social networking giant introduced a new advertising policy last December that prohibits ads that portray census participation as useless or meaningless or advise people not to participate in the census.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/bdlaax/article30998243.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06NETFACEBOOKTRUMPAD,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/facebook-removes-donald-trump-campaign-ads-around-2020-us-census/article30998244.ece

Google and Apple have begun taking action on fake mischievous apps to fight new coronavirus-related misinformation on their app stores.

Apple is removing all coronavirus-related mobile software not from recognised health organisations or the government, reports CNBC.

Google, on the other hand, has stopped throwing results if someone search about coronavirus on its Play Store.

Some of these apps used public data from reliable sources like the World Health Organisation (WHO) to create dashboards or live maps.

“Some developers asked not to be named to avoid further complications with Apple’s review process,” the report mentioned.

On the Apple App Store, the top result for ‘COVID 19’ is a “virus tracker” app from a developer called Healthlynked with WHO figures and maps charting where confirmed cases have been.

Google Play has published a website called ‘Coronavirus: Stay informed’ with suggested apps, including software from the CDC, Red Cross, and Twitter.

Some popular Android apps related to the coronavirus are not available for iPhones, said the report.

With claims related to false cures or prevention methods for coronavirus, like drinking bleach cures infections, spreading on social media giants like Facebook and Twitter have started taking proactive measures to fight the spread of harmful content, apart from taking action against those who spread misinformation.

Facebook said it is focusing on limiting the spread of misinformation and harmful content about the virus, while also connecting people to helpful information.

Twitter said it has invested significantly in its proactive abilities to ensure trends, search, and other common areas of the service are protected from malicious behaviour.

Twitter said it is also halting any auto-suggest results that are likely to direct individuals to non-credible content on the platform.

At a time when the world is reeling under the threat of coronavirus, Google-owned YouTube has reportedly started demonetising videos about the deadly virus and creators are not too happy about it.

“For today’s video, I won’t be directly commenting on the recent health-related news because A, I am not a health care professional, and B, I don’t need my video demonetised,” said Linus Sebastian, host of Linus Tech Tips, according to a report in The Verge on Wednesday.

The popular video-sharing platform has demonetised videos about sensitive subjects in the past as well.

The company’s advertising guidelines state that sensitive topics — usually a recent event with a “loss of life, typically as a result of a pre-planned malicious attack” — are normally not suitable for advertising.

These videos are allowed to stay on the platform; they just can’t make money from YouTube’s built-in ad service, the report added.

According to the video-sharing platform, coronavirus outbreak is now being considered a sensitive topic.

“As such, all videos focused on this topic will be demonetised until further notice,” Tom Leung, product officer at YouTube, said in a recent video.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/u5d81t/article30997961.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06NETYOUTUBE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/youtube-demonetising-videos-on-coronavirus-report/article30997962.ece
47,2020/03/06,Twitter bans posts that ‘dehumanise’ people in connection with diseases,"Twitter says the policy change was not a reaction to the outbreak of the virus, which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19, but was part of its continual effort to update its rules against hateful conduct

Twitter Inc said on Thursday it is banning posts that “dehumanise” people because they have a disease or disability or because of their age, a step that happens to correspond to an explosion of tweets about the spreading coronavirus.

The company told Reuters that the policy change was not a reaction to the outbreak of the virus, which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19, but was part of its continual effort to update its rules against hateful conduct.

“We couldn’t have predicted that this would happen in terms of the coronavirus,” Jerrel Peterson, Twitters head of safety policy, said in a phone interview.

Twitter has long been under pressure to clean up hateful content on its platform, and social media sites are under scrutiny over their attempts to handle misinformation and abuse related to the coronavirus outbreak.

A Reuters search for derogatory terms linked to the virus on Twitter found posts that called Chinese people “subhuman” or likened them to animals. The outbreak, which began in China, has spread to nearly 80 countries and territories and killed more than 3,000 people.

Peterson said the three new categories had been added not because there were more reports of hateful language in these areas but because of the potential for offline harm.

Twitter’s hateful conduct policy already bans attacking or threatening others on the basis of categories such as race, sexual orientation, age, disability or serious disease. This update will mean that those attacks do not need to be targeted at an individual or specific group.

Now, even “if it’s a tweet that doesn’t have an @mention that likens a group based on their age, disability or disease to viruses or microbes or maggots, something that’s less than human, that can be in violation of our policy now,” Peterson said.

Announcing the new policy in a blog post, Twitter said any offending tweets must be removed. Tweets sent before Thursday would also need to be deleted, but would not directly result in account suspensions, it said.

In July 2019, Twitter expanded its rules to ban language deemed to “dehumanise” people on the basis of religion. Between January and June last year, Twitter’s transparency report said there had been a 48% increase in accounts reported for potential violations of its hateful conduct policies. Twitter said it had taken action on 5,84,429 unique accounts for hateful conduct violations.

Twitter also announced on Wednesday that it was testing a new type of content that disappears after 24 hours, similar to the stories feature by Facebook Inc’s Instagram and first popularised by Snap Inc’s Snapchat.

Twitter spokeswoman Lauren Alexander said that this ephemeral content would also be subject to the company’s hateful conduct rules.

48,2020/03/06,How unprocessed trauma is kindling communal violence in South Asia in the 21st century,"Stanford psychiatrist Shaili Jain is among the world’s leading experts on post-traumatic stress disorder

Stanford psychiatrist Shaili Jain’s family history is one of trauma and tragedy. Her paternal grandfather was murdered during Partition in 1947. Her father, who was 10 at the time, was forced to flee his home and become a refugee in India, where he worked as a child labourer.

Two decades later, he would immigrate to England, where Jain was born and raised. “I spent chunks of my youth living in the shadow Partition had cast on his life and with a feeling that no matter how much I loved him, and he loved me, a part of him forever changed in 1947 and remained inaccessible,” she says.

This lingering trauma, more commonly known as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), influenced her decision to opt for a career in medicine and later specialise in psychiatry. She has always been fascinated by “the connections between thought, emotion and behaviour, in deconstructing emotional suffering and finding ways to alleviate psychological distress” — to the extent that she decided that Partition, which had, all along, been central to her own life and career choices, should be at the heart of her first book, The Unspeakable Mind: Stories of Trauma and Healing from the Frontlines of PTSD Science, released last August.

“Trauma often represents the violation of all we hold to be dear and sacred. Such events are simply too terrible to utter aloud and hence they become unspeakable,” says Jain, explaining the book’s title. “Sometimes the survivor wishes to speak, but the wider community is unwilling or unable to bear witness to their story, so the survivor is forced into silence.”

Science of suffering

The problem is that PTSD thrives in such conditions.

In her capacity as a trauma scientist, Jain diagnoses the festering sectarian tensions in South Asia as a result of repression, dissociation and denial operating on a societal level. “The science of suffering tells us that there is a big price to pay for such collective denial. Atrocities don’t remain buried forever. As powerful as the desire is to deny, in the long run, it does not work. I feel strongly, that this unprocessed collective trauma has engendered future spirals of communal violence in South Asia, a violence that continues to be re-enacted in the 21st century.”

Today, she is considered to be one of the world’s leading experts on PTSD. Her research and almost two decades of treating thousands of trauma survivors are part of a revolution in understanding and treating the illness. “Traumatic thoughts and memories that remain “unspeakable” or “unthinkable” for too long often impede our brain’s natural process of recovery after trauma,” says Jain. “They become stuck points that inhibit the mental reintegration needed for healing to occur. PTSD mutes happiness and yields, instead, to an irritability that keeps sufferers on the perpetual verge of withdrawal from the world and alienation from those who love them.”

The causes of PTSD are many. Rape, family violence, being mugged, escaping a major accident, being a political or economic refugee are just some examples. Higher rates of PTSD are found in the armed forces, but they are also found in police officers and low-income women and youth who reside in urban ghettos and shanties. PTSD is often found among the depressed, alcohol- and drug-addicted, and the anxiety-ridden. All sufferers are at higher risk of death by suicide, so the collective mental health burden is huge.

Dr. Jain is playing a significant role in informing the world about how widespread the condition is and the urgency of treatment. Indeed, trauma-related disorders, overall, are the largest cause of health problems and disability worldwide, more than cardiovascular diseases and cancer combined. They can also be infectious. Family members of people with the condition are at higher risk of inheriting it themselves. “PTSD seeps beyond the confines of the mind or brain and alters the body’s hormone secretion, neurochemistry and immune system. This contributes to diseased cells, organs, and other bodily systems. It has emerged as a risk factor for many conditions — cancer, heart disease and obesity — to name a few.”

A ‘Western’ problem

According to a recent World Health Organization-sponsored study, India is the world’s most depressed country, with one of the highest suicide rates in the world. According to the study, a student commits suicide every hour in India and over 2,20,000 people take their own lives every year. Data from the 2015-16 National Mental Health Survey (NMHS) indicates that every sixth person in India needs mental health help of some sort. Despite all this, there is an unsettling resistance — on the part of influential thought leaders — to mental health being a problem in India. There is a belief that it is somehow an American/ Western problem. The average Indian would rather go to a ‘spiritual’ healer than seek professional help for their issues. And the concept of psychotherapy is largely unknown outside of the major metros.

PTSD has always been endemic to our society, however, it has not always been acknowledged as such. Partly because hidden psychological wounds are harder for people to understand, but also because the socially disadvantaged are most vulnerable to the effects of prolonged exposure to trauma. So, if the victim is from a marginalised or impoverished background, historically, their trauma account might not be validated by wider society.

“When it comes to trauma and PTSD, as a society we must accept how one’s social reality can have a profound influence on one’s mental health and biology,” says Jain. “As an example, if you are raised in a culture where family violence is the norm or perpetrating sexual violence is acceptable, the odds are that will leave an imprint on the way you think and behave, not only on a psychological level but on a cellular level too. Hurt people, hurt people. There is no shame in recognising a need to undo such harm.”

Silence and denial

It is also important to challenge the stigma around mental health in India. People are not likely to open up if disclosing a history of trauma or mental health distress will expose them to prejudice or have a detrimental effect on their professional or personal life. If victim-shaming continues, then the silence and denial surrounding mental health will not go away. Therefore legal and societal protection for victims must be set in stone. Compounding the problem, there is an extreme shortage of qualified mental health professionals — only 10% of the patients having access to treatment, accounting for a negligible 0.06% of India’s healthcare budget.

The government needs to earmark sufficient funding and set long-term goals for creating a mental health infrastructure, including the training and hiring of professionals and promoting research, development and public awareness.

“There is no health without mental health, so there would be a very tangible return on such an investment — a healthier, more productive and hopeful population,” says Jain. “Of course, one’s psychological well-being takes a back seat when one does not have food to eat, clothes to wear or a roof to live under. Any public awareness effort will fall flat if poverty, lack of access to education or healthcare are also not addressed.”

49,2020/03/06,"A melange of rituals, festivities, folk art and commerce at the annual Attukal Pongala in Thiruvananthapuram","The festival, termed by the Guinness World Record as “the largest annual gathering of women”, is on March 9

As dusk envelopes the city, the winding roads that lead to Attukal Bhagavathy Temple are lit in rainbow colours. Fairy lights twinkle along the roads and all the way to the temple precincts. Decorative panels of gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon welcome pilgrims, men and women, of all ages, streaming in from every nook and corner of Thiruvananthapuram. Devotionals, announcements and music from the performances going on in the three stages on the premises of the temple mingle with the rhythm of drums, bells and crackers to create a layered soundscape while all around the parking lot the appetising aroma of spicy snacks, fruit juice, ice creams, peanuts and more tempt families to splurge on a variety of eats.

At this time of the year, all roads lead to the temple for the 10-day festival that reaches a crescendo with the famous Pongala, termed by the Guinness World Record as “the largest annual gathering of women”. The certificate issued by the Guinness World Record says that on March 10, 2009, 2.5 million women participated in the event organised by the Attukal Bhagavathy Temple Trust.

Vibrant mood

Prior to the grand finale, the area surrounding the temple resembles a mela. Stalls selling everything from safety pins, hair clips, bangles and bags to footwear, utensils, toys and readymades spring up around the time of the annual festival and do brisk business till night falls as the temple closes only by midnight. Traders from all over India seem to have congregated here to cash in on the festival. If Pratap Kumar Mandal from Jharkhand is your ubiquitous balloon seller, Hanuman and Ramalal, both from Rajasthan, specialise in gaily painted clay figurines of gods and goddesses. “We hail from Rajasthan but now live in Kerala. All these were made here and now we know when and where such major festivals are conducted. We have been coming to Attukal for the last five years. Business reaches a crescendo on the day before the Pongala when many women camp here overnight,” says Hanuman who refuses to divulge his surname.

Many of the itinerant traders selling keychains, bead necklaces, peacock feathers, slings and an assortment of shiny bags and lampshades hail from Tamil Nadu and many of them have come with entire families in tow. Lottery vendors tempt devotees with promises of “bumper prizes”. But, Prasanna Kumari, who has been selling lottery tickets for 15 years, says sales were much better a couple of years ago. “Now, I find it difficult to sell even two books of tickets. Earlier, four to five books used to get sold,” says the resident of Neyyattinkara.

Then there are traders from Kollam and Pathanamthitta. Muneer S, who has a stall full of earrings, ear studs and hair clips, says he usually follows the calendar of temple festivals and has put up stalls in many of the well-known temple festivals in the neighbourhood. There is even an art exhibition of mural art-inspired works by Prince Thonnakkal and his students that is drawing many spectators.

In unison “The Corporation has supplied steel plates and tumblers to residential associations and other organisations that supply food and water for the devotees. This is one festival that eliminates barriers of all kinds and city dwellers work as one to ensure that the Pongala is conducted without any hitches. Since we have been doing this for many years now, there is a procedure and coordination is ensured by all the departments involved in the conduct of the festival. The Chief Minister, Ministers in charge of different portfolios, officials of Kerala State Electricity Board, Kerala Water Authority, Kerala State Road Transport Corporation, the Mayor, and senior police officers are some of those involved in the planning for the smooth conduct of the festival. After the festival, it is our sanitation workers who move in to clean the streets in record time,” explains Deputy Mayor Rakhi Ravikumar.

And while there are many stalls selling earthen ware and steel utensils, what is conspicuous by its absence is plastic. Not a single stall near the temple has plastic containers of any kind. The efficacy of the Green Protocol, which bans use of one-time plastics, is evident in almost all the stalls.

The temple Trust has made ample provision for supply of drinking water and even devotees standing in queues for darshan of the deity are given boiled water in steel tumblers by an army of volunteers.

Cultural extravaganza

Meanwhile, cultural programmes at the three temporary stages on the temple premises, Amba, Ambika and Ambalika, include different kinds of dance forms, music, Kathakali, Ottanthullal and so on. While the recitals by leading performers are mostly organised by the Temple trust, many dance schools and performers themselves consider it as an offering to the deity. For instance, Nadia S has come with her 12-year-old daughter Lekha Mahesh as her dance school, Kollam-based Sowparnika Dance School, has a slot during the fete for a Bharatnatyam recital. Aaditya R Praveen has just finished her performance and is all set to go home while several youngsters, all made up and dressed, await their chance as fond parents, mobile phones in hand, push and jostle to find a suitable place to record their wards’ recitals.

By around 8 pm, loud beats of the chenda announce the arrival of the elaborately decorated ‘Vilakkukettu kazhcha’ from suburbs like Vellayani, Pappanamcode, Balaramapuram and so on. Balanced precariously on the heads of devotees, the tall pyramidal structures used to be made of tender coconut leaves and plantain stems and adorned with flower garlands. Now, it is more of colourful, glittering paper but the fervour remains the same. Once the last rituals for the day get over at the temple by midnight, the men bearing the vilakkukettu circumbulate the temple accompanied by devotees. “It is quite something to see the way they balance it on their head. Devotees stay on to watch this and by 1 am the temple closes its doors only to reopen the next day at 5 am,” says V Shobha, a member of the Trust in charge of public relations this year.

Every day, from 10.30 am, a sumptuous lunch is served at the two auditoriums. “About 8,000 devotees have lunch every day during the festival and the number goes up on the day of the Pongala. We cook about 800 sacks of rice. This is in addition to a mess for officers-on-duty at the temple,” explains Shobha.

50,2020/03/06,"Meet homemaker-cum-trucker K Sellammal, who is raring to go places","Have licence, will drive

K Sellammal arrives in her Tata Sumo for her interview. As the only woman in her village with a commercial driver’s licence, and her own vehicle, the homemaker from Pachai Veli, Thirupanjali in Manachanallur Taluk, stands out from the crowd easily.

“Most of the women in my village are homebound; they would rather starve than step out of their comfort zone to earn a living. I took up driving in 2018 because I felt it would help me to supplement my husband’s income, and I loved vehicles,” says the 29-year-old mother of two children.

Guided by Women Entrepreneurs Association of Tamil Nadu (WEAT) in Tiruchi, Sellammal attended courses that put her on the road to becoming a professional driver.

Despite being licensed to drive two-wheelers, auto-rickshaws, cars and heavy vehicles, she was unable to find employment, mainly because of the bias against women workers.

The Sumo was a gamble Sellammal and her lorry driver husband A Kumaran took last year. With the four-wheel drive, Sellammal had hoped to become the first woman transport provider for a private school in Pachai Veli. “But I was asked to stay away on the very first day because the male drivers there didn’t want to work with me. I was devastated,” she remembers.

Worse, the couple was left burdened with a vehicle loan.

Unfazed, Sellammal decided to get licensed in heavy transport vehicle (HTV) driving by enrolling in a 45-day course at the Ashok Leyland Driver Training Institute in Namakkal in July 2019. She was the only woman in her class of 84 learners.

Husband’s co-driver

Sellammal’s multiple licences have brought her both bouquets and brickbats, but she tends to ignore her critics and focuses on the people who have helped her along the way.

“My husband is my biggest champion. When the men in our village laughed at me for daring to drive, and some even suggested I should get a sound thrashing, he would ask me to stay calm and keep at my lessons. His support has brought me this far.”

From September last year, Sellammal has become her husband’s co-driver on the Ashok Leyland Boss BS4 6-wheeler intermediate truck (8 to 14 tonnes capacity) that he plies for a private transporter based out of Tiruchengode.

“Driving school isn’t enough for professional truckers, we have to learn how to deal with traffic on the roads,” says Sellammal. “My first trip, from Cuddalore to Kuttipuram in Kerala (nine hours by road) with my husband guiding me, was a bit nerve-wracking. But after that, it got easier, and now I can navigate any route alone confidently. I have driven on different terrains from Chennai, Arcot to Pollachi, taking produce like plantains, beetroots and tender coconuts to Kerala from Udumalapettai, and travelled on through Senkottai and Tirunelveli back home,” she says.

On the road

While truck drivers aren’t expected to offload their cargo, they do have to be extra careful when the vehicle is getting ready for a trip, says Sellammal. “There are some routes which aren’t considered safe for loads of food items like rice, so we have to keep checking to see that the stock doesn’t get stolen in transit,” she says.

Even though there are days when she gets only 45 minutes of sleep, when on the road, Sellammal says that she can easily manage up to 200 kilometers in a day at a moderate speed. “If you drive within the speed limit, and stay alert, there’s nothing to fear,” she says.

Like most truck drivers, Sellammal is paid 15 paise per ₹100 that a transport deal earns. “After the restrictions placed on sand-mining in the Cauvery delta, truck drivers’ earnings have gone down drastically,” she says. “And even though the material and fuel costs have increased, this doesn’t reflect on our income.”

A typical round-trip delivery run can bring in around ₹4000-8000 for the lorry driver in southern India. “Going on a long trip can help the drivers earn more,” says Sellammal, whose husband has gone to Gujarat when we speak. “But it can take a toll on the driver’s health.”

Future plans

Though she is happy to help her husband, Sellammal feels becoming a bus driver would be more practical for her, as her two sons need her attention at home. “I am quite willing to work as part of a school team in Pachai Veli, until the kids complete their education. A few families have approached me to chauffeur their women family members on trips to the temples nearby in our Sumo, so that’s another option I am looking at,” she says.

The vehicle may vary, but Sellammal is sure to be in the driving seat for many years to come.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/tr3cif/article31001452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07TYMPSELLAMMALMAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/society/have-licence-will-drive/article31001453.ece

Anitha says her doors are always open for complaints and suggestions. But she does have her share of difficult customers. “Some people, it they are not satisfied with the response at the first point of query, choose to take up the complaint with the head office instead of approaching the Branch Manager,” says Pathmaavathi. “I have been bluntly told that I am incapable of solving problems because I’m a woman,” adds Anitha.

Strangely, the branch has not been assigned a security guard and the women have pepper spray for self-defence. The team at Pudur police station, and the SP, are just a shout away, if the need arises.

The women breeze through tasks typically assigned to men in other branches, such as downing the heavy shutters every evening after the office closes and opening it the next morning, buying diesel for the generator and switching it on in case of power cuts, and loading cash in the ATM.

Women on track

S Anitha, the only woman Senior Assistant Loco Pilot in Madurai Division of Southern Railways, is on her way to becoming the first woman loco pilot too. She has cleared the exam and trained in passenger trains through night shifts, and her promotion letter is due any time. Ask her whom she credits her success to, and without batting an eyelid, she says “my children”.

She can never forget the many night shifts when she’s had to stay away from them. “Every mother will suffer anxiety. I try to maintain my composure. There have been days when I came back home to a child down with fever,” she says. And after her shift, Anitha herself might not be able to get some rest immediately, despite having to start for her night shift the same day. “Situations become challenging, but I never sulk,” she says.

S Thenmouli joined as a Trackwoman on compassionate grounds after her husband passed away 15 years ago. Her job was to dig out track ballast daily and walk kilometres to the nearest railway station carrying loads of crushed stones. “It was not easy but I had to earn money,” she says. Now promoted to Gate keeper at Ramanathapuram crossing gate from 8 pm to 10 am, she says she sometimes faces troubles from miscreants loafing around in the nights.

A major problem railway women on field face is lack of toilets. “ We do the full shift, even if we are not able to relieve ourselves,” says Anitha.

Railway Protection Force Constable Chinchu Shekhar says while her job is to ensure safety of passengers and protect railway property, sometimes, certain situations unnerve her. Like a recent suicide attempt by a woman at Madurai Railway Station. “I spotted her sitting in a corner of the platform and she was looking strange. She had poisoned herself and her two-year-old child; I immediately rushed them to the hospital. While the child survived and was united with the rest of the family, the mother died. The incident still haunts me,” says Chinchu. The Senior Divisional Manager R P Rathipriya, to whom the women employees report their difficulties, says there is no gender discrimination when a job is assigned. “It is often the mental make-up of colleagues that creates invisible and impenetrable barriers between men and women and fails to remove obstacles,” she says.

Currently undergoing training, the to-be-appointed Station Master Panchami Vasudevan points out that implicit biases do not stop women from joining the workforce.

Compassion first

Around 600 policewomen can reach out to T Lilly Grace, the only woman Assistant Commissioner of Police in Madurai City in times of distress. She has recently been appointed the chairperson of Internal Complaints Cell.

Although she has not received many complaints about harassment at workplace, she says that most women find the confidence to pour their hearts out to her regarding their family and personal problems.

Her informal interactions with women police personnel on their morning and night beats often reveal high stress levels.

“A majority of them complain about lack of enough leaves, missing out on family functions, fatigue from being on duty 24 X 7 without holidays,” says Lilly, who also takes the two dozen women who come directly under her in Anna Nagar where she is posted, on outings once in two or three months.

We bump into her team one night at the Walker’s Club. It is 9 pm and they all sit together cracking jokes. Now is when they get some free time to share a few laughs over a meal or some ice-cream. “A healthy and friendly dialogue is important and empathy is a tool for their empowerment too,” says Lilly.

It is in moments like these that they reflect on the challenging nature of their work and the multiple flaws in the system.

“An informal meeting is an opportunity to uninhibitedly thank and commend each other,” says Lilly. She believes that police women choose compassion as a tool to promote safety and justice among the public.

And incidentally, for the first time, she informs us, the city’s women police force would be celebrating International Women’s Day this year.

52,2020/03/06,Genes gone wild on International Women’s Day,"What gives women their thick skin and vocal ability?

That little girls are made of sugar and spice and all things nice is such rubbish. Fake news! This is the little-known secret of what goes into the making of a woman.

The very-vocal cords

The voice box of the woman was plagiarised from the lyre bird for its infinite variations. Take the hum. ‘Hmmm,’ she says when you get back late from office and ‘Hmmm,’ when you answer that vital question about how fat the dress makes her look. Now, allow for 99 other ‘Hmmms’ in between. And it is your job to interpret each.

Dungbeetle armour

Since she shoulders over 250 times the ‘dung’ of other people that she should, the woman was given that tough exoskeleton (thank you, superhero vocab!) which dung beetles have. Not easy to crack her, they’ve tried for centuries.

Ankylosaurus ankles

Nope, but she did get the tail with the club at the end. And history pretends dinosaurs died without leaving anything behind. The woman inherited that whack-a-tail. It just swings out of nowhere. You forgot the spinach she told you to buy? ‘You always forget,’ she says out of nowhere. ‘You bought full cream instead of toned yesterday, you forgot our anniversary year before last, you didn’t notice my new haircut in 2015.’ You are as lowly as ankylosaurus ankles. Not even spinach will save you.

The question hump

The camel was generous enough to donate its hump, its repository of fat. (Fat? How dare you use that four-letter word!) Instead, a woman stores her stash of questions in there. Take that wedding you go for: 27 quick-fire questions are lined up — who with whom, wore what, said or didn’t say what. Remember, you cannot hum. That is reserved for her.

Antennae

A woman can hit a girlfriend’s ‘Help me outta here’ wavelength from across a crowded room. She wakes up, knowing her kid is having a bad day from continents away. She sniffs out the snitch in the office instantly. And she knows you’re going to lie, even before you do.

Well-armed legs

Oh, of course the woman has all 750 of the millipede’s legs, just that 748 are invisible. For all that running around on various errands for various people she’s done all her life. Not your business to ask what, just to provide the budget for shoes for those 750 legs. Got it?

Happy Women’s Day, weirdly wondrous creation! Let’s pretend man sits on the apex of the food pyramid, for now. After all, he’s buying the chocolates.

At your request, the bank has to provide a statement of account for the loan transaction. The same would be required for your tax purposes as well.

You can check whether all payments made by you are duly reflected in the said statement. In the event that any payments made by you are not reflected accurately, you may write to the bank bringing the discrepancies to its notice and seeking issuance of a rectified statement.

You could also meet the concerned officer personally to resolve these issues. If these measures do not succeed, you may issue a notice to the bank through your lawyer and initiate appropriate legal proceedings in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement.

54,2020/03/06,Supreme Court upholds 2018 order on land acquisition,"Land acquisition will not lapse if relief is paid to treasury, the Court says.

The Supreme Court on Friday reaffirmed its February 2018 ruling on Section 24 on land acquisition compensation awards, given by a three-judge bench, led by Justice Arun Mishra, in the Indore Development Authority case.

A Constitution Bench, also led by Justice Arun Mishra, has overruled an earlier co-ordinate Bench ruling in the Pune Municipal Corporation case of 2014 under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act of 2013. The five-judge Bench was interpreting Section 24 (2) which concerns land acquisition compensation awards made five years “prior or more” to the coming of existence of the 2013 Act, which replaced the 1894 law. The new Act, which came into existence on January 1, 2014 replaced the colonial 1894 law.

Explained | What is the furore around the land law case?

The provision said that in such cases, if the physical possession has not been taken “or” the compensation is not paid, the acquisition proceeding is “deemed to have lapsed”. The government, if it so wishes, would have to initiate “fresh acquisition proceedings” under the new Act of 2013, which provides for “fair compensation”.

The 319-page judgment authored by Justice Mishra, however, said compensation would be considered paid if the amount is put in the Treasury. There was no obligation that the amount should be deposited in the court in order to sustain the land acquisition proceedings under the 2013 Act.

Further, the court held that a land acquisition proceeding under Section 24(2) would only lapse if the authorities have neither taken physical possession nor paid the compensation due to the landowner for five or more years prior to January 1, 2014. For this, an “or” in the Section was “interpreted” as an “and”.

Land acquisition case | Justice Arun Mishra refuses to recuse himself from Constitution Bench

Thus, there is no lapse if possession has been taken and compensation has not been paid. Similarly, there is no lapse if compensation has been paid and possession not taken of the land.

Further, the Bench held that Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not give rise to a new cause of action to question the legality of concluded proceedings of land acquisition.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vcepus/article31003935.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/land-acquisition-will-not-lapse-if-relief-is-paid-to-treasury-supreme-court/article31003936.ece
55,2020/03/06,Pulwama attack case: NIA arrests two more,"They had procured materials online

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested two more persons for their alleged role in the 2019 Pulwama attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. A total of five persons have been arrested in connection with the case so far.

The suspects were identified as Waiz ul Islam (19), a resident of Srinagar and Mohammad Abbas Rather (32), a resident of Pulwama.

The NIA asserted in a statement that Mr. Islam had disclosed that he had used his Amazon online shopping account to procure batteries, accessories and chemicals for making the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) used by the car borne suicide bomber Adil Ahmed Dar.

The NIA alleged that Mr. Islam had procured the items on the directions of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad operatives.

The NIA had earlier said in a statement that the explosives were “ammonium nitrate, nitro-glycerine and RDX”. A senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, had said many items used in the IED had been purchased online but did not specify the source of the high grade explosives like RDX.

“Islam also personally delivered the items to the JeM terrorists after procuring the incriminating material online as a part of the conspiracy to carry out the Pulwama attack,” the NIA asserted.

The other accused, Mr. Rather, was a known overground worker of the JeM, the NIA alleged. “He has disclosed that he gave shelter to another terrorist Mohd Umar (IED expert) when he came to Kashmir in April-May 2018. He also harboured JeM terrorists... Adil Ahmad Dar, Sameer Ahmed Dar and Kamran (Pakistani) at his house a number of times in the run up to the Pulwama attack,” the NIA asserted.

Mr. Rather also allegedly arranged safe shelter for the JeM militants at the house of another accused Tariq Ahmed Shah in Pulwama. Mr. Shah and his daughter Insha Jan were arrested on March 3.

The NIA made its first arrest in the case on February 28, when it arrested Shakir Bashir Magrey (22), a furniture shop owner in Pulwama.

The two accused will be produced before the NIA’s Special Court at Jammu on Saturday.

According to the police and the Army, most of the militants involved in the planning and execution of the attack, including Pakistan-based militants, were killed in encounters in the past one year

56,2020/03/06,"Non-vegetarian food does not cause COVID-19, says Minister","False rumours are causing losses across the value chain of poultry, meat and fish production, threatening the livelihoods of more than 10 crore small farmers and affecting the nutrition of consumers as well, Mr. Singh told journalists on Friday.

Fisheries, Dairying and Animal Husbandry Minister Giriraj Singh intends to publicly demonstrate his daily routine of eating two eggs every morning, in a bid to add weight to the Centre's urgent message that coronavirus infections do not spread through non-vegetarian cuisine.

False rumours are causing losses across the value chain of poultry, meat and fish production, threatening the livelihoods of more than 10 crore small farmers and affecting the nutrition of consumers as well, Mr. Singh told journalists on Friday.

He cited industry estimates that wholesale chicken prices have dropped from Rs. 100 per kg to Rs. 30 per kg over the last month, leading to losses of approximately Rs. 2,000 crore per day.

“I am not speaking on behalf of meat processing companies, but the small farmers who depend on this sector for their livelihood. Further up the value chain, maize and soyabean farmers will also be affected, as their products are used to make animal feed,” he said. “On the other side, 35% of the protein requirement of the country comes from this sector, so we must think of the nutrition impact as well.”

He cited the World Organisation for Animal Health and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, which have both vouched for the safety of easting meat, saying that there is no scientific evidence indicating that the coronavirus is transmitted from animals to humans.

“I myself eat two eggs every morning. I am thinking I will make a video of that to show that there is no danger, and no need to panic,” said Mr. Singh. He downplayed concerns that groups which promote a vegetarian lifestyle are using this opportunity to highlight the ""danger"" of meat products.

However, he admitted that there are concerns about the levels of sanitation and hygiene being followed in the production and sale of meat, poultry and fish in the country. The Centre is taking steps to promote hygienic markets and supply chains, especially in the fisheries sector, he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/h9pv6o/article30880228.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GIRIRAJSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/non-vegetarian-food-does-not-cause-covid-19-says-minister/article31003791.ece
57,2020/03/06,‘Changemakers should help poor access benefits’,"Venkaiah Naidu all praise for awardees.

Change may be constant in society, but the benefits of all change must percolate down to the poor and the downtrodden, Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu said in New Delhi on Friday.

Delivering his oration at the third edition of The Hindu BusinessLine Changemaker Awards, Mr. Naidu said: “It is the role of ‘Changemakers’ — like this year’s award winners — to accelerate this process and to ensure that the benefits of this change reach the last person and uplift the lives of the poor and the downtrodden.”

Striking a lighter note on the spread of coronavirus in India, he said the country was better positioned than Western nations because of its superior food habits. Further, Mr. Naidu said that the youth should not fall for marketing gimmicks promoting Westernised dishes.

Mr. Naidu said COVID-19 is a matter of concern but not of panic for the country.

Lauding BusinessLine for recognising and awarding changemakers, Mr. Naidu said, “The Hindu Business Line is doing national service by identifying changemakers.”

‘Transforming lives’

Lauding the winners of the awards, Mr. Naidu recognised the effort of Arunachalam Muruganandam, the ‘padman’ who transformed social attitudes to female hygiene, and the winner of the Iconic Changemaker award.

“Arunachalam faced many challenges in this task. He nearly lost his family, his money and his place in society while researching on a topic that is wrongly considered a taboo in society. But his indomitable spirit has saved many a woman from the agony of reproductive diseases caused by poor menstrual hygiene,” he said.

Mr. Naidu said Pradeep Mewada, the winner of the Young Changemaker award, used innovative ways to end open defecation in his village.

He noted that the other winners of the Young Changemakers award, Rashid, Nikhil, Arun and Vimal of Genrobotics, had invented a robot to replace manual scavenging.

He complimented IndiaStack for winning the Businessline Changemaker award in Financial Transformation category. “Through your work, you created the base for transformative ideas like UPI Bhim App and Aadhaar,” Mr. Naidu said.

“Today we have honoured Shanti Raghavan of EnAble India. It is inspiring to know that her organisation has placed thousands of divyang people in corporate jobs. I am happy to know that her organisation, EnAble India, focuses on comprehensive development and people skills in order to ensure that differently abled candidates are well-equipped to face work challenges in the corporate sector.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pf9lac/article31003739.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06BL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/changemakers-should-help-poor-access-benefits/article31003741.ece
58,2020/03/06,Centre can’t brand an organisation as ‘political’ for aiding a public cause: Supreme Court,"‘It can’t be deprived of foreign funds for using legitimate forms of dissent’

The Central government cannot brand an organisation ‘political’ and deprive it of its right to receive foreign funds for using “legitimate forms of dissent” like bandh, hartal, road roko or jail ‘bharo’ to aid a public cause, the Supreme Court held on Friday.

“Any organisation which supports the cause of a group of citizens agitating for their rights without a political goal or objective cannot be penalised by being declared as an organisation of a political nature,” a Bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao and J. Hemant Gupta observed in a 23-page judgment.

But the foreign funding pipeline could be cut if an organisation took recourse to these forms of protest to score a political goal, the court said.

It struck a similar balance in the cases of organisations of farmers, workers, students, youth based on caste, community, religion, language, etc. It said their foreign funding could continue as long as these organisations worked for the “social and political welfare of society” and not to further “political interests”.

Political objectives

However, the court wholesomely agreed that organisations with “avowed political objectives in its memorandum of association or bye laws” cannot be permitted access to foreign funds. Such organisations were clearly of a “political nature,” it concluded.

The verdict came on a petition filed by Indian Social Action Forum challenging certain provisions of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), 2010 and the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Rules of 2011, both of which confer the Centre with “unguided and uncanalised power” to brand organisations ‘political’ and shut down their access to foreign funds.

The FCRA 2010 prohibited acceptance and utilisation of foreign contribution or foreign hospitality for any activities detrimental to the national interest, it the court said.

“The purpose for which the statute prevents organisations of a political nature from receiving foreign funds is to ensure that the administration is not influenced by foreign funds. Prohibition from receiving foreign aid, either directly or indirectly, by those who are involved in active politics is to ensure that the values of a sovereign democratic republic are protected. On the other hand, such of those voluntary organisations which have absolutely no connection with either party politics or active politics cannot be denied access to foreign contributions,” Justice Rao, who wrote the judgment, clarified.

The provisions under challenge before the court included Section 5 (1) of the FCRA. This provision allowed the Centre a free hand to decide whether a seemingly non-political organisation was actually political in nature. INSAF argued that Section 5(1) was vague and thus unconstitutional. The Delhi High Court, which INSAF approached first, said the provision was “expansive” and not vague. The Supreme Court agreed with the High Court on Friday.

The next provision under the microscope was Section 5(4) of the FCRA. INSAF said the provision did not exactly identify the authority before which an organisation could represent its grievance. But the apex court dismissed this contention.

INSAF had also challenged the various clauses of Rule 3 of the 2011 Rules. This provision identified the various types of ‘political’ activities for which/organisations whose foreign funding could be stopped by the government.

Senior advocate Sanjay Parikh, for INSAF, had argued that the FCRA and its Rules allowed the government to indulge in its whims and fancies to deprive organisations of their foreign contributions. He said the terms used in the statute like ‘political objectives’, ‘political activities’, ‘political interests’ and ‘political action’ had no clarity.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4t4emi/article30999222.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-cant-brand-an-organisation-as-political-for-aiding-a-public-cause-supreme-court/article31003668.ece

In a new mandate to curb unnecessary demand, the Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration on Friday said that chemists cannot sell N95 masks without a doctors prescription. The FDA also warned that serious action would be taken against those who are found selling masks at high prices or hoarding them.

“Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits and N95 masks are being sold at very high prices in medical shops.The State has received many complaints about the same. It has also been found that many are making bulk purchases and hording PPE kits and N95 masks,” FDA commissioner Arun Unhale stated in his circular, adding that it is now compulsory to sell the kits and masks only on doctors prescription.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak in China, shortage of PPE gear and masks has been reported from across the world.

While the Indian government has currently banned exports of N95 masks, the manufacturers are focussed on making other surgical marks to get good returns from exports.

Health officials have clarified that N95 should be worn by healthcare workers, infected persons and those taking care of infected persons.

Abhay Pandey of All Food and Drug Licence Holders Foundation said that the prescription clause will lead to unnecessary rush for doctors consultations. “The government should instead mandate that each mask should be sold with a bill so that an FDA scrutiny can be done and action can be initiated against those who are hoarding or selling at high prices,” he said.

Meanwhile, the State has advised to postpone any kind of mass gatherings till the spread of the virus is contained and have also started screening at the Pune and Nagpur airports.

Some employers in malls, theatres, restaurants have began taking precautions by keeping hand sanitisers available and offering masks to employees.

Till date, 229 people were placed under isolation in Maharashtra of which 204 have tested negative. Reports of 25 people are still awaited.

The parliamentary panel on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice has pulled up the government for “dismal implementation” of the reservation policy, pointing out that in six key ministries, over 7,000 posts reserved for Scheduled Castes, over 6,000 for Scheduled Tribes and over 10,000 for Other Backward Classes remain unfilled.

In a strongly worded report, the standing committee, headed by BJP MP Bhupender Yadav, said the statistics point to a serious malaise. “Mounting number of backlog vacancies year-on-year points to a serious malaise afflicting the entire recruitment system as a whole,” the report states. The panel has directed the Centre to hold special recruitment drives to fill the vacancies without further delay. “The government should identify the root causes of backlog vacancies and take remedial measures,” it noted.

The top six ministries that the committee has highlighted are the Departments of Posts, Atomic Energy, Defence, Railways, Housing & Urban Affairs and Home. The highest backlog of unfilled posts in reserved category is in the Home Ministry, where 5,850 posts for SCs, 5,383 posts for STs and 6,260 posts for OBCs remain vacant.

The Committee that was reviewing Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has also pointed out many other gaps in the bureaucracy.

Voicing concern over shortage of 1,494 IAS officers, the Committee called for addressing the problem of deficit of bureaucrats afflicting the Indian administration quickly.

The Central Bureau of Investigation has 1,281 vacancies, the Committee noted, which could increase pendency, hamper quality of investigations and reduce the efficiency of the agency. Of the total, 789 posts in the executive ranks, 77 posts of law officers and 415 posts of technical officers and staff are vacant.

The Committee has also recommended that there should be no random posting of the IAS officers suggesting instead that they should be categorised according to their skill set, aptitude and interest. Clusters like rural, social, financial should be made.

“Once assigned to a particular sector, the civil servant will spend the rest of his career within the sector concerned. This system will enable civil servants to acquire skills, expertise and professional excellence in a particular domain.

The Lok Sabha on Friday passed the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill and the Mines and Mineral Laws (Amendment) Bill amid loud sloganeering by Opposition members who were demanding immediate discussion on the Delhi riots that have so far claimed 53 lives.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) Bill seeks to protect successful bidders of insolvent companies from any risk of criminal proceedings for offences committed by previous promoters of the companies concerned. The amendments in the law seek to remove bottlenecks and streamline resolution process of insolvent companies.

Protesting against the ‘disproportionate punishment’, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said ‘a pickpocket cannot be sent to the gallows’ even as other Opposition parties joined the Congress in calling for a revocation.

Bills passed in din

In between adjournments, the government passed two Bills — the Mineral Laws (Amendment) Bill and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill — amid protests by the Opposition.

Even before Parliament proceedings started, the Congress party had reached out to other Opposition parties and party MPs, including Rahul Gandhi, protested in front of the Mahatma Gandhi statue inside the Parliament complex, wearing black bands.

When Lok Sabha proceedings got underway at 11 a.m., some members of the Congress and other Opposition parties such as the DMK and the Indian Union Muslim League trooped into the Well of the House, seeking discussion on the riots and raising slogans demanding Home Minister Amit Shah's resignation.

Mr. Chowdhury rushed to the Well and was seen picking up the rule book of Parliament and showing it to the Chair. Though Mr. Solanki initially announced the proceedings to be adjourned until 2 p.m. he revised it to 12 noon subsequently.

At noon, amidst the noisy scenes for close to 30 minutes, the House conducted some business and passed the Mineral Laws (Amendment) Bill and soon after the Chair again adjourned the House for 10 minutes.

‘Respect for Chair’

Speaking on the suspension, Mr. Chowdhury said Congress members regarded the Chair as “the Pope of the Vatican” and had never disrespected it.

Speaking in Hindi and questioning the suspension, Mr. Chowdhury said Jeb katua ko phansi ke takhte pe nahi chadaya ja sakta hai [a pickpocket cannot be sent to the gallows] and demanded that the suspension be revoked.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi quickly used the statement to attack the Congress leader.

“It is strange to compare the suspended MPs with pickpockets. It is most unfortunate. We don’t agree with this,” Mr. Joshi said as he claimed the snatching of papers from the Chair had never happened in the House in its history of more than 70 years.

The Minister also cited the record of the 15th Lok Sabha [when Congress-led UPA was in power] when the then Speaker had suspended 45 MPs of the BJP.

However, Sudip Bandyopadhyay (TMC), Dayanidhi Maran (DMK) and Supriya Sule (NCP) said the decision to suspend the seven members should be recalled as the “punishment” was “disproportionate”.

At 12:45 p.m., the Lok Sabha took up the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill. Amidst continuous protests by Congress members, the Bill was declared passed by Rajendra Agarwal, who was in the chair.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jh9ins/article31003350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07CONGREEPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lok-sabha-speaker-to-head-probe-into-ruckus-in-house/article31003351.ece
63,2020/03/06,"‘Government disrupting House to evade questions’, says Derek O’ Brien","O’Brien accuses Centre of genocide

With the Rajya Sabha failing to function for a fifth day in a row, TMC leader and MP Derek O’ Brien, in an unusual move, addressed the issue of last month’s Delhi riots in the corridors of Parliament, accusing the government of wilfully disrupting the House to evade “hard questions”.

In his 10-minute speech that he uploaded on social media, Mr O’ Brien said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah “have blood on their hands”.

He said he has been ready with his speech for last five days but was not allowed to speak and is now forced to deliver it not in the chamber but from first floor of Parliament.

Comparing the Delhi violence with the genocide in Nazi Germany, Mr. O’ Brien said, “Genocide is a process’ even during the Nazi time it didn’t start with the gas chambers. It started with slogans spreading hate and bigotry.” The German secret police, the Gestapo, was complicit in the 1930’s pogrom and in the 2020 India, Delhi Police under Home Minister Amit Shah is complicit, he said.

Delhi violence | Death toll rises to 53

Flagging, the hate speeches made by many BJP leaders, Mr O’ Brien said, “What gives them the guts to utter these slogans? It is almost as if they (Prime Minister and Home Minister) have sanctioned these slogans,” Contrasting the situation in the capital with that in West Bengal, he said, seven persons had been arrested for shouting similar slogans in the State capital Kolkata.

Referring to the suspension of seven Congress MPs in Lok Sabha, Mr. O' Brien said, “MPs are getting into trouble for tearing up papers but what about the PM and HM who are responsible for shredding the social fabric of our nation?”

On Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to hand over his social media account to women who inspire him on the occasion of Women's Day [Sunday], Mr O’ Brien asked, “Why doesn't he give the handle to mothers who lost their children in the riots.”

The Delhi riots he said were engineered for political gain. “All Modi and Shah do is plan elections. There is enough evidence in the public domain to suggest that after these kind of riots and genocide only one political party gains... They have stalled Parliament because they don’t want to answer hard questions,” he alleged.

The TMC leader pointed out that the last time a notice of an opposition member to discuss issues was accepted was in November 2016.

“What does an opposition member do in desperate times like this? I am not going to wait. I hope this speech goes out to the young people of India. I want to ask where is the prime minister. It took him 69 hours after the genocide to respond, that too on Twitter.

India has come a full circle in women empowerment as they are now seeking opportunities and excelling in administrative jobs as well as in defence, space and the forces, which were earlier considered “taboos”, Mr. Singh said.

“Earlier, women used to opt for teaching and social welfare jobs only,” he said while addressing a workshop in New Delhi to mark International Women’s Day, which will be observed on Sunday.

The event was organised by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT).

Mr. Singh said, after a long gap, “we have first generation women professionals in India and similarly, in the field of entrepreneurship, they are scaling new heights”.

This is not only a huge departure from the past, but also a great tribute to women empowerment, he said.

Expressing happiness over the presence of a huge number of women officers in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Mr. Singh said a huge galaxy of women talent is not only part of the administrative department for creating reforms, but in creating reforms pertaining to women.

From the destruction witnessed after the Delhi riots, the rampage looked like the handiwork of “total professionals”, said former Supreme Court judge, Justice A.K. Patnaik.

Another retired apex court judge, Justice Kurian Joseph, stated that the “burning smell” still hung over the riot-hit areas where families had lost their homes, livelihood and loved ones to mobs wielding rocks, rods and guns between February 23 and 26.

Justices Kurian and Patnaik were on Friday relating to The Hindu the impressions they gathered during their visit to the riot-hit areas and a relief camp. They were accompanied by another former Supreme Court judge, Justices Vikramjit Sen.

Both Justice Kurian and Patnaik said the families in the relief camp yearned to go back home but were too scared. Justice Patnaik said the State and its forces had “totally failed” to guarantee their basic right to life.

‘Rebuild homes’

“The State has to pay compensation. But ‘compensation’ here does not mean some money. It means the State, having failed to protect their right to life, is now obliged to rebuild their homes destroyed in the riots and give them back the assets they lost in the violence. The State has to put their lives back on track,” Justice Patnaik said.

The visit was not to find fault with the authorities or the law enforcement agencies but to understand the ground situation. They met children who had lost their school books, families robbed of their wedding jewellery, vendors whose push-carts were burnt to cinders, employees looking on at what was once their homes and two-wheelers, he said.

“We saw that Muslim people and houses were targetted. Relief camps have Muslim men, women and children. The perpetrators may be people from outside the localities as these areas have seen communities live together peacefully for decades… We do not know who these people [rioters] are, but they were total professionals... There were instances of throwing oxygen cylinders into homes and lighting them up”, he observed.

The police have to work hard to regain the trust of the victims, Justice Patnaik added.

Justice Kurian said national and Delhi legal aid authorities should open a help desk to provide legal assistance to the victims. The identity documents of many victims had been destroyed in the violence. “They would need legal help to replace them... More lawyer bodies should got out there and offer help. That will make the victims confident.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3qb9zn/article31001835.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDDELHIRIOTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/state-has-failed-to-do-its-job-say-ex-sc-judges-on-delhi-riots/article31001836.ece
67,2020/03/06,Nirbhaya case convict moves Supreme Court seeking restoration of his legal remedies,"Plea seeks CBI probe into alleged “criminal conspiracy” hatched by the Centre, Delhi government

Mukesh Singh, one of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case, moved a plea in the Supreme Court on Friday seeking restoration of all his legal remedies, alleging that his lawyers had misled him.

The plea, filed through advocate M.L.Sharma, sought a CBI probe into alleged “criminal conspiracy” and “fraud” hatched by the Centre, Delhi government and advocate Vrinda Grover, who is the amicus curiae in the case.

A trial court here on Thursday issued fresh warrants with March 20, 5.30 am, as the date for the execution of the convicts — Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31).

“Petitioner (Mukesh) is victim of criminal conspiracy and fraud played and hatched jointly by the R-1 (Ministry of Home Affairs), R-2 (Delhi government) and R-3 (Vrinda Grover) and other advocate who appeared in the session court, High Court and the Supreme Court in the petitioner’s death warrant case.

“They compelled him to sign various papers under threat of session court order (which was never issued by the session court) stating that court has directed her to secured various signed documents from him to file various petitions, including curative petition, on his behalf in the high court and the Supreme Court in his death sentence case,” the plea said.

'Criminal conspiracy'

The petition contended that the respondents “knowingly and deliberately” for vested and political interests hatched a joint criminal conspiracy against Mukesh Singh and visited Tihar Jail and met the petitioner asking him to sign various documents.

The plea said that they asked him to sign vakalatnama stating that the session court have issued order to get various documents signed by him to file curative petition for him in all courts.

“Being pressurised/feared due to so-called session court order, the petitioner signed various sets of vakalatnama for her and signed other papers for her. Recently the petitioner came to know that there was no such session court order,” the plea said.

The petition claimed the limitation period to file a curative petition was three years from the date of dismissal of the review plea and sought to “restore” the rights available to him and allow him to file curative and mercy petitions till July 2021.

A 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as ‘Nirbhaya’ (fearless), was gang-raped and savagely assaulted in a moving bus in south Delhi on December 16, 2012. She had died after a fortnight.

Six people, including the four convicts and a juvenile, were named as accused. Ram Singh, the sixth accused, allegedly committed suicide in Tihar Jail days after the trial began in the case.

The Delhi Police should extend the same alacrity to act against leaders who spewed hate and led to 53 deaths in Delhi riots as they are showing against activist Harsh Mander for his “contemptuous speech”, senior advocate Dushyant Dave told the Supreme Court on Friday.

Mr. Dave was reacting to submissions made by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the Delhi Police, that an affidavit had been filed promptly detailing Mr. Mander's alleged transgressions.

“He [Mr. Mehta] should bring the same kind of affidavit against the leaders who indulged in hate speeches and led to the deaths of 53 people”, Mr. Dave, appearing for Mr. Mander, said before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde.

On March 4, this Bench stopped Mr. Mander from participating in a hearing on a batch of petitions seeking the immediate registration of FIRs against leaders who instigated communal violence in Delhi with their hate speeches.

Mr. Mander was, in turn, accused of making disparaging remarks about the Supreme Court in a public speech.

Mr. Mehta had accused Mr. Mander of “instigating people”. He said there was a video clip showing Mr. Mander goading people, saying “ultimate justice” has to be made available on the streets and cannot be got from either the Supreme Court or Parliament.

The police promptly within hours, on March 4, filed an affidavit listing its accusations against Mr. Mander.

On Friday, Mr. Dave said the police were showing the court only a leaked extract of the speech. “There was nothing contemptuous, seditious or disparaging in his [Mander’s] speech”, Mr. Dave countered.

Also Read Read them the riot act: On police inaction during Delhi violence

Mr. Mehta submitted that the police had unearthed another “contemptuous” speech made by Mr. Mander. He urged the Bench to issue a contempt notice against Mr. Mander. He said the purpose behind such speeches was to “disrupt the institution”.

Mr. Dave countered, “There is no disruption of this institution... Instead, the government is obstructing my right to move this court... this institution. The government wants to shoot the messenger. I am being put in the dock for coming to this court in the first place. This is a serious matter. My right to move the court is being seriously harmed”.

It was Mr. Mander’s petition that made the Delhi High Court assemble at midnight recently and order the police to ensure the safe passage and medical treatment for the riot victims.

Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan said the court cannot be seen to issue contempt notice on the basis of “some affidavit filed here or there”.

For this, Mr. Mehta said Mr. Mander cannot have more than one counsel representing him.

But Chief Justice Bobde intervened to clarify that the court has not issued any notice of contempt against Mr. Mander. “We are only now giving him time to file his response”, he said.

Mr. Dave, who is also the president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, said he would be the first to oppose any act of contempt against the apex court.

When Mr. Mehta began to express his doubts about that, Mr. Dave turned to him and said “if you allege that I am acting contemptuous against the Supreme Court, I openly challenge you to bring contempt against me. The government is trying to browbeat”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5whl70/article31000310.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HARSHMANDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/police-should-take-same-action-against-leaders-spewing-hate-harsh-mander-tells-sc/article31000311.ece

The Centre has directed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to look into the causes of the crisis at Yes Bank and to pin responsibility on the individuals responsible and those who failed to address the problems at the bank, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Friday.

“While our government is completely committed to ensure that the depositors’ interest is completely safeguarded, equally I want the RBI to ensure that due process of law is set to roll with a sense of urgency, so that we should find out as to who led to this problem of this size and magnitude at Yes Bank,” said Ms. Sitharaman.

She added that she has asked the central bank to assess the adequacy of regulatory and supervisory norms as well.

Speaking to journalists just after RBI unveiled its restructuring plan for the Bank, the Finance Minister expressed confidence that the plan would be effective within 30 days, the moratorium period imposed by the RBI to limit withdrawals from the Bank. While she acknowledged that there would be a “period of pain” for depositors, she insisted that all deposits and liabilities would be honoured and will continue unaffected as before, and assured Yes Bank’s employees that their jobs and salaries were assured for at least one year.

Ms. Sitharaman rebuffed accusations that the government had failed to monitor the Bank’s troubles. She claimed the RBI had been keeping tabs on the situation since 2017, and had taken steps to deal with the governance and leadership issues, culture of weak compliance, wrong asset classification and risky credit decisions. Central agencies had pushed for management changes, slapped fines, investigated irregularities and urged equity infusions in an effort to improve Yes Bank’s health, she said.

Countering Opposition criticism, Ms. Sitharaman claimed that Yes Bank’s exposure to stressed corporates such as the Anil Ambani group, Essel group, DHFL, IL&FS and Vodafone existed before 2014 during the UPA regime. She accused the “so-called, self-appointed competent doctors” of the Congress of having bungled the handling of three other banks in crisis — Global Trust Bank, United Western Bank and Ganesh Bank of Kurudher.

Central agencies had pushed for management changes, slapped fines, investigated irregularities and urged equity infusions in an effort to improve Yes Bank’s health, she said.

Countering Opposition criticism, Ms. Sitharaman claimed that Yes Bank’s exposure to stressed corporates such as the Anil Ambani group, Essel group, DHFL, IL&FS and Vodafone existed before 2014 during the UPA regime. She accused the “so-called, self-appointed competent doctors” of the Congress of having bungled the handling of three other banks in crisis — Global Trust Bank, United Western Bank and Ganesh Bank of Kurudher.

“In all three, they just merged and washed their hands off. How many people did they take action against?” asked Ms. Sitharaman. “I have assured that I will not allow any institution to fall off the cliff.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ydz2px/article30999275.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI04-03-2020000099BTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yes-bank-committed-to-safeguarding-depositors-says-nirmala-sitharaman/article30999276.ece
75,2020/03/06,SC quashes plea seeking mechanism to deal with alleged misuse of sedition law,"The petition had sought quashing of the FIR against the principal and other staff of the Shaheen School at Bidar in Karnataka for allegedly allowing students to stage an anti-CAA and anti-NRC drama

The Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain a plea seeking framing of a proper mechanism to deal with alleged misuse of the sedition law by the government machinery.

A Bench headed by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar dismissed the plea filed by a social activist and said it was open for the petitioner to approach the appropriate authority.

At the outset, the apex court told advocate Utsav Singh Bains, appearing for the petitioner, that he could not seek quashing of an FIR in a sedition case filed against the management of a Karnataka school for allegedly allowing students to stage an anti-CAA and anti-NRC drama.

Bains told the Bench that he was not just pressing for a prayer to quash the FIR but the petitioner has also sought a direction for framing of a proper mechanism to deal with the alleged misuse of the sedition law.

“Let the affected party come and we will hear them. Why it should be done at your instance,” the Bench said, refusing to entertain the petition.

The petition had sought quashing of the FIR against the principal and other staff of the Shaheen School at Bidar who have been booked under sections 124A (sedition) and 153A (promoting enmity between different groups) of the Indian Penal Code.

The plea had also sought an apex court direction for a proper mechanism to deal with alleged government misuse of the sedition law.

Section 124A of the IPC says that “whoever brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards... the Government shall be punished with imprisonment for life...”.

The plea had sought a direction to the Centre and the Karnataka government “to quash the FIR registered in connection of seditious charges against the school management, teacher and a widowed parent of a student for staging a play criticising CAA, NRC and NPR.”

The petition had claimed that the police “also questioned students, and videos and screenshots of CCTV footage showing them speaking to the students were shared widely on social media, prompting criticism.”

The drama was staged on January 21 by students of the fourth, the fifth and the sixth standard.

The sedition case was filed based on a complaint by social worker Neelesh Rakshyal on January 26.

The complainant alleged that the school authorities “used” the students to perform a drama where they “abused” Prime Minister Modi in the context of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4t4emi/article30999222.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-quashes-plea-seeking-mechanism-to-deal-with-alleged-misuse-of-sedition-law/article30999223.ece

The CISF has postponed its anniversary parade and related celebrations scheduled for next week across the country, in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, officials said on Friday.

The main event of a mega parade and martial drills display, involving thousands of troops and their families, was to take place on March 13 at a Central Industrial Security Force camp in Ghaziabad near here to mark the 51st Establishment Day of the force.

All the formations of the force in the country also hold various events to mark the day, albeit on a smaller scale as compared to the main event.

“The CISF day parade in Ghaziabad and related events to be held all across the country on March 13 have been postponed in view of the coronavirus outbreak,” a senior official said.

“The decision has been taken after receiving directions in this context from the MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs),” he added.

An order issued by the paramilitary force said the event was being cancelled due to “administrative reasons and until further orders.”

Troops from all over the country converge here for the main event and are hosted at various camps of the force in the National Capital Region (NCR), with elaborate measures made for their stay and meals.

Such gatherings were thought better to be avoided, another official said.

A fresh decision will be taken based on a review of the prevailing situation of the disease, the official said.

In a similar decision, the CRPF has also postponed an event scheduled to be held at the India Gate in the national capital to mark the International Women’s Day on March 8, in the wake of the coronavirus-combat measures.

As the event involved participation of hundreds of force personnel and locals, the event at the India Gate has been postponed, an official said.

With these cancellations, the CRPF anniversary parade scheduled to be held later this month in Gurgaon near here is also uncertain.

The event will involve thousands of troops and their family members like the CISF event.

80,2020/03/06,"Social scientists, economists demand halt to NPR data collection","De-link it from the Census 2021 exercise to remove fears among substantial sections, they say

A collective of economists and social scientists have published a joint statement demanding that data collection commissioned as part of updating the National Population Register (NPR) be stopped and that it be de-linked from the ongoing Census 2021 data gathering exercise.

“There is a real danger that the concerns around the National Population Register and the fears that are growing among substantial sections that investigators can determine whether a respondent’s citizenship is ‘doubtful’. This possibility has already led to widespread public distrust and suspicion about the NPR, and it is not at all clear that there are any benefits from the NPR at the present juncture,” the nearly 100 researchers have said in a statement. “ It is essential to ensure that the exercise of data collection for Census 2021 is absolutely safe, comprehensive and uncontaminated by any other factors.”

Conducting the NPR along with the Census also violates Clause 15 of The Census Act 1948 that bars anyone from accessing “any book, register or record made by a census-officer in the discharge of his duty”. It also violates the provision in the same clause that “no entry in any such book, register, record or schedule shall be admissible as evidence in any civil proceeding other than a prosecution under this Act,” the statement adds.

The signatories span a range of institutions — from the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi University, Azim Premji University, The Indian School of Business, Hyderabad — as well as international establishments such as the Oxford University, United Kingdom, and the New York University, USA.

There have been widespread protests across the country against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019 and the proposed National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC). West Bengal and Kerala have suspended work related to the preparation and update of the NPR.

The NPR, a register of residents with demographic and biometric details, was supposed to be prepared between April 2020 and September 2020 ahead of the Census slated for 2021.

87,2020/03/06,Tusker movement in Tirupati sets alarm bells ringing,"A herd of elephants, including cubs, sighted close to city limits

For the first time in the history of Tirupati, elephant movement was sighted very close to Karakambadi Road, now a buzzing eastern suburban area.

A herd of seven elephants, including a couple of cubs, came all the way from the Mamandur forest towards Karakambadi by moving behind the Amara Raja plant and reached up to Venkatapuram village abutting the four-lane highway.

All this happened around 10.30 p.m., when the day’s hustle-and-bustle did not end, making a couple of panicked motorists alert the Forest Department. The forest sleuths observed dung and elephant footprint a few feet away from the four-lane highway as well as the Child Resource Centre. “Elephants have a tendency to explore and this could only be an inkling of their preference to look out for newer territories,” S. Saravanan, Chief Conservator of Forests, Tirupati Wildlife Management Circle, has told The Hindu.

The herd, believed to have moved from Idupulapaya towards Tirumala several decades ago, remained confined here for long, moving between Talakona and Railway Kodur. “Had they crossed the Tirupati-Kadapa highway or the intervening railway track to the other side, they would have easily moved into the Veligonda hill ranges, which somehow has not happened,” opines the Divisional Forest Officer (wildlife) Nagarjuna Reddy. In view of their instinctive nature to explore, the herd is believed to have moved towards human habitations, triggering a likely man-animal conflict in near future.

What is more worrying is the presence of plastic waste such as cut portions of milk sachets in the dung, as sighted by the team of ecologists from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research). This shows that the elephants could have been moving closer to human habitation for a longer time than expected, which also sheds light on the likelihood of their getting attracted to food waste disposed of indiscriminately in the forest fringe villages.

The RPF booked cases against the owners of the travel agencies that were allegedly involved in booking tickets on IRCTC portal illegally and selling them away.

Modus operandi

According to the health department’s bulletin, the number of asymptomatic persons under home isolation on Thursday went up to 130 against 65 on Wednesday. Also, the number of symptomatic persons hospitalised went up to 13 on Thursday against eight admitted on Wednesday.

So far, as per the bulletin, samples of 24 persons were collected and 11 tested negative for COVID-19 while the reports of the 13 samples are awaited.

Mallikarjuna issued an advisory to the chemists and druggists across the State to keep adequate stock of hand sanitisers and masks and distribute them judiciously to customers. They were further asked to not to withhold stocks or overcharge.

92,2020/03/06,"Swiss group offers to set up ₹12,000-cr. steel plant in Kadapa","Govt. ready to provide necessary facilities, says Chief Minister

IMR Metallurgical Resources AG, the Swiss commodity trading group, has evinced interest in making an investment of more than ₹12,000 crore and set up a steel plant with a production capacity of 10 million tonnes (MT) in YSR Kadapa district.

The IMR representatives met Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Thursday. Explaining the company activities to him, they said the company has presence in countries such as Indonesia, South Africa, Mexico, Columbia, Italy, Ukraine and India. The activities include coal, iron ore and gold mines excavation and also involved in the power production and steel industries, they said.

Mr. Jagan said the Andhra Pradesh government had hastened the process to set up a steel plant in YSR Kadapa district. The government entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) for the supply of iron ore, he said.

‘Locals stand to gain’

The State government was ready to provide water, power and other facilities to the company if it makes the investment. Krishnapatnam port, railway connectivity and highways were readily available for transportation purposes. The proposed IMR steel plant would help transform the industrial landscape in the district once it comes up. Moreover, it would provide better employment opportunities for local people, he said.

The IMR representatives said the region would become a steel hub once the plant was set up.

93,2020/03/06,More skeletons tumble out of vehicle scam closet,"88 more vehicles violating norms identified: Jt. Commissioner

Joint Transport Commissioner (Road Safety) S.A.V. Prasad Rao on Thursday said the scam involving plying of 66 BS-III vehicles as BS-IV vehicles using fake documents, seems to be bigger in size with the department unearthing another 88 vehicles operating in a similar manner.

At a press conference, Mr. Prasad Rao said all the vehicles were registered in Kohima in Nagaland and shifted to Andhra Pradesh within 2-15 days with a ‘no objection’ certificate issued by that State and were being plied here.

An enquiry with Ashok Leyland, the vehicle manufacturer, revealed that the company had sold the BS-III vehicles as scrap to the buyers. The documents available with Kohima Transport officials show the vehicles as BS IV-compliant. He said an official team that visited Kohima as part of the inquiry, was given details of six vehicles and was promised that information of the remaining vehicles would be sent to them by post. Signatures of J.C. Uma Reddy (wife of J.C. Prabhakar Reddy, who is the brother of former MP J.C. Diwakar Reddy), C. Gopal Reddy representing C. Gopal Reddy and Company and Jatadhara Industries Private Limited, based at Tadipatri in Anantapur district, have been found on the registration documents of the six said vehicles.

It may be noted that sale and registration of vehicles that did not meet BS-IV emission standards were prohibited from April 1 of 2017 and registration of the 66 vehicles in question was done between August and September months of 2018 at Kohima. The transport official said violation of this rule by a vehicle manufacturer could attract a penalty of ₹100 crore.

‘Fake insurance’

The department also booked criminal cases against 23 vehicles which were being plied in other States with fake no-objection certificates. Similarly, barring six vehicles, the insurance documents for the remaining had been faked and the insurance company concerned was enquiring into the irregularities, he said.

Twenty-three vehicles had been seized and the process to identify others was on. The department officials had written to the national-level vehicle data authorities to blacklist these vehicles.

Mr. Prasad Rao said of the newly-discovered 88 vehicles, 29 had been registered in Anantapur district in the State. The department had started investigation to see if any official or staff was involved in this irregularity and if found guilty, stringent departmental action would be initiated against them, he warned.

Another glaring violation, he said, was converting three lorries as buses, exposing the passengers to grave life threat.

Revenue rises

He said over 14,000 cases were registered against contract carriages operating in violation of the rulebook and fines to the tune of ₹4.75 lakh were collected in 2019-20.

Additional Commissioner P. Srinivas said despite tax exemption for autorickshaws, tractors and other vehicles, the department had earned a revenue of ₹3,003 crore this fiscal year till February, against ₹3,001 crore in the last financial year. He said it was expected to improve in the next few months.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/6n31i7/article30995047.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06VJPAGE3TRANSPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/more-skeletons-tumble-out-of-vehicle-scam-closet/article30995048.ece
94,2020/03/06,Expert panel on RTPP submits report,"Govt. examining its recommendations

The four-member expert committee constituted to study the problems faced by the 1,650-MW Rayalaseema Thermal Power Plant (RTPP) has submitted its report to the government and it is examining the recommendations thereof, according to official sources in the Energy Department. The committee headed by SPDCL former CMD P. Gopala Reddy is learnt to have made a detailed analysis of the whole gamut of issues faced by the RTPP and also paid due attention to the performance of various thermal plants.

Energy Secretary N. Srikant discussed the issues with the officials of the A.P. Power Coordination Committee, AP-Transco and other stakeholders to work out a strategy for improving the efficiencies of the Thermal Power Plants (TPPs), some of which, including the RTPP, are considered as good buyout opportunities by the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).

The expert panel has been informed of the variable costs and a whole lot of factors related to the TPPs.

Employees’ demand

It may be noted that the APSEB Engineers’ Association demanded that the RTPP should be retained with the AP-Genco and suggested that the plant’s small size generators of 210-MW capacity are advantageous for the NTPC, which has made official enquiries about the acquisition.

The situation has come to such a pass that the A.P. Electricity Employees’ JAC insisted that the government should publish a White Paper on the power sector listing out the measures taken to bail out the ailing power utilities, complete the construction of long-pending 800-MW thermal units at Dr. Narla Tatarao Thermal Power Station (NTTPS) and Sri Damodaram Sanjeevaiah Thermal Power Station (SDSTPS) and the Polavaram hydro-electric project and to sort out coal linkage and other issues. It is feared that operation and maintenance services of SDSTPS were contemplated to be handed over to private parties.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/expert-panel-on-rtpp-submits-report/article30994954.ece
95,2020/03/06,Reservations: YSRCP points an accusing finger at Naidu,"‘TDP president has harmed the interests of SCs, STs and BCs’

YSRCP activists staged protests across the State on Thursday against the alleged attempts of TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu to stall the reservations being given to SCs, STs and BCs.

They said that Mr. Naidu had approached the Supreme Court challenging the High Court order that favoured 59.85% reservations. The result was that it was truncated to 50%, they alleged.

While the YSRCP government took steps for implementing the court verdict, Mr. Naidu unleashed a false propaganda that it was the YSRCP that cheated the BCs, they contended.

Addressing the media in Vijayawada, Minister Mopidevi Venkataramana and MLA Kolusu Parthasaradhi said that in the present instance, a TDP-backed leader had approached HC questioning the validity of the reservations for the BCs.

They said that if the local body elections were not completed by the end of this month, a sum of ₹4,000 crore, which was due from the 14th Finance Commission, would not be released by the Centre.

“Mr. Naidu has conspired to drag the process of elections by filing a petition in the court to put the government in the dock,” they alleged.

The protesters said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy gave four Deputy CM posts to SCs, STs, BCs and minorities and 60% of the Cabinet berths to members of those communities. “This reflected his sincerity to politically empower these sections that are numerically strong but faced injustices,” they added.

It was Mr. Naidu who harmed the interests of the SCs, STs and BCs, and he pretended to be concerned with the fallout of the court judgment on the empowerment of the BCs and others, they alleged.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/reservations-ysrcp-points-an-accusing-finger-at-naidu/article30994932.ece
96,2020/03/06,Boys flee home to see Chennai beach,"In another case, a kidnapped infant was reunited with his mother

Two adolescent boys sneaked out of their school in Renigunta on Tuesday and fled to Chennai without informing their families, reportedly wanting to visit Marina Beach.

The boys, studying at a private school in Renigunta, left during lunch hour on March 3 and were not seen thereafter. Based on a complaint lodged by the correspondent, the police launched a manhunt and found them boarding a Chennai-bound train at the railway station.

Information was passed on to the Chennai police, who surveilled CCTV cameras and found the boys alighting at Chennai Egmore station the next day. One of the two boys, son of separated parents, confessed that he had been yearning to visit Marina Beach but was scared of telling his father which is why he ran away with his friend.

Superintendent of Police (Tirupati Urban) A. Ramesh Reddy, who formally reunited the boys with their parents, advised the parents to be affectionate and friendly with their children and instill a sense of confidence and purpose in them by spending quality time with them.

Infant reunited

In another case, police rescued a six-month-old infant who was kidnapped late on March 2 from Renigunta railway junction. G. Swarnalatha, hailing from Takkulapalli village of Putlur mandal in Anantapur district, was staying at the railway station with her baby ever since walking out on her husband after a marital dispute. Two women from Tamil Nadu befriended her and kidnapped the baby when the mother was sleeping. After the mother lodged a complaint, police swung into action and arrested G. Ambika from Puttur town.

Ambika, wife of Muthu Kumar and a resident of Arakkonam town in Tamil Nadu, confessed to have asked Mariamma, Kumar, Ganga and Subbaratnam of Renigunta to get a baby for her as she could not beget a child. The four persons kidnapped Swarnalatha’s infant and gave him to Ambika. All the five persons were arrested and sent to remand. Mr. Ramesh Reddy handed over the infant to Swarnalatha.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/wcjad5/article30994896.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06VJONGPAGE2RESCUED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/boys-flee-home-to-see-chennai-beach/article30994897.ece

An elderly couple from Madurai has travelled over 86,000 km across the country spreading the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi.

Gandhi’s teachings offer a solution to numerous problems faced across the world, including terrorism, say the couple.

Now, M. Karuppaiah and his wife Chitra are on yet another 1,000-km padayatra from Erode in Tamil Nadu to Hyderabad in Telangana to mark the 150th birth anniversary of the Mahatma to spread the message of non-violence and Satyagraha.

Carrying the national tricolour, the couple drew the attention of passersby at Church centre here. The couple briefly interacted with the denizens after paying tributes to Pingali Venkaiah, who designed the national flag.

The couple’s padayatra also coincides with the famous Salt March of 1930, when Mahatma Gandhi began a 24-day march from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi on March 12, 1930 to protest the tax rates imposed by the British Raj on salt.

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has asked officials to increase the strength of the enforcement wing of the Prohibtion and Excise Department at the earliest.

At a review meeting on Thursday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that the services of two-thirds of department’s staff could be utilised in the enforcement wing.

‘Adhere to SOPs’

“The targets set can be achieved if there is a coordination between the enforcement and other wings. Efficiency can be improved by adopting standard operating procedures (SOPs),” he said, and added that the officials should strictly adhere to the SOPs.

Stating that illegal sand mining and illicit brewing were impediments in the smooth functioning of the administration, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that the Police and the Prohibition and Excise departments would have to work in tandem.

“Control of belt shops is the primary duty of the Mahila police. The government has provided telephones to the Mahila police. Get information from them at regular intervals. Similarly, there are Mahila Mitras. Their services can also be utilised,” the Chief Minister observed.

“At any cost, there should not be belt shops and illicit brewing in the State. Also, illegal sand mining and transportation has to be curbed. Keep a strict vigil on the border areas. The police and the prohibition and enforcement personnel have to act tough,” he added.

Telugu Akademi chairperson N. Lakshmi Parvathi has said that TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu is misleading the farmers in the name of the ‘Save Amaravati’ movement.

“Mr. Naidu is moving courts and filing petitions against the welfare activities being undertaken by the YSRCP government in the State,” Ms. Parvathi told the media at the party central office at Tadepalli near here on Thursday.

Through his supporters, Mr. Naidu had filed a case on the Amaravati issue in the International Court of Justice, tarnishing the brand image of Andhra Pradesh, she alleged.

“Now, Mr. Naidu is challenging the High Court order on reservations in the Supreme Court only to delay the process of local body elections and deprive the State of Central funds,” Ms. Parvathi said.

“Mr. Naidu and his son Lokesh had swindled public money and grabbed lands in Amaravati. The ‘Save Amaravati’ movement is only to save their benamis,” she alleged.

“Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is committed to the welfare of the people. Schemes such as Amma Vodi, English medium education and provision of jobs to the unemployed youth vouch for it. But Mr. Naidu is opposing every scheme and creating hurdles,” Ms. Parvathi said.

A native of Potturu village in Guntur district, Venkateswara Rao was the forerunner of quality Telugu journalism and had left his imprint in the newspapers he had worked in. In his five-decade-long career, Venkateswara Rao had worked in Eenadu, Andhra Bhoomi, Vaartha and Andhra Prabha. Between 2004 and 2010, he often found time to give guest lectures to students of Journalism and Mass Communications at Acharya Nagarjuna University.

105,2020/03/06,Social media blamed for panic over COVID-19,"Residents of six villages restless after rumours that a man from the region has returned with the dreaded virus from China

Chittoor district is absolutely safe from the dreaded coronavirus (COVID-19), with not even a single suspected case so far, said officials of the Medical and Health Department, exhorting people not to pay heed to rumours on social media.

“The rumours are spreading on social media much faster than the virus itself,” said an official who did not want to be named.

On Thursday, residents of six villages at Yerravaripalem were worried over rumours that a man from the mandal who was working in China had gone missing at the Bengaluru airport after arriving there last week. The rumours sparked panic in the area, with residents finally calming down after officials clarified that no such development had taken place.

District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) M. Penchalaiah told The Hindu that since January-end, 25 persons, who had arrived from foreign trips, were screened upon their arrival at Tirupati airport.

“All the cases were put under surveillance at their houses itself while the paramedical staff were asked to monitor the cases. After 28 days, 18 of them were declared free from COVID-19 infection. Surveillance on seven more would be lifted in a couple of days,” the DMHO said.

Busting myths

The officials also sought to bust several myths doing the rounds that eating a particular diet would increase chances of contracting the virus. “As per the Government of India guidelines, the public can eat any non-vegetarian food, ice-creams, and beverages of their choice,” he said.

Ever since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a steady rise in the sales of masks, handkerchiefs, and general medicines related to cold and cough. “Generally, the sale of medicines related to cold and cough would peak from December till the first week of March. Compared to the previous three years, this year, the sales have gone up by 25%,” said Dhananjay, owner of a medical shop in Chittoor.

The panic over COVID-19 has also led to a heavy influx of mothers carrying their toddlers to government hospitals at all mandals, particularly in the western side. “We cannot leave anything to chance,” said Nirmala, a woman who brought her infant to a government hospital here.

Changing behaviour

Passengers on APSRTC buses, unlike earlier, are reluctant to board crowded buses and are willing to wait for a less crowded bus. “The travel patterns of commuters has changed a lot. Now, they are avoiding holding the support bars and panels. The number of passengers wielding handkerchiefs has also gone up,” said a conductor on the Satyavedu-Bengaluru route.

Interestingly, some schoolteachers, both government and private, are said to be starting their classes with a message to the students asking them to avoid handshakes and instead adopting the ‘Namaskar’ gesture.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/oizaxo/article30994711.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06VJONGPAGECORONAMEET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/social-media-blamed-for-panic-over-covid-19/article30994712.ece
106,2020/03/06,Minister rules out rolling back increase in bus fare,"Setting aside the demand for a rollback of bus fare hike in the State, Transport Minister Laxman Savadi on Friday justified the upward fare revision citing operational costs of the transport corporations.

In a written reply to a question by Thippanna Kamakanoor during the Zero Hour, the Minister said: “Considering the financial condition of the corporations and the overall increase in fuel prices over the years to ₹11.27 per litre, it is essential that the fares be hiked.”

“Fare revisions are done once in four years. However, we have revised this time after six years,” he said. Replying to another question on the demand to consider the employees of transport corporations as government employees, the Minister said the administrative and financial aspects relating to the issue are being reviewed.

Replying to another question by Y.A. Narayanswamy, who attributed bus accidents to use of substandard spare parts, Mr. Savadi said if concrete information on the allegation was provided along with documents, he will initiate action against those involved.

Asserting that it was difficult for the department to give free bus passes to all students and not just those belonging to the SC, ST communities, the Minister pointed out that all the four transport corporations were running under loss.

Replying to JD(S) Member Marithibbe Gowda, he said the State government was yet to release ₹3,000 crore to the Transport Department towards free bus pass.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/minister-rules-out-rolling-back-increase-in-bus-fare/article31003965.ece
107,2020/03/06,Priyank’s remark on RSS triggers din,"‘Those who did not sweat it out in freedom struggle want Constitution changed’

A veiled attack on the RSS by Congress MLA Priyank Kharge — who wondered what the leaders who want to change the Constitution now were doing during freedom struggle — led to a heated exchange of words between the ruling and the Opposition members in the Legislative Assembly on Friday.

Participating in the debate on Constitution, Mr. Kharge said some of the senior RSS leaders had expressed a view that the present Constitution should be changed. Those who did not sweat it out in the freedom struggle, let alone shed blood, were now demanding that the Constitution be changed, he said.

“Why did they take 52 years [after attaining freedom] to hoist the national flag and what is their eligibility to seek a change in Constitution?” he wondered. He asked why the BJP top leaders, including the Prime Minister, were not advising those who speak against the Constitution to desist from doing so.

He asked: “Where were you when the country was going through freedom struggle?” This angered the ruling members, who launched a counter-attack on Mr. Kharge and the Congress.

Kannada and Culture Minister C.T. Ravi maintained that it was wrong to accuse the Hindutva right-wing leaders of not involving in freedom struggle as the Jan Sangh itself was formed in 1951, while the BJP had taken birth in 1980. But it did not mean that they had stayed away from freedom struggle as they had played a role in their individual capacities, he said.

He went on to allege that the Congress leaders had ignored Mahatma Gandhi’s suggestion to dissolve the party post-Independence and instead “misused its name” by indulging in corruption.

This angered Congress leader Krishna Byre Gowda, who asked Mr. Ravi not to deviate from the subject of discussion. But Mr. Ravi persisted.

Calm prevailed after Speaker Visweshwar Hegde Kageri repeatedly instructed Mr. Ravi to keep quiet.

Earlier, Mr. Kharge alleged that efforts were being made to suppress freedom of expression in the country. There were 154 instances of Internet being shut down in the country from January 2016 to 2018 to stop communication, he said. “How can we call ourselves a free democracy if there is no freedom of speech?” he asked. Anyone who questions the actions of those in power is being projected as “anti-national,” he said. Sedition cases had been filed against farmers, Dalit students, writers, intellectuals and labour leaders, he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/priyanks-remark-on-rss-triggers-din/article31003961.ece
108,2020/03/06,Loan waiver: ‘Farmers hit by technicalities’,"He says he will take up the issue with CM to help farmers

Cooperation Minister S.T. Somashekhar has said that there was a delay in reaching farm loan benefits to 1,60,493 farmers as verification of their eligibility was taking time owing to various norms prescribed by the erstwhile Janata Dal(Secular)-Congress government.

Replying to Congress member Shivanand Patil during the Question Hour, the Minister said 69,749 farmers were yet to submit their ration cards, while 36,438 farmers had submitted wrong Aadhaar card, RTC and ration card details.

Expressing dissatisfaction over prescribing of such eligibility conditions, former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah urged the Minister to help farmers by doing away with such norms.

Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri too pointed out that some technicalities had come in the way of about 10,000 farmers in his home district of Uttara Kannada getting the benefit of loan waiver. He suggested to Mr. Somashekhar to hold a meeting of officials along with the Chief Minister to provide relief to farmers who have missed out because of minor technical issues.

The Minister agreed to this suggestion.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/loan-waiver-farmers-hit-by-technicalities/article31003949.ece
109,2020/03/06,"Ragi, jowar, and toor dal to be considered for Anna Bhagya","The government, which had done away with the experiment of supplying ragi and jowar in its Anna Bhagya scheme, is likely to examine the possibility of not only resuming them but also including toor dal in it.

Food and Civil Supplies Minister K. Gopalaiah on Friday assured the Assembly of considering this suggestion by some of the members. Replying to BJP member Basanagouda Patil Yatnal during the Question Hour, the Minister said he would soon hold a meeting of officials concerned to examine the demand.

Earlier, BJP member Basanagouda Patil Yatnal suggested to the Minister to supply ragi in southern areas and jowar in northern region instead of providing only rice under the scheme. Congress member Shivanand Patil pointed out that the State had a huge stock of toor dal procured from farmers under the market intervention scheme over three years and suggested that it should be included under Anna Bhagya scheme.

Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said the components of ragi and jowar that had been introduced by his government had been withdrawn as they had seen lukewarm response from people.

110,2020/03/06,Ambedkar opposed inclusion of Article 370 in Constitution: Yatnal,"Mr. Yatnal also talked of the ills of caste system and said some leaders are identified with their caste.

Senior BJP member Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, who has been in the middle of a controversy for his derogatory remarks on freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy, on Friday argued that Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, who drafted the Indian Constitution, was against the inclusion of Article 370 granting special status to Jammu and Kashmir.

Speaking on the debate on Constitution in the Legislative Assembly, he said after 70 years of the Constitution, Prime Minister Narendra Modi scrapped Article 370. Mr. Yatnal said implementation of the Constitution could have been different if Dr. Ambedkar had the opportunity to become the country’s first Prime Minister.

Holding a book on Dr. Ambedkar authored by D.P. Thengadi, a Hindutva ideologue and founder of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Mr. Yatnal said Dr. Ambedkar embraced Buddhism on October 14, 1956, after he was frustrated by the basic tenets of Hinduism.

Mr. Yatnal also talked of the ills of caste system and said some leaders are identified with their caste and only people belonging to a particular caste attend birth anniversaries of their caste leaders. Those associated with some sections of Dalits participate in the birth anniversary of Babu Jagjivan Ram, while those associated with other sections take part in the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar.

111,2020/03/06,"Under pressure, CM announces ₹10,000 crore for UKP phase-III","Non-allocation of funds for project had angered leaders from Bombay Karnataka

Yielding to immense pressure from some Ministers and Bharatiya Janata Party legislators from Bombay Karnataka region, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has announced allocation of ₹10,000 crore for the third phase of the Upper Krishna Project (UKP) in Vijayapura district.

This comes a day after the State Budget was presented. The Opposition, while welcoming the allocation, demanded to know from what sources the Chief Minister proposed to raise this enormous amount.

The Chief Minister made the announcement in the Assembly on Friday, after Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol and BJP MLAs of Bombay Karnataka region urged him to allocate funds to the UKP phase-III project.

Unhappy leaders

Apparently, several Ministers and legislators expressed their displeasure over the non-allocation of funds in the Budget to UKP. They had not attended the post-budget press meet of the Chief Minister at the Secretariat. Only Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai and Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C. Madhuswamy had attended it.

It is learnt that the BJP Ministers and legislators of the region held a dinner meeting on Thursday night to chalk out a strategy to seek funds for UKP. They had even thought of taking up the issue with the party high command.

Realising that this might blow into another controversy and lead to groupism among a section of Ministers and legislators, Mr. Yediyurappa announced the amount as soon as the House assembled on Friday.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah in the Legislative Assembly in Bengaluru on Friday.

However, the Chief Minister’s announcement of a huge financial commitment to the UKP irrigation project has surprised many in the House because its financial implications have not been accounted for in the Budget.

Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah asked the Chief Minister where he would get such a huge amount from. “We have no objection to the amount being given to the UKP project. But from where do you bring this money for the project? Your announcement will remain only on paper because there is no money in the government to take up any project in the State,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said.

Mr Karjol said that the project works were pending owing to poor commitment from successive governments. Allocation of ₹10,000 crore will help to take up the irrigation work, he said.

Action plan soon

The Chief Minister said that he has asked the officials to prepare an action plan to take up the project. Within three years, it would be completed. Along with the irrigation project, the government would also take up rehabilitation of 20 villages that are going to submerge, he said.

112,2020/03/06,Suspension of CUK Vice-Chancellor sought,"Confederation writes to President Ram Nath Kovind

The All-India University Employees’ Confederation has written to the President seeking the suspension of the Vice-Chancellor of Central University of Karnataka for alleged irregularities in the appointments to the posts of professors and associate professors at the varsity.

M.B. Sajjan, general secretary of the confederation, addressing a press conference here on Friday, alleged that large-scale irregularities took place in the appointments at CUK.

They also sought a high-level inquiry to probe into the allegations and also wanted all the recruitments by CUK Vice-Chancellor H.M. Maheshwaraiah to be put on hold.

Mr. Sajjan alleged that candidates who did not meet the requirement as per the notification were selected for the interview. The applications of the candidates who did not have eight years of teaching experience as an assistant professor in the relevant subject, which was the criteria, were also considered. Many aspirants did not apply as they do not have the required number of research papers published in the University Grants Commission-approved list of journals. Ironically the scrutiny committee accepted applications of the candidates that failed to meet the criteria. The scrutiny committee had followed the guidelines in selecting candidates in geology, geography, linguistics and physics departments. But the same was not done while selecting candidates for computer science, electronics, and communication engineering, life sciences, history and archaeology, tourism and hotel management, commerce, and business studies. Mr. Sajjan alleged that crores of rupees exchanged hands in the appointment to various posts.

The confederation has also written to the Prime Minister, the Minister for Human Resources, and the chairman of the University Grants Commission.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/suspension-of-cuk-vice-chancellor-sought/article31003860.ece
113,2020/03/06,Janata Dal (S) bid to regain lost ground in Bombay Karnataka,"Party will train and mentor workers at the two-day workshop in Hubballi

In a first step towards regaining its lost ground in the districts of Bombay Karnataka, the Janata Dal (Secular) has organised a workshop in Hubballi on Saturday and Sunday to train and mentor party workers .

Addressing presspersons, along with other office-bearers including national general secretary N.H. Konaraddi, Gururaj Hunasimarad and Rajanna Koravi, State general secretary Y.S.V. Datta said that the workshop was the outcome of the introspection by the party and an effort to strengthen the roots and broaden its base.

Mr. Datta said that at a time when the two national parties, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), were trying to suppress regional parties, the party had taken up the exercise to approach the workers and also train and mentor them on the ways of broadening the party base in the State.

“We know we have committed mistakes and the workshop is the first step towards mending our ways. During our tour of the districts of north Karnataka, we have seen support for the JD(S) and there are many loyalists of the Janata Parivar. However we have failed to garner their support and convert it into seats. The workshop is aimed at finalising the way forward,” he said.

Mr. Datta said that party supremo and former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda will be inaugurating the workshop and will interact with party workers on the second day.

On the inaugural day there will be three sessions: One on the birth of the Janata Parivar and the party’s ideology, another on the contributions of Mr. Deve Gowda to north Karnataka, and the third on how to use the social media for party activities, he said. The second day will be dedicated to interaction with party workers.

Mr. Datta said two books ‘Indu Bharata Maataduttide’ by thinker Devanur Mahadeva and the other on contribution of Mr. Deve Gowda to north Karnataka during his six-decade political career will be released during the inaugural ceremony of the workshop at Vasavi Mahal on Saturday. He said the Hubballi workshop would be followed by workshops at Raichur, Davanagere, Udupi for ‘Kalyana Karnataka’, central carnataka, and coastal Karnataka respectively.

Mr. Konaraddi said that there old timers in the party had sat together to chalk out steps for strengthening the party and the workshops were an outcome of the introspection.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/3bsqis/article31003850.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7BGDATTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/janata-dal-s-bid-to-regain-lost-ground-in-bombay-karnataka/article31003851.ece
114,2020/03/06,Allocation for Mahadayi scheme inadequate: Datta,"JD(S) leader says at least ₹2,000 crore should have been given

Terming the allocation of ₹500 crore to the Mahadayi water diversion scheme as inadequate, State general secretary of the Janata Dal (Secular) Y.S.V. Datta has said that at least ₹2,000 crore should have been allocated for the works.

Addressing presspersons here on Friday, Mr. Datta said that it was time the State government took up its works and its related works on war footing particularly after the gazette notification following Supreme Court direction.

“We don’t know when another hurdle will come to delay the project. So the best way is to allocate more funds, initiate, and complete the works at the earliest,” he said.

He said that the budgetary allocation to Mahadayi works was indicative of the ‘seriousness’ of the State government towards the long-pending project despite the clearances now. Mr. Datta said that the State had already lost GST allocation to the tune of ₹12,000 crore to ₹13,000 crore.

“There is a total deficit of around ₹21,000 crore. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has openly accepted the injustice that has been meted out to Karnataka in the Centre’s allocation,” he said.

Mocking the Chief Minister’s remark that they would again petition the Centre for increasing the allocation and they would get increased allocation next year to meet the deficit, Mr. Datta wanted to know who he wanted to fool.

“The truth is that the State’s financial condition is pathetic and Mr. Yediyurappa has to depend on limited sources of revenue. And through the message, he has clearly indicated that he cannot give anything extra to the people of the State,” he said.

The BJP leaders had always maintained that the allocations and benefits to the State would improve if the same party was in power both at the Centre and the State, and now instead of allocations being increased, it had only reduced, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/allocation-for-mahadayi-scheme-inadequate-datta/article31003832.ece

“Updating one’s skill sets and making use of the same to deliver the results at a fast pace is the core of success in the present competitive world,” said senior vice-president of Radio Mirchi, Bengaluru, Sangeeta Nair.

Speaking at the inauguration of the two-day national-level advertising festival ‘Bamboozle-2020’, organised by KLE Society’s Institute of Management Studies and Research (IMSR), here on Friday, Ms. Nair called on the students to make best efforts to learn.

“The first five years of your career is all about learning. The two lessons I have learnt in my life are: firstly, opportunities will not come to you, and secondly after your education you feel learning will stop. But actually it is continuous,” she said.

Narrating her own experience and the difficulties she faced during her projects, she explained how her decision not to give up and her perseverance helped her to succeed. Quoting Rabindranath Tagore, she called on the students to be humble in their approach.

Hubballi-Dharwad Police Commissioner R. Dileep stressed the need for the students to develop core competencies. “Performance is more important for brand building today and for long-term success. Brand building has become the mantra of the day and everyone has to work hard to achieve the same”.

Presiding over the inaugural ceremony, member of the board of management of KLE Society Shankaranna Munavalli elaborated on various measures taken by the society on improving the quality of education.

118,2020/03/06,"Two tree officers for Bengaluru, one from Forest Department","Earlier, Bengaluru had one BBMP tree officer, but the tree census triggered the need for another

Lack of personnel to conduct the tree census can no longer be an excuse as the city will have two tree officers who will also be responsible for green cover.

The Forest Department has appointed the Deputy Conservator of Forests (DCF), Bengaluru Urban division, as the tree officer for private areas within the limits of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). The officer will be joining the existing DCF of the civic body.

According to a recent Forest Department notification, the DCF, BBMP will be the tree officer for conservation and management of trees on roads and parks which are “under the administrative control of BBMP”. “For all other areas within BBMP limits, the DCF, Bengaluru Urban division (Forest Department), has been appointed as the tree officer,” the notification reads.

Earlier, Bengaluru had one tree officer for the entire city. But the crucial tree census for Bengaluru triggered the need for another tree officer.

The BBMP had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Institute of Wood Science and Technology to undertake the tree census, which was supposed to begin in the last quarter of 2019. But the MoU stated that only trees in public spaces will be enumerated. This was followed by a PIL petition in the Karnataka High Court.

The court took objection to this and directed the BBMP to also enumerate trees on private land.

The BBMP had stated practical difficulties in covering private land, including apartment complexes and owners of private land not allowing enumerators in. This is one of the main reasons the Forest Department has decided to divide the responsibilities between the DCF of the BBMP’s forest cell and the DCF of Bengaluru Urban, Forest Department, officials said.

“Earlier, the BBMP area had the BBMP DCF as tree officer. But during the case in court regarding the tree census, the civic body has said that it cannot do it on its own. That is why we decided to appoint the DCF of Bengaluru Urban as the tree officer to cover private areas,” said a senior official of the Forest Department.

Not just tree census

The new arrangement will not be limited to the tree census, officials added. “All duties will now be divided between the two DCFs,” said the official.

However, sources in the civic body said this may lead to some confusion as councillors and citizens will have to figure out if they should approach the BBMP DCF or the Forest Department for permissions such as for tree cutting.

According to the BBMP, the duties and responsibilities of the DCF include raising nursery and avenue plantation in vacant lands, government and other public places, lake bunds, and parks. “He is responsible for preserving and developing tress. He has the power to invite tender for forestry works. The Range Forest Officers, Assistant Conservator of Forest, Deputy Range Forest Officer, and Forest Guards come under the administrative control of the Deputy Conservator Forests,” the civic body says.

119,2020/03/06,State to issue notice to BBMP to show cause on why it should not be dissolved,"This for failing to enforce laws on Solid Waste Management: State tells HC

The State government on Friday told the High Court of Karnataka that it is in the process of issuing notice to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) asking it to show cause why it should not be dissolved for having failed to perform its duties to enforce laws on solid waste management (SWM).

Advocate-General Prabhuling K. Navadi made this submission orally before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi during the hearing of PIL petitions related to the city’s garbage problems.

The A-G was responding to a query posed by the Court during earlier hearings on why the government had not taken action against the BBMP under Section 99 (Power of government to dissolve a municipal corporation) of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, for failing to implement laws for scientific disposal of municipal solid wastes.

Meanwhile, after noticing that the BBMP was dumping garbage at Bellahalli quarry without authorisation from the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) from January 1, 2016, till September 30, 2019, and Bellahalli landfill was not filled as per the norms, the Bench directed the KSPCB on action to be taken against BBMP for the violations, which amounts to offence under the provisions of the Environmental Protection Act.

The Bench also directed the KSPCB on it action proposes to take against the BBMP for illegally dumping waste at Mittaganahalli quarry from October 1, 2019.

As the BBMP has submitted application seeking authorisation for Mittaganhalli quarry for dumping waste, the Bench said the KPSCB will have to strictly follow the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, while considering the BBMP’s application, keeping in mind the fact that a tank is located close by, and leachate from Bellahalli quarry landfill was discharged to this tank earlier.

The BBMP, the Bench said, will have to immediately stop dumping waste at Mittaganahalli quarry if the KSPCB did not grant authorisation.

New buildings and waste

Also, the Bench directed the State government and the BBMP to come out with a proper and realistic road map for solid waste management as per the law, while keeping in mind the generation of waste in the city in future as the BBMP had given around 9,100 permissions for new building constructions during past one year, and 2,000 applications were pending approval.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dad7jg/article31007237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/state-to-issue-notice-to-bbmp-to-show-cause-on-why-it-should-not-be-dissolved/article31003179.ece
120,2020/03/06,New train service to Goa via Karwar to be flagged off on Saturday,"Rly. Ministry gives approval despite KRCL objections

The new Yeshwantpur-Vasco-da-Gama Express Special via Karwar has become a reality beating all the odds put forth by Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd., (KRCL) with the Railway Ministry approving its flagging off on Saturday from Yeshwantpur.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Minister of State for Railways Suresh C. Angadi would flag off the new train at 9 a.m. at Yeshwantpur besides introducing LHB coaches for Yeshwantpur-Vijayapura-Yeshwantpur Special Express, according to an official invitation by South Western Railway (SWR).

While Mr. Angadi had announced the new train in January this year that was followed up by various rail users’ associations, Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary, MPs Shobha Karandlaje and Anant Kumar Hegde and former MP K. Jayaprakash Hegde, KRCL consistently supported the proposal. KRCL reportedly opposed the proposal saying it would reduce earnings from operation of goods trains.

Yet, people from coastal Karnataka insisted on having the new train saying areas beyond Mangaluru till Karwar needed faster connectivity through the new train that does not enter Mangaluru region. KRCL, that earlier had opposed bifurcation of Bengaluru-Kannur/Karwar train and running the Karwar portion via Padil, later changed its stand to receive the bifurcated train so as to block the new train.

Even after the recent Inter-Rail Timetable Committee meeting at Bengaluru finally endorsed the new train, KRCL reportedly approached Railway Minister Piyush Goyal as a last report to get the new train cancelled. Allegations were also reportedly levelled against Mr. Angadi that he had been introducing new trains in Karnataka causing losses to the Railways. Ms. Karandlaje, Mr. Anant Kumar Hegde and Mr. Jayaprakash Hegde were reportedly able to clear the misinformation campaign with Mr. Goyal at the last minute on Thursday, making the train a reality, sources said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/new-train-service-to-goa-via-karwar-to-be-flagged-off-on-saturday/article31001408.ece
121,2020/03/06,HC upholds order on winding up UBHL for failing to pay debts of Kingfisher Airlines,"‘Mallya’s settlement offer can’t be said to have been made in good faith as offered assets were attached by ED or DRT’

Liquor baron Vijay Mallya’s offer for settlement of debts of Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. (KFA) suffered a blow as the High Court of Karnataka on Friday termed it as “cannot be said to be bonafide and made in good faith” while dismissing an appeal filed by United Breweries (Holdings) Ltd., the 102-year-old parent company of the UB Group, against the order for its winding up for its failure to pay liabilities to creditors, including banks, as per the corporate guarantees extended to the KFA.

A Division Bench comprising Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice Ravi V. Hosmani delivered the verdict while upholding the winding up order passed by a single judge on February 7, 2017.

“There is no serious challenge on behalf of the appellant [UBHL] to the single judge’s order and only submission on merit with regard to the single judge’s order that has been urged is that the assets of the company [UBHL] are more than the debts,” the Bench said.

On offer of settlement made by the UBHL by claiming that the market value of the company’s assets is more than the debts, the Bench said many of the assets proposed by the UBHL in the settlement offer were attached either by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 or by the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) under the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993.

Citing apex court’s judgments, the Bench said the High Court, under Section 483 of the Companies Act, 1956, cannot prohibit the statutory authorities, the ED and the DRT, from discharging their statutory functions. Therefore, the Bench said, the offer for settlement made on behalf of the UBHL cannot be accepted as the High Court cannot issue direction for sale of the assets attached by the ED or the DRT.

On Mallya’s plea

On plea filed by Mr. Mallya offering settlement before the Division Bench in the course of hearing of the appeal, the Bench said that he was not a party in the proceedings before the single judge, and he was declared as a fugitive offender and is facing a contempt of court proceedings initiated by the High Court for breaching an undertaking given to the DRT for not alienating his assets.

“The offer cannot be said to be bonafide and made in good faith as the same has been made in respect of the assets attached by the ED or by the DRT,” the Bench observed.

On UBHL’s claim that as on January 17, 2020 the value of its assets was ₹8,667.86 crore and the value of the assets of its other entities was ₹3,051.04 crore, the Bench said this claim was not supported by an affidavit or any document to show the market value of assets and hence no reliance could be placed on it.

Observing that there was no challenge in the appeal on the single judge’s finding that the company was unable to pay debts, the Bench said there was no infirmity to interfere with the order of the single judge.

122,2020/03/06,75-year-old in hospital with COVID-19 symptoms,"The man and his wife returned from Israel on March 3

Sudheer Chandra Sooda, District Health and Family Welfare Officer, said on Thursday that a 75-year-old man from a village in Udupi district, who had shown symptoms of COVID-19, had been admitted to the District Government Hospital on Wednesday [March 4] night.

Addressing presspersons here, Mr. Sooda said that the man and his wife had gone on a 10-day visit to Israel and returned on March 3. The man suffered from cold and cough, and showed symptoms of COVID-19. Soon he was shifted from his house to the isolation ward at the District Government Hospital here. His throat swabs, taken on Thursday, had been sent to the lab in Bengaluru to check for COVID-19. The report is expected in a couple of days. If the person tested negative, he will be discharged and sent home. But if the person tested positive, then he will be given treatment at the hospital. After his admission at the District Government Hospital, the condition of the person was improving, he said.

To a query, he said that the wife of the person had not shown any signs of COVID-19. Hence she had not been told to get admitted to the hospital, he said.

To another query, Dr. Sooda said that the health authorities got the list of people from the district who had visited foreign countries. They were brought to the hospital only if they showed symptoms of COVID-19. Else they would be told to stay in home isolation for two weeks, he said.

A five-bed isolation ward with two beds in ICU and three ventilators had already been set up at the District Government Hospital here and a three-bed isolation ward had been set up at the Taluk Government Hospital in Karkala and Kundapur for COVID-19, he said.

To another query, he said that the Director of Student Affairs had been told to keep a vigil on foreign students coming to Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) in Manipal.

123,2020/03/06,Forum urges people to celebrate Holi peacefully,"It meets DC, DCP and urges them to take all precautions

Maruti Manpade, Asgar Chulbul, Nasir Hussein Ustad, Arif Ali, and other leaders of the Karnataka People’s Forum, a conglomerate of different organisations, community outfits and individuals, called upon the people to celebrate Holi peacefully.

Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, they said that they had already met Deputy Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner of Police requesting them to take all precautionary measures to ensure peaceful celebrations.

“This is the land of Sufi saints and Sharanas who advocated peaceful co-existence of different communities and religions. The region has always maintained harmony even during the worst communal tensions prevailing across the country. We want this to continue. We urge the people to celebrate this Holi peacefully as usual not falling prey to the hatemongers. The police should have a focused vigilance on the anti-social elements, irrespective of their religious backgrounds, who tend to disturb the peace during the celebrations,” Mr. Manpade appealed to the people.

“We have met both the Deputy Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner of Police and discussed the precautionary measures to be taken to ensure peaceful celebrations. CCTV cameras have been installed at 57 locations across Kalaburagi city, many of which are defunct. The police officers have promised us that they would repair them apart from installing 70 more CCTV cameras in vital locations. We have also requested the department to deploy more forces in the communally sensitive areas,” Mr. Chulbul said.

The leaders also demanded that the police nab the culprits who had recently written a pro-Pakistan slogan on the wall of a house terming the incident as “an attempt to disturb the peace and trigger communal violence in the otherwise peaceful city”.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/forum-urges-people-to-celebrate-holi-peacefully/article30997614.ece

125,2020/03/06,Jarkiholi welcomes allocation,"Minister for Major and Medium Irrigation Ramesh Jarkiholi has welcomed the State Budget that has set aside ₹500 crore for the Mahadayi basin projects.

He said the department will take up work on the project on priority, after getting all necessary clearances. A week ago, when the Minister visited Kanakumbi, the birthplace of the river, he said he would ensure that the project got a Budget outlay of at least ₹2,000 crore.

Kalasa Banduri project Horata Samiti president Vijay Kulkarni has welcomed the budget allocation.

He demanded that the government should immediately complete work on the Kalasa nala link canal by building a barrage and removal of the underground wall that stops water flow from the nala to the Malaprabha.

He also asked the government to start work on the Banduri nala link canal and a barrage.

However, Laxmi Hebbalkar, Congress leader and MLA, has criticised the budget as lacking in vision and having no concern for the poor. “It is not clear who will benefit from this budget. There are no programmes that could help any segment of the society. It is disappointing,” she said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jarkiholi-welcomes-allocation/article30997606.ece
126,2020/03/06,Karnataka budget gets mixed response,"The State Budget received mixed response.

While several leaders and activists have welcomed the allocation of ₹500 crore towards the Kalasa-Banduri Nala project, they however have felt that the project needed more funds allocation.

Activist Viresh Sobaradmath Swami, whose Raitha Sena led the agitation, has said that at least ₹1,000 crore should have been allocated for the project.

Welcoming the budget proposals, Union Mminister for Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi has said it would boost the farming sector as there was more focus on irrigation. Mr. Joshi has said that the mobile soil testing laboratory, the subsidy to drip irrigation and horticulture, the increased allocation for crop insurance, and the development of Dharwad district as home and consumer-care manufacturing cluster were welcome moves.

However, Prasad Abbayya, MLA, and Srinivas Mane, MLC, both of the Congress, have termed the Budget as visionless and disappointing.

In separate releases, they have said it was disappointing that the Chief Minister had not shown the same interest with which he had formed the government. Mr. Abbayya has said that the Chief Minister had completely neglected north Karnataka.

“What is even disappointing is that the focus has been only on Bengaluru and the rest of the cities in the State have not received any special allocation,” Mr. Mane said in a release.

Professor and Chairman of Department of Economics, Karnatak University, Dharwad, R.R. Biradar and Professor of Economics B.H. Nagoor have termed the budget as a balanced one. Prof. Nagoor has welcomed some of the proposals such as allocation of ₹5,000 crore for lift irrigation.

Farmers’ leader Gangadhar Patil Kulkarni said that the budget is more focussed on the beautification of Bengaluru rather than welfare of the farmers. While efforts had been made to present the budget as pro farmer, it was not so in reality, he has said.

The Karnatak Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) has welcomed several of the budget proposals including allocation for irrigation projects . However it has felt that the stamp duty (from existing 5% to 2% ) on first-time registration of new apartments/ flats, costing less than ₹20 lakh, should have been to increased to ₹40 lakh.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-budget-gets-mixed-response/article30997604.ece
127,2020/03/06,‘BJP govt. has no interest in developing Kalyana Karnataka’,"Residents feel region has been neglected in State Budget

The State Budget, presented by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Thursday, appeared to have triggered a strong discontentment among people in Kalyana Karnataka as they feel that their region has been neglected.

It was widely expected that special grants to the Kalyana Karnataka Region Development Board (KKRDB) would have been increased from ₹1,500 crore to ₹2,500 crore and a separate Secretariat would have been established in Kalaburagi for the effective utilisation of funds and implementation of the special status accorded to the region under Article 371(J) of the Constitution.

However, there was no mention of either the increase in grants or the secretariat in the Budget.

Budgetary allocation was also expected for the extension of the Narayanpur Right Bank Canal (NRBC) from the 120th mile to the 157th mile. However, there was no mention of it. No allocation has been made for the establishment of Raichur university which was announced in the previous Budget.

Building a balancing reservoir at Navale in Raichur district as a measure to compensate for the quantity of silt accumulated in the Tungabhadra Reservoir was also long-pending demand. Only ₹20 crore has been allocated for the preparation of the detailed project report.

Many projects were announced for the region in the previous Budget, such as an agricultural tool manufacturing unit in Bidar, the establishment of a jeans manufacturing hub in Ballari, the establishment of a Tourism University in Hampi, skill development centre in Kalaburagi. However, the current Budget did not mention them.

“The BJP government showed more interest in renaming Hyderabad Karnataka as Kalyana Karnataka. However, it has not shown a similar interest in actually developing it. The gross negligence towards the region is clearly evident in the Budget. Mr. Yediyurappa provided ₹155 crore for the development of University of Agricultural and Horticultural Sciences, Shivamogga. But, no amount has been earmarked for the University of Agricultural Sciences, Raichur. The only satisfaction is that the government has decided to continue the implementation of the Dr. D.M. Nanjundappa panel recommendations at a cost of ₹3,060 crore,” Razak Ustaad, intellectual and activist, said.

“We had requested the government to establish special economic zones in Kalyana Karnataka region as a measure to trigger the industrial development in the backward region. But, there is no mention of that in the budget,” Amarnath Patil and Shashikanth Patil, president and secretary of Hyderabad Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bjp-govt-has-no-interest-in-developing-kalyana-karnataka/article30997600.ece

129,2020/03/06,State Budget: Focus on public-private participation in health sector,"Taking a cue from NITI Aayog’s proposal to privatise district hospitals, the State government has planned several budgetary proposals on the basis of public-private participation (PPP).

From monitoring and maintaining intensive care units (ICUs) in taluk hospitals to setting up cath laboratories in K.C. General and C.V. Raman hospitals in Bengaluru and upgrading neonatal ICUs in 17 medical colleges, the government appears set to depend heavily on PPP model. Other budgetary allocation include a proposal to extend tele-medicine services to primary health centres/wellness centres in a phased manner at a cost of ₹19 crore. To tackle hearing impairment in children, congenital deafness among children below the age of six will be detected at an early stage and cured by conducting cochlear implant surgery along with supply of hearing-aids, with ₹28 crore set aside for the propose.

The Budget proposes provision of free peritoneal dialysis service to BPL renal patients in five select districts, and sets aside ₹5 crore for developing Emergency Medical Treatment Centres at K.C. General Hospital and five other hospitals into centres of excellence. An Institute of Dermatology and Cosmetology and an Institute of Geriatrics with financial contribution from the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS) have been proposed.

130,2020/03/06,Karnataka’s first ‘Child Budget’ presented,"For the first time, the State government presented a ‘Child Budget’ on Thursday.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said this budget, as a special feature, consolidates all the policies and programmes for the development of children aged below 18. It has 279 programmes with an allocation of ₹36,340 crore, which constitutes 15.28% of the total volume of the State Budget. Mr. Yediyurappa presented the first gender budget in the State in 2007–08.

The Child Budget lists a range of issues — survival, protection, and development — from different departments. The maximum funds in this Budget are from the Department of Primary and Secondary Education and the Department of Women and Child Development.

Vasudev Sharma, executive director of non-governmental organisation Child Rights Trust, said it was a long-standing demand. “This will now at least help in monitoring and also demanding for services as per the State Budget and expenditure on child-centric issues. We now know how much money is allocated to the sectors listed,” he said.

Among the interesting announcements is that youngsters who are discharged from Bala Mandiras after 21 years will be given a financial assistance of ₹5,000 a month for a maximum of three years under the ‘Upakara’ scheme. Skill Development Training will also be provided to these young men and women.

The Chief Minister also announced modernising Mahila Supplementary Nutrition Production and Training Centres, aimed at better nutrition at anganwadi centres. “To enhance the production capacity by modernising these centres, it is proposed to provide interest-free loan from ₹15 lakh to ₹20 lakh under the Marginal Loan Scheme of the Karnataka State Women Development Corporation,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnatakas-first-child-budget-presented/article30994870.ece

Many schools are already observing this practice once a month.

Pushing ahead with the agenda of opening new avenues for English education, after opening English-medium sections in 1,000 Kannada-medium schools, the State government has decided to start English-medium sections along with Urdu medium in 400 government Urdu schools from 2020–21. A sum of ₹1 crore will be allocated for this. A sum of ₹100 crore will be provided for infrastructure development of the 276 Karnataka Public Schools that have classes from pre-primary to pre-university course.

Mr. Yediyurappa also announced that under the Karnataka Legislators’ Local Area Development programme, three government schools would be adopted and developed by legislators in their respective constituencies.

In flood-hit areas

With several anganwadis and classrooms being damaged owing to floods, the government has decided to reconstruct 842 anganwadis and 6,469 classrooms of 3,386 government schools.

Teachers will get all the administrative facilities online. For this purpose, a mobile app, ‘Shikshaka Mitra’, will be developed.

132,2020/03/06,New agricultural policy to be evolved to revive economy,"Budget focusses on conservation and efficient use of water; proposes concept of land bank

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who presented the Budget wearing a green shawl on Thursday, proposed to bring about a new agricultural policy to revive the economy.

The proposed policy, among other things, will prescribe measures to encourage water security, concepts of land bank and mass cultivation, besides micro-irrigation, processing of farm produce, and marketing. The larger intention is to provide the status of industry to agriculture and horticulture, notes the Budget. The State is also set to announce another policy which will prescribe crops suitable for specific regions based on recommendation by the Land Resources Registry, availability of water, and soil health.

Repeating an earlier announcement, the Chief Minister proposed to waive interest on default farm loans obtained from cooperative bodies for purchase of farm equipment. He also proposed to provide an interest exemption to the extent of 5% on loans taken by arecanut growers up to a maximum loan amount of ₹2 lakh availed of from cooperative bodies.

Karnataka being a State that has large tracts of drought-prone land, the Budget announced World Bank-funded new multi-State watershed area development project (REWARD) for the next six years to assist farming on 10 lakh hectares of land. Jalamrutha project will be implemented in 810 small watersheds, covering four lakh hectares in the next three years.

To take services to farmers’ doorstep, it has been proposed to launch “mobile agricultural health clinics” for soil and water testing besides providing various technical information relating to insecticides and diseases. However, there is no mention of size of the scheme and financial allocation.

To address the issue of post-harvest losses in the horticulture sector, the Budget has proposed to establish 10 cold storage units with a capacity of 5,000 tonnes each under public-private partnership in the APMC yards at a cost of ₹75 crore.

It has also proposed to strengthen HOPCOMS besides utilising the Krishi Rail scheme of the Centre to transport flowers and horticultural produce from Bengaluru to Delhi, Mumbai, and Thiruvananthapuram.

The cultivation of teff, chia, and quinoa too has been brought under the ‘Raitha Siri’ scheme under which incentive will be provided for cultivation of drought-resistant varieties such as minor millets. Similarly, ₹200 crore has been earmarked for encouraging organic farming.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/new-agricultural-policy-to-be-evolved-to-revive-economy/article30994797.ece

The Budget has expressed commitment to speedy implementation of the Mahadayi project. The Budget proposes a programme to complete the lift component works of Yettinahole project’s first stage and also to commission it on a trial basis in the coming monsoon season.

A target to bring an additional one lakh acres of land in the State under irrigation has been set for 2020–21. Also, a feasibility report is set to be prepared to turn the flood-irrigated command areas of various irrigation projects into Israel model micro- irrigation systems.

Balancing reservoir

A sum of ₹20 crore has been earmarked in the Budget for preparing a detailed project report for construction of a balancing reservoir near Navale to remove the deficiency in the water storage capacity of the Tungabhadra dam owing to deposition of silt.

134,2020/03/06,Loan waiver scheme to end on March 31,"The farm loan waiver scheme announced by the Janata Dal (Secular)–Congress government led by H.D. Kumaraswamy is set to end on March 31.

Confirming the development, Finance Department officials said most of the eligible farmers had already received the waiver benefit, and about one lakh farmers, who had the eligibility under the scheme, had not submitted their records. “We had taken steps to enable farmers to submit ration cards. Despite this window, nearly one lakh farmers have not come forward to submit the documents and we believe there could be duplicity of accounts,” officials said.

Announced during the 2018–19 Budget, the scheme has so far benefited more than 25 lakh farmers’ families, who were identified based on land records, Aadhaar, and ration card to prevent a family from receiving benefits both in commercial and cooperative sectors. The scheme cost the State exchequer nearly ₹18,000 crore.

“How long do we run the scheme? The scheme is more that one-and-a-half-year old. The deadline for farmers, who still have not availed of the benefits, to submit relevant documents is March 31,” an official said. Another official said that money required for loan waiver for those farmers whose documents were being verified had been set aside.

135,2020/03/06,How long do we wait for Karnataka’s dream Budget?,"This Budget, like several that have come before it, lacks any vision to truly chart a new course for State’s development

This is a difficult year for Karnataka. Between falling grants from the Finance Commission and stagnating GST revenues, Karnataka’s ₹2.37 lakh crore Budget is nearly about the same size as last year’s. The Chief Minister was not wrong in saying that Karnataka is in a financial crisis, and indeed this is a question that needs to resonate in all our minds.

We rightfully hold the government of India to account on its Budget, on the achievement of various national development goals, on job creation and on the growth of the economy. It’s time we started doing the same with our State governments as well.

Expense per person

Even with a Budget that has stayed the same in size, the government of Karnataka plans to spend ₹33,700 per person in the State. In comparison, the government of India has budgeted only ₹22,000 rupees per person. Once you exclude defence and other expenditures that are distant to most people’s lives, it becomes evident that a more prosperous State such as Karnataka is very much in charge of its own future. Between the GST and Union taxes, the State may not have full control over its revenues, but does have overwhelming control over its expenditure.

While most of our attention goes towards national missions with heavy marketing, the bulk of expenditure on cities, health, education and more come from State’s own schemes. For example, this year the State has budgeted ₹10,294 crore on health — a healthy increase of 6% at a time when the Budget has not grown. Out of this, Ayushman Bharat, National Health Mission, and all other Union government schemes constitute less than ₹3,000 crore. The remaining funds are left to the imagination and the policymaking prowess of State leaders.

Unfortunately, leadership is often squandered at the State level. This Budget, like several that have come before it, lacks any vision to truly chart a new course for the State’s development. Karnataka was a pioneer in decentralisation in the 1980s, urban governance reforms in the late 1990s and 2000s, and in the last few years, a leader in reforming and modernising agricultural markets. The State’s fiscal crisis has not been turned into opportunity — for accelerating the privatisation of ailing State PSUs, for unlocking new sources of revenue, for modernising property tax collection systems to make cities self-sufficient, or a whole host of other reforms.

One can argue that these are policy matters, and the Budget is a mere presentation of its accounts. But in India, not only do new policies get announced alongside the Budget numbers, but the budgets reveal the true priorities of governments.

Hyperpolarisation

The 2020 Budget also appears to have fallen victim to the hyperpolarisation of the State’s politics. On subjects such as agricultural market reforms, Karnataka saw policy continuity across different governments in the early 2010s. Now, we see a new plan for Bengaluru with every Budget, with ideas such as Mattondu Cauvery being shelved before even taking off, and new clones and variants of older projects being announced.

As Karnataka struggles to balance its Budget this year, it’s also important to ask how well the State did when it had sufficient resources. Through the last decade and more, the State has managed its finances well, with a limited fiscal deficit and a revenue surplus in most years. Researchers Jacob and Chakraborthy at NIPFP found that the State managed to do so by compressing its expenditure on education, nutrition, energy, and transport over the last decade. Overall, a higher priority was given to rural development and agriculture — and the outcomes of that expenditure do not match the priority. Not much has changed with this year’s Budget. This is in spite of drop-out rates and learning outcomes being worse in Karnataka’s schools than in comparable neighbours.

In 2020, a State such as Karnataka has no excuse in not building up its leadership, its policymaking talent, and the ability to come up with 21st century solutions to its challenges. If not this year, then next year Karnataka will be a $250 billion economy. We need governance, leadership, and budgets that can transform Karnataka into a trillion dollar economy by 2030, and one that doesn’t leave people behind.

136,2020/03/06,"Peripheral Ring Road, elevated corridor find no mention","Conspicuous by their absence are the Peripheral Ring Road and Elevated Corridor projects, two mega road infrastructure projects for the city.

The Peripheral Ring Road (PRR), which was fast-tracked by the State government — Chief Secretary has been chairing review meetings every Friday — surprisingly finds no mention in the Budget.

The BDA recently held multiple meetings with farmers whose lands have to be acquired for the project over compensation and the latest proposal before the State government pegged the cost at over ₹8,800 crore. “The project was allocated ₹1,000 crore in last year’s Budget, which is yet to be spent. No mention in the Budget doesn’t mean the government is not committed to implement the project,” said a senior Urban Development Department official. The BDA Commissioner was not available for comment.

Meanwhile, the absence of the elevated corridor project seems to have drawn cheers among civic activists. A group of BJP city MLAs had lobbied hard for funds to be allocated to it, drawing ire from civic activists who have been opposing the project for three years.

“Compared to other cities, the nature of problems and issues are complex and has posed a major challenge to the administrative management of the city. To provide effective administration and citizen services, a Municipal Corporation Act, specific to Bengaluru city, will be formulated,” the Budget says.

“This is a path-breaking initiative and the need of the hour,” BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar.

There is a draft prepared by the BBMP Restructuring Committee before the State government that proposes a three-tier governance structure – ward committees and corporation apart from Greater Bengaluru Authority, chaired by the Chief Minister at the regional level. The Draft Bill keeps the option of directly elected Mayor or Mayor in council, open for the State government to choose. BJP MP from the city Tejasvi Surya has been arguing for a directly elected mayor for a period of five years.

“Unless we fix the governance structure, no reforms will pay dividends. The city cannot be fixed without governance reforms. A dedicated law for city governance is the first step towards this,” said V. Ravichandar, former member of BBMP Restructuring Committee.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/peripheral-ring-road-elevated-corridor-find-no-mention/article30994576.ece
137,2020/03/06,Budget: Karnataka government has little option but to borrow,"The high borrowings of about ₹53,000 crore for capital expenditure, that is about 22% of the total revenues, may increase the total debt of the State, but the government, which is staring at reduced grants from the Centre, has limited leeway. For, about 59% of the estimated expenditure goes towards salaries, pension, debt servicing and other revenue expenditure, while another 10% goes into committed subsidies. This leaves the government with limited funds for creating assets and infrastructure that spur economic activity.

The borrowings of ₹53,214 crore is up from ₹46,127 crore in 2019-20. This takes the total borrowings of the State to ₹3.68 lakh crore, or about 20.42% of the GSDP. The State is expected to spend about ₹22,216 crore on payment of interests in 2020-21. The fiscal deficit — an indicator for borrowings — is estimated to be around ₹46,000 crore.

While just about 20%, or ₹43,000 crore, will be spent on creating assets such as buildings and roads, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa also pointed out at the increased expenditure towards salaries and pension to a tune of ₹10,000 crore at a time when the State was set to lose ₹11,000 crore because of the 15th Finance Commission’s recommendation. The Chief Minister also said that despite borrowing, the State had continued to adhere to the Karnataka Fiscal Responsibility Act, both in terms of fiscal deficit and borrowings.

The Economic Survey pointed out the State’s limited flexibility in allocation of resources for new schemes. Though it said that the capital outlay, as percent of GSDP in expenditure, had increased slightly from 2.38% in 2018-19 to 2.52 % in 2019-20, it said that this posed a great challenge and was a matter of concern because of the prevailing infrastructure inadequacies.

In another worrying factor for the State, the non-tax revenue — which if collected optimally can boost revenues — has been reducing. The non-tax revenue is estimated to be around ₹7,767 crore. Karnataka has one of the lowest non-tax revenues to GSDP in the country. It has been around 1% for the past five or six years.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/budget-karnataka-government-has-little-option-but-to-borrow/article30994559.ece
138,2020/03/06,Opposition leaders slam Karnataka Budget,"Describing the Budget as lacking in vision, former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah ridiculed Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa by saying that his wearing a green shawl would not result in the welfare of farmers.

In a series of tweets, he alleged that the Chief Minister had betrayed farmers. He said the Budget was not clear on the status of farm loan waiver. He also criticised the reduction in allocation for the SC and ST sub-plan. He added that there was no mention of minority welfare in the Budget. “An unexpected Budget from B.S. Yediyurappa. He calls himself son of a farmer, but this is an anti-farmer budget. A complete failure to boost economy, to realise inclusive development and to improve standard of living,” he tweeted.

JD(S) leader and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy also criticised the lack of clarity in the Budget. “Our State has not slacked in tax collection. We have almost reached the revenue targets of the last Budget. The problem is with the Union government not giving our rightful share,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/opposition-leaders-slam-karnataka-budget/article30994548.ece

Police personnel across all divisions will attend the crash course in batches.

Nine professionals have been roped in to train the police and help them improve their image and the way they project themselves, said Tabarak Fathima, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Pulakeshinagar, who is in charge of the programme. “There is a notion that policemen on the ground are always angry and grumpy. We have to change this, especially when they are interacting with people. No one should be scared to approach the police. Personnel will be trained to create a more positive atmosphere to extend cooperation and help when they are approached,” she said.

Training in body language communication skills and showing empathy towards children, women and people who are vulnerable are all part of the programme. There will be modules on time management and how to deal with stress and anger, as well as personal grooming. “The training aims to boost confidence among police personnel and make them proud to be part of the force,” Ms. Fathima added.

141,2020/03/06,Karnataka Budget: Survey of shola forests to conserve diversity,"A survey of the shola forests in the State has been proposed by the government to “protect and conserve the biodiversity” of these forests. A grant of ₹5 crore has been allocated for it. Shola forests — tropical montane forests — have been touted by recent studies as being among the most threatened ecosystems globally.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa also announced a vulture breeding centre that will be set up in the vulture sanctuary in Ramanagaram at a cost of ₹2 crore. There will also be a ₹6.25-crore programme for rehabilitation of monkeys in five years.

The Budget has raised the issue of air pollution caused by thermal power stations and proposed setting up a Flue Gas Desulfurisation (FGD) system at the thermal power stations of Raichur, Ballari and Yaramaras at a cost of ₹2,510 crore.

Implementation of drainage and sewage systems in 20 urban areas to prevent the accumulation of filth in the riverbeds of 17 rivers and the establishment of a Faecal Sludge and Septage Management (FSSM) unit in one town will be undertaken at a total expenditure of ₹1,690 crore, Mr. Yediyurappa said. A scheme for the use of treated water in urban areas for non-domestic purposes in Ballari, Chitradurga and Hubballi-Dharwad has also been proposed.

Among the other major announcements are the State’s first marine eco-park, to be established in Uttara Kannada, and the upgrading of the mini-zoo at Tyavarekoppa Tiger-Lion Safari in Shivamogga.

Meanwhile, environmentalists criticised the Budget for failing to address critical concerns. Yellappa Reddy and Leo Saldanha said the threats to the Western Ghats found no mention in the Budget. “Nothing has been mentioned about the destruction of the Western Ghats. If you do not take corrective measures now, the fragile ecosystem will vanish,” said Mr. Reddy.

Mr. Saldanha said that though there is a mention of the devastating floods caused during last monsoon, nothing has been planned to attend to the “causative factor of the floods”. “The entire Western Ghats hardly gets any attention. Instead, there is a mention of diversion of rivers, which is causing destruction. Similarly, there is no plan to save the habitat of vultures. The shola forests cannot be protected unless the lower forests are. The Forest Department has no major financial support,” he said.

Milind Bunyan, academy coordinator, Ashoka Trust For Research In Ecology and the Environment, said, “The decision to fund a survey of sholas is welcome. The sholas consist of a matrix of forests and grasslands, both of which are vital for the unique species assemblages that live there and the rivers that originate here.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-budget-survey-of-shola-forests-to-conserve-diversity/article30994467.ece

143,2020/03/06,Karnataka Budget: Funds crunch eats into food subsidy in big way,"With the State facing a financial crunch, as many as six crucial sectors have seen reductions to a tune of ₹2,213 crore in terms of subsidy allocated in the State Budget.

The biggest reduction — ₹1,209 crore — has come in the food subsidy bill. It is down from ₹3,755 crore in 2019-20 to ₹2,546 crore. A big chunk of this subsidy goes into the Anna Bhagya scheme, which was launched by Congress leader Siddaramaiah’s regime to overcome the problem of hunger.

In the housing sector, subsidy that normally goes into ensuring housing for the poor in rural and urban areas under various schemes has seen a reduction in allocation from ₹2,057 crore to ₹1,250 crore.

The total subsidy extended by the State government has come down from ₹25,688 crore in 2019-20 to ₹23,475 crore. Acknowledging this, a senior finance official said, “Some schemes that were old have been stopped and many departments themselves asked for the removal of some schemes, resulting in the drop in subsidy amount.” When asked whether the big drop in food subsidy meant a reduction in the Anna Bhagya scheme size, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa did not clarify.

Among the departments that have seen a reduction in subsidy are Education (from ₹538.11 crore to ₹390.46 crore), Women and Child Development (from ₹309.42 crore to ₹100 crore), and Agriculture and Horticulture (from ₹2,865.59 crore to ₹2,661.32 crore). The subsidy towards milk has declined from ₹1,362.27 crore to ₹1,250 crore.

However, the subsidies extended to Home, Transport, Cooperation, Commerce and Industries, and Power departments have seen increases to a tune of ₹420 crore.

Allocation to services

The allocations to crucial social services and economic services have come down by ₹5,717 crore, while that to general services has increased by ₹8,665 crore.

Funds set aside for social services, which include public health, housing, social security, welfare (including SC/ST welfare), have come down by ₹3,250 crore, from ₹68,296 crore in the revised estimates of 2019-20 to ₹65,046 crore in 2020-21. Similarly, allocation to economic services, that include agriculture and allied activities, rural development, water and power, industry and minerals, transport and communication, is down by ₹2,467 crore.

However, the allocation to general services has increased from ₹50,937 crore to ₹59,602 crore. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said this was on account of an increase in salaries and allowances. Debt servicing of ₹11,604 crore is included in general services.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/18jszt/article30997497.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGJuneSubsidiescol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-budget-funds-crunch-eats-into-food-subsidy-in-big-way/article30994449.ece
144,2020/03/06,Karnataka Budget gives push for coastal tourism,"Tourism along the State’s coastal belt and in the waterways is expected to get a push this year with the government announcing plans to develop the sector.

The Karnataka Maritime Perspective Plan for the development of mini-ports, coastal protection and comprehensive development of coastal tourism, which will be implemented in 2020-21, and a programme to promote tourism by developing inland waterways of the rivers Kali, Sharavati, Hangarakatte, Gurupura and Netravati in collaboration with the Inland Waterways Authority of India have been announced.

A tourism circuit for Jog Falls in Shivamogga — a popular destination — will be provided with supplementary infrastructure. In addition, the development of Anjanadri hill in Koppal, popular as the “birthplace” of Anjaneyaswamy, Chitradurga, popular for its legends of Veera Madakari Nayaka and Onake Obavva, and the overall development of Badami (announced in the last budget as well) have also been proposed. Among the measures announced to boost tourism in the State are a new tourism policy, which will be implemented after the present one comes to an end this March, implementation of the ‘Karnataka Tourism Task Force’ under the leadership of Sudha Murty, and an investment of ₹100 crore for advertisement and a ‘Global Tourism Investors Meet’.

However, Sanjar Imam, president of Karnataka Tourism Forum, said marketing of destinations is what the State has been lacking over the years. “You need to market yourself first before you go into marketing micro-destinations. You need to put the State on the map, which has not been done. How and where to spend the ₹100 crore announced becomes important,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-budget-gives-push-for-coastal-tourism/article30994443.ece
145,2020/03/06,"No new projects for DK in Budget, says Cong.","The State government has not announced any new projects for Dakshina Kannada in the Budget. It was not a useful Budget, K. Harish Kumar, president, Dakshina Kannada Congress Committee and MLC, said.

He said the government had not announced funds for the Paschima Vahini Project. The old schemes have been continued. The development projects in the State have come to a standstill due to financial crunch, he said.

Abdul Ravoof, Leader of the Opposition Congress in Mangaluru City Corporation council, said no special funds have been allotted to Mangaluru City Corporation. The Budget has been presented for the sake of presenting it.

The 3% increase on the VAT on petrol and diesel will not only increase oil prices but other prices also as the transportation cost will be up, he said.

Ilyas Mohammed Thumbe, State president, SDPI, said the Budget had ignored youth who needed employment opportunities. It was not development oriented, he said.

BJP welcomes Budget

Kota Srinivasa Poojary, Minister in-charge of Dakshina Kannada, said enough grants had been reserved for fisheries and port sectors in the coastal belt. D. Vedavyasa Kamath, MLA, Mangaluru City South, termed it as “people’s Budget”.

The Budget provided a textile park for Karkala and this could help market Udupi saris, which enjoys GI tag.

Satyanarayana Udupa Japti, general secretary of the district unit of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, said that it was a “pro-agriculture budget.” It had provided for construction of vented dams against rivers in the coastal districts. “Every year, good announcements are made, but a lot will depend on implementation of the budget,” he said.

Kuilady Suresh Nayak, president of BJP district unit, said it was a “pro-development budget”. Vinaykumar Sorake, Congress leader, said it was a “disappointing Budget” as it did not provide solutions to problems of coastal districts. Yogish Shetty, president of JD(S) district unit, said the CM had failed to get funds for State’s development.

The budget had nothing in it to stabilize the weakening economy of the State. The hike in prices of petrol and diesel will hit the middle and poor classes, he said.

In his Budget speech, the Chief Minister said: “...To facilitate the development of areca growers, interest exemption is provided to the extent of 5% on a loan to the extent of ₹2 lakh for long-term agricultural loans given to each family of farmers from the available financial resources of the Areca Growers Primary/Market Co-operative Societies and this amount will be borne by the government...”

148,2020/03/06,Greens see red over continuation of Yettinahole water project,"The project has become a perpetual ‘ATM’ for successive governments, says activist

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s proposal to set apart ₹1,500 crore for the Yettinahole Integrated Drinking Water Project in the State Budget on Thursday has not gone well with the environmentalists in Dakshina Kannada, who have termed the project a perpetual 'ATM' for governments irrespective of political dispensation.

Sahyadri Sanchaya that has been in the forefront opposing the project said both Karnataka Neeravari Nigama Ltd., which earlier commenced the project, and Visvesvaraya Jala Nigam Ltd., which is currently executing the project, have admitted that there was no surplus water at Yettinahole that could be diverted for potable use. Even people in the beneficiary regions have realised this and opposed the project, said Dinesh Holla, convener of Sahyadri Sanchaya, a body of activists. “The project would go on for 25 years with no end result,” he said.

While people from Karavali, Malnad and Bayaluseeme have opposed the project, successive governments have consistently shown the ‘monetary’ usefulness of the project, Mr. Holla rued. In such a situation, one must wonder why and for whom the governments were striving.

By allocating funds, Mr. Yediyurappa, just as Siddaramaiah and H.D. Kumaraswamy, has consistently shown the ‘monetary’ usefulness of the project, he said. When people of Bayaluseeme, Malnad and even Karavali (coast) have all opposed the project, one should wonder why and for whom the project was for.

Mr. Holla challenged VJNL to show availability of water in the catchment areas of the project — Kadagaravalli, Hiradanahalli, Hebbasale, Heggade, and Maranahalli — as the project had crossed six years. Land in these regions witnessed blasts for the project implementation severely impairing water sources and impacting the Western Ghats.

Extensive landslips in the Western Ghats last Monsoon was the result of the massive damage in the region. With lack of water, plans were on to divert waters of the Kapila through a tunnel, Mr. Holla alleged, adding the entire project was an elaborate scheme to kill the Nethravathi.

Mr. Holla noted that increased human activities in areas of originating spots for Aniyoor and Mruthyunjaya rivulets, tributaries of the Nethravathi, opening of home stay resorts, mushrooming coffee estates have only added to the ecological imbalance. There have been growing instances of forest fires in these regions, he said, adding that unless there was immediate rethink on the project, Dakshina Kannada would suffer.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/s4lag1/article30994411.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6BGYETTINAHOLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/greens-see-red-over-continuation-of-yettinahole-water-project/article30994412.ece
149,2020/03/06,Fishermen give thumbs up,"Funds allotted for setting up harbours at Hejmady, Hungarcutta

The fisheries sector has got a bonanza in Udupi district in the State Budget presented on Thursday.

The government nod for developing four fisheries harbours in the district has delighted the fishermen community. It had been a long-pending demand of the fishermen that harbours in the district should be developed.

The Budget has provided for construction of fisheries harbour at Hejmady-Kodi in Kaup taluk at a cost of ₹181 crore in collaboration with the Centre. The Budget has also provided for the construction of a harbour at Hungarcutta at a cost of ₹130 crore. The work on second phase of the outer harbour, which is under construction at Maravanthe in Byndoor taluk, will be completed at a cost of ₹85 crore. The budget has also provided ₹2 crore for the development of Koderi fishing harbour.

The budget has also provided ₹5 crore for providing 1,000 fisherwomen with two-wheelers so to help them transport and sell fish under the Mahila Meenugara Sabaleekarna Scheme.

Sadashiva Kotian, president of Hejmady Bandaru Samiti, told The Hindu that the samiti had been fighting for a fisheries harbour at Hejmady-Kodi for the last 41 years. The construction of a harbour at Hejmady will help fishermen from Mukka in Dakshina Kannada to Yermal in Udupi district.

“It will provide a landing facility for fishermen between Malpe and Mangaluru, which will be of great help. It will also help fishermen to anchor their boats during rough weather and monsoon,” he said. M. Mohan Kharvi, president of Meenugarara Seva Samiti, Maravanthe, said fishermen from Marvanthe had been demanding the completion of the outer harbour works for the last two years. “We are happy that Mr. Yediyurappa has allotted ₹85 crore for it,” he said.

Krishna S. Suvarna, president of Malpe Fishermen’s Association, said the development of other harbours was welcome as it would reduce the pressure on Malpe Fisheries Habour. “This will help the fishermen to a great extent and will give a fillip to the fisheries sector in the district,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fishermen-give-thumbs-up-to-budget/article30994408.ece
150,2020/03/06,Budget has many plans for fisheries and tourism sectors,"Fishing harbours, two-wheelers for fisherwomen, are some of the proposals

The 2020-21 Budget presented by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has brought in a host of plans and projects, including fishing harbours, two-wheelers for fisherwomen, developing inland water ways and more, for the benefit of lakhs of fishermen in the State, mainly in coastal parts.

Though ₹2 crore was earmarked for a backwater fish seedlings production centre at Mulki, the move could augment backwater fish production at a time when there has been marine fish famine. Karnataka Matsya Vikasa Yojane for adopting modern technologies by fishermen has got ₹1.5 crore.

Considering fisherwomen play a vital role in marketing the catch and they walk miles from sea shore to market places, Mr. Yediyurappa announced to provide 1,000 two-wheelers to them under ‘Mahila Meenugarara Sabaleekarana’ scheme at ₹5 crore cost.

He has proposed a modern fish export plant at a cost of ₹12.5 crore to supplement the Kulai Fishing Harbour under construction so as to augment fish export from the region. While the expenditure on Hejmadikodi fishing harbour being constructed in partnership with the Central government was revised to ₹181 crore, Mr. Yediyurappa promised to complete the outer fishing harbour at Maravanthe by allocating ₹85 crore and ₹2 crore for Koderi fishing harbour.

The Budget also had proposals for improving fishing activities in Uttara Kannada district where it has provided ₹4 crore for improving Karwar fishing harbour. Tenginagundi fishing harbour’s estuary would be dredged at ₹5 crore. Bids would be invited for developing Pavinakurve/Belikeri ports under public-private partnership at an estimated cost of ₹2,500 crore, Mr. Yediyurappa announced.

The Chief Minister said Karnataka Maritime Perspective Plan was formulated following a study for the development of mini ports, coastal protection and comprehensive development of coastal tourism in the State. The plan would be implemented in 2020-21.

151,2020/03/06,Bengaluru-Mangaluru train travel to be smooth,"Budget says HMRDC’s move will help ease train operation on Ghat section

The Hassan-Mangaluru Rail Development Corporation’s (HMRDC) proposal to spend funds on improving facilities on Sakleshpur-Subrahmanya Road Ghat section as announced by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Thursday in the Budget is likely to enhance smoother movement of trains on the Ghat section.

HMRDC was established as a joint venture of the Ministry of Railways and the Karnataka government to develop the Railway network between Hassan and Mangaluru during the gauge conversion. Mr. Yediyurappa said HMRDC was planning to spend in 2020-21 to enhance the capacity of rail line in the ghat region that would not only enhance travel speed between Bengaluru and Mangaluru but would also help introducing additional train facilities.

A senior HMRDC official said the company that intends to become a ₹500 crore net worth entity by 2025, would introduce state-of-the-art signalling system on the Ghat section at a cost of ₹5 crore. The move would help reduce the block section and ensure optimal utilisation of the Railway line besides giving scope for introduction of more trains.

The official said the work would be completed in about four months following HMRDC getting approval from the Railway Ministry. He said the company was striving to introduce both freight and passenger trains in equal measure after signalling improvement.

As the stretch falls under Mysuru Division of South Western Railway, Divisional Railway Manager Aparna Garg had been pushing the proposal with HMRDC, the official said acknowledging her personal effort. The company had resisted introduction of passenger trains at the cost of freight revenue for obvious reasons, he said, adding the work will strike balance between the two.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/j4zwqa/article30994392.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGSAKLESHPUR-SUBRAHMANYAROADGHATSECTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bengaluru-mangaluru-train-travel-to-be-smooth/article30994393.ece
152,2020/03/06,Church adopts precautionary steps against COVID-19,"CBCI president Cardinal Oswald Gracias writes to parish priests

The Catholic Church has asked the faithful to say namaste with folded hands instead of handshakes and avoid kissing the cross as precautionary measures against COVID-19.

The faithful have also been advised to receive the Holy Communion in hand and not in mouth.

Cardinal Oswald Gracias, president of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India (CBCI), has written to parish priests, priests-in-charge, and head of institutions in the Archdiocese of Bombay to follow these steps as coronavirus is rapidly spreading.

“Encourage our people not to shake hands at the sign of peace,” he wrote.

The Cardinal, also the Archbishop of Bombay, asked the priests to discourage people from kissing the cross on Good Friday at the veneration of the cross. “The blessing with a raised cross will be adequate. Those who desire, they could come in a queue, make reverence with a bow and go back,” suggested the Cardinal in his letter.

Focus on hygiene

The priests and ministers should clean their hands in a bowl of water or with a sanitiser before the distribution of the Holy Communion. He also directed them to keep the holy water stoops dry.

These temporary arrangements will be in force till Easter, which falls on April 12. The arrangements will be reviewed time to time.

The Cardinal also asked the priests to temporarily suspend the meetings of cells, sodalities, and associations if there are indications that an individual of the community has been infected.

While noting that the first response is to turn to God, the Cardinal also enclosed a prayer to be said every day.

On its part, the Kerala Catholic Bishops Council issued circulars to all bishops to give suitable instructions in their dioceses to control the spread of the virus.

The circular issued by Cardinal George Alencherry also quotes the precautionary note issued by Cardinal Oswald in the Archdiocese of Bombay.

Cardinal Alencherry urged the faithful to remember the sick and those in observation and the doctors and paramedics treating the sick in their prayers. While asking the faithful to adhere to the instructions of health authorities, Cardinal Alencherry suggested regulating travels and modifying the activities so as to control the spread of the disease.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/church-adopts-precautionary-steps-against-covid-19/article31004224.ece
153,2020/03/06,Seminar discusses media’s challenges,"A seminar on ‘Challenges and scope of media’ has called upon mediapersons to be careful about being used as tools for spreading communalism.

If mediapersons fail to resist fake news and half truths, they will become tools in the hands of communal forces, said journalist Pramod Raman. He was speaking at a seminar organised by the Information and Public Relations Department in association with Thrissur Press Club here on Friday.

“Journalists should become seekers of truth. Hiding truth will hit the credibility of the media. People want to hear credible news. Apathy towards issues will lead to cliched news. We should desist from following a particular framework,” he said. Truth get distorted in the attempt to create fake news. In the post-truth era, public get confused with the credibility of news, Kerala Sahitya Akademi secretary K.P. Mohanan said. Corporate forces have been controlling the media, he added.

155,2020/03/06,"Higher education being attacked, says Patnaik","‘Critical thinking in youth being discouraged’

Commercialisation of higher education is part of the hidden agenda of governments to discourage critical thinking among youths, economist Prabhat Patnaik has said. He was inaugurating the State conference of the Association of Kerala Government College Teachers (AKGCT) here on Friday. Mr. Patnaik said higher education in the country was under attack like never before.

“The trend that started with the introduction of the neo-liberal policies has become very serious now. The Hindutva ruling force is trying to make education a commercial product, thus bringing down its quality. They want to produce a generation that cannot think or criticise. They try to distort history by replacing it with mythological stories. Important decisions have been made on the basis of beliefs and emotions,” he said.

The BJP-led Union government is insisting on inducing principles of the private sector into public education through corporatisation and commercialisation. In the process, a large section of people have been excluded from the mainstream. The Hindutva represents corporate-communalist agenda. The strategy of the fascist rule is to weaken democracy, he noted. AKGCT State president K.K.

156,2020/03/06,Governor flags norm violation in revaluation,"He, however, desists from proposing anything that may affect KTU student

Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has flagged norm violations in conducting revaluations by universities.

Mr. Khan, who held a hearing last month on a contentious decision of the A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) to conduct a second revaluation for a former student, observed, in the proceedings of the hearing which is out in public domain, that the university was at odds with its statutes as well as relevant court directives by entertaining revaluations in the absence of regulations that provided for the same.

The Governor, who is also the Chancellor of the university, has made clear his disapproval towards the university move and directed the authorities concerned to ensure that the course of action adopted in the particular case should not be treated as a precedent in the future. Irregularities in the conduct of examinations and publication of results were bound to have a negative effect on the goodwill and reputation of the university, he observed.

Despite the observations, the Chancellor felt it unnecessary to propose a decision that could potentially hamper the career of the student in question.

He noted that the petitioner in the case, the Save University Campaign Committee, was also not inclined to “unsettling the result of the student.”

‘Illegal act’

Mr. Khan also took a critical view of the manner in which the controversial adalat was organised.

He observed that the university committed an illegal act by constituting an adalat organising committee of 12 members, which included the private secretary and the additional private secretary of the Higher Education Minister.

After examining the KTU Act, the Governor pointed out that it did not contain any provision for the “constitution or creation of an authority like adalat with powers to advise, recommend or direct the university or its authorities or officers.”

Autonomous body

Citing a Supreme Court judgment (State of Punjab and Another vs. Sardari Lal and Others), the Governor noted that the university was an autonomous body and therefore, the State government was not entitled to interfere with its internal administration notwithstanding the fact that it was the funding body.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/governor-flags-norm-violation-in-revaluation/article31004092.ece

Kerala is all set to launch a massive total digital literacy campaign ensuring that the benefits of the State’s emergence as an inclusive knowledge-based society reaches down to the grassroots.

Powered by the Kerala State IT Mission and Kerala Literacy Mission, the campaign, ‘I am also digital’, will be based on the participatory model by roping in resource persons and instructors down to the civic ward level across the State. The programme aims at enabling citizens to enjoy the benefits of digital technology, including a spectrum of online services, and educate people about cybersecurity issues in the context of the spurt in cybercrimes.

The campaign seeks to create public awareness about e-governance and equip citizens to make use of various digital platforms through which a wide array of services are being delivered, said a press note quoting the IT Mission. Educating people on the increasing significance of social media and equipping them to be on guard against their misuse for mischievous purposes like spreading fake news will be part of the programme.

Training

The pilot project will be launched in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation soon, starting with the selection of 50 master trainees having sound basic knowledge of handling online IT tools.

Side by side, five instructors from each of the 100 wards of the city will be selected.

The master trainees will instruct the ward-level instructors, who, in turn, will carry out the mission in their respective locality. Master trainees will be selected for the campaign based on their knowledge of digital technology, Internet and its possibility, new media and cybersecurity, handling online financial services, use of online platforms on which the government services are being delivered online and use of Malayalam as a medium on computer and mobile handsets.

People from all walks of life, including government staff, college students and socially concerned individuals associated with organisations in the public domain, will be drafted into the campaign as trainees.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/total-digital-literacy-drive-soon/article31004077.ece
159,2020/03/06,Land acquisition begins for Kavalam-Thattassery bridge,"Expected to boost growth of remote areas of Kuttanad

Land acquisition for constructing a bridge across the Pampa connecting Kavalam and Thattassery in Kuttanad has begun.

Officials said here on Friday that a report submitted by a private agency after conducting a social impact assessment had been approved. As much as 185 cents of land in the possession of 46 landowners in 68 survey numbers will have to be acquired for the project.

Steps for realising the project has resumed after an inordinate delay.

Sandhya Ramesh, president, Kavalam grama panchayat, said the bridge would bring an end to the travel woes in the region. The bridge will connect the Alappuzha-Changanassery (AC) Road and Main Central (MC) road. It will help reduce the distance between Alappuzha and Kottayam by 9 km and is expected to open doors of development to the remote areas of Kuttanad.

₹51.5-cr. estimate

In 2016, the State government allocated ₹30 crore for the construction of the bridge and approach road. The estimate was later revised to ₹51.5 crore following changes made in the design. The original plan was to acquire the land through direct negotiated purchase. However, some landowners demanded a change in the alignment. As the alignment was fixed by the Inland Waterways Authority, officials rejected their demand.

Under LARR Act

Later, the Revenue Department ended the move to acquire land through negotiated purchase. Following this, in November 2018 the department announced that the Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement (LARR) Act would be invoked to acquire land for the construction of the bridge and the landowners were given time till December 1, 2018 to hand over consent letters.

However, the authorities failed to take follow-up action. It was after residents petitioned Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan that the project gained momentum recently.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/land-acquisition-begins-for-kavalam-thattassery-bridge/article31004076.ece
160,2020/03/06,Revenue staff abetted tree felling: report,"Greens say action not taken even after 3 months

A few revenue officials in Ranni, including a tahsildar and a village officer, are facing disciplinary action for abetting forest plunder from the Vattakappara hill in Chethackal village in Ranni taluk.

In an inquiry report submitted to District Collector P.B. Noohu on December 17, 2019, Thiruvalla Subcollector Vinay Goel recommended disciplinary action against the officials involved in preparing a ‘misleading’ report showing the land as revenue puramboke.

However, Western Ghats Protection Council leaders Avinash Palleenazhikath and Reji Malayalappuzha said they suspected a move to protect tahsildar Sajan Kuriakose and village officer Sunil M. Nair, who were found guilty in the report. The revenue authorities had not taken any action on the report even after three months, they said.

Protests

The issue came to the fore following protests by the local people against the felling of trees from 4.3440 ha on the hill on the strength of an application seeking No Objection Certificate (NOC) for granite quarrying from there.

The Collector directed the Subcollector to inquire into the matter and he carried out a four-day site inspection in November last and found that the hill was very much a part of the reserve forests.

The Subcollector said no permission could be granted for granite quarrying in the area identified as forestland. Local people told the inquiry officer that trees were cut and transported in trucks on the night of August 20, 2019.

Dr. Goel, in his report, said neither the village officer nor the tahsildar had given due importance to the complaints from the public. While recommending for NOC, the revenue officials prepared the survey sketch on the basis of the land register and the incomplete resurvey sketch that had not been handed over to the revenue authorities.

The NOC application was sent to the village officer seeking an official report on March 18, 2019 and the report was sent only on August 7, 2019. The statements given by the local people showed that the trees were felled and smuggled from the hill during this period. The site inspection carried out by a Forest Department team too supported this argument.

Dr. Goel said the tahsildar had failed to comply with the direction to personally inspect the site. Though the official records clearly demarcated the land as reserve forests, the report submitted by the tahsildar recommended granting of NOC. The Subcollector also sought disciplinary action against the officials who were found guilty and stern action against those who have cut the trees.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/j9ug8y/article31004073.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07tvpthill,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/revenue-staff-abetted-tree-felling-report/article31004071.ece
161,2020/03/06,Elephant runs amok on temple premises,"Panic at Olari for nearly two hours even as mahout has a miraculous escape

An elephant that turned unruly created panic at Olari here on Friday morning. The elephant, Kalidasan, of the Olari Bhagavathi temple turned violent while mahouts were trying to tether it.

The mahout, who was atop the elephant, had a miraculous escape. The elephant tried to trample another mahout, who managed to escape by rolling away from it.

Panic

The elephant ran amok on the temple compound and uprooted trees, creating panic for around two hours. People were evacuated soon from the premises. The elephant squad, police and mahouts managed to control the animal after two hours with capture belt, rope, and chain.

As news spread, a huge crowd gathered in the temple’s vicinity to see the elephant. The police had to divert vehicular traffic.

The mahouts managed to prevent the elephant from running to the busy Olari junction nearby, thus averting a disaster. The animal had just completed its musth period.

An elephant, Ootoli Anandan, brought for the festival at the Bhagavathi temple, Peechi, also went unruly on Friday. The mahouts brought it to control later.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/elephant-runs-amok-on-temple-premises/article31004029.ece
162,2020/03/06,Ban on channels invites criticism,"Media One to fight ban legally, Asianet says it was not informed before taking channel out

After two major Malayalam news channels — Asianet and Media One disappeared from air at 7.30 p.m on Friday, following a 48-hour ban by the Union Information and Broadcasting Ministry, social media platforms erupted with condemnations against the ban.

While the Asianet management has not yet reacted to the ban, C.L. Thomas, Editor-in-Chief of Media One TV, told The Hindu that the ban was a naked assault on media freedom. He said that the channel would legally fight the ban.

“The ministry’s order accuses us of provocative coverage, which is also biased and critical of the Delhi Police and the RSS. They have interpreted our reporting of the Delhi Police’s failure in registering an FIR for hate speech against BJP leader Kapil Mishra as an attempt at creating communal disharmony. This is equivalent to putting out an order saying that independent journalism is not allowed in this country,” said Mr. Thomas.

Asianet sources said the channel had earlier given an explanation for the ministry’s showcause notice, but it was not informed before the channel was pulled off the air. It was done directly through the company which was involved in uplinking the channel’s content on air.

The Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) State Committee has condemned the Central government’s move as an attempt to create an undeclared emergency. The KUWJ will be organising protests across the State on Saturday morning. Journalists organised protests in some districts as soon as the ban came into effect.

CPI(M) State Secretary and Leader of opposition Ramesh Chennithala also spoke against the ban.

CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said in a statement that the RSS-controlled Central government was banning media in a manner rivalling that during the emergency.

“This is a threat from the Modi government to shut down media organisations which does not report as per the wishes of the RSS. This fascist move is meant to hush up the fact that the communal riots are being engineered with State support. The government is not ready to discuss the riots even in the Parliament. A strong movement of the people has to come up against this attempt at stifling media freedom,” he said.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala exhorted all democratic minds to unitedly resist the temporary ban.

“This is an act of vengeance from a government which is angry at the facts of the Delhi riots being placed before the world. Under the BJP government, those who instigated the riots are walking free, while the media who brought the tearful images of the riots to us are being chained. This decision is unconstitutional and against the freedom of the press,” he said in a statement.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ban-on-channels-invites-criticism/article31004025.ece
163,2020/03/06,Boat owners yet to remit dues to fishermen’s fund,"Steep fee hike and crisis in fishing sector blamed for non-remittance

Even as the Fisheries Department has set a deadline for fishing boat owners to remit their annual contribution to the Kerala Fishermen's Welfare Fund Board, many are yet to pay citing the steep decline in their income.

Though the owners of bigger fishing boats are supposed to remit ₹15,000 as their annual contribution to the fund, only the owners of a few newer boats have so far remitted the amount.

The steep hike in the revised boat registration and license renewal fee is reportedly discouraging many to remit the amount. Now, the hiked license fee for boats with 22-metre length is ₹50,000 a year, which is not a fair calculation according to boat owners in Kerala.

Though the boat owners are supposed to remit both the license renewal fee and welfare fund contribution, they are urging the Fisheries Department to come out with an ‘affordable option’ for the fishers.

March 13 deadline

According to Fisheries Department officials, the last date fixed for remittance of the contribution is on March 13. Smaller boats with in-board engines too will have to comply with the rule and keep the receipt ready for verification during inspections.

Only those with a valid registration and renewed license will be able to remit the contribution to the welfare fund.

“The traditional boat operators in the sector will never be able to bear the license renewal fee and the contribution to the welfare fund together. With the sector in crisis, fishers are giving up their work and searching for other jobs,” says V. Umesh, a boat owner and the district president of All India Fishermen Congress.

He also said talks on the matter with the Fisheries Department had not yielded any result.

Boat owners in Kozhikode district say there is no provision to remit the amount in instalments. With the rigid rules, many boat owners are finding it hard to renew their boat licence.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/boat-owners-yet-to-remit-dues-to-fishermens-fund/article31003901.ece

166,2020/03/06,KSINC takes the plunge into water sports,"Agency inks MoU with Odisha Tourism to build house boats, floating restaurants

Close on the heels of making operational profit during the past three quarters, State government-owned Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC) has forayed into consultancy and development of tourism amenities in half-a-dozen States.

The thrust areas are water sports and adventure tourism. The agency recently inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Odisha Tourism to build house boats, floating restaurants and to develop water sports in that State. This was in the backdrop of President Ramnath Kovind opting for a sunset cruise on board Nefertiti - its cruise vessel, during his recent Kerala visit.

“The Odisha government was impressed with KSINC's technical expertise in the field. After all, we are the sole public-sector enterprise in India which has such wide experience in constructing boats and ships that transport both passengers and cargo. Our agency is also ISO certified. There are a whole lot of opportunities across India in the water-based tourism sector, be it in the backwaters or in beaches. We have identified areas of cooperation and held discussions with tourism and other stakeholders in Lakshadweep, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Bihar,” said Prasanth Nair, the MD of KSINC.

Stakeholders in different States are looking for boats/ships suited to the region, apart from different equipment to promote water sports. The KSINC is in a position to provide end to end solutions to their tourism requirements, including design and construction of boats, ships, jetties and related infrastructure, having learnt by trial and error. The agency undertakes their annual maintenance contract. It can also train personnel and guide in obtaining statutory clearances such as the ones regarding Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ), he said.

The agency operates a total of 17 vessels, including tourist vessels and over a dozen barges which ferry cargo in bulk to firms such as FACT. It is also engaged in constructing four barges at its yard in Kochi, while a solar-powered tourist vessel will shortly be introduced in Kochi, it is learnt.

Mr. Nair said that KSINC manufactures vessels that adhere to both Indian Register of Shipping (IRS) and Kerala Inland Vessel (KIV) Rules. “We offer guidance based on sustainable models and carrying capacity. We are also cooperating with Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI),” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ksinc-takes-the-plunge-into-water-sports/article31002771.ece

As the State prepares to grapple with a harsh summer, the State government has formed a 12-member panel headed by the Chief Secretary for preparing an action plan for the optimum utilisation and conservation of water in the State.

The committee was formed as per directions issued by the Union Ministry of Jal Shakti to all States and Union Territories (UTs).

With the Secretary, Water Resources, as its convenor, the panel includes senior officials of departments of water resources, planning, irrigation, groundwater, information and public relations and Kerala Water Authority (KWA) as members. It will also include two subject experts, said a March 3 order issued by the government.

As per a January 10 direction from the Union Ministry, all State and UTs have to prepare action plans for the optimum utilisation of monsoon rainfall and improving efficiency in water use and share it with the Ministry.

On its part, the Ministry will give shape to a management information system (MIS) to monitor the implementation of the action plan. It will also form a committee at the national level chaired by the secretary, Ministry of Jal Shakti.

In May 2018, the Centre had organised discussions on measures to be adopted in the States for the efficient conservation and use of water, especially monsoon rainfall.

The southwest monsoon in 2019 was a normal one for Kerala with the State receiving just 13% in excess of the expected rainfall. (Rainfall is deemed 'normal' if the percentage departure from the normal rainfall for a given period is between -19% and +19%). Kerala had received 27% excess rainfall during the 2019 northeast monsoon which lasted from October 1 to December 31. But the State reported 57% deficiency in winter rainfall during January and February 2020.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-forms-panel-on-water-conservation/article31002662.ece

A 12-member group of officials from Telangana’s Health Department is in Kerala on a two-day visit to learn from Kerala’s experience on the containment of COVID-19 and how the first three COVID-positive cases in the country were clinically managed by doctors here.

The team met Health Minister K.K. Shylaja and held discussions with her.

A statement issued by Ms. Shylaja’s office said that the State government had made all arrangements for the Telangana team to learn at close quarters, the containment strategies and precautionary measures adopted by Kerala to stop COVID-19, which had been successful in totally preventing secondary spread of the disease in hospitals and amongst the immediate families of the patients.

Ms. Shylaja explained that the entire State government machinery had worked in total harmony to ensure that the dreaded disease did not result in a nosocomial or community spread.

The government had followed the guidelines of the World Health Organisation (WHO) but had altered it suitably to suit the State’s context too. The activities were coordinated at the district and State-level with a control room at the Health Department headquarters and others at district headquarters.

Call centre

One of the strongest measures adopted by the State government was to set up a call centre and helpline, which not only answered queries from the public on COVID-19, but also helped them by giving the necessary guidance on how they could seek medical care in case they fell sick.

The training given to Health Department staff in universal infection control measures, managing those on home quarantine, setting up of isolation wards, stockpiling of personal protective equipment (PPE) were all explained to the Telangana team.

The governments of Odisha, Delhi and Karnataka had also sought Kerala’s help in priming their response to COVID 19 threat.

Vigil

Ms. Shylaja maintained that rather than panic, what was required was constant vigil and focussed action.

As the first State which diagnosed and managed to contain COVID successfully, Kerala had a lot to teach Telangana, the Additional Commissioner Telangana GHMC, B. Santhosh, said.

He said that though Telangana was also following the WHO guidelines strictly, Kerala’s strategies to contain the virus and maintain the mammoth surveillance network was something all States had to learn, he said.

Those who held discussions with the Telengana team included the Principal Secretary (Health), Rajan Khobragade; the State Mission Director, National Health Mission, Ratan Kelkar and the managing director of Kerala Medical Services Corporation Ltd., Navjyot Khosa.

The team also studied the surveillance and screening arrangements readied in the airport.

The team is also planning to visit Alapuzha Medical College on Saturday.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-telangana-team-looks-up-to-kerala/article31002347.ece
169,2020/03/06,SC order will expedite poll process,"State Delimitation Commission will meet on March 11 and set the ball rolling

A stay order issued by the Supreme Court on Friday in favour of the State Election Commission’s (SEC) plea for using the electoral rolls prepared in 2015 is expected to clear the roadblocks for conducting the local body elections in time.

Local Self-Government Department sources told The Hindu that the State Delimitation Commission would meet on March 11 and set the ball rolling without any hitch. In the wake of the apex court order, the SEC may have to grant at least one more week for enrolment and complete the hearing of those who had placed applications for having their names in the electoral roll.

Complaints of the SEC denying opportunity for more voters to enrol their names may not hold water since the facility for enrolment would be provided twice, after completing the delimitation of wards and then before going to the polls. That means, all those who are eligible to be enrolled would have their names in the voters’ list, sources said.

Since the rolls prepared by the SEC in 2015 with the consent of the Central Election Commission have ward specific details, using it would expedite the process and clear the hurdles, if any, in holding the elections in time.

The SEC’s proposal to conduct the elections on a modest budget was widely appreciated. Since the State was facing a serious resource crunch, the government had decided to limit the expenses to the bare minimum and scale down the delimitation process. The SEC proposal to avert an additional expenditure of ₹10 crore by using the 2015 poll rolls is seen as a sagacious move to save expenditure and time.

While the State government had reiterated that it was amenable to any decision of the SEC, the United Democratic Front’s (UDF) bid to draw the election process into a litigation had come in for criticism. This was construed as an attempt to delay the polls.

But the latest decision would expedite the preparation of poll rolls and the delimitation of wards, so that the elections could be conducted as scheduled, sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sc-order-will-expedite-poll-process/article31002246.ece
170,2020/03/06,COVID-19 | Amritanandamayi stops darshan at Kerala ashram,"Move follows instructions from the Health Department

In the wake of COVID-19 cases in various parts of the country, Mata Amritanandamayi has stopped her daily darshan till further notice following instructions from the Health Department. The spiritual leader based in Amritanandamayi Math, Kollam, usually blesses her devotees by embracing them and the ashram regularly sees a footfall of around 3,000 a day.

“We are sorry to inform you that due to the extremely heightened restrictions specified to the Mata Amritanandamayi Math by the Health Department — including mandatory quarantines, daily health checks, and other protocols — currently, the Ashram cannot allow anyone to enter Amritapuri Ashram. This includes Indian nationals as well as foreign-passport-holders (including OCI-holders). This includes both day visits and overnight stays. This policy is irrespective of any amount of time the individual may have been within the nation of India,” said a notice issued by the Math authorities.

Though the Math has been screening visitors, there was no restrictions for entering the ashram till Wednesday. The district administration and Health Department had approached ashram authorities since avoiding physical contact is very important in preventing the spread of the virus. “The devotees wait for their turn in the huge prayer hall that can accommodate over 15,000 persons at a time. Amma starts seeing her devotees every day at 9 a.m. and often it goes on till midnight. Taking into account the risk involved, we have cancelled darshan as a precautionary measure,” said an Ashram representative.

Meanwhile, the Health Department has instructed those returning from abroad and places like Delhi, Rajasthan and Telangana to remain in home quarantine. “Though the samples are tested negative it’s mandatory not to attend public events and remain in home quarantine for 14 days. Currently, 32 persons from the district are under home quarantine while two persons have been shifted to hospital,” said District Medical Officer V.V.Shirley.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/oecyfr/article30997978.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIAHUGGINGSAINTTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-amritanandamayi-stops-darshan-at-kerala-ashram/article30997979.ece
171,2020/03/06,DDE office plunges into darkness as KSEB cuts power supply,"Action follows failure to pay bill arrears of ₹38,000

The office of the Deputy Director of Education (DDE) here plunged into darkness and chaos on Thursday after the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) disconnected power supply over unpaid bills.

The power disconnection hit the DDE office hard, especially as dozens of sections within the biggest general education office in the district were preparing for the SSLC examinations beginning on March 10.

About 100 computers in the office had to shut down as the power was disconnected around 1.30 p.m. Without power supply, the office functioning virtually ground to a halt.

The KSEB action was widely viewed as instance of vindictiveness by the office superintendent. A request given by DDE Kusumam K.S. not to disconnect the power supply in view of the SSLC examinations and other hectic work towards the end of the current fiscal, was apparently rejected by the KSEB officials.

The KSEB had issued a warning to the DDE office last month when the power bill arrears rose to ₹38,000. As the funds to pay the power bills from the Education Department were delayed, the staff in the DDE office then raised ₹20,000 and paid the KSEB to avoid disconnection.

However, the staff could not help their office this time. The KSEB superintendent visited the DDE office on Thursday morning and threatened to disconnect if the bills were not paid by 2 p.m. However, Ms. Kusumam, in her letter to the Assistant Engineer, KSEB, asked the board to give some more time.

Apparently infuriated by the DDE’s letter of request, the KSEB superintendent ordered disconnection of the power supply by 1.30 p.m.

Employees in the DDE office were dismayed by the KSEB action even when several government offices within the collectorate had even larger amounts in arrears.

They said the arrears were usually cleared in instalments, and the offices had an understanding with the KSEB.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/qng96w/article30995116.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/dde-officil-vaidhythi-vechedhichathine-thudarnnu-mobail-torchupayoghicchu-joli-c,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dde-office-plunges-into-darkness-as-kseb-cuts-power-supply/article30995118.ece
172,2020/03/06,Forest officials accused of insulting differently abled farmer,"Misdemeanour when farmer approached officials with complaint of crop loss due to monkey menace

The police on Thursday conducted a preliminary investigation into the incident in which a differently abled farmer from Chakkittappara panchayat was allegedly insulted by two forest officials from Peruvannamoozhi forest range office.

The statement of M.A. Johnson, the complainant, was also recorded after local farmers took up the issue seeking stern action.

It was on Tuesday that Mr. Johnson came up with the complaint against the two officials who allegedly used derogatory remarks against him when he reportedly complained of monkey menace in his farm and the huge crop loss.

According to the complainant, the officials behaved in an insensitive way by making crude remarks on his disabilities.

Jijo Thomas, legal cell convener of We Farm Hillside farmers’ collective, said they would take out a march to the Peruvannamoozhi police station on March 9 if the police failed to initiate legal action against the suspected officials. “They recorded his statement in an informal way on Thursday. The insulted man is a respected rural entrepreneur and inventor who has come out with several novel projects overcoming his disabilities,” he added.

Mr. Thomas said the officials made the “insulting remarks” when Mr. Johnson explained his helplessness in claiming agriculture loss by producing the damaged crops as proof for verification.

“Monkeys usually escape into the forest with plucked coconuts and other fruits from the farm. A differently abled man like Johnson will never be able to collect the remnants and produce them for claiming compensation. The forest officers came out with the insulting remarks when Johnson explained his helplessness,” he said.

Meanwhile, a senior officer attached to the Peruvannamoozhi forest range said he was yet to see the complaint. “We will check it with the officials concerned for prompt action,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/forest-officials-accused-of-insulting-differently-abled-farmer/article30994983.ece

175,2020/03/06,Officers hail SIC order,"Parting of personal information of MVI

An order of the State Information Commission (SIC) barring parting of personal information about a motor vehicle inspector (MVI) to an association representing goods carriers has been termed a morale booster for Motor Vehicles Department officials deployed in traffic enforcement duties.

Office-bearers of tipper lorry and private bus operators’ associations often pester Regional Transport Offices with such ‘irrelevant’ information to tarnish the image of personnel acting tough on rule violations such as overloading and reckless driving. There have been instances of a few such associations pasting defamatory posters against officials at public spaces and even near houses of such officials. Such associations have also taken out rallies to houses of officials who do not yield to their pressure tactics. The SIC order is a deterrent to such pressure tactics, said a senior MVD official.

The SIC order came on an appeal filed by an office-bearer of the Kerala Taurus Tipper Association seeking information about a host of questions, including copies of diploma certificate, workshop-experience certificate, wage register, and muster roll of an MVI attached to the Thiruvananthapuram Enforcement Regional Transport Officer (RTO) office.

The MVD contended before the commission that the office-bearer’s aim was to intimidate straightforward officials (like the MVI) and that he had sought such information about many other officials too of the department with this objective.

The commission, in its order, said the Right to Information (RTI) was a sacred right, using which people could seek information.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/officers-hail-sic-order/article30994404.ece
176,2020/03/06,"Government goes ahead with busports, logisticports","Three consultants to prepare a detailed project report in 45 days

The government has gone a step further towards building airport-modelled busports, logisticports, and an e-mobility manufacturing ecosytem by tasking three consultants to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for the projects.

The preparation of the DPR has been entrusted to the consultants empanelled by the National Informatics Centre Service Inc after a committee set up under the Transport Department reviewed the preliminary proposals submitted by them. The Principal Secretary, Transport, has issued orders fixing the duration of completion, fee regarding assignment, and the terms and conditions, official sources said. The consultants selected for preparing the DPR are PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG (Registered), and Ernst and Young.

In the case of busports, the consultants should undertake feasibility studies of five locations each in the State and deliver the DPR of at least two. They will have to do the bid process management and handhold till the signing of the concession agreement with private investors.

A five-acre plot of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation along the National Highway 66 byass at Eenchakkal in the capital, exit of the KSRTC terminal near the Ernakulam South railway station, and Malaparamba in Kozhikode figure among the five locations under consideration for the busport.

Central funding

A 40% Centrally funded project of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), the aim is to set up at least one busport in every State with all advanced facilities. The remaining 60% will be through public-private partnership and the main condition is to allow buses of private operators in the port. The ports will have busbays, ticket counters, food courts, restrooms, drinking water, toilets, parking facility for private stage carriers and luxury buses, and service centres.

For the logisticport, Pricewaterhouse Coopers should undertake feasibility studies of five locations and deliver two sites to the department. A period of 65 man-months from the kick-off date has been given for completing the assignment.

The e-mobility manufacturing ecosystem is being pushed through for creating infrastructure for electric vehicles to embrace environment-friendly electric mobility . The consultant has been given 45 days to complete the assignment.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-goes-ahead-with-busports-logisticports/article30994396.ece
177,2020/03/06,Highest growth in tourist arrivals in 24 years,"Foreign exchange earnings put at ₹10,271.06 crore, a growth of 17.19% over 2018

Recording the highest growth rate in tourist arrivals in 24 years, Kerala attracted around 1.96 crore tourists in 2019, to post a healthy growth of 17.2% as compared to the figures the previous year.

The tourist footfall last year was pegged at 1,95,74,004, including 1,83,84,233 domestic and 11,89,771 foreign tourists, according to statistics compiled by Kerala Tourism.

In 2018, 1,67,01,068 tourists visited Kerala, which included 1,56,04,661 domestic and 10,96,407 foreign tourists.

The growth rate in domestic tourist arrivals was 17.81% and foreign tourists 8.52%. The earnings from tourism stood at ₹45,010.69 crore, an increase of 24.14%.

Industry optimistic

“We are optimistic about sustaining the growth momentum this year also, but it will depend on how quickly the world finds a solution to the COVID-19 outbreak,” he added.

179,2020/03/06,The eternal relevance of Michael Scott from 'The Office',"Steve Carell's now-legendary character is emblematic of a generation that manufactures voices to drown out the silence in their heads

In my teens, the medical sitcom Scrubs had convinced me that the easiest way to make friends was by becoming a young doctor. In my head I was J.D. (Zach Braff), a cool narrator-protagonist who turned hospitals into a hoot. In my early twenties, How I Met Your Mother felt like a natural extension. Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor), the Manhattan-based architect who constructed his emotional core from a series of hopeful heartbreaks, was my spirit animal. But then came my late twenties. And with it, the social media boom – and the crippling epiphany that public validation is a heady drug.

Curating an image

Everyone who grew up wanting to emulate a Ted, Raymond, Frasier, Phoebe or Rachel now had the power to be those characters for a live audience. I could choose an identity, curate my image and edit out the vacuum to broadcast a life at odds with my awkwardly introversive personality. Perhaps it’s no surprise that I then took to The Office, a workspace mockumentary centered on a boss who is essentially the human manifestation – and bittersweet critique – of today’s digital culture. In many ways, Steve Carell plays Michael Scott as a social media tragic: A person so obsessed with putting on a show for strangers that his performative personality ends up revealing his inherent loneliness and tone-deaf ignorance. Our undying affection for the so-sad-he’s-good regional manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Company’s Scranton Branch stems from the uncomfortable truth that Michael Scott became our spirit animal while we were busy making other plans.

Michael was a good salesman because he viewed every client as a potential friend whom he sold his image to. Most of us project an inflated version of ourselves online, but the second we sign out – the second Michael reaches home after work – there’s a void that no camera is advanced enough to examine. The bedroom looks empty, the dinner cold and the stillness, punctuated by the clinking of cutlery. All we can do is think of the hits our casual-yet-elaborately-composed Insta stories might garner the next day, or the tasteless prank that might provoke Toby without pissing him off. And then wait, till the sun rises so that the lens can make us feel seen again.

Michael Scott is emblematic of a generation that manufactures voices to drown out the silence in their heads. But he is so spectacularly bad at it that almost every self-loathing adult – beneath a cult-like reverence for Carell’s role – subconsciously views Michael Scott’s counterfeited extroversion as a cautionary tale. He is the worst-case scenario for the modern introvert. For instance, I routinely panic before entering a room full of people. I rehearse my greetings and expressions. Then I imagine what Michael would do. He’d burst in, accidentally offend everyone and overcompensate for his desolate weekends by being the centre of attention – and the butt of all jokes without even knowing it. So I do the opposite: I abstain from eye contact, stand in a corner and whip out my cellphone to declare how allergic I am to human beings. In doing so, it escapes me that I become the Michael Scott of my own little universe: the centre of attention without even knowing it. Only, my camera captures me avoiding the gaze of other cameras.

Staying real

The most memorable scenes of The Office unfurl when Michael Scott stops trying to make them memorable. Take the episode where none of Pam’s colleagues attend her art exhibition, but Michael barges in before closing time. He rushed to get there, even sincerely appreciating her amateur work, moving Pam to tears with his unassuming gesture. Or Michael’s last day, where Pam rushes to the airport to give him a final hug before he boards the plane. Their goodbye is private; neither know that the cameras are still rolling. Or even the time Michael testifies against his own volatile girlfriend, Jan, in her lawsuit deposition against Dunder Mifflin. These are rare moments in which Michael Scott isn’t performing – because none of them happen in the office. They happen when he unwittingly affects, and becomes a part of, others’ timelines. He doesn’t recognize his own virtues because validation for Michael – he of the friendless childhood and broken family – is something that has to be actively earned rather than passively evoked.

Recently, after a Twitter spat, I left the house to get some fresh air. An hour later, I received a phone call from an old friend. Stuck in traffic, he spotted me playing with stray dogs down the road. It made him smile and make that elusive phone call. But we didn’t meet after that. He went back home. I went back online. Blissfully unaware that other plans are what happen to us while we’re busy making a spectacle out of life. Deep inside, it’s a slippery feeling. But in the words of Michael Scott: That’s what she said.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/q875nd/article31003065.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7bm-pg5-Film-column,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-eternal-relevance-of-michael-scott-from-the-office/article31003066.ece
180,2020/03/06,‘Onward’ movie review: Pixar's latest advocates for the everyday magic within us,"The audio-visual creativity on-screen supersedes the messaging, which is simple and personal, but hardly life-altering

Pixar films can change the way you see the world. Whether it is the symbiosis of art and critique, the afterlife and familial bonding, starting afresh in your twilight years, or humanising emotions ⁠— Pixar has a knack for dismantling perceptions. The imagination, at a conceptual and philosophical level, often transcends the creativity we see on-screen.

Onward Director: Dan Scanlon

Cast: Tom Holland, Chris Pratt, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Octavia Spencer

Storyline: Two elf brothers set off an adventure trip to bring back their deceased father for a day

Pixar’s latest, Onward, has a similar goal — it wants you to re-imagine family and advocates for everyday magic. But in this one, the audio-visual creativity on-screen supersedes the messaging, which is simple and personal, but hardly life-altering.

The film, which had its world premiere at the Berlinale 2020, begins in a time, long long ago, when there was magic in this world. All mythical creatures knew how to use magic, be free and explore. Over time, the magic started dying and civilisation, as we know it, tamed the creatures. This is the background of Onward, which follows the quest of two elf brothers, Ian and Barley Lightfoot, to find a jewel that can bring back their dead father. The film functions on two levels, one where the mythical creatures, living in a suburban area, learn to tap into the magic they forgot they had, and other is a more personal one — the pursuit of an absentee father. While the film earnestly and successfully builds up the emotional crescendo with the two brothers, the attempt to reinvigorate magic in a suburban life (allegorically, the world we inhabit today) remains a rather neglected by-product. Onward's philosophy remains on the surface, and even predictable, which is not the level of emotional intelligence we expect from Pixar.

Once you make peace with the disappointment that this Pixar film doesn’t possess the transcendence of Ratatouille, Up or Inside Out, you can enjoy the temporality of the film: the world-building and wit. There are imaginative booby traps, invisible trust bridges, amusing spells and ample silly animation humour. An elf single mother dating a cop centaur, rough pixies riding bikes in groups and a tame manticore running what should have been a dangerous tavern, make for hilarious characters. There’s also a cyclopes police officer, who is touted to be Disney’s first-ever openly-lesbian cartoon character. She has one line that reveals her sexual orientation: “My girlfriend’s daughter got me pulling my hair out.” Even though Russia reportedly has censored ‘girlfriend’ to ‘partner’, the one line isn’t worthy of being glorified as representation in 2020. Its inadequacy and inconsequentiality make it seem more of a publicity bait than genuine inclusion.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jtp6ag/article31002707.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ONWARDKB,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/onward-movie-review-pixars-latest-advocates-for-the-everyday-magic-within-us/article31002708.ece
181,2020/03/06,‘Kaamyaab’ movie review: A nostalgic trip carelessly executed,"An ode to the side-actor of older Hindi films, unfortunately this Hardik Mehta-directorial doesn’t go beyond being a great idea

Birbal, Lilliput, Manmauji, Veeju Khote. All together at a bar, sharing a drink. That one shot is the entire raison d'être of Kaamyaab written all over it – not to talk of the sheer nostalgia that it is soaked in – in a casual, throwaway manner. Hardik Mehta’s ode to the side-actor of the 70s-80s-90s cinema kicks off well. There’s the nicely observed, cloyingly sweet TV interview of “Garhwal ki prerna” (the inspiration of Garhwal), side actor Sudheer (Sanjay Mishra), who has retired into anonymity while people still remember him for his on-screen takiya kalaam (catch-phrase): “Enjoying life. What’s the option?”

Kaamyaab Director: Hardik Mehta

Cast: Sanjay Mishra, Deepak Dobriyal, Sarika Singh, Avtar Gill, Birbal, Lilliput, Manoj Bakshi, Veeju Khote, Guddi Maruti, Manmauji

Run time: 1 hour 49 minutes

Storyline: Old-time Bollywood actor Sudheer decides to come out of retirement to do a role for achieving the record figure of 500 films

That tiny, barely recognisable face on the corner of the poster, the quintessential aloo (potato) that could adapt well with any vegetable, Kaamyaab gives little nods to them, their versatility as against the swagger of the digital generation, the intimacy and grace in the relationship of old-timers and stacked against it is the rant of the newer lot--purane chawal se risotto kaise banayein (how to cook risotto with rice that has aged well)?

Old-time Bollywood actor Sudheer (Sanjay Mishra) decides to come out of retirement to do a role for achieving the record figure of 500 films. Will he, won’t he?

There is something simple, sincere and well-intentioned at the heart of Kaamyaab but it is also quick to get mired in similar pigeonholes that the unheralded actors found themselves trapped in; lifelong. A lot of them still do. There is a familiarity to the arc, predictability in telling and expectedness about the gags as well as the characters, whether it’s the big hero with a huge ego, the sly casting director, the competitive character actor, the struggling young actor neighbour or the grumbling, disapproving daughter; or the odd wig or the kitschy clothes or that 30ml whiskey. What’s more a seasoned Sanjay Mishra doesn’t seem invested in the character.

182,2020/03/06,"‘Climate Change: The Facts’ review: Running out of time, but there is still hope","A ready reckoner on what ails the planet and what can be done, presented by David Attenborough, makes for compelling viewing

While we all know climate change is for real, our eyes tend to glaze over when we hear of glaciers melting — whether as some kind of ostrich-in-sand reaction or maybe because glaciers seem so far away from us.

Climate Change: The Facts, the new show on Sony BBC Earth, like the title proclaims, presents the facts about climate change. That the said facts are presented by David Attenborough who says “We are running out of time, but there is still hope,” makes it more palatable.

In an hour, we learn all we need to know about climate change and what each of us can do to stall and reverse the process. For instance, while I have heard about carbon emissions and carbon footprints, when the programme likened carbon to a blanket surrounding the earth and increased emissions thanks to fossil fuels, which power our lives, resulting increased temperatures, it made perfect sense. More emissions means thicker blanket means more heat — it is that simple.

When we hear of temperatures increasing by one degree since pre-industrial days, it does not sound like much. But a single degree can result in rising seas, floods, typhoons forest fires and other forms of extreme weather as seen in the forest fires of Australia and the deluge in Kerala. The description of a father and son who drove through a wild fire in the US with trees exploding was apocalyptic.

Climate Change: The Facts Presenter: David Attenborough

Director: Serena Davis

Run time: 60 minutes

Episodes: 1

Scientists believe 8 per cent of species are going to go extinct because of climate change. The heat has caused a third of the corals to bleach and die. Ice frozen for millennia is melting and causing sea levels to rise. Louisiana is losing land the fastest on the planet at the rate of a football field every 45 minutes!

Incidentally scientists warned about global warming in 1988, but fossil fuel companies used the same tactics as tobacco companies to obfuscate the facts. Remember ad agencies trying to put a positive spin on smoking in Mad Men?

After all the horrors, comes the hope in the form of Greta Thunberg, the Swedish school girl who went on strike to protest climate change, the Paris Agreement, and the simple lifestyle changes we can make to heal the planet.

A ready reckoner on what ails the planet and what can be done presented by David Attenborough makes for compelling viewing.

183,2020/03/06,Alphons Joseph hits the right note with the Dulquer Salmaan-starrer ‘Varane Avashyamund’,"The music director talks his recent Malayalam film, and goes down memory lane to recall singing 'Aaromale' for A.R. Rahman 10 years ago

Music director Alphons Joseph sounds happy over the phone. He has good reason to be — his songs for Varane Avashyamund are doing well, as is the film. “It is always a good feeling when the film and the songs both do well. One wouldn’t like to hear that the songs are doing well but not the film,” he says. Anoop Sathyan’s film is his first for the year, last year he had composed for Lonappante Mamoodeesa.

Of late he has not been composing back to back for films. Music has kept him busy, he says, only that they had nothing to do with films. He has completed his post-graduation in Carnatic music; he has been working on developing the syllabus for his music school, Crossroads, as well as for pre-school music education and of course, live stage shows. “There was a gap for three to four years, but it has all to do with music.”

Working with Sathyan Anthikkad was a long cherished dream and getting to work with his son, Anoop, came close. An acquaintance told Alphons that Anoop was interested in him composing music for the film and connected the two. “The story was such that it had scope for music, especially since it is located in Chennai and give a feel of Tamil culture. I was able to put to use what I learnt for my PG.” The film gave him my an opportunity to try vastly different things like the song ‘Ne Va En Aarumukha...’ and the hip hop number ‘Unnikrishnan’s song’.

10 years of Aaromale... The filming of Vinnaithandi Varuvaaya was done when, Alphons says, the music director AR Rahman (ARR) felt he wanted to add one more song. That song was Aaromale..., which Alphons believes was God’s gift to him, facilitating his ‘second coming’ to the industry. It went on to become one of the most popular songs of the film. “It still is. Each time I am part of an ARR show this song is played and what a response it gets each time!” The song was to be used as promotional, instead it went into the film thanks to some readjustments by director Gautham Menon. “I firmly it happened for me. Also it was the first time that Rahman sir had created a song like that, with a bluesy feel to it.”

Alphons had been going through a tough time personally as he had been diagnosed with spondylosis and was confined to the bed. He had been able to compose only one song for Casanova. He was pursuing his masters (first year) in Carnatic music from the Calicut University when he got the call from Rahman’s office. “Being confined to the bed, it was a time for deep introspection for me. I had been thinking a lot about life and spirituality. God intervened, when I got that call.”

Alphons had met ARR in 2002, when he attended the audio launch of Alphons’ debut film Vellithira. Alphons had a sung a song at the function, which led ARR to ask, “whether I wanted to be a composer or sing. I told him I wanted to compose, but if I got a good break I wouldn’t mind giving singing a shot. Perhaps Rahman sir remembered that.” He credits Rahman for allowing him to improvise with the song for stage shows, like recently at a Rahman show where he performed with a saxophonist.

“Anoop asked if we should take a krithi (for ‘Ne Va En Aarumukha...’) or create a new song from scratch. I told him let’s write a song, we got Dr. Kritaya to write the Tamil part and lyricist Santhosh Varma the Malayalam part which I then set to tune. It went very well with the film’s Navarathri scene. All the songs worked organically with the plot, the songs gelled with the situations.” Another song, ‘Muthunne Kannukalil...’, has a story as well. Shobhana wasn’t very keen to dance for the song, as she wasn’t sure if it would be relevant. “We wanted the song to be such that she would agree...after listening to the song she did.”

The music for the song was a collaborative effort. Alphons, Anoop and Santhosh Varma worked together on the project in Chennai except the ‘Mullapoove...’ song which was composed almost immediately after Alphons heard the story. “Working together was good, we complemented each other. The last time I worked like this was for Vellithira and Jalolsavam. Anoop was very open to suggestions. What makes me most happy is that everything that was composed for the film was used.” The feedback he has got from others in the industry has been good, especially that he has tried different genres — classical, hip-hop, melody, and Christian devotional — for the film.

Alphons has also sung for the film — ‘Oh! En Eesa...’ and ‘Mathi Kann Ullathu Chollan...’ What makes him most happy about the project is that he got playback singer KS Chithra to sing for him after a while. “It has been a while and it was so good to work with Chithra chechi, the last time was Jalolsavam.” His next project is Bhadran’s Joothan which he says has also given him a chance to try varied kinds of music.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/f4q56/article31001324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07KIMPAJ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/varane-avashyamund-has-been-a-good-break-says-music-director-alphons-joseph/article31001325.ece
184,2020/03/06,‘Les Misérables’ questions the responsibility of the government towards its people: Alexis Manenti,"As the Oscar-nominated film comes to India, actor-co-screenwriter Alexis Manenti talks about the politically-charged French drama

After making waves in the festival circuit, Ladj Ly’s hard-hitting political drama “Les Misérables” is releasing in India. As part of the promotions, Alexis Manenti (co-screenwriter and one of the main protagonists) and actor Omar Soumare were in Delhi, recently.

The first thing that strikes about the French film is its title, inspired by Victor Hugo’s classic novel. “The film’s major connection to the Victor Hugo novel is that it is set in Montfermeil, a commune in the eastern suburbs of Paris, where an important part of the classic novel is set. So even after 150 years the place stills suffers from poverty,” reveals Manenti.

Soumare agrees that the title does create a sense of curiosity among the audiences owing to obvious reasons.

“The people want to find out if it’s a modern retelling of the same story or not. So, the title does help at some level. But I think that ultimately the success of the movie is because of what it offers not because of its title,” asserts Soumare who feels that the film’s greatest strength is that it doesn’t take position for the police or for the population.

“It shows that police is also the victim of the political situation. Also, the policemen are underpaid but they try to do their job. But the social tensions and political pressures are so intense that it becomes very hard for them,” adds Soumare.

Present tense

While, Hugo’s novel offered a critique of a French society essentially comprising French people, Ladj Ly’s examines the plight of the immigrant population in Montfermeil. “What has changed is that earlier there were all French people but now the place has a lot of immigrants, especially of African or Arabic ethnicities. But, the problems they face are more or less the same. So, the film talks about poverty and the present situation. What makes the situation worse is the violence, and cops provoking people. As a result there are riots against the police towards the end of the film,” reveals Manenti while lamenting about the loss of life and property in the recent Delhi riots about which he got to read in the newspapers.

“Les Misérables” is actually based on a short film of the same name made by Ladj Ly about three years back. “The director Ladj Ly is a friend of mine. We started 20 years ago doing some short films. Now, around three years back he asked me to write a short film with him. He also offered me a part in it. Since the short film tasted a lot of success at the festival circuit, a producer came on board and asked us to make a feature film on the short one. So that’s when we started to expand the screenplay. It took us six months to write it. It has the same basic story with same central characters but the end is not the same,” explains Manenti who won the award for Best Male Newcomer for the film at the recent César Awards.

Keeping it real

Manenti, who plays a cop in the film, trained with real cops to prepare for his part. “My character Chris is a bad cop. He is violent, arrogant, racist and corrupt. I let Ladj write scenes for me which added an element of surprise to Chris. Also, on the sets, I was just the actor and let Ladj take care of the briefing and other tasks. It allowed me to focus entirely on my acting. I watched a lot of movies about cops. Also, I had some training with the cops in order to understand how they walk, how they work, and the words they use, their methods, technicalities and procedures involved,” reveals Manenti.

Soumare’s preparation, on the other hand, was pretty straight forward. “I play a character called Macha who works for the street mayor from the suburb. He is not the real mayor and uses street kids for all kinds of shady activities. He is half-gangster, half-leader . My character is basically his right-hand man. Although, I don’t have many scenes with Chris in the movie, there is an inherent dislike between the two of our characters. My preparation was simple. I just stuck to the basics,” recounts Soumare.

Manenti opines that the film’s highly political nature and hard-hitting subject made it less appealing to the Oscar jury in comparison to some of its competitors. “Our film is not afraid to highlight the tension between the police and the migrant population. Also, it questions the responsibility of the government towards its people. Maybe, the Academy preferred ‘Parasite’ because though it also talks about poverty, it is not as political as ‘Les Miserables’. Also, perhaps, it’s a part of success of ‘Parasite’ that it’s not so realistic,” sums up Manenti.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/iz5t4f/article31001176.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Alexis-Manenti2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/les-misrables-questions-the-responsibility-of-the-government-towards-its-people-alexis-manenti/article31001177.ece
185,2020/03/06,Sanjay Mishra: Story of a sidekick,"Ahead of the release of Kaamyaab, Sanjay Mishra talks about what it means to be successful

In the last decade, there has been a rise of faith in supporting actors in Hindi films. One of them is Sanjay Mishra. Now, Mishra’s fame as a supporting actor has made him the subject of Kaamyaab, which closely relives what he has experienced in the film industry. With Shah Rukh Khan presenting the film, it seems Kaamyaab has a successful promotion strategy.

He nods, “Involvement of a name like Shah Rukh Khan has brought a different kind of attention to this small film. Otherwise, it is still difficult to find space for such films. You cannot imagine me to be a hero who could attract the audience, but I am feeling like a hero right now. That is because of the compelling story which made me the centre of attraction,” he says.

Kaamyaab is Hardik Mehta’s debut film which centres around a character actor Sudhir’s yearning to complete 500 films. Mishra relates his own experiences of the famous Juhu Tara road where he used to roam around to find a role in films. “That was the reason I picked up this film as I had to play the struggle of an actor and that is the world I know inside out. I was Hardik’s choice because I have lived that life. Like Sudhir, I did a lot of films where I had a very small screen time. However, I am different from Sudhir in terms of his approach towards his career as unlike him I never came here to become a typical hero.”

Mishra reminds there was a time when actors were earmarked for a particular role. “For drunkard, you had Keshto Mukherjee. For father, there was Kader Khan, for judge, D.K.Sapru and for corrupt bureaucrat there was Om Shiv Puri. It is a homage to these wonderful actors as well,” he underlines.

One should admire Mishra for rising above the sidekick tag to play meaty roles in films such as Aankhon Dekhi, Masaan, and Kadvi Hava. “The process of filmmaking should be an exploration. Director explores the actor and actor get a chance to explore himself while understanding the director’s choices. I love to be directed by new directors and films like Masaan, Newton and Angrezi Mein Kahte Hain were a result of that exploration only,” he reveals. “I am glad that these films are giving me a chance to act as a protagonist and that is different from my other films where I play supporting roles and the responsibility to carry the film is not on my shoulders.”

Hindi films are increasingly telling ordinary people’s stories and, in a way, has created a demand for actors who could essay such characters. Mishra is aware of this trend. “A film like Masaan talks about the sensibilities of youth but that was not a college romance. There was a time when there existed a parallel cinema, but those stories are now becoming mainstream.

Had they been made in the ‘80s, they would have been treated as a parallel cinema but right now it is not a case. There is a space for older actors, heroines are not just hero's love interest and I am very thankful for this change.” Is there an increased affinity of the audience for older characters as well? “Of course, you can see how Mr (Amitabh) Bachchan has re-invented himself. There was a time when old age was considered as something negative on screen. I feel, if you show gripping old characters to the audience, they will be inspired.”

Initially, he was chosen for roles close to his real self, but gradually filmmakers realised his range. He likes picking up mannerisms from different spaces and cultural humour which helps him become a new person in every film. “I learnt music in my childhood and I relate that with the acting I do. You need to understand the note of the character and that should be tuned to the director’s vision.”

Mishra says he is content. “If you get success very early, it becomes essential that you maintain it. It becomes difficult and there comes a lot of pressure. As I got the attention very late, I don’t have any ego.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/9bw554/article31001153.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Snapseed-24,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sanjay-mishra-story-of-a-sidekick/article31001154.ece

Venom star Riz Ahmed is in negotiations to star in Exit West, to be produced by Michelle and Barack Obama’s Higher Ground Productions.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Avengers: Endgame directing duo Joe and Anthony Russo are also on board the project as producers.

The film, set up at Netflix, is an adaptation of Pakistani author Mohsin Hamid’s 2017 best-selling book of the same name.

French filmmaker Yann Demange is being eyed by the makers to helm the project.

The story, which has elements of fantasy and magical realism, is about a young couple, Saeed and Nadia, living in an unnamed city amid a civil war who flee using a system of magical doors that lead to different locations around the globe.

If finalised, Ahmed, 37, will take on the role of Saeed.

The actor and the author had previously collaborated on 2012 political thriller drama The Reluctant Fundamentalist. The film was also an adaptation of Hamid’s book of the same name.

187,2020/03/06,"‘I am fascinated by each and every aspect of direction’, says Kavya Prakash about her début film ‘Vaanku’","The film zooms in on a young woman, and her desire to recite the Azaan (the call to prayer), better known as 'vaanku' in Malayalam, to the shock of her family and society

Kavya Prakash may be suffering from a bad throat but that does not dampen the enthusiasm in her voice or prevent her from speaking nineteen to the dozen about her directorial début Vaanku.

An adaptation of Unni R’s popular short story by the same name, the film zooms in on Razia, a young woman, and her desire to recite the Azaan (the call to prayer), better known as vaanku in Malayalam, to the shock of her family and society.

The daughter of filmmaker VK Prakash, Kavya says she grew up watching her father work on various sets, be it commercials, music videos or films. “And I knew then, even as a child, that I wanted to become a director. I am fascinated by each and every aspect of direction. I enjoy the entire process right from scripting and casting to shooting and editing. I have been hands on on all aspects of Vaanku, even the music composition and the final mix of the film,” says Kavya, a graduate of visual communication from Manipal University.

The seed for shooting Vaanku as her directorial first was planted by Unni. “Unni sir had dropped by my father’s office and we began talking. He started narrating various stories of his. I felt an instant connect when I heard Vaanku. He noticed how my eyes lit up when he narrated the tale and suggested I turn it into a film. As I was fascinated by the tale and its characters I didn’t think twice.”

The scripting for the movie took over two years as Shabna Muhammed, who has penned the screenplay and dialogues, wanted to handle “the sensitive subject subtly without hurting anyone’s sentiments or sensibilities. Razia’s desire to recite vaanku is not an act of rebellion or a means for her to challenge the community; it comes from her desire to bring out her Sufi nature.

“We have given close attention to detail to the dialogues, the clothes, the village wherein the film was set…”

It also helped that Unni was personally involved with the project from start till end. “I was clear that I wouldn’t tamper with his vision. He was there as a guide at every step of the making of the film.”

The choice of the cast, most of them newcomers, was a joint effort by Kavya, Shabna and Unni. The actors, says Kavya, attended a three-day workshop.

“It was more of an ice-breaker than an acting camp. As most of them were new, I wanted them to be comfortable. I wanted them to feel free to pose questions, like why their character reacts to a situation in certain way, for instance. I believe the more comfortable your team is, the better their performance on screen will be.”

Although her father, a two-time National Award winning director, is an executive producer of the film, Kavya relied on him for just emotional support.

Kavya Prakash | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

“I didn’t ask him for any guidance. I was clear that the film had my all; it is my baby. Only then can I take satisfaction with the outcome,” says the 27-year-old who doesn’t believe in having things handed to her on a silver platter.

Says Kavya: “I worked in the corporate field and the advertisement industry before joining my dad’s office. Even then, I started from scratch; I didn’t want to be treated differently just because I am VK Prakash’s daughter. I started out as an assistant director at my dad’s company and I have worked with Mridul Nair on his film BTech.”

Kavya, who is planning to start work on a few new projects, which she is keeping under wraps, admits she is feeling nervous about how the audience will receive Vaanku, which will hit theatres on March 13.

“Although the film is based on Unni sir’s short story, we have adapted it to suit the cinematic format. I hope the audience will accept this film, which my team and I have poured our hearts and souls into. I want the audience to leave the theatre with smiles on their faces.”

Lyrics by PS Rafeeq is set to music by Ouseppachan. Arjun Ravi is the DOP. Anaswara Rajan of Thanneermathan Dinangal, plays Razia.

189,2020/03/06,"‘Baaghi 3’ movie review: Beyond the Tiger Shroff voyeurism, there is little else to this film","The third installment in the ‘Baaghi’ franchise is all about loving and saving your family from global terror outfits

Filmmaker Ahmed Khan seems to have a fetish for installation art, that too the kind that involves modes of transport. So you have one action sequence shot against the backdrop of several hundreds of colourful cars piled up, one atop another, in a circle. In the middle of this car, Tiger Shroff displays his chops. Homage to Rohit Shetty films? Not quite. Some hours into the film and there is another automobilian sculpture — three helicopters, one over the other, with Tiger on top, burning bright, seemingly signalling to the baddies below — “I am the cub (if not the tiger king) of the world”.

In the third instalment of the Baaghi franchise, Tiger returns as Ronnie, as does Shraddha Kapoor as his lady love Siya. Ronnie goes on a one-man mission to Syria to save his elder brother, cop Vikram (Riteish Deshmukh) who has been kidnapped by an Islamic terrorist organisation while on an assignment there.

Baaghi 3 Director: Ahmed Khan

Starring: Tiger Shroff, Riteish Deshmukh, Shraddha Kapoor, Jaideep Ahlawat, Vijay Varma, Jameel Khoury

Run time: 143 minutes

Storyline: Ronnie (Tiger Shroff) goes on a one man mission to Syria to save his elder brother, cop Vikram (Riteish Deshmukh) who has been kidnapped by an Islamic terrorist outfit while on an assignment

In keeping with the nationalistic fervour of the times, Baaghi 2 had shown a lot of respect for the army; cops can be bad, army men can’t, it seemed to say. Here it’s a cop who is handily eulogised for protecting innocent people and laying down his own life in riots. Given the current state of affairs, it’s not unusual then to wonder if the entire sequence was truly prescient or was it programmed into the script later, considering the police is otherwise not shown in a great light the film. The nod to the recent ‘Bollywood police’ genre — Dabangg and Singham and the foreshadowing of Sooryavanshi — also seem intentional.

The rebel Ronnie who breaks bones, teeth and jaws of the street side taporis to begin with becomes “America, Russia, Mossad”, all rolled into one against the might of the dreaded Islamic terrorist Abu Jalal (Jameel Khoury). Bombs, explosions, landmines: nothing can stop him from wreaking a vengeance which becomes laughably improbable and inane in the climax. In the middle, many stereotypes gets reinforced, visually, and in the writing and dialogue. Asinine jokes about the towers in the men’s loo and about surnames like Kute abound in the name of humour.

Despite sporting an impassive face, a perennially faraway look and moist eyes, Tiger Shroff has managed to forge his way ahead in Bollywood with some lithe, aesthetic stunts. He is agile and athletic, poses and posturises with a choreographed grace and daintiness. An overmuscled, overbronzed body demands display. So, somewhere down the line, a rag of a shirt hung loosely on his body also gets conveniently ripped apart. Beyond this Tiger voyeurism, there is little else to the film. Seasoned actors like Jaideep Ahlawat and Vijay Varma are made to ham, Shraddha Kapoor is more of a comic relief in the name of being the leading lady and Riteish Deshmukh appears to keep eating dahi for good luck. There is a phrase in Hindi: dimaag ka dahi, the curdling of brain. That’s what the film does to your mind, leaves you all woolly-headed.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/u4q8js/article31000334.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/baaghi3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/baaghi-3-movie-review-beyond-the-tiger-shroff-voyeurism-there-is-little-else-to-this-film/article31000335.ece
190,2020/03/06,"‘O Pitta Katha’ movie review: Showcases a new talent, but ultimately disappointing","Chandu Muddu's official debut as director fails to impress

This story takes place in a village in Kakinada. The heroine Venkatalakshmi (Nitya Shetty) is a devotee of Sai Baba and believes that if one writes letters to eleven people professing their faith in the Saint, their wishes will be fulfilled. Since letter writing is non-existent now, we are made to believe the story is set in the 80s, but one of the heroes, Krish (Vishwant) actually asks her in the age of WhatsApp and emails, why is there a necessity to hand over letters.

The film marks the debut of character artiste Brahmaji’s son Sanjay Rao and also an official debut of Chandu Muddu as a director.

Venkatalakshmi is the only daughter and her father owns a cinema hall. He was once a mere worker in the cinema hall and wooed the owner’s daughter every time she came to see a film and eventually married her. Another worker has a son around the same time Venkatalakshmi is born. The boy Prabhu (Sanjay) grows up to be jealous that his father is still in the same position, he on his part has not been able to clear his exams and to adding to his woes, the girl once in love with him is leaning towards her NRI cousin Krish. He hoped that if he marries Venkatalakshmi, the cinema hall would be his.

We are made to believe that Prabhu is a negative character and our sympathies are aligned towards Krish. The only interesting part of the film is its screenplay. The story is told in each person’s perspective to a cop (Brahmaji) when Venkatalakshmi suddenly goes missing. Nitya Shetty who worked as a child in films, is just adequate here and it is Sanjay who makes a promising debut. His work is effortless and shows his ease in every frame.

Chandu had earlier directed Aa Oorlo O Sari Yemjarigindhante, but it didn’t get a proper release. The film showcased his talent and one wished with another chance he could prove himself in the industry. Sadly here, there is no upgrading in terms of dialogues or entertainment despite having the scope. Songs are pleasing but cinematography highlights the limitations of the artistes.

191,2020/03/06,"Not another teen drama: On Netflix's new show, 'I Am Not Okay With This'","Director Jonathan Entwistle has a knack for presenting clichéd adolescent issues through an interesting new lens, as he showed in 'The End Of The F*cking World'

Netflix is obsessed with teenagers. Or wait, is it the other way round?

We are only two months into 2020, and the streaming service has already given us that lukewarm sequel to that film about that teen who wrote letters to all the boys she loved before, and which gave the Internet that swoon-worthy pin-up. There is also that new (stellar) season of that show about teens experiencing sexual awakening. And last week, Netflix dropped I Am Not Okay With This, a new show about yet another confused, angsty teen coming to terms with — what else but — a whole lot of curveballs pubescence throws her way.

This girl, Sydney, hasn’t yet wrapped her head around the recent death of her father; she may be in love with her best (girl) friend, who’s in turn smitten with the annoying school jock; and she is struggling to come to terms with bodily changes… like zits on her thighs. Nothing new here, you might say.

But wait, there is a twist: Sydney may have telekinetic abilities. Only, it is not some cool superpower kids in Marvel stories (or even other Netflix shows like Stranger Things) use to save the world. Instead, it is a force that awakens during Sydney’s darkest moments, like when she is furious about getting second-hand treatment by her bestie, or when immense grief over her parent’s death strikes. It is quite possible that Charles Forsman, whose comic book the show is based on, thought, “What if teen angst was a superpower?” and then wove a story around it.

Two previously frothy movie genres — the teen movie and the superhero movie — have been mined for dark TV lately. Both these strands combine in I Am Not Okay With This, and rather well. Director Jonathan Entwistle has a knack for presenting clichéd adolescent issues through an interesting new lens, as he showed in The End Of The F*cking World. (You guessed it. Another Netflix teen show.) That, too, was an adaptation of a Forsman graphic novel, and the director and author are clearly in fine sync.

This time, they serve up an expectedly dark but also unassumingly wicked teen drama that has the ability to surprise you. I ventured into it with pretty much the same attitude I do other shows about young adults nowadays (“Ack! One more.”), but stayed around till the rather satisfying end. There is also the lovely Sophia Lillis, who has been turning up in films (It) and TV shows (Sharp Objects) lately, and she plays Sydney with understated, twisted charm. Wyatt Oleff (another It alumni) plays Stanley Barber, a boy who is smitten with Sydney, and he’s a real find, too.

If you can look past familiar teen show tropes in the early moments, you will find that I Am Not Okay With This slowly transforms into an unsettling drama that, at seven 20-odd-minutes-long episodes, is a breeze. A short teen show — small mercies!

Season One of I Am Not Okay With This is now streaming on Netflix.

192,2020/03/06,Kareena Kapoor Khan finally makes Instagram debut,"The ‘Good Newwz’ star posted her first picture in all-black attire, in what seems to be a promotional collaboration with Puma athleisure

Jennifer Aniston broke the platform with her debut post a few months ago, and now we have our desi Bollywood star Kareena Kapoor Khan also following suit.

While the actor has always maintained she was not going to join any social media platform, she also did let slip on a couple of talk shows (such as Koffee with Karan) earlier that she has a ‘fake’ account which she secretly uses to keep updated on the world of celebrity pictures and gossip.

However, now, in what seems to be a promotional collaboration with Puma athleisure, the Good Newwz star posted her first picture in all-black attire, captioning it, “The cat’s out of the bag. #HelloInstagram”

Earlier, the account had a video of a black cat passing by, reading, ‘Play, Pause and Loading’ which hinted at her becoming active soon.

The account @kareenakapoorkhan has already racked up 641,000 followers as of now, as more fans discover the star on Instagram.

193,2020/03/06,Television host Yyamini Padma reveals why her role in serial 'Thoorpu Padamara' is special,"In the series, Yyamini shares a Tom-and-Jerry kind of relationship with Aishwarya, her grand mother (Nagamani)

Staying away from scheming, corrupt narratives, the new series Thoorpu Padamara on Zee TV presents a refreshing storyline. Yyamini Padma playing Laya in the daily series is confident of it creating an enduring appeal. “The drama is relatable and entertaining,” she says. Yyamini plays a traditional girl with a love for simple things; her life takes a 360 degree turn when she gets married to a man who appreciates western culture. It is also a story of two friends — an optimistic Laya (“Even a broken clock is right twice”) and the sceptical Shruti (Jaya Kavi).

In the series, Yyamini shares a Tom and Jerry kind of relationship with Aishwarya, her grand mother (Nagamani). The reason: The grandmother wants her to be modern and this conflict and arguments between them are presented in an humorous way. She says: “We all have that one person in the family with whom we share a love-hate relationship. Many will be able to connect to our complex relationship and it evokes laughter.”

Yyamini hails from Warangal and the Commerce graduate’s television début was in and as Chinna Kodalu. She played Bhoomi in Muthyala Muggu (her all-time favourite role) and also Meenakshi, a visually-challenged girl who transforms her disability into strength to protect her family. Yyamini reveals that doing only four projects in a span of eight years was an informed choice. “Too many characters can sometimes evoke boredom among the audience. I wanted to carve a niche and create an identity for my roles.”

For Yyamini, playing Laya is special as the character is close to her in real life. She has a select few friends, is rooted to tradition and prefers spending time with her kith and kin. “I am a simple, proud Telugu girl who likes to wear clothes that I am comfortable in. During my non-shooting days, I prefer a no make-up and jewellery look and when I go out, many do not recognise me.”

Yyamini is confident Thoorpu Padamara will appeal even to younger audiences. “The content, especially the comedy that unravels in the storyline, will be entertaining. The series portrays our lives, the way we talk or have fun with our family members. It is nice to watch a television series that brings a smile to the face than a frown. This is also the first time that I am doing a light-hearted role and wear salwar kameezes.”

She often shuttles between Hyderabad and Warangal, and makes it a point to spend time with her family. “I like to give my best in whatever I do and once I put on make-up, I give my 100 percent.” In her free time, she loves watching movies. “I am inspired by the kind of roles that Trisha and Ramya Krishnan did. Today’s films focus mostly on the heroes and actresses do not get much space to perform.”

194,2020/03/06,"HBO is adapting video game ‘The Last of Us’ into a TV series, ‘Chernobyl’ creator Craig Mazin on board","The show will be produced by Sony Pictures Television and PlayStation Productions, and also has the game’s co-director and writer Neil Druckmann on board

HBO has left video game fans across the world stunned at its most recent announcement: the decision to adapt the hugely-successful survival horror video game The Last of Us, along with Sony Pictures Television and PlayStation Productions, into a TV show.

A project long in the running, fans of the game have been waiting for years for news of this official announcement, after several former collaborations to do the same fell through.

Now, the game will be adapted by The Last of Us co-director and writer Neil Druckmann, as well as Craig Mazin, who will once again work with HBO after the critical success of Chernobyl, states The Hollywood Reporter. Mazin who has an extensive body of work — The Hangover II, The Hangover III, and The Huntsman: Winter’s War — has created, written, and executive produced Chernobyl.

“From the first time I sat down to talk with Craig, I was equally blown away by his approach to narrative, and his love and deep understanding of The Last of Us. With Chernobyl, Craig and HBO created a tense, harrowing, emotional masterpiece. I couldn’t think of better partners to bring the story of The Last of Us to life as a television show,” Druckmann said in a prepared statement.

Mazin, on his part, said that Druckmann was the “finest storyteller working in the video game medium” and the game as his “magnum opus.”

The Last of Us follows the journey of Joel, a smuggler with a dark past who is travelling across post-apocalyptic US, along with a 14-year-old girl Ellie, who he has to deliver safely as she maybe the answer to cure a deadly pandemic that is turning people into monsters. The immersive experience and movie-like events of the title has won it many ‘Game of The Year’ awards and has sold over 17 million copies across both its original release on the PlayStation 3 and a remastered version on PlayStation 4.

The TV adaptation will be produced by Sony Pictures Television and PlayStation Productions (the first TV show from the latter). An announcement is expected to be made about the cast and crew in the coming months.

Meanwhile, the sequel to the game, The Last of Us Part II, is scheduled to released May 29, and the TV show could also feature additional content from the second game as well.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/3v4y3n/article30999229.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/the-last-of-us-14863-1920x1200,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/hbo-is-adapting-video-game-the-last-of-us-into-a-tv-series-chernobyl-creator-craig-mazin-on-board/article30999230.ece

Filmmaker-writer Taika Waititi is set to direct two animated series based on Roald Dahl’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for Netflix.

Waititi, who won an Academy Award in February for his adapted screenplay, Jojo Rabbit, will also serve as the writer and producer on the animated series.

According to Deadline, the first series will be based on the world of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, while the second will be an original take on the Oompa-Loompa characters from the book.

The Oompa-Loompas are little humans who were preyed upon in Loompaland before Wonka invited them to work at his chocolate factory. They are paid in cocoa beans and love practical jokes and singing songs.

Netflix said the animation series would “retain the quintessential spirit and tone of the original story while building out the world and characters far beyond the pages of the Dahl book for the very first time.”

196,2020/03/06,‘Velvet Nagaram’ movie review: Varalaxmi struggles in a movie that is both confusing and patchy,"Manojkumar Natarajan seems clueless about his own material, and the amateurish way of handling suspense is both derivative and simplistic, despite a potent subject at the centre

They say that the first 20 minutes of a movie would determine if you are really into it or not. I reject Brotman’s Law when it comes Tamil cinema. For me, what matters is the opening sequence — if it begins with an aerial shot showing the vast expanse of a picturesque location or a locality, I’m already out. Sure, there have been movies that have had absurd opening shots but turned out surprisingly good by the end of it.

Velvet Nagaram opens with a drone-shot of wildfire in Kodaikanal and a voice-over on the atrocities faced by the tribal community inhabiting the region. What did I just say in the previous paragraph? It is a dull scene that sets precedent for a duller movie. You sense a lack of interest — both in the actors and the director — right from the start. What is even more distressing is the lethargic attitude of the director who seems to reject the notion of what is called as plot building exercise. We are absolutely dependent on dialogues to understand what is happening on screen and between the characters.

Velvet Nagaram Cast: Varalaxmi Sarathkumar, Maalavika Sundar, Ramesh Thilak, Kasturi Shankar and Santhosh Krishna

Director: Manojkumar Natarajan

Storyline: A journalist’s life is at stake when she uncovers a dark truth about Kodaikanal forest fire, fuelled by a corporate giant with the Government’s hand in it. What extent would she go, to save her life and to expose the truth?

Allow me to give you a sample of this. Social activist and actor Gowri (Kasturi Shankar) has been brutally killed for discovering a vital piece of information about the Kodaikanal forest fire. She claims it was orchestrated by a corporate giant called Advaita and not a natural disaster. There isn’t visual evidence to substantiate her argument. We are told who she is and what she does through a phone call that she has with her friend Usha (Varalaxmi Sarathkumar). Now, you are like: “Who is Usha, dude?” Don’t worry, says the director. In the next scene, we are told who Usha is. When she goes to the crime scene, we learn that she is a journalist. You heave a sigh of relief. However, you are still divided on whether she is an investigative journalist or a talk show host. You put those thoughts aside, but soon realise that Velvet Nagaram is as messed up as Usha’s one-dimensional character.

Just when you are about to come to a conclusion that it is going to be a murder-mystery, it goes into a different territory and becomes another movie — like a home-invasion thriller. I, for one, didn’t see that coming. But does it achieve that? No. Take Ashwin Saravanan’s Game Over, which is a far superior movie and dealt with a similar premise. Everything was crystal clear on paper, even though it had a twisted narrative structure. But here, everything is hastily put together. New characters, who have no relevance to the larger design of the movie, are thrown into the proceedings. Maybe I didn’t follow what transpired in-between (let me confess; I dozed off for like a solid five minutes). Velvet Nagaram still could have been a watchable home invasion thriller had it not been bogged down by lazy writing.

Manojkumar Natarajan claims to be Quentin Tarantino’s fan and you understand why. His directorial debut comes across as the work of an independent filmmaker, given its patchy look and feel. The movie, in fact, begins with QT’s quote: “I steal from every great movie ever made.” Sometimes, it is absolutely okay to lift ideas provided the movie is engaging on some level.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/hj0fr/article30998789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/velvet,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/velvet-nagaram-movie-review-varalaxmi-struggles-in-a-movie-that-is-both-confusing-and-patchy/article30998790.ece
197,2020/03/06,Singer Srinivas on returning to independent music with ‘Nenjil Oru Vannam’,"19 years after ‘Ussele Ussele' in 2001, the singer has another independent venture, which is about adding colour to your dreams

Way back in 2001, singer Srinivas came up with ‘Ussele Ussele’, a song from a pop album that created waves for being shot like a music video. It was a big hit, but Srinivas did not attempt such a thing again, since he got busy with film songs and concerts.

He is back to the independent music space with ‘Nenjil Oru Vannam’, releasing today.

It all started when he composed a song on colours. When he pitched the number to Nippon Paint, they were interested — and tweaked the concept to be an empowering video which focusses on the girl child and her struggle to shine in a challenging environment that refuses to acknowledge her talent.

“I meet so many singers and musicians who keep complaining about the decrease in the quality of songs today. But why aren’t we doing anything about it?” he asks.

Part of what he is trying to do is re-imagining the independent music scene with his musical outings. “There cannot be anything better than creating a path of your own with your music,” he says, “It’s high time that singers start creating their own independent stuff, and performing that in concerts. Today, you don’t need a music company, and thanks to everything being digital, you can shoot a video and put it out there.”

Is the move because of a lack of offers on the film front? “I sang for Imman’s Pon Manickavel, but that’s about it. I’m not complaining, though, because the current crop of youngsters should get the kind of opportunities I got back then,” says the singer.

He hopes that ‘Nenjil Oru Vannam’ will be added to a playlist that boasts superhits like ‘Minsara Poove’, ‘En Uyire’ and ‘Azhagae Sugama’.

Also on the cards is another independent musical effort that will be a ‘thank you’ number for everybody associated with his musical journey. “I touched the landmark 60 years recently, and it has been more than 25 years in the film industry. As far as music is concerned, there’s nothing called retirement. I’m happy that I’m still singing, and that music still excites me like it did back then.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/hvd2uf/article30998043.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ZG2A4195JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/singer-srinivas-interview/article30998044.ece
198,2020/03/06,"Cannes Film Festival to go ahead, despite concerns over coronavirus outbreak","Hardly any probability of gathering of over 5,000 at same time in one location for screenings

With the French Health Minister extending the ban on gatherings of more than 5,000 people in confined spaces to May 31, fresh concerns arose on Thursday over the novel coronavirus outbreak affecting the 73rd edition of Cannes Film Festival, scheduled to be held from May 12 to 23.

Putting speculations to rest, a spokesperson of the festival told The Hindu on a long distance call, “As of today, there is nothing to indicate that it [the festival] will not go ahead as planned. Everything is going on as normal right now in the office in Paris.”

While the organisers are committed to follow the Minister’s “specific instructions”, the rules don’t seem come in the way of the festival. Two of the biggest auditoriums at the venue — Palais des Festivals et des Congres — are Lumiere and Debussy, with a capacity of 2,309 and 1,068 respectively. So there is hardly any probability of a gathering of more than 5,000 people at the same time in one location for the festival screenings. Cannes Film Market, however, may have to be more closely monitored.

Regarding fears that attendance of film personalities, media and cinephiles may dwindle this year, the spokesperson said: “We will discover in the next few weeks. It’s hard to tell how the situation evolves.” As of now, the festival is committed to announce the official selection mid April; April 16 in all likelihood.

The one time Cannes was brought to a halt in recent history, midway at that, was in 1968, when several filmmakers — including Jean-Luc Godard,

François Truffaut and Claude Lelouch — showed solidarity with striking students and workers resisting Charles de Gaulle’s government. Some like Alain Resnais withdrew their movies, while others like Roman Polanski, Monica Vitti and Louis Malle resigned from the jury.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ikghru/article30995335.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6BMCANNESREDCARPET,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/cannes-film-festival-to-go-ahead-despite-concerns-over-coronavirus-outbreak/article30995336.ece
199,2020/03/06,Coronavirus: TN to establish quarantine facilities for persons suspected to have COVID-19,"The Health Minister inspected the arrangements made at the Chennai international airport to screening passengers of all flights.

Tamil Nadu is planning to establish full-fledged quarantine facilities for persons suspected to have coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the outskirts of Chennai and Madurai, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said.

“We presently have 300 beds in isolation wards across the State, and can increase these if needed. Now, the Chief Minister has allotted special funds to set up separate quarantine wards in the outer areas of Chennai and Madurai. These facilities are to quarantine persons whom we suspect to have coronavirus disease during screenings, on an emergency basis. We are working on establishing these facilities simultaneously,” he told reporters on Friday.

The Minister, along with Health Secretary Beela Rajesh and Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine K. Kolandaswamy inspected the arrangements made at the Chennai international airport to screening passengers of all flights.

With the impact of COVID-19 being felt in an increased number of countries such as Italy, South Korea, Iran and Japan, he said a 100-member team consisting of doctors and paramedical personnel were involved in round-the-clock screening at the airport. This includes the Health department’s team of 65 medical and paramedical personnel. They are screening nearly 8,500 passengers arriving in nearly 52 to 57 flights. Along with hand sanitisers, air sanitisers have been installed at the airport, he said.

“Nasal and throat swabs along with blood samples were lifted from 54 persons and all have tested negative for COVID-19. There is no case of COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu. Public need not fear or panic. But it is important to be cautious as it is an airborne disease. Seek medical help in case of symptoms of fever, cough and difficulty in breathing,” the Minister said.

Isolation wards in private hospitals

The Minister said they have advised private hospitals to set up isolation wards with the required facilities. Some of the major hospitals have come forward to establish isolation wards and follow the treatment protocols.

He added that all public places where there are chances of overcrowding including airports, commercial establishments, shopping complexes, theatres and schools should strictly follow the instructions issued by the respective district Collectors and Health Department on cleaning surfaces using disinfectants.

The Chief Secretary has written to all Collectors on dos and don’ts and to take up awareness on COVID-19 in schools, colleges, factories, MNCs, theatres, marriages halls and shopping malls. “We are continuously reiterating the importance of hand washing. The disease transmits 20% directly through droplets in the air through cough or sneeze, while 80% transmission occurs by touching the infected surfaces such as tables, handrails or seats,” he said.

He added that the department’s mobile health teams continued to monitor the districts that share border with Kerala. He said that the control room and health helpline 104 were receiving about 100 calls each on COVID-19.

Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, Chairman and Managing Director, Cognizant India, said the quantity and quality of engineering talent is going up significantly every passing year, and there is no real cause of concern about the recent fall in admissions.

“I agree that some institutions that do not have enough infrastructure such as faculty, minimum student intake and lab infrastructure are closing down. I see it as a good thing, as the good faculty and students will migrate to better-run institutions and increase the overall quality throughout,” he said in an interview.

Cognizant plans to hire 23,000 freshers this year in India, starting June, when compared to 17,000 last year.

Mr. Ramamoorthy said the quality of talent is being enhanced because of the government expanding the number of IITs and IIITs in the country while upgrading RECs to NITs.

Institutes such as BITS Pilani, VIT and others have expanded their footprint and set up newer centres in places including Hyderabad, Goa, Bhopal and Amravati, he added.

Large corporates are making significant investments in setting up institutions of higher learning as part of their philanthropic work, and dozens of premier State private universities are doing really well across India, Mr. Ramamoorthy said.

He also pointed out that the All India Council for Technical Education’s move limiting the core curriculum across disciplines of study to 160 credits and allowing greater flexibility with the remaining 60 credits, had helped progressive institutions to include courses focusing on new age skills such as artificial intelligence, IoT, Cloud and cyber security, among the bouquet of electives.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/1qhlv0/article30998449.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06MARTH-RAMKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/engineering-talent-remains-robust-not-a-cause-for-concern-says-cognizant-india-cmd/article30998450.ece

203,2020/03/06,"Courses offered by medical varsity without MCI nod illegal, says HC","CJ’s Bench concurs with decision taken by a single judge of the court in June

The first Division Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday confirmed an order passed by a single judge of the court in June last declaring as illegal a host of courses offered by Tamil Nadu Dr. MGR Medical University without obtaining necessary approval as required under Section 10(A) of the Indian Medical Council (MCI) Act of 1956.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad concurred with the decision taken by Justice S.S. Sundar, who had restrained the university from continuing the illegal courses either directly or through medical colleges affiliated to it. The Bench recorded the submission of MCI counsel V.P. Raman that it had not approved the courses.

However, the Bench struck off the costs of ₹5 lakh imposed by the single judge on the State-run university for having run medical courses in violation of the law, along with a directive to pay the money within four weeks to the School Education Department so that it could be used for improving the infrastructure of needy government schools.

Giving reasons for striking off the order imposing costs, which had not been paid since the university preferred an appeal, Chief Justice Sahi said it only appeared that the varsity had conducted those courses not with a mala fide intention but only on a misconception that it could offer such courses without the approval of the Union Health Ministry and the MCI.

Apart from the directive related to imposition of costs, “we find no reason to take a different view than what had been taken by the learned single judge... There is no material to find fault with the findings of the learned single judge,” the Bench said while dismissing the writ appeal preferred by the university last year and pending since then.

Ruling upheld

Justice Sundar had declared the courses illegal while allowing a writ petition filed by Doctors’ Welfare Association of Tamil Nadu (DWAT), represented by its general secretary K. Srinivasan, in May last year. The judge agreed with the petitioner’s counsel, P. Ebenezer Paul, that even a State-run university should follow the requirements of a Central law.

In its petition, the association had urged the court to prevent the university from offering one-year fellowships in HIV medicine, occupational health, clinical immunology, palliative medicine and sexual medicine.

It wanted the university to be prevented from offering two-year courses in medical genetics, critical care medicine, clinical diabetology, ultrasound (obstetrics and gynaecology) or any other unauthorised PG degree, diploma, certificate or fellowship in medical sciences course for which an MBBS degree is the requirement for admission.

Opposing the writ petition, the university had claimed that the courses were started only after clearance by its governing council and that it was empowered to offer the courses in medical sciences, depending on the need for such courses, even without obtaining the approval of the Centre or the MCI.

Rejecting the contention, the judge had said Central enactments would prevail over State laws and that a Division Bench of the High Court in Dr. V. Balaji versus Union of India (2008) had stressed upon the need for every medical course to have been approved by the Centre and MCI.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/courses-offered-by-medical-varsity-without-mci-nod-illegal-says-hc/article30994777.ece
204,2020/03/06,Will take steps to rid T.N. of water woes: CM,"Palaniswami lays foundation for medical college in Namakkal

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Thursday said the Tamil Nadu government will take all necessary measures to make the State free of water issues.

At the foundation stone-laying ceremony for a new government medical college in Namakkal, he said the linking of Godavari and Cauvery was a dream project of the AIADMK government and will definitely be implemented.

The government was also looking at the possibility of diverting surplus water from the Mettur dam to Thirumanimutharu river, which would bring prosperity to Namakkal, the CM said. He also inaugurated an arts and science college at Senthamangalam.

Speaking at the function, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam said the Opposition was unable to digest the various achievements of the AIADMK government.

Participating in the event, Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey appreciated the State government for implementing various development projects and noted that Tamil Nadu was leading in various health indicators and in organ transplantation.

Later in the day, Mr. Palaniswami declared open the hospital and a few additional buildings of the Government Medical College at Sanapiratti on the outskirts of Karur.

A 700-bed hospital, a community hall with a seating capacity of 800, staff quarters, canteen, kitchen and quarters for resident doctors were among the new facilities inaugurated by the CM. They were constructed at an estimated cost of ₹119 crore.

Accompanied by Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, former Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha M. Thambi Durai and State Ministers, Mr. Palaniswami visited the seven-storeyed hospital and inspected the facilities provided to the patients, operation theatres, the outpatient ward, the emergency ward, lecture halls, faculty rooms, MRI scan and CT scan facilities, pharmacies and other amenities.

Transport Minister M.R. Vijayabhaskar explained the facilities provided to the patients and medical students. Health Secretary Beela Rajesh, Collector T. Anbalagan and senior officials were present on the occasion.

Mr. Palaniswami had inaugurated the Government Karur Medical College through video-conferencing on July 31, 2019. It was to have an annual intake of 150 students.

A sum of ₹269 crore was sanctioned for the construction of a medical college and hospital. It was one among the medical colleges announced by then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in the Assembly in 2014.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/srde2w/article30994721.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06CM1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/will-take-steps-to-rid-tn-of-water-woes-cm/article30994722.ece
205,2020/03/06,Rajini meets RMM district secretaries,"Actor ‘disappointed’ about one aspect, says he will disclose it ‘at the right time’

Amidst reports that he will float a political party later this year to contest the 2021 Assembly election, actor Rajinikanth met the district secretaries of the Rajini Makkal Mandram to discuss the current political situation and the path forward.

The RMM was set up in 2018 to prepare the ground for his political plunge. On Thursday, he held an hour-long closed-door meeting with 30 district secretaries at the Raghavedra Kalyana Mandapam.

While the district secretaries were strictly told not to speak to the media about what was discussed at the meeting, sources said the discussions revolved around the launch of the party, possible alliances and, importantly, how the actor was being perceived on the ground.

‘Discussed issues’

Speaking to the media later, Mr. Rajinikanth said, “I met them after a year and they had a lot of questions for me. I answered them and we also discussed a number of issues.”

While the district secretaries were ‘content’ with what transpired at the meeting, the actor said he was ‘disappointed’ about one aspect. When asked if it was a personal or a political disappointment, he said, “I will tell you about that at the right time. It was a personal disappointment.”

He said he had asked Muslim organisations to reach out to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah directly to resolve the issues surrounding the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register.

Speaking to The Hindu, a district secretary expressed surprise that Mr. Rajinikanth had said he was disappointed about something. ""We had a lively discussion. I am puzzled as to why Thalaivar said that,” he said. An insider said Mr. Rajinikanth might have been ‘disappointed’ by the actions of some office-bearers who were engaging in “internal politics” rather than reaching out to the people.

A source close to Mr. Rajinikanth said the actor had categorically told the current RMM district secretaries that most of them will not hold the same positions when he launches the party. Sources said only some of the district secretaries were allowed to speak and ask questions. The actor also told the gathering to “leave the decision about alliance to him” and not worry about it.

Outside his house, when he was asked if he would be willing to tie up with Kamal Haasan's Makkal Needhi Maiam for the 2021 Assembly election, he said, “Only time can answer this question.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/u472w7/article30994709.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06RAJINI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rajini-meets-rmm-district-secretaries/article30994710.ece
206,2020/03/06,Petrol bomb hurled at Coimbatore mosque,"Two ADGPs camping in city amid tensions

A petrol bomb was hurled at a mosque in Vedambal Nagar in the early hours of Thursday, amid tensions over the recent attack on a Hindu Munnani leader.

Members of right wing organisations assaulted an auto-rickshaw driver named Mohammed Khani in front of the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital. They also damaged several auto-rickshaws.

Call for shutdown

Condemning the assault on its Coimbatore district secretary Madukkarai Anand on Wednesday, the Hindu Munnani has called for a dawn-to-dusk shutdown in Coimbatore on Saturday. The outfit had initially announced that the hartal will be observed on Friday, but subsequently deferred it by a day, citing requests from the merchant community.

The Coimbatore District All Jamath and Islamic Organisations Federation, which initially announced a morning-to-evening shutdown on Friday to oppose what it described as attempts by the right wing organisation to create communal tension in Coimbatore, subsequently called it off.

Amid tensions, ADGPs Jayanth Murali (Law and Order) and Shankar Jiwal (Armed Police) have been camping in Coimbatore to monitor the law and order situation. They have held a meeting with City Police Commissioner Sumit Sharan. Around 1,500 police personnel along with paramilitary forces have been deployed in the city.

Announcing the shutdown, Hindu Munnani's State president Kadeswara C. Subramaniam told mediapersons that the aim of the move was not only to condemn the assault on Mr. Anand, but also to resist perceived attempts (by those behind the attack) to exploit the incident to spark communal riots. Mr. Subramaniam said the DMK, the Dravidar Kazhagam, the Congress, the Communists and Naxals were instigating Muslims by spreading false information about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, though the Union government and the Chief Minister had reiterated that Muslims would not be affected by the law. Though their aim was to derive political gain out of the CAA, the ‘extremists’ were also trying to create communal tension, he said. He alleged that an attempt was made by an individual to disturb a pro-CAA dharna by the BJP and allied parties at Gandhipuram on March 2, and the “casual approach” of the police to the issue had led to the assault on Mr. Anand.

Meanwhile, a Hindu Munnani spokesperson said Mr. Anand, who suffered a head injury in the attack, was scheduled to get discharged from hospital on Friday.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/petrol-bomb-hurled-at-coimbatore-mosque/article30994690.ece
207,2020/03/06,Muslim delegation calls on Kamal,"MNM leader praised for steadfastly opposing CAA

Representatives of various Muslim associations met actor and Makkal Needhi Maiam president Kamal Haasan at the party office on Thursday.

They thanked Mr. Haasan and his party for getting a case registered against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and appreciated the actor-turned-politician for steadfastly opposing the controversial citizenship law.

Acting on the instructions of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, members of the Malabar Muslim Association from Chennai also joined the delegation which met the actor.

Mr. Haasan told the delegation that he would continue to lend his support towards maintaining the unity and sovereignty of the country. While the protests against the citizenship law should be focused and strong, Mr. Haasan said everyone should remain vigilant and ensure that no space is created for violence.

Members of the delegation expressed their support for Mr. Haasan’s views and said they would cooperate with the actor and his party.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/muslim-delegation-calls-on-kamal/article30994681.ece
208,2020/03/06,"Stand-off between Kiran Bedi, Cabinet bad news for U.T.: HC","Judges hope the differences of opinion will be resolved amicably

The Madras High Court on Thursday expressed serious concern over a series of disagreements between the Council of Ministers and the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) of Puducherry Kiran Bedi resulting in many litigations before the court. The court said: “The repeated stand-off/acrimony between the said two high constitutional functionaries may not augur well for the governance of the Union Territory, especially the people.”

A Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha made the observations while dismissing a case filed by Local Administration Minister A. Namassivayam challenging the L-G’s decision to reject a decision taken by the Cabinet to appoint T.M. Balakrishnan as the State Election Commissioner and instead fill up the post through a selection committee by calling for applications from across the country.

Right decision

It held that the appointment of Mr. Balakrishnan was not in consonance with the rules and that there was nothing wrong in L-G’s decision to follow a transparent mechanism to fill up the post. However, observing that the Cabinet as well as the L-G must also be aware of the consequences of frequent disagreements between them, the judges said: “This court hopes and trusts that whatever be the reasons for the difference of opinion, they will be resolved amicably.”

The judges pointed out that Section 9A(1) of the Puducherry Village and Commune Panchayats Act of 1973 states that the superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of electoral rolls for the conduct of all elections to the panchayats shall be vested in the Election Commission consisting of an Election Commissioner to be appointed by the Administrator (L-G) and laid emphasis on the word Administrator used in the legislation.

Further, Section 9A(2) of the Act states that subject to the provisions of any law made by the Legislative Assembly of the Union Territory, the conditions of service and tenure of office of the Election Commissioner shall be such as the Administrator may by rule determine and pointed out that the appointment of Mr. Balakrishnan had not been approved by the L-G and therefore such appointment could not be sustained in law.

In so far as the L-G’s decision to constitute a selection committee headed by the Chief Secretary and invite applications for the post through an all India advertisement was concerned, the judges pointed out that her decision had been approved by the Union Home Ministry. They also held that the decision taken by the L-G was perfectly in consonance with the Constitutional and statutory provisions applicable to Puducherry.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/stand-off-between-kiran-bedi-cabinet-bad-news-for-ut-hc/article30994671.ece

Not a day passes by without road accidents, and most of them are caused because people ride their two-wheelers at break-neck speeds or without wearing helmets. Car drivers too have taken traffic rules lightly, speeding along, without wearing seat belts.

To create awareness among motorists about the importance of adhering to road safety rules, law enforcers have been taking strict action against those violating the Motor Vehicle rules, and a large number of cases have been registered against violators from the beginning of this month, in Vellore, Katpadi, and Bagayam. Checks are being conducted at signals and main thoroughfares such as Anna Road, National signal, Green signal, and near the Collector’s office.

Violators were advised by inspectors of police to adhere to traffic rules.

In a vehicle check near the Collectorate on Wednesday, 310 cases were booked by the police and ₹35,000 was collected as fine.

The Tamil Nadu government had asked the District Collectors to urgently take preventive measures, in the wake of 30 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country.

In a letter to the Collectors, Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam asked the officers to immediately convene a meeting with all private and government doctors.

In his address, Mr. Sivanarul said that there was no need for panic about COVID-19 in the district.

He said that there were a number of people from Alangayam, Vaniyambadi and Ambur staying abroad, and that they would be thoroughly screened when they land at the airport.

213,2020/03/06,"With Aadhaar-enabled system, now avail banking services at your doorstep","Awareness drive to demonstrate benefits of AePS conducted

People living in areas without banks or ATMs will no longer have to walk long distances to avail such services.

The Aadhaar-enabled Payment System (AePS) will come in handy for such residents in rural areas, especially for those in the hilly terrains.

To demonstrate the various benefits of AePS services to the general public, a special awareness drive was organised at the Vellore Head Post Office on Thursday.

Superintendent of post offices, Vellore division, P. Komalkumar, said, “AePS is a bank-led model which allows basic interoperable banking transactions at Points of Sale (PoS) (Micro ATM), through post offices, that will work as business correspondents of the India Posts Payments Bank, at no extra cost to the customer.” The services have been extended to all post offices in Vellore district, he said.

The benefits

The AePS payment method allows Aadhaar cardholders to make financial transactions through Aadhaar-based authentication.

The system facilitates disbursement of government entitlements, social security pensions and old age pension, among others, of State and Central government bodies, using Aadhaar authentication, as supported by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). AePS allows a bank customer to use Aadhaar as a verification of identity to access respective Aadhaar-enabled bank accounts and perform basic banking transactions like cash withdrawal, inter-bank fund transfer and balance enquiry. Cash deposit facilities will be linked with AePS soon.

Using AePS

To put the AePS system to use, a customer must first get to a post office or find a postman with an electronic device.

The customer can then provide his Aadhaar number, choose the type of transaction and provide verification through fingerprint. The customer must then confirm his transaction and collect payment. The receipt for the transaction will be sent to the registered mobile number through SMS.

Based on the demographic and biometric information of an individual, the system eliminates the threat of fraudulent and non-genuine activities.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/fl4jd6/article30994481.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6THAEPS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/with-aadhaar-enabled-system-now-avail-banking-services-at-your-doorstep/article30994482.ece

In a case of female infanticide, a 31-day-old baby girl was allegedly murdered by her parents and grandfather on Monday night in a village near Usilampatti in Madurai district.

Chekkanoorani police on Thursday arrested parents S. Vairamurugan, 37, and Sowmya, 22, and paternal grandfather S. Singam, 67, under various sections of the Indian Penal Code for murder, criminal conspiracy and tampering with evidence. Following a tip-off about the missing infant, the police had gone in search of the parents, but they were absconding, Usilampatti Deputy Superintendent of Police A. Raja said. However, the police managed to trace them.

“They have admitted to the crime and have been charged with murder,” Additional Superintendent of Police (Crime against Women and Children) S. Vanitha said.

The man worked in the fruit market at Simmakkal, Madurai city. His wife delivered the baby on January 31.

As the couple already had a three-year-old girl, Vairamurugan blamed his wife for giving birth to a second daughter, the police said.

The parents and the elderly man had administered a poisonous herbal juice to the infant on Monday.

Father and son had then buried the body.

An anonymous call to the police triggered the investigation and arrest of all three. The body of the child was exhumed by a medical team that performed a post-mortem under the supervision of Usilampatti tahsildar, said Revenue Divisional Officer (Usilampatti) K.V. Rajkumar.

Madurai District Collector T.G. Vinay said female infanticide, prevalent in the Usilampatti region in the past, had resurfaced after a long time. “If the parents do not want a female baby, they can always hand it over to the authorities at government hospitals and the babies will be taken care of under the Cradle Baby scheme,” he said. He added that the district administration was chalking out a plan of action for an awareness campaign in Usilampatti on the opportunities open for girls.

215,2020/03/06,‘Rapist teacher’ held in Wanaparthy,"Pvt. school teacher allegedly raped 11 minor girls since 2018

A 27-year-old private school teacher in Wanaparthy district was arrested for allegedly raping 11 minors girls since 2018.

Police said that all the victims who were aged 9 to 10 years were his students from a village in Gopalpet mandal.

The accused used to conduct coaching classes for students of Class IV who were aspiring to secure admission in the State-run Gurukul Residential Schools, a senior officer associated with the investigation said.

“At the time of coaching, the accused lured the girls by promising to provide better marks in the entrance exam for Gurukul schools and raped them in an inebriated condition,” he said.

He is a native of Telkapally mandal in Nagarkurnool district and moved to Gopalpet mandal for teaching. He was living at his aunty’s house and was teaching English to primary class students at a private school in the village.

“The coaching classes were conducted at his aunt’s house and he threatened the victims with dire consequences if they revealed the offence to anyone,” the officer said.

According to police, the offences came to light only on Thursday night when the grandparents of a student noticed bloodstains on her clothes and questioned her.

She narrated the whole incident to her family members and also informed them that one of her friends was also assaulted by the same teacher. Following this, the villagers ransacked the school, roughed up the accused, before handing him over the police.

“The teacher confessed that he raped 11 girls but don’t remember their names,” the officer said.

Based on the complaints lodged by parents of two girls, the accused was booked under Section 376 (punishment for rape), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with the intent to outrage her modesty) and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

217,2020/03/06,CAT reserves order on IPS officer’s suspension,"With the arguments concluding over suspension of senior IPS officer A.B. Venkateshwar Rao of Andhra Pradesh, the Central Administrative Tribunal-Hyderabad has reserved orders in the case on Friday.

Mr. Rao, who was suspended by AP government over allegations of unfair practices in procurement of security equipment, moved the CAT seeking to set aside the disciplinary action. A bench of CAT chairman Justice L. Narsimha Reddy and member B.V. Sudhakar heard contentions of Mr. Rao’s counsel Vidya Sagar for the past few days.

Former Advocate General of Telangana High Court and senior lawyer D. Prakash Reddy, who was engaged by AP government, appeared for the State. Mr. Reddy contended that the officer played crucial role in ensuring the tenders of purchasing drones were finalised in favour of a company headed by his son Chetan Sai Krishna.

Though the tender was eventually cancelled, Mr. Rao allegedly wrote a letter stating that the same company be awarded the contract. After conducting an inquiry, the government suspended the officer accusing him of violating the service rules.

Mr. Rao’s lawyer Vidya Sagar contended that AP government failed to comply with the rule that Centre should be informed of any disciplinary action taken against an All India Service officer within 48 hours. There could have been some delay in conveying to the Centre about the officer’s suspension due to holidays, the senior lawyer said.

Mr. Sagar argued that the government cannot unilaterally suspend an IPS officer over mere allegations. It should serve a notice to the officer concerned and only then action should be initiated, he said before the Tribunal.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/cat-reserves-order-on-ips-officers-suspension/article31003604.ece

219,2020/03/06,Governor’s speech painted a rosy picture of govt’s failures: Bhatti,"None of the important issues covered, says CLP leader

Terming the Governor’s speech as one nowhere near truth, CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka said the government had projected a rosy picture of a State suffering with failures and corruption.

Speaking to reporters after the CLP meeting, he said the government had not fulfilled even a single promise made during the elections. There is no clarity on the unemployment dole of ₹3,000 promised and also on the irrigation projects.

He said the government has been just repeating the same words on double bedroom houses for the last six years while it failed to transform into reality at the ground level. Governor’s report doesn’t mention anything about the podu lands and the funds meant for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

Mr. Bhatti charged that the Rythu Bandhu scheme meant for extending financial assistance to farmers before kharif and rabi have become weapons of elections as funds are released only during the elections time.

Congress MLA Komatireddy Rajgopal Reddy has yet again raised the issue of leadership of the Telangana Congress and claimed only the Komatireddy brothers have the ability to revive the party.

In an informal chat with reporters at the Assembly, he indicated that his brother and Bhongir MP Komatireddy Venkata Reddy should be made the president of Telangana Congress or else they would look for other alternatives. If the top post is not given to ‘them’, they may think of launching a new party or joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

He said Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao himself informed the members about the government’s willingness to take up a discussion on the issue and pass a resolution against CAA, NPR and NRC. The Congress and the AIMIM members also favoured it.

222,2020/03/06,HC reserves orders in PIL pleas on Secretariat demolition,"Decision taken without full information, argues counsel for a petitioner

Telangana High Court reserved orders in a batch of PIL petitions challenging government’s decision to demolish Secretariat building, with the ‘final hearing’ held consecutively for the past four days coming to an end on Friday.

Presenting her contentions, counsel for one of the petitioners, B. Rachna Reddy said Telangana State Cabinet had no complete information on the condition of Secretariat building when it decided on June 16, 2019 to demolish it. Only after the decision was questioned, the Cabinet constituted a technical committee of four engineers-in-chief and cited reasons for arriving at the decision of Secretariat demolition.

“This attracts the Wednesbury principle of unreasonableness. The Cabinet taking an important decision like demolition of Secretariat building without precise information or data is unreasonable and the court can intervene,” Ms. Rachna Reddy said. She told the Bench that Wednesbury principle of unreasonableness says that courts can intervene when the government had taken a decision not considering matters that lawfully must be considered.

‘Relevant matter’

Courts can also review if the government takes a decision by considering matters that are not relevant and if the decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable person would make it. Telangana Cabinet decided to demolish Secretariat building without considering the issues like soundness and durability of the buildings. The Cabinet eventually backed its decision by citing Technical Committee report which took into account irrelevant factors like parking space and wiring issues, she said. “Because of these two factors, naturally the decision becomes unreasonable and liable to be rejected by the court,” the lawyer argued.

Advocate General B.S. Prasad, recalling senior counsel S. Satyam Reddy’s earlier reference to Buckingham Palace in England, said that even Telangana government wants to build such an iconic structure after demolishing the existing Secretariat building. He said that Cabinet took the decision of Secretariat demolition “after discussing” the matter thoroughly.

According to him, there was no basis for the petitioners to attribute ‘mala fides’ to the Cabinet decision. But Ms. Rachna Reddy replied the petitioners never said government had any mala-fide intention “because the government itself did not have proper data as to why it decided to demolish Secretariat”.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/8u7rp4/article31004232.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY07HIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hc-reserves-orders-in-pil-pleas-on-secretariat-demolition/article31002736.ece
223,2020/03/06,Man drowns 3 daughters in village tank,"Fayaz was an alcoholic

A man addicted to alcohol and gambling allegedly killed his three daughters by pushing them into an irrigation tank at Tadkol village under Banswada police station limits of Kamareddy district on Friday.

Mohammed Fayaz allegedly pushed his three daughters Afia (10), Maheen (9) and Joya (7) into an irrigation tank in the village where they drowned. Fayaz married to Niloufer had five children, four daughters and a son. The youngest daughter was given away in adoption at an early age.

The couple were staying with three daughters and son. Fayaz used to have frequent quarrels with his wife over money to buy liquor.

Convincing the four children that he was taking them to attend a Kandur (function) at a local dargah, Fayaz took them to the irrigation tank with full of water. Suspecting his father’s behaviour, the son somehow managed to escape from the spot.

While Niloufer was searching for her three daughters, Fayaz appeared with wet clothes near the tank. Finding something amiss, she rushed to the tank where she found the footwear of her children on the bund. On hearing, Niloufer’s cry, people in the vicinity rushed to the tank and fished out the bodies.

Police rushed to the spot and took Fayaz into custody. The family members staged a dharna in front of the police station, demanding severe punishment to the accused. However, the police prevailed upon them to give up the agitation.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/man-drowns-3-daughters-in-village-tank/article31002605.ece
224,2020/03/06,Azad demands Revanth’s unconditional release,"TPCC demands enquiry into illegal constructions

The Congress mounted an attack on the State government for arresting its Member of Parliament A. Revanth Reddy for “exposing the illegal constructions” of the members of the ruling party in violation of GO 111.

Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said instead of taking action against the people involved in illegal constructions it was deplorable that a MP was arrested. “It only shows that there is a close nexus between the government and those involved in illegal constructions,” he said.

Mr. Azad deplored the high-handedness on part of the government and demanded Mr. Revanth Reddy’s immediate release and initiation of action against those involved in illegal construction.

Speaking to the media at the Assembly, Congress MLC. T. Jeevan Reddy sought an explanation from IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao, whether he constructed the building in violation of GO 111. He said it was for the first time in Indian independent history that a MP was arrested and put in jail.

Manthani MLA D. Sreedhar Babu said if the government had proof of Revanth’s involvement in using drones illegally it should make the evidence public. It was unfortunate that false cases were being foisted for settling political scores.

At a separate press conference, Bhongir MP Komatireddy Venkata Reddy, former MP Konda Vishweshwer Reddy and TPCC treasurer Gudur Narayan Reddy said arrest reflected the “revenge politics practised by the TRS”.

Mr. Venkata Reddy questioned as to how a MP be arrested when Parliament was in session and he would raise the issue in Parliament. He said Revanth was being targetted for exposing land scams of Rameshwar Rao, and asked why the government was silent on huge land scams in Miyapur and Kokapet worth thousands of crores.

Action was being taken if small farmers violate GO 111 but the same was not being applied to people close to the TRS leadership, he alleged and demanded a judicial inquiry into it. He said if Revanth and his brother indulged in irregularities in Gopanpally land action could be taken against them.

He said the drone cases foisted on Revanth were laughable and people were amused with the use of such laws. Konda Vishweshwer Reddy reminded that the Chief Minister himself assured several times that GO 111 would be scrapped. It should either be scrapped or the illegal constructions in the area be demolished, he demanded.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/6770oj/article31002653.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY07CONGRESSASSEMBLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/azad-demands-revanths-unconditional-release/article31002595.ece

227,2020/03/06,State to explore new avenues to improve revenue,"Economic challenges faced by country impacted State sources too, says Governor

The State government has decided to search for new avenues to better the revenue sources in the light of the severe economic challenges witnessed during the past several months.

Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan said the economic challenges faced by the country also had an impact on the State, but it was able to withstand the situation due to strong administrative policies and fiscal discipline. “The blink in the blind is that while other States are showing negative economic growth, Telangana is able to stick its neck out,” the Governor said.

The government had decided to pursue fiscal discipline due to the prevailing economic scenario in the country and it was committed to fulfil all the promises made to the people. “All the programmes and schemes will be continued,” she asserted.

The Governor elaborated on the spree of welfare and developmental programmes launched during the last six years, ever since the TRS government took over the reins, during her address to the joint session of the legislature marking the commencement of the budget session. During the close to 45-minute address, she said the State started its journey in 2014 with all sectors in dire straits due to the neglect meted out to it in the united State.

Difficult beginning

There were problems in the power supply situation and health and education sectors too collapsed. Farm sector in particular was in deep distress owing to various problems, including non-completion of pending irrigation projects and absence of timely supply of inputs like fertilisers and seeds. The government prepared short, medium and long term plans for the all-round development of the State after taking into consideration its resources, facilities, needs, advantages, disadvantages, strengths and weaknesses for revitalization and rejuvenation of the State.

“The achievements and success the State achieved in such a short span of time is being observed with admiration by the entire country,” she said. With a series of welfare programmes launched to provide minimum security of livelihoods to the poor, the State stood first among all other States in the welfare sector. Starting its journey with acute power shortages, Telangana registered spectacular and unprecedented accomplishments in power sector to become the State with highest per capita utilization of power.

Social indicators

“The peak demand in the united Andhra Pradesh stood at 13,162 MW whereas in Telangana it crossed that figure and the demand reached an all-time high of 13,168 MW,” she said adding this in itself was an evidentiary tall proof of “our glorious success” in power sector. On the agricultural front too, the State achieved significant increase in acreage of paddy cultivation in the summer crop. Against the paddy cultivation area of 17.08 lakh acres during summer, the progress made in irrigation sector ensured that paddy was grown in 38.19 lakh acres, marking an increase of 123.5%.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/4pj336/article31004379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy07budgetgov1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/state-to-explore-new-avenues-to-improve-revenue/article31002050.ece
228,2020/03/06,Govt firm on protecting unity and secular fabric of the State: Governor,"Governor’s speech does not make mention of CAA, NPR

The government would respect every religion and celebrate all festivals.

The development comes amid talk in the political circles that the government planned to introduce a resolution against CAA and announce its decision to stall works relating to NPR in the State.

She said that the government had installed 6 lakh CC cameras across the State which accounted for 66% of the CC cameras across the country. The Command Control Centre which was being constructed with international standards would be launched soon.

Referring to the industrial growth, she said the TS-iPASS, the single window policy for according all the requisite permissions for industry, already won accolades from across the world encouraging more industries to come to the State.

229,2020/03/06,Rythu Samanvaya Samitis to be renamed Rythu Bandhu Samitis,"Governor’s address to State Legislature talks of welfare programmes

The State government has decided to rechristen the Rythu Samanvaya Samitis (farmers’ coordination committees), constituted to organize farmers into a united and strong force as Rythu Bandhu Samitis (RBS).

The RBS would play a key role right from the time of sowing seeds to getting supportive price to the agriculture produce and an action plan in this regard would be chalked out soon, Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan said. The RBS conceived and implemented in the State provided ₹ 10,000 an acre investment support to farmers, it was now being replicated in several States as it had turned out to be a progressive turning point that would change the destiny of farmers.

The Governor was addressing the joint session of the Telangana Legislature marking the commencement of the budget session on Friday. She said the Rythu Bima, envisaging payment of ₹ 5 lakh each to families of farmers who die in harness, was not in existence in any other State across the country. This was in addition to the appointment of one extension officer each for every 5,000 acres and construction of Rythu Vedikas which were under process.

The government had resolved to reduce the age limit for old age pension from 65 years to 57 and all eligible persons attaining the age of 57 would be given Aasara pensions soon.

Dr. Soundararajan said the government could overcome the decades-old drinking water problem with the introduction of Mission Bhagiratha aimed at supplying safe and pure drinking water to all households. As many as 11 States undertook study of the project for replication in their respective States and NITI Ayog too had advised other States to follow the Telangana model.

On the Irrigation front, the world’s largest multi-staged lift irrigation project — Kaleshwaram — was under stage-wise completion and the fast track works going on there to lift 3 tmcft water a day from the ensuing monsoon were visible to all. Works on the Palamuru-Rangareddy project as well as Sammakka barrage works aimed at supplying water to Devadula throughout the year were also fast tracked.

The State made rapid strides on the public health front too with the creation of 40 dialysis units, 20 ICUs and 305 standardised labour rooms in government hospitals in addition to setting up of 20 new newborn care centres, six of which had already started functioning. After the Kanti Velugu programme for eye-screening, the government had decided to conduct ENT screening tests which would be followed by preparation of the State health profile.

The State had ushered in administrative reforms reorganizing districts and increasing the number of municipalities to take administration closer to people besides revamping the entire police department in a scientific way. New policies covering urban and rural areas had been introduced while the government enacted new legislations for making the functioning of the panchayats and municipalities more effective.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ibu2o0/article31003367.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy07budgetgov,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/rythu-samanvaya-samitis-to-be-renamed-rythu-bandhu-samitis/article31001839.ece

RAJANNA-SIRCILLA: The ancient and historic Sri Raja Rajeshwara Swamy Devasthanam in Vemulawada in Rajanna-Sircilla district which witnesses hordes of devotees otherwise looks deserted following rumours about the spread of COVID-19 in the State.

Following advisories urging people to avoid big gatherings to protect themselves from contracting the disease, pilgrims, mostly masses, have stopped visiting the Vemulawada temple, fearing they might catch the dreaded virus.

A fraction of the usual

Usually, the temple town witnesses around 30,000 to 50,000 devotees per day on normal days, and over one to two lakh devotees on weekends and holidays. Following rumours about COVID-19, their number had come down to less than 3,000 per day since Thursday. On Friday, considered an auspicious day, the devotees’ number had further dwindled to less than 2,000, and the temple wore a deserted look.

Sources said devotees, mostly masses were scared to visit the shrine where several thousands would arrive for the darshan and other rituals such as tying of an ox, following rumours obout COVID-19 spread. Besides, poor sanitation in the temple shrine since January due to arrival of hordes of devotees to the shrine on the eve of biennial Samakka-Sarakka Jatara, and the recently concluded Mahasivarathri Jatara too has made devotees put off their visit to the shrine.

Shrine not completely sanitised

Moreover, COBID-19 is likely to cast its impact on the ensuing five-day Sri Parvathi Rajarajeshwara Swamy Kalyanotsavam at Vemulawada from March 11 to 15 as well. Authorities, however, are making all arrangements for conducting the celestial wedding of the presiding deities.

The main celestial wedding of Lord Shiva with his consort Parvathi would be held on March 12. There would be several pujas and rituals at the temple shrine till March 15.

Locals have urged the district authorities to instruct the temple and Vemulawada municipal authorities to launch special sanitation drive in the temple town to avoid the spread of any diseases during the ensuing kalyanotsavams. They alleged that the authorities were yet to take up total sanitation in the town after the completion of the Mahasivarathri Jatara wherein several lakhs of devotees had visited the shrine.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/covid-19-impact-fewer-devotees-at-vemulawada/article31000446.ece
235,2020/03/06,KCR promises drinking water to Tamil Nadu,"Supply will be made from assured source in consultation with Andhra Pradesh, he tells a delegation of TN ministers and officers; briefs CM Jagan Mohan Reddy and seeks co-operation

Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has agreed to ensure supply of drinking water to Tamil Nadu from an assured source in consultation with his A.P. counterpart Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy.

The Chief Minister gave this assurance to a delegation of Ministers and officers from Tamil Nadu that called on him on Thursday. The Tamil Nadu Chief Minister could send a formal proposal in this regard to Telangana and A.P. Chief Ministers after which there could be officers’ and experts’ level meeting of the three States for preparing a report and taking the issue forward, said Mr. Rao.

Example of inter-State co-operation

Once the officers reach a consensus for taking a final decision, the exercise would become set an example of inter-State cooperation.

The Tamil Nadu delegation, according to an official release, comprised of Ministers S. P. Velumani and D. Jayakumar, accompanied by PWD secretary K. Manivasan and advisor M. Sheelapriya. Telangana Ministers K.T. Rama Rao, E. Dayakar Rao, and Vemula Prashanth Reddy, Chief Advisor Rajiv Sharma, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, and Irrigation Secretary Rajat Kumar represented the State during the discussions.

‘Adopt a benevolent attitude’

The Chief Minister stressed the need for the States to adopt ‘benevolent’ attitude when it came to catering to the drinking water needs of neighbours. He recalled how he had raised the drinking water problem faced by Tamil Nadu and other key issues several times at NITI Ayog meetings while the TRS MPs had raised the issue in the Parliament.

Mr. Rao said the whole country should feel “ashamed” for the suffering of Tamil Nadu people on the drinking water front at a time when the country had a surplus of 30,000 tmcft even after catering to the irrigation needs of all the States. Effective utilisation of 10,000 tmcft of water would ensure that there is no drinking water shortage across the country.

‘Understand TN’s dire water need’

The Chief Minister exhorted the Tamil Nadu delegation to evolve a special strategy to fight for their drinking water needs and this strategy should take priority over every other thing. The country should understand the dire need of Tamil Nadu people for drinking water, he said, adding persuasion and sincere efforts would yield good results.

Mr. Rao, according to an official release, contacted Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy over phone and briefed him on his meeting with the Tamil Nadu delegation and his in-principle consent to provide drinking water to Tamil Nadu.

According to sources, a team of ACB sleuths laid a trap and caught Shaik Saidulu, Sub-Treasury Officer, Divisional Sub-Treasury Officer, Bhadrachalam, and Senior Accountant Venkatesh.

The duo had demanded the bribe from B Narayana, a retired official of the Agriculture Department, to process the commutation and final pension payment of bills following which the latter approached the ACB.

Venkatesh allegedly collected the bribe from the complainant on the bank of the Godavari in the temple town on Thursday afternoon.

When he returned to the office, the ACB officials caught him with the amount.

237,2020/03/06,KLIP turns a bane for farmers of two villages,"Ryots not able to take up cultivation on 500 acres submerged by backwaters of Annaram barrage

Even as the Kaleshwaram lift irrigation project (KLIP) has rekindled hopes among the distressed farming community with the availability of water throughout the year, the same has become a bane for the farmers of two villages in Manthani mandal.

Farmers of Arenda and Mallaram villages in the mandal have not been able to take up cultivation for the past two years owing to submergence of their fields under the backwaters of the Annaram barrage. Annaram barrage was taken up as one of the three KLIP barrages between Medigadda and Yellampalli, the other two being Medigadda and Sundilla. From Medigadda barrage, the water is lifted through the Kannepalli pump house, making way for the water to flow through gravity into the Annaram barrage in Mahadevpur mandal.

The Annaram barrage was designed to store 11.9 tmcft of water and constructed to a height of 120 metres at pond level and 107 metres at bed level. It has 66 crest gates. The authorities have acquired about 1,200 acres of land for the project in Jayashankar-Bhupalapally, Peddapalli and Mancherial districts.

Not acquiring an additional 500 acres of land for the project is proving dear for farmers of Arenda and Mallaram villages with the submergence of their fields by backwaters. Instead of acquiring the land for the project on the pretext of huge cost of land acquisition, the officials have made two arrangements: they had dug a canal of 15 feet depth and 2-km length from Arenda village tank into Godavari river to divert the backwaters.

Similarly, they had diverted the water coming from Somanpalli village from Swaranapalli village into Manair river. The authorities had also constructed a protection wall to avoid submergence of fields at Annaram barrage, but in vain. Sunkari Mahesh, a farmer from Mallaram village, said that for last two years he had been unable to take up cultivation due to its submergence by backwaters of the Annaram barrage. “Before the Annaram barrage, we used to do cultivation by lifting water from Manair river. Now, I lost my source of living,” he said.

Paidakula Chandraiah blamed the irrigation officials for claiming that their fields would not be submerged. Now, because of their unscientific works, around 500 acres of fields had been submerged, denying livelihood to farmers, he said and demanded that the government include their land in submerged areas and give them compensation.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hj83lh/article30997766.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06HYPEDDAPALLI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/klip-turns-a-bane-for-farmers-of-two-villages/article30997767.ece
238,2020/03/06,State to take a call on private hospital COVID-19 charges,"Telangana government will dictate the prices that private hospitals can charge if they were to admit and treat a COVID-19 positive patient. Besides, they will also instruct the hospital the method of treating the patient.

Till Wednesday evening, suspects of COVID-9 were admitted only at Telangana government-run Gandhi Hospital, Musheerabad. However, Health Minister Eatala Rajender said on Wednesday that private hospitals which have isolation wards can admit the suspects.

A day after the announcement, the Health Minister said that they are allowed to treat provided they follow the government’s conditions on price slabs and treatment methods.

Besides, Director of Public Health Dr. G. Srinivas Rao issued an advisory to the private hospital’s managements on measures to be taken when someone with influenza-like symptoms walk into their hospital.

They were instructed to arrange separate counter for people who show influenza-like symptoms and have foreign travel history to COVID19 effected counties or had contact with person having the travel history.

At the separate counter, boards have to display which state ‘Counter for patients with influenza-like symptoms and travel history to effected countries or contact with those who travelled to effected countries.’

This is an important step as the index (first COVID positive) case from Telangana consulted doctors at a major corporate hospital on out-patient basis before he was diagnosed with the virus. The measure to have separate counters could help in avoiding such possibilities.

Complete details of such people have to be documented such as symptoms, travel history. They have to contact Gandhi Hospital's nodal officer for Coronavirus, Dr Prabhakar Reddy, for further course of action.

Dr. Rao stated in the guidelines that the hospital may manage the suspects provided they have isolation wards which comply latest guidelines by the Union government.

The hospitals can collect samples from suspected cases, pack and send them to ICMR laboratory at Gandhi Hospital.

Further, the hospital managements were instructed to train their doctors, health workers to prevent transmission.

241,2020/03/06,Rutuja continues fine form,"Sania-Ankita duo delivers against Korea.

Ankita Raina shared the first two sets against En Shuai Liang in the second rubber after Rutuja Bhosale had provided a winning start for India against Chinese Taipei in the Fed Cup Asia-Oceania group-1 league match on Friday.

The 160th-ranked Ankita got off to a flying start, taking the first set 6-3 after leading 5-1 at one stage. However, the 19-year-old Taipei girl, ranked 205th in the world, fought back to clinch the second 6-2.

Digging deep

Earlier, Rutuja had to dig deep, saving three match points from 2-4 and 4-5 in the decider before winning a battle of wits against the 15-year-old left-hander, Ya Yi Yang, in two hours and 44 minutes.

The 23-year-old Rutuja, a former Asian junior champion, converted her second match point in the tie-break for a 6-3, 3-6, 7-6(6) victory.

It was the third win on the trot for the 433rd ranked Rutuja, who had earlier won her matches against Uzbekistan and Korea, after having put up a good show against world No.35 Shuai Zhang in the first tie against top seed China.

On Thursday, India had to depend on Sania Mirza and Ankita Raina in the doubles to clinch the tie against Korea.

After Rutuja had won and Ankita had lost, former World No. 1 in doubles, Sania Mirza, stepped on court for the first time. In the company of Ankita, she won 6-4, 6-4 against Han Na-Lae and Kim Na Ri.

242,2020/03/06,Judoist Sarita Chaurey’s drive to win,"How Sarita Chourey, a visually impaired judoist, started to get serious about Judo

Sarita Chourey, 21, wakes up at 5:30 every morning to train for an hour before heading out to class at Mata Jijabai Government Girls P.G. College, Indore. In the evening, she trains for another hour — a regular feature in the life of any sportsperson, except, Sarita has been blind from birth, and her two older sisters, Jyoti and Pooja are visually impaired too. While Sarita won a bronze at the 2019 Commonwealth Judo Championship for the visually impaired in the U.K. last year, her sisters, who inspired her, are also judoists and national bronze medalists.

The daughter of a labourer father and homemaker mother from Hoshangabad, M.P., Sarita is the fourth among six children. In school she enjoyed dancing, singing, running and judo, but she wanted to take up sport seriously.

Sightsavers India, an NGO that works for those with visual impairment, organises training in judo and self-defense, and it is through them that she started: “I learnt self-defense under the Sightsavers’ social inclusion programme in 2017,” recalls Sarita, adding that this made her realise she wanted to take up judo to the next level.

“With judo I can be [in]dependent and always protect myself,” she says. After she won her first bronze medal in the 44 kg juniors category at the 2018 National Blind and Para Judo Championships (NBPJC), she says, “People motivated me, saying they wanted me to keep winning medals.” She went on to win a silver in the 28 kg category in the same event last year.

Instructors use both physical touch and sound during training. “First they speak and then teach me practically to grip the person and throw them,” says Sarita. “In practice sessions, the coach just calls out the name of the throws and my partner and I perform them.”

Her coach Bhagwan Das, who is the General Secretary of the Madhya Pradesh Blind and Para Judo Championship, says that learning a sport “requires a lot of stamina, skill, hard work, focus and willpower — and Sarita has all these qualities.”

In her second year of B.A. now, Sarita hopes to get a government job once she completes the programme. “People appreciate that I am doing well. They say, ‘We want to do the same.’ I just advise [them] to keep working hard, no matter what field they choose,” she says. Currently, she is working towards the 2020 NBPJC and dreams of qualifying for the 2024 Paris Olympics.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/9uqjyn/article31000187.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sarita-1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/sarita-chourey-a-visually-impaired-judoist-takes-judo-seriously/article31000189.ece
243,2020/03/06,Celebrating Delhi’s cultural diversity,"The latest edition of “Words In The Garden” paid tribute to stalwarts who enriched Delhi’s art and culture over the years

Defining and describing a metropolis on the basis of its skyscrapers, multiplexes, malls, sports stadia is never complete. The city’s true character and uniqueness is reflected through its music, literature, visual arts, dance, poetry, performing arts, theatre, etc. This is what the fourth edition of Words In The Garden, held last week, brought to the fore. The annual festival was curated by noted Hindi poet-critic, Ashok Vajpeyi. “The objective was to honour the incredible creativity, imagination and ideas that Delhi, generates, sustains and embodies,” observed Vajpeyi.

Ashok Vajpeyi

The festival hit the right note as it started with an informative and insightful documentary “Ram Kumar: Nostalgic Longing” by Laurent Bregeat. Recalling how he was fascinated by art, artist Ram Kumar, narrates his initial classes under Sailoz Mukherjee, keeping his writing and painting in tandem and going to Paris to learn art from Fernand Leger and Andre Lhote. Later, he returned to India to start with figurative paintings and then moved to abstract. “Kumar, lived and worked in Delhi and being one of the leading lights of art in the Capital, we decided to feature this documentary,” said Vajpeyi.

The screening was followed by an invigorating session “The Many Layers – History and Culture”.

The panellists included Vajpeyi, Pavan K. Varma, Sohail Hashmi, S.Y. Quraishi and Rajiv Sethi. The discussion centred on how Delhi has emerged as India’s cultural hub with its own unique culture -- a delightful mix of the traditional and the contemporary and a true reflection of India as a whole. Quraishi, whose family has lived in Delhi for 500 years, said, for over thousands of years the city had welcomed people, and even made invaders, settle down here.

Reminiscing about the Capital, Sethi, a noted cultural impresario, fondly talked about Connaught Place’s green cover and Janmashtami celebrations at the Lakshmi Narayan Mandir. He said the city ingrained in him the love for art and theatre and also moulded his character. Lamenting the shrinking of Delhi’s cultural space, he remarked, “As compared to Delhi, Mexico City is teeming with more museums, thus ensuring its residents enjoy its culture and heritage.”

Making a pertinent observation, historian Hashmi said: “All cities are made by migrants. What makes Delhi special is that it never discriminates on the basis of language. It, rather, welcomes all.” He cited the examples of Mir Muhammad Taqi Mir and Mirza Ghalib, both from Agra, who made Delhi their home. He said the use of the word ‘bara’ as a prefix or suffix to name areas and monuments denotes the influence of Marathas. “Every city has layers, pertaining to its customs, food, language, which are added year after year. For example, the red chilli used in Mughlai food today was never part of the original cuisine.”

Varma, author and former diplomat, wondered, “Has the city got its own cultural vibrancy today?” Highlighting the people’s participation in culture, Varma said when Ghalib composed a couplet in the morning, the Old Delhi residents started reciting it by the evening. “In those days, culture was not elitist but popular with masses who enjoyed its finer nuances.” He added that unlike cities like London, Delhi didn’t patronise popular and classical arts equally. Varma asked for a change in the education system, to ensure rasikas are there to appreciate classical art and music. Hashmi added, that institutions needed to reinvent themselves, making them accessible to children.” “Museums should be made interactive, with lesser restrictions, in order to attract youngsters.”

Well known Kathak exponent Pandit Birju Maharaj, who joined the panel later, was honoured for his yeoman service to the dance form.

244,2020/03/06,The 61st National Exhibition of Art at the LKA is showcasing tapestry of talent,"From childhood memories to finding the animal within, here are five National Award winning works that hold your attention at the ongoing 61st National Exhibition of Art at the Lalit Kala Akademi

The 61st National Exhibition of Art of the Lalit Kala Akademi is showcasing a set of 283 works from different parts of the country. The exhibition follows the National Lalit Kala Akademi Awards given to 15 artists by President Ram Nath Kovind at the Rashtrapati Bhavan earlier their week. The works consist of drawings, paintings, mixed media, ceramics, sculptures, etchings, and woodcuts.

Amongst the works of winners, five works stood out for their degree of originality, their compositional control and their ingenuity of subjects chosen. While the compositions ranged from everyday realities to experiences and observations and memories, it is clear that personal choices and aesthetics enrich the language used by artists. The perception of reality differs from one person to another, but it is the perspective within and without that leads an artist to create a work that echoes the credibility of a living presence.

Drawings

Anoop Manzukhi Gopi’s untitled work

Trichur-born, Santiniketan-dweller Anoop Manzhuki Gopi’s charcoal on rice paper is a riveting drawing of a set of dried branches bundled together perhaps for fuel or even just to make a thatched roof. “ During the day, I walk around the little pathways and look at the remnants of the lifestyles of humble people,” says Gopi. “ I use charcoal on rice paper because it allows me to consider simultaneously the characteristics of the object I ‘ drawing, its textural qualities, and I also include the quality of surrounding light, the atmosphere and all that can only be expressed by drawing. I think of vanishing practices in these days of the great migration from city to city and try to capture simple rudiments that are engaging.”

Sculptures

Keshari Nandan Prasad’s ‘Kal Chakra’

Amongst sculptors, it is last year’s AIFACS award winner Keshari Nandan whose “Kaalchakra” made of stoneware is a modern-day testimony of tumultuous times we live in. Deliberate distortions in his wood-fired stoneware terracotta tinted creation speaks evocatively about karma as he sets us pondering about why and wherefore of the Purusha Prakriti principle that meant harmony and balance in the days of yore. Jaipur-based Keshari’s treatment of the sculptural stoneware is also a gentle reference to the beauty and power of stoneware as a medium in creating contemporary art pieces.

Kolkata artist Faruq Ahmed Haldar’s “Childhood” is a moving wooden sculpture of a poverty-stricken hungry little child trying to lick the remnants that he finds in a handi. The posture and expressive action both become the evocative emotion. “I was making a comment on the very memory of childhood that I saw on the street,” says Haldar, “at the end of the day it fills the onlooker with so much pain and pathos that we think of it long after we have witnessed it.”

Etchings and woodcut

Amongst the etchings and woodcuts, it is Solapur’s Tejaswani Narayan Sonawane who won the award for a self-portrait in a woodcut that finds bird and animal within. “I looked into the mirror and thought I am a cat, so I made the ears, I thought of a bird that can fly without any burden leaving everything behind. I think, as men and women according to our circumstances, we are both bird and animal.”

The second award-winning print maker is Vadodara’s Devendra Kumar Khare whose favourite artists are Albrecht Durer Francis Goya and Anupam Sud. Khare creates a stellar diptych in which he creates a sepia tone scene that speaks of surrealism as well as the incisive iconographic treatment of memories as metaphors that sift through time. “My etching is based on my teenage experiences,” says Khare. “I used the image of a bull to comment on the likeness of man and animal – just as the bull chews and regurgitates what it eats we too keep mulling over events that have happened in our lives and shapes our present. In the second part, I dealt with death because I remember my drawing teacher who died when I was young. I, now, realise that death is inevitable but at that time it was unsettling and deeply traumatic to lose a loved teacher.”

Ultimately, these five award winning artists portray the poignancy of personal practices honed on the hinges of art education.

245,2020/03/06,Art teacher V Rajagopal on his recent work inspired by Thirukkural couplets,"Art teacher V Rajagopal on his work at Thriukkural Koodam, Chennai that was inspired by the ancient text

A lotus bud rises from a pond in the foreground and a meditative figure sits in Padmasana in the background — this painting by artist V Rajagopal captures the essence of the Thirukkural couplet ‘Vellaththanaiya Malar Neetam Manthartham Ullath Thanaiyathu Uyarvu’ from Ookamudaimai. “The couplet says that as one rises in stature, he must make himself worthy of it with noble thoughts. You can infer many meanings,” explains Rajagopal. One’s ideas and thoughts should eventually lead to good deeds. “I have kept the blue skies as the background to show that the concepts are universal.”

Rajagopal is just back from Chennai where he received an award from the International Institute of Tamil Studies. His painting, a panel of four couplets, now graces the walls of Thriukkural Koodam, an exhibition hall in Chennai.

The artist is not new to using Thirukkural couplets as inspiration. He did so in miniature form back in the 80s. “I came up with figurative work for 100 Thriukkural couplets. The 35 mm discarded film strips were my canvas. Through this contest, I revisited my earlier days.” The panel work also features a wounded elephant. This, derived from the couplet ‘Sidhaivitaththu Olkaar Uravor Pudhaiyampir Pattuppaa-toondrung Kaliru’. “The elephant’s body is pierced by an arrow and there is blood oozing from it. But that doesn’t deter the elephant. It is just to show that a strong-willed mind never falters in adverse situation. I have used a grey background to express calm and discipline which are essential to get out of difficult times.”

Another segment shows deep sea pearl-hunting. “They dive several hundred feet under water to harvest pearls and conches. They have to take risks but they do so for a livelihood. The couplet ‘Ulluva Thellam Uyarvullal Matradhu Thallinum Thallamai Neerthu’, captures this. It urges one to set big goals driven by noble purpose.”

Notable works Flute Player - which he painted at the Brahma Kumaris Shantivan at Mount Abu in Rajasthan as part of a National painting contest and workshop where 250 professional artists from all over India painted on the theme of unity, peace and prosperity. He used a human abstract form to represent the flute player

Triveni Sangamam at an artist get together organised by Allahabad Museum and Nav Aakar International Artist Group

Rajagopal displayed a series on Shiva, at an exhibition at the Kumbh Mela organised by the South Zone Cultural Centre.“I completed most of the paintings during the three day train journey,” he recalls.

Over 60 of his paintings including landscapes, portraits, and miniatures of wild animals were displayed recently at the Karnataka Chithre Santhe, Bengaluru

A tiger roars at an elephant on the panel, and the artist points out how even though the elephant is bigger and has sharp tusks, it still fears the tiger’s attack. Size and positions is not always the deciding factor. Thiruvalluvar's couple that starts with 'Pariyadhu Koorngottadhu Aayinum...’ conveys this message.

Rajagopal, who retired as the art teacher at Government High School in Devarayapuram, has taught art for over three decades and feels the need for proper training in art with more art camps. He says an understanding of not just the colours but also the subject one choose to paint adds value to the work. He is inspired by the works of many artists like artist Manian Selvan (illustration), Trotsky Marudhu ( for the beauty of movement in his illustration, animation, and realism) Adhimoolam (line drawing, colours, ad contemporary work) Chandru (for his comparative works on Indian and European art sculptures), Dr. Alphonso (cubic art forms), and Dr. Sirpi Jeyaram (charcoal work and line drawings). “I taught art to my students with whatever material was available to them. They drew birds, tigers, and elephants, or gave shape to tribal and folk art forms. They also experimented with terracotta, geometric designs, animation art ( 2D and 3 D)...” Rajagopal hopes that art is given a prominent place in curriculum. “It makes students observe and think. Art also filters stress and anger.”",art,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/c35rhp/article31000759.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAJAGOPAL2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/art-teacher-v-rajagopal-on-his-recent-work-inspired-by-thirukkural-couplets/article31000760.ece

Age is just a number

When Andhra University’s Fine Arts department invited applications for a certificate course in painting, 39-year-old Roja Sanchana decided to go for it. Though throughout her life she had been sketching and doodling her thoughts, the idea to take it up as a profession never occurred to her before.“I got married at a young age, got busy with my home and children,” she says. But once her kids grew up, she decided to enrol for the six-month course, “as I thought I could manage the home and the classes easily,” she says.

“During the course, I realised how much I loved spending time with the canvas and experimenting with the colours,” says Roja and she just kept on till she earned a Masters in Fine Arts. Roja also holds a degree in Sociology.

The course also led her to sculpting. “I enjoyed painting, but there is something about sculpting that excites me,” she says. With a Bachelors in Painting, Roja went on to do her Masters in Sculpting.

“Those were the best days, I spent all my time doing something I really loved. So if you have a passion for something, pursue it and see how happy your life turns out to be,” she says.

Roja has displayed her work in over 20 exhibitions. Most of her works have an underlying theme of spirituality that encourages the viewers to look within themselves. She is currently gearing up for an art workshop in Guntur where she will teach the participants basics of sculpting.

Growing up Sharmla Karri loved her dance classes. A trained Kuchipudi dancer, she learnt from the renowned Vempati Chinna Satyam. While she did toy with the idea of taking up dance as a career, she discovered that her true calling was in art.

The Seethammadhara-based artist took up painting professionally five years ago. “I believe I got the gene from my mother as she loved painting too. I gifted my friends and family members hand-painted gifts and that received a lot of appreciation. People started asking me where I purchased them from! That is when I thought of taking it up professionally,” she says. Sharmla spent a lot of time poring over techniques of the masters and studying more contemporary methods of art. “I adored the works of Raja Ravi Verma. He had such an eye for detailing. I read a lot of books about art and honed my skills watching YouTube videos,” says the self-taught artist.

“Colours fascinate me and so do humans. Having people in a painting adds a touch of realism to my work,” she says. Most of her paintings have a feminine figure in them and while it is not a deliberate choice, she believes that women are more sensitive and display emotions more readily. Her latest painting ‘Meenakshi’ will be exhibited at the upcoming Art Revolution Taipei in August this year. “Meenakshi is the goddess of the fisher folk and in Sanskrit, it the one with eyes shaped like fish. The 'Meenakshi' series, through the bright and brilliant eyes of a young girl, tries to convey that there is divinity in living harmoniously with Nature,” says Sharmla.

Sitting in her studio in Akkayapalem, Divya Chinni remembers her drawing teacher at school. “He would tell me how there was a painting of an apple that was so detailed that it looked real. Ever since then it has been my goal to paint objects so meticulously that they are as good as real ones.”

The artist who a student of Andhra University’s Fine Arts Department specialises in object drawings. “I love bringing to canvas objects that no one would otherwise bother with . But when painted, these mundane objects elicit appreciation,” she says pointing at a painting of two teacups and a kettle that she calls, ‘Hot couple’.

Her childhood dream of being a teacher came true when she taught art and craft at the Sanskruti Global School in Visakhapatnam for two years after completing her Bachelor in Fine Arts. “While working there I realised that I wanted to study further and learn all about painting, so I completed my Master in Fine Arts and am now planning to do a PhD. Since then I have been a full-time artist,” she says.

In 2019, her painting titled ‘Reflections of Traditions’ was displayed at the Art Revolution Taipei in Taiwan. The painting shows a utensil shop with several cauldrons, pots and buckets. The beauty of the painting lies in the detailed reflection on the surface of the vessels. “I have always been a keen observer. Be it objects or people, I love to notice the tiny things that make them special,” she smiles.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/these-women-artists-prove-that-no-dream-is-too-big/article31000213.ece
247,2020/03/06,Art classes by Crafts Council of Andhra Pradesh are heralding a change in government-run schools in Visakhapatnam,"The centuries old craft of Cheriyal keeps schoolchildren enthralled at a workshop organised by the Visakhapatnam-chapter of Craft Council of Andhra Pradesh

It is an unusual day for artist Shravan Kumar. Generally, he is busy chasing deadlines to complete orders for Cheriyal Masks, but today he is in a classroom with over 70 children of the in a classroom at the Thota Garuvu Zilla Parishad High School in Arilova gazing solemnly at him as he explains the history of his craft.

“I come from a family that has been practising this art form for a century now. I learnt the ropes from my father who in turn learnt it from his father. We come from a village, called Cheriyal in Telangana’s Warangal district where this craft has flourished for over 400 years,” he says and holds up a brightly-painted mask for the students to see.

Shravan and his father, Nageshwar Dhanalakota have been invited by the Crafts Council of Andhra Pradesh. The Visakhapatnam-chapter of the council is conducting craft classes in five Zilla Parishad schools under their initiative Krishna Kamalam Praveenya Vikasam. This initiative introduces students to traditional artforms. So far they have learnt about Etikoppa toys, bamboo basket-weaving, natural dyeing, and soap making.

Crafts Council hopes to resurrect interest in crafts that were an intrinsic part of Indian culture. “Learning should never be restricted to just academics. Children should be exposed to art and craft from an early age. These workshops is to tell children that there is so much more to learn beyond their books,” says Ammaji Rayudu, joint secretary of the council.

Shravan Kumar and Nageshwar Dhanalakota during the session

Shravan the fifth-generation artisan begins by telling the children the raw materials needed to make the mask. “Our forefathers were smart, they understood the importance of preserving nature and used everything that was sustainable and eco-friendly. The masks are made using a sticky paste made of tamarind seeds and sawdust. These are then shaped into different faces and left to dry after which they are painted using natural colours,” explains Sharvan who completed his engineering but chose to take up the family profession. As Shravan speaks, his father moulds lumps of tamarind and sawdust paste into faces of farmers and characters from the epics. “Traditionally, these masks were used as props by the ancestors who travelled to cities reciting stories from Mahabharata and Ramayana. Apart from masks, they also painted scrolls that were used as a visual aid to go with the ballads. Today, adapting to the changing times, many artisan families are making keychains and wall art,” explains Nageshwar who has been practising the art for over 40 years. Children watch in awe as the masks take shape. P Soumya is seeing a Cheriyal mask for the first time and is enthused. She says“They look so colourful and bright. My friends and I have decided to make one ourself. Of course, we do not have tamarind paste and sawdust so we have planned to use clay and paint them with watercolours. I hope it looks as good as theirs.”",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/uy4wtz/article31000088.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sharvan-Kumar,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/art-classes-by-crafts-council-of-andhra-pradesh-are-heralding-a-change-in-goverment-run/article31000092.ece
248,2020/03/06,A collaborative effort,"Several music institutions across the city put up a united front to celebrate the works of Tumu Narasimha Dasu commemorating his birth anniversary

In a first of its kind initiative, drawing several music institutions in Hyderabad under one roof to celebrate the works of veteran Telugu poet Tumu Narasimha Dasu (originally Tumu Lakshmi Narasimha Dasu), Vagdevi Cultural Association and Saraswathi Sangeetha Nritya Sikshanalayam had organised a concert in the premises of Potti Sree Ramulu University recently. Till several years ago, the annual event to commemorate the birth anniversary of the poet had been quite restrictive in its reach. In what promises to be a regular series from now, each of the musical schools participating in the event was allocated to perform two songs each (rendered mostly by the students).

Music researcher, vocalist Y Ramaprabha gave the best possible start to the event, throwing light on Tumu Narasimha Dasu, the person and how his identity reflected through his literary works. She had particularly mentioned about the conversations the poet supposedly had with Lord Rama, which later found its way through his numbers.

Discussing how the ‘pancha chamara seva’ held every day at the Bhadrachalam temple (before the deity is put to sleep) was his brainchild after witnessing a similar seva at a temple in Sri Rangam, the singer had elaborated on the poet’s prowess with the kanjira too. He’s credited to have invented a new talam (julva), created new ragams like Konda Malahari to name a few as well. The focus on his kirtanas that also mentioned about danta dhavanam (cleaning one’s teeth) where he had named Rama as a ‘Danti Rakshaka’ (one who guards our teeth) created an element of intrigue.

The performances began with students from Saraswathi Sangeetha Nritya Sikshanalayam rendering Meluko Sugunalavala, a kirtana to awaken Lord Rama, as he is addressed through various names. In another innovatively lyricised kirtana, Nee Momu sung by the budding vocalists, the poet talks of how he feels richer by merely seeing the face of the Almighty. The pleasantness in the compositions was largely due to the tunes too, that have been standardised over the years.

With the performances from students of Durgabhai Deshmukh College to that of Swara Sahitya Gaana Kuteer, Vageswari Music School, Seetaramam Music Circle, Sammohana School for Vocal Music and Keerthana Institute of Music, the audiences were treated to an expansive lineup of songs that explored bhakti in various contours – through tattvas, metaphors and lullaby-like compositions intended to cajole the God before he calls it a day. Chinmayuni Padambujamulu, Aparadhinaparadhini, Niddura Pucchare were among the imaginatively structured and composed works of the poet that were sung in the event. The mangalam number (Jaya Mangalam) composed by Kamala Ramani was the icing on the cake.

The singing wasn’t always consistent, though the event’s purpose was noble enough. There was more to it beyond the music too. Composer and singer Nemani Parthasarathy at the event recollected an instance where the descendant of the poet (Krishnaveni Tumu) had introduced him to Tumu Narasimha Dasu’s works. He took to the stage to also announce the release of a music project as a composer, where veteran playback singer S P Balasubramanyam had given commentary to a series of 62 kirtanas of the poet. Another singer Pratima Sasidhar had highlighted the need for a standard notation of Tumu Narasimha Dasu’s kirtanas that most music students could refer to, alike Annamayya and Ramadasu.

Besides a well-informed anchor (Sirisha) who got her homework behind the event right, piquing the interest of the audiences about the poet, the presence of instrumentalists Vijay Kumar Acharya and Ogirala Guru Prasad on the tabla and keyboard ensured a strong musical foundation to the concert.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/laqqre/article30997726.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf06Parthasarathyjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/tumu-narasimha-dasu-vagdevi-cultural-association-saraswathi-sangeetha-nritya-sikshanalayam/article30997731.ece

250,2020/03/06,"Foreign tourists turned away by hotels in Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh","Travel operators seek urgent help from authorities over COVID-19 fallout

Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, travel operators on Friday sent an SOS to the government after hotels in Rajasthan, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh started turning away or demanding medical certificates from tourists hailing from Italy, South Korea, Japan etc. despite them having confirmed group bookings.

Indian Association of Travel Operators (IATO) sought urgent help from the authorities as hotels in Udaipur started directing bus loads of tourists to Maharana Bhupal Government Hospital saying that check-in would be allowed only on the basis of a medical certificate from doctors there.

These tourists were forced to stand in a queue at the hospital from 10 a.m. till way after sunset and many missed their sightseeing activity plans for Friday as a result. In Agra, tourists were refused entry in star hotels, after the district authorities warned that the hotels would be sealed if any positive case of COVID-19 was detected among tourists staying there.

“It has come to our notice through our members in various States that District Magistrates of some districts of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab were giving instruction to the hotels to “not to allow foreign tourists to stay in their hotel even if they are being medically verified with no symptoms of coronavirus,” IATO said.

“No such orders are being given in writing but verbal instructions are being given to the hotels by District Magistrates, that foreign tourists should not be allowed to check–in at the hotel. Also instructions are being that foreign tourists who are checked-in, are to be confined in the hotel till they complete 14 days from the date of their arrival in India or leave the State immediately otherwise tourists will face the consequences of forced quarantine, especially Italian nationals even if they have arrived before the visa restrictions were made and they were permitted to enter our country on valid visa,” IATO president Pronob Sarkar said. IATO has 300 members and most have been affected by this issue.

Letter to Health Minister

In a letter to Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare Dr. Harsh Vardhan and top officials of the Ministry of Tourism, IATO said that there was total damage and India Tourism was getting extremely bad impact and negative publicity which would have long term negative impact on foreign tourist arrivals to our country.

“This will result in loss of lakhs of jobs in tourism and hospitality industry and negative impact on the economy of our country,” Mr. Sarkar said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/6bjj4j/article31004196.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE06-TOURIST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/foreign-tourists-turned-away-by-hotels-in-rajasthan-punjab-uttar-pradesh/article31004197.ece
251,2020/03/06,CBI trying to subvert course of justice: Amarinder Singh,"‘Review plea a dilatory tactic in Bargari sacrilege case’

Taking exception to the Central Bureau of Investigation’s review petition on the Bargari sacrilege case of 2015, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday charged the central agency of trying to subvert the course of justice at the behest of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).

The Chief Minister described the move as a delaying tactic, aimed at scuttling the probe into the Bargari case, which the State government had decided to hand over to the Special Investigative Team (SIT) of Punjab Police through a resolution in the Vidhan Sabha in August 2018.

Capt. Amarinder said the CBI has intimated the Special Judicial Magistrate at SAS Nagar (Mohali) of its intent to file a review petition in the Supreme Court for review of its order dated February 20, by which the apex court had dismissed the central agency’s Special Leave Petitions on the ground of delay, while leaving open the question of law.

‘Akalis involved’

“Not only is the CBI’s decision to move a review petition a blatant attempt to delay the investigation further, it is a clear endorsement of the Akali involvement in the incident, which had shaken Punjab back in 2015,” the Chief Minister said. “With this action, the Akalis had clearly proved their involvement in the entire ugly affair,” he added.

Pointing out that the then SAD-BJP government had entrusted the probe into three cases filed in the matter to the CBI in November 2015, Capt. Amarinder pointed out that the agency had failed to make any headway in its investigation all these years – a fact duly noted and recorded by the court during hearings in the matter.

“The entire drama of filing closure report, refusing to give copy of the same to the State government, then taking a U-turn on it after nearly two months, was enacted by the CBI on the directions of the Akalis, who did not want the truth in the matter to come out,” said the Chief Minister.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/uhzq5z/article31004189.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE06-AMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cbi-trying-to-subvert-course-of-justice-cm/article31004190.ece
252,2020/03/06,‘Rescued’ M.P. MLAs deny BJP coercion,"Four of the six Madhya Pradesh MLAs, reportedly rescued from a Manesar hotel on Wednesday by senior Congress leaders, said they had returned of their own accord and were not offered bribes to cross over nor held hostage by BJP leaders.

BSP’s Sanjeev Singh Kushwah and Rambai Parihar, SP’s Rajesh Shukla and Congressman Aidal Singh Kansana have rubbished claims of Ministers Jaivardhan Singh and Jitu Patwari that they had to be urgently brought back since they were forcibly taken to the hotel.

Patheria MLA, Ms. Parihar, clarified that she went on her own to her daughter’s house, and had met the BJP leader at the airport.

“Politicians meet each other often, what’s wrong in that? There has been no coercion, we are not children,” she said.

Mr. Singh on Monday had accused BJP leaders of luring MLAs with the Congress government with crores of rupees to cross over, in an attempt to destabilise the regime.

Terming the charge of an attempt to being bought over “a lie”, she added, “There was no such deal or manhandling. The two Ministers must be asked to reveal the truth. We returned of our own accord.”

Denying that he’d received any offer from the BJP, Mr. Kushwah, Bhind MLA, said the BSP legislators in the State had been heeding its chief Mayawati’s direction of supporting the government from outside since its formation. “But today, some Ministers are making such remarks, that they should refrain from, only to gain traction. This will only hurt the Congress and Kamal Nath,” he said.

Stating that this was an attempt by two-four Ministers, who sought the spotlight, to tarnish his image, he added, “If you have rescued us, come out in the open informing everyone how it was done. I have gone to New Delhi several times, but have I been rescued each time? The government is safe and will complete it’s five year tenure. Kamal Nath is a great Chief Minister”.

“We were not kidnapped. We are not that weak,” said Rajesh Shukla, who represents Bijawar. “I spoke to Mr. Nath six times on the night of our supposed rescue, so how could we be held hostage? MLAs are competent enough, no one can take them anywhere. My phone was not off even for a single minute.”

Calling upon Ministers to refrain from such claims as it made the MLAs seem weaker, he said, “What response will we give to the people of our region? The Ministers are disrespecting us. And if they claim we were held hostage, they should prove that.”

Meanwhile, Mr. Kansana, fourth-time MLA from Sumawali, stated that he had not gone missing. “No one is that powerful enough to take me away against my will. My daughter-in-law is admitted at a hospital in New Delhi and I went to see her. I was staying at the Madhya Pradesh Bhavan, so how could I be missing? And why would BJP offer me anything as I belong to the Congress. I was not at the hotel, and no Minister brought me back.”

253,2020/03/06,Coronavirus | Alarm in Assam as US tourist tests positive in Bhutan,"He spent 7 days in State and tested positive after reaching Bhutan

A 76-year-old tourist from the United States tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) in Bhutan on Thursday night, triggering alarm in Assam where he spent a considerable time before visiting the Himalayan country.

The Bhutan government confirmed the COVID-19 case on Friday morning.

The Prime Minister’s Office in capital Thimphu said the man and his 59-year-old partner reached the country from the Paro International Airport after boarding a Drukair flight from Guwahati on March 2. Of the 10 passengers in the flight, eight were Indian nationals.

Thimphu also informed New Delhi that the U.S. tourist toured India from February 21 to March 1 after starting his travel from Washington DC on February 18.

“At the Paro International Airport, the patient’s health declaration form was assessed. He had indicated ‘negative’ against all conditions. He did not have any sign of fever,” a statement issued by the Bhutan government said. The tourist, however, visited the Jigme Dorji Wangchuk National Referral Hospital around 3 p.m. upon reaching Thimphu, complaining of bloated abdomen and nausea. He was suffering from chronic hypertension but did not show any flu symptoms.

He went to the hospital again on March 3 with an upset stomach and diarrhoea, the statement said. He returned from a trip to the country’s Punakha and visited the hospital for the third time on March 5 with “fever, sore throat, cough and shortness of breath”.

He tested positive for COVID-19 after being kept under observation at a designated flu clinic.

Went on cruise

Assam has particularly been alarmed by the itinerary of the U.S. couple conveyed by the Centre. The two had spent much of their time in Assam and had gone on a seven-day Brahmaputra river cruise that included a stay at a resort in the Kaziranga National Park.

“There were two other foreigners with the U.S. couple on the ship that sailed on February 24 with 35 crew members, none of whom showed any signs of infection. The other two foreigners returned to their country. The ship was fumigated once the group checked out and the new group of 22 foreigners checked in to start sailing on March 1,” said Sanjay Basu, who heads the firm that runs the cruise Mahabahu in collaboration with the Assam Tourism Development Corporation.

He added that the cruise has a paramedic and an Assam government medical team would be checking everyone on board at the next stop.

The Supreme Court Friday extended till March 16 protection from arrest granted to civil rights activists Gautam Navlakha and Anand Teltumbde in the Bhima Koregaon case.

A Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Indira Banerjee said it would hear on March 16, the appeals filed by Navlakha and Teltumbde against the last month’s order of the Bombay High Court rejecting their anticipatory bail pleas.

The High Court, while denying the anticipatory bail to Navlakha and Teltumbde on February 14, had extended the interim protection from arrest for a period of four weeks to enable them to approach the apex court.

Appearing for the activists, senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Singhvi informed the Bench that protection granted to both of them by the High Court would expire on March 14 and the top court should extend it.

The Bombay High Court had on February 14 refused to grant anticipatory bail to Navlakha and Teltumbde, saying “prima facie evidence shows complicity of both the accused in the case”.

The court, after perusing letters allegedly exchanged between the accused persons had noted that Navlakha, Teltumbde and the other accused persons like Surendra Gadling, Rona Wilson and Sudha Bharadwaj had direct access and connections with central committee members and leaders of CPI (Maoist).

“It was revealed during the course of investigation that Anand Teltumbde was recipient of funds from the banned terrorist organisation,” the court had said.

Navlakha, Teltumbde and several other activists have been booked by the Pune Police for their alleged Maoist links and several other charges following the violence at Koregaon Bhima village in Pune district on January 1, 2018.

According to Pune Police, “inflammatory” speeches and “provocative” statements made at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017 had triggered caste violence at Koregaon Bhima the next day. The police alleged that the conclave was backed by Maoists.

Teltumbde and Navlakha had approached the High Court seeking pre-arrest bail in November last year after a sessions court in Pune rejected their pleas.

256,2020/03/06,Arunachal seeks pilot projects to stop migration of people living near China border,"Depopulation in border villages posing a security threat, MLAs say

GUWAHATI

The Arunachal Pradesh government has sought pilot development projects to stop people living along its international borders, specifically with China, from migrating to faraway urban centres in the State.

Some MLAs representing the border constituencies said depopulation in border villages was posing a security threat, echoing former Chief Minister Kalikho Pul’s contention that foreign armies would find it easy to occupy vacant villages.

Arunachal Pradesh shares a 1,080-km border with China, 440 km with Myanmar and 160 km with Bhutan. Twenty of the State’s 60 Assembly constituencies touch the international borders, 13 of them with China.

Discussing the issue in the Assembly on Thursday, Chief Minister Pema Khandu agreed people were migrating from the border villages but said depopulation in such areas was an exception and not the norm.

“Possible facilities are being provided to border villagers under the Border Area Development Programmes are being equally distributed to the border districts and it is for the elected representatives to ensure that the funds are utilised properly,” he said.

Mr Khandu, however, said the issue was serious and advocated selection of 10 census towns along the India-China border as pilot projects for infrastructure development so that people can be dissuaded from migrating for livelihood.

He informed the House that the State government has proposed a special package of ₹4.60 crore to the Union Home Ministry for development of infrastructure in the border areas.

“The proposal has cleared the ministry’s vetting and is pending with the Union Cabinet. Once it is cleared, the border areas will be developed with all amenities so that migration can be stopped,” the Chief Minister said and promised to pursue the matter with the Centre on his next visit to Delhi.

The migration issue was raised by BJP’s Koloriang legislator Lokam Tassar. He said there were several cases of intrusion by people from Tibet across the McMahon Line – the boundary between India and China – into his constituency bordering China. “The government should take steps to make our people go back to their villages by providing basic amenities,” he said, adding that this would go a long way in ensuring vacant villages are not occupied.

The then Tribal Affairs Minister, Kalikho Pul, in October 2014 warned of a “Kargil-like situation” if border residents were not provided basic amenities and incentives to stay back and “guard the borders”.

As the Union Home Minister, Rajnath Singh in May 2017 expressed concern over migration of people from border areas. He called residents of border areas “strategic assets” and directed the State governments and paramilitary forces to carry out welfare activities for them.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rcjgqo/article30999049.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIACHINA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/arunachal-seeks-pilot-projects-to-stop-migration-of-people-living-near-china-border/article30999050.ece

258,2020/03/06,Son of MP Congress MLA files ‘missing person’ complaint with police,"Bisahulal Singh is among four legislators suspected to have been taken to Bengaluru by the BJP

The Bhopal police on Thursday registered a ‘missing person’ complaint over Congress MLA Bisahulal Singh, who was among the four legislators suspected to have been taken to Bengaluru by the BJP on Wednesday morning and has been incommunicado.

The complaint was filed by Mr. Singh’s son, said Sai Krishna S. Thota, Bhopal South Superintendent of Police.

In the complaint, the son had mentioned that the legislator from Anuppur had been missing since March 2, and his mobile phone was switched off, said Sanjeev Kumar Chauksery, TT Nagar Police Station incharge. “Mr. Singh didn’t tell the family where he was going,” he added.

The police were yet to trace the four-time legislator and former Minister, believed to be ferried along with two Congress and an independent MLA by the BJP from a hotel in Manesar to Bengaluru. On Wednesday morning, the Madhya Pradesh Congress “rescued” six MLA from the hotel, purportedly thwarting the BJP’s bid to buy over its MLAs to destabilise the Kamal Nath government.

Congress MP and former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh, while maintaining the government was stable, had said that Bisahulal Singh had told him that he was being taken by the BJP against his wish. “Still, he told me he was with us.”

Mr. Singh had earlier said the BJP was luring its MLAs with ₹25-35 crore to cross over, in a bid to topple the Congress regime.

Although the Congress had reassured voters that its leaders were in touch with the four estranged MLAs and the situation was under control, MLA from Suwasra Hardeep Singh Dang on Thursday night tendered his resignation as a legislator, yet to be received by the Speaker, claiming the Cabinet Minister ignored his region’s development and his appeals to the Chief Minister went unheeded.

Besides the two MLAs, Surendra Singh Shera, an independent legislator from Burhanpur, and Raghuraj Singh Kansana, a Congress MLA from Morena, are still believed to be in Bengaluru.

With the Assembly strength at 228 (two seats vacant after the deaths of MLAs), the majority mark stands at 115. While the Congress holds 114 seats, and enjoys the support of four independent, two BSP and an SP MLA, the BJP holds 107 seats.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/son-of-mp-congress-mla-files-missing-person-complaint-with-police/article30998404.ece
259,2020/03/06,"Now, police banners in Lucknow show anti-CAA protesters accused of violence","They have been asked to pay for damage to public and private property within a stipulated time or have their properties seized.

The police have put up several hoardings across Lucknow identifying those accused of violence during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in December last.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused are listed in the hoardings, triggering those named fear for their safety.

They have been asked to pay for the damage to public and private property within a stipulated time or have their properties seized by the district administration. The total damage listed in the hoardings amount to ₹1.55 crore.

As many as 57 persons have been identified in separate hoardings that have come up in the Hazratganj, Thakurganj, Hasanganj and Qaiserbagh police station areas.

One of them, with 28 names, put up at the prominent Hazratganj intersection, next to the statue of B.R. Ambedkar, asks them to pay up over ₹64 lakh.

Those served notices in this hoarding include retired IPS officer S.R Darapuri, lawyer and activist Mohammad Shoaib, Congress member Sadaf Jafar, teacher Robin Verma, cultural activist Deepak Kabir and Dalit activist Pawan Rao Ambedkar.

It is not clear why the Lucknow police and administration publicised the names of the people served notices as they had been issued notices by magistrates and asked to pay the amount within 30 days or face confiscation of their properties.

Many of the accused were granted bail by court in the charges against them.

They had said they would challenge in court the notices issued to them.

Ms.Jafar said her name came up on a day when she had got a stay on her property attachment notice. She is seeking legal help once again.

“We are exposed to mob lynching now,” she said, expressing a fear that the public display of her face and address could jeopardise the safety of her children and herself.

“Just came back from Hazratganj, saw people clicking pictures of us closely. They are trying to break us by exposing us to humiliation and danger...But this only strengthens my grit to fight it legally as well as constitutionally “ said the single mother of two.

'A ploy of govt?'

Mr. Kabir wondered if the hoardings were a ploy of the government to “create fear among people”. While on the one hand it served notices for damage to public and private property, on the other it was spending on putting up these hoardings, he said. Like others he had also received the notice in jail itself and claimed that this was a step to “put pressure” on them.

“What is the government's intention? Does it want to create fear among people because it is willing to spend more money on such things”, he asked.

He also asked if the government had ever before put out hoardings of those accused of rape, murder or financial fraud. “We are not even history-sheeters”, he said.

Mr. Darapuri said the hoardings were an illegal act and the administration had no right to put them up under any law. Revealing their personal information had “exposed” them in an illegal manner among the common public. “Yes we are accused but we are not convicted. This was done to dishonour us and to make targets of us”.

The legality of the competent authority to issue notices for damage during public demonstration was being heard in the Supreme Court. He also pointed out that in a similar case from Kanpur, the Allahabad High Court recently put a stay on the recovery notice issued against an accused.

“I have written to the Home Secretary, the DGP, the Commissioner and the DM, informing them that their act istotally illegal and has created a big threat to our lives, property and freedom,” he said. The government would be responsible for any untoward incident. He would approach the High Court against the hoardings, he added.

Minister defends action

State Cabinet minister and government spokesperson Siddharth Nath Singh, however, defended the Lucknow administration action of puuting up the hoardings.

“#UP Name and Shame of rioters will put a deterrent under Yogi rule which is as per the law of the land”, he said . “Those screaming r habitual to b on the wrong side & wish not to differentiate between ‘Recovery and Conviction’,” he said on Twitter.

Akilesh statement

Samajwadi Party Akhilesh Yadav, in a statement issued through party spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary, said the hoardings and posters labelling people as criminals without any “daleel and vakeel” cannot be considered “moral” in any way.

“With freedom to do such acts, the BJP government can harass anyone and anywhere”, Mr. Chaudhary said. He accused the BJP of being the face of Indian politics that considered its “dharma to put fear into democracy.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/m79z6j/article30998200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bannerjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/up-police-put-up-hoardings-identifying-anti-caa-protesters-accused-of-violence/article30998121.ece

A fight among children belonging to two families took such an ugly turn that the father of one of the children bit off a woman’s finger and poked a sharp-edged weapon into her husband’s eye.

“The incident occurred on Wednesday when children of two families got involved in a fight. Their parents intervened and one of the parents then started abusing the other couple – Vijendra and Anita,” said Ravindra Singh, Station House Officer (SHO), Amroha Nagar police station.

During the argument, the accused attacked Anita and inserted a sharp object into her husband Vijendra’s eye.

261,2020/03/06,CAA may impact Assam Rajya Sabha polls,"Elections to three Rajya Sabha seats in Assam on March 26 could turn out to be a tussle between those for and against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The 126-member Assam Assembly has an effective strength of 124 after the death of two MLAs.

With 86 legislators, the BJP and its allies are confident of winning two of the three seats to be vacated by Bhubaneswar Kalita, Sanjay Sinh and Biswajit Daimary in April.

Both Mr. Kalita and Dr. Sinh quit the Congress and joined the BJP last year. Mr. Daimary belongs to the Bodoland People’s Front, one of BJP’s two regional allies.

The Opposition comprising the Congress with 23 MLAs and perfume baron Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) with 14 MLAs can bag the third seat only if they field a consensus candidate and there is cross-voting.

The Congress and the AIUDF, formed in 2005 after the Supreme Court scrapped the allegedly pro-foreigners Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act of 1983, have hardly been on the same page.

But the anti-CAA stand is expected to bring the two parties together for the Rajya Sabha elections, where the value attached to the votes of the MLAs decides the winner. The two parties have been scouting for an vocal anti-CAA activist.

“The equation is such that the two parties have to come together to make space in a constricting political atmosphere created by the present divisive dispensation,” Congress leader Apurba Bhattacharjee told The Hindu.

AIUDF legislator Aminul Islam agreed. He said the anti-CAA agitation in Assam has given the two parties a reason to zero in on a consensus candidate. “We are looking for someone who can raise the burning issues of Assam in Parliament,” he added.

The names of the CAA critics doing the rounds include jailed peasant leader Akhil Gogoi, film-maker Jahnu Barua, actor Barasha Rani Bishoya, journalist Ajit Kumar Bhuyan and Assamese media mogul Jayanta Baruah.

Mr Barua, however, said he was not interested in joining politics or contesting elections.

The possible tie-up between the Congress and AIUDF for the Rajya Sabha election has given the BJP a stick to beat the Congress with, particularly because former Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi has often labelled Mr Ajmal’s party as BJP’s “B-team.”

“Seven generations of people in Assam will not forgive anyone who gets elected to the Upper House of Parliament with the help of AIUDF. Such a candidate will come across as someone who opposed the CAA only to get a Rajya Sabha berth,” Finance and Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.

The BJP has been projecting the AIUDF as a party catering to illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, who could rule Assam one day if the indigenous people do not make the “right political choice.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/caa-may-impact-assam-rajya-sabha-polls/article30995125.ece

While Delhi-NCR is grappling with the COVID-19 scare, with one case of COVID-19 reported from Ghaziabad on Thursday, neighbouring Meerut is reeling under the effect of H1N1 influenza, popularly known as swine flu.

According to Meerut district officials, 8 people have died and 86 cases of H1N1 have been reported in the city, including 21 constables of Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC). “One more case of a female RAF constable has come to light. Out of 21 PAC constables, 20 have been discharged after treatment,” said Dr. Raj Kumar, Chief Medical Officer.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Kumar denied the charge that the rise in number of cases is due to lack of isolation wards in hospitals. “We are fully prepared. 114 beds have been earmarked in different hospitals for the patients of swine flu. It is a seasonal outbreak. The cases will subside as the temperature will increase. Last year, we had 380 cases of swine flu,” he said.

On the cause of deaths, Mr. Kumar said in all cases the patients were suffering from other ailments as well. “Swine flu becomes fatal when the patient’s immunity level is low,” he said.

Besides, swine flu, he said, awareness is also being spread about the COVID-19 infection. “No case of coronavirus has been reported from Meerut so far.

263,2020/03/06,"‘Why no action in Narada, chit fund scams in Bengal?’","Political consideration stopping Centre, allege Left, Congress leaders

Raising the Narada sting videos and the chit fund scam, Leader of the Left Legislature Party in the West Bengal Assembly Sujan Chakraborty and Leader of the Opposition Abdul Mannan on Thursday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking why “sanction has not been accorded to” the Central investigation agencies to prosecute MPs allegedly involved in them.

“From 2014 onwards, whenever you had come to West Bengal you told the public that no one would be spared if found guilty in the scams and the Central government would act at the earliest,” the letter signed by Mr. Chakraborty of the CPI(M) and Mr. Mannan of the Congress said referring to Mr. Modi’s public speeches in the State.

‘CBI awaiting sanction’

Both the leaders alleged that a “political consideration is stopping the Union government from giving sanction to the Central agencies”.

They referred to media reports that the Central Bureau of Investigation has been waiting for a long time for sanction to proceed against accused Members of Parliament, bureaucrats and bank officials.

“Incidentally, it is also observed that the Parliamentary Ethics Committee has maintained silence in this regard for over four years,” the letter said.

The letter assumes significance as the Left and the Congress have been alleging a “tacit understanding” between the BJP and the Trinamool Congress in Bengal.

Both the Opposition parties have been raising questions about the tardy pace of investigation in the two scams in which names of several leaders of the ruling Trinamool Congress have surfaced.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/why-no-action-in-narada-chit-fund-scams-in-bengal/article30995362.ece

The car, which was seized on Tuesday night following a squabble between two parties, was located by its owner 140 km away from Lucknow in Lakhimpur Khiri district on Wednesday.

According to police, the policemen had gone to Lakhimpur Khiri in connection with a case in the 2018-model SUV.

“Efforts are being made to ensure that such acts by policemen do not take place in future,” the ACP said, adding that the SHO had been sent to the police lines.

When asked about action against the constables who accompanied the SHO, the ACP said they accompanied the officer on his orders.

The policemen, who were caught unawares, remained stranded inside the vehicle for over three hours after its owner located them in Lakhimpur Khiri district, almost 140 km away from Lucknow.

265,2020/03/06,‘Missing’ Congress MLA resigns from Madhya Pradesh Assembly,"My region’s development ignored, claims Hardeep Singh Dang

Congress MLA from Suwasra Hardeep Singh Dang, who was among the four reportedly missing MLAs believed to be ferried to Bengaluru by the BJP, on Thursday tendered his resignation as a legislator claiming the Cabinet Ministers ignored his region’s development and his complaints with the Chief Minister went unheeded.

Stating that he had heard the news of his resignation, Vidhan Sabha Speaker N.P. Prajapati pointed out that Mr. Dang had not tendered his resignation to him in person. Once he does so, the Speaker would take the appropriate step after considering it according to the rules.

Flagging that “middlemen and corrupt are sitting in the government”, Mr. Dang wrote in his letter, “I am being continuously ignored in the Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha region. And no Minister is willing to work. Even to get the smallest work of party workers done, I have to make repeated trips to Bhopal and still work is not done.”

“As a result,” he wrote, “development works like irrigation scheme, road construction, compensation in case of 100% damage to crops in floods, crop loan amount, bonus, self help groups, loan waiver, laptops to students, etc were not being completed.”

Mr. Dang claimed that on request for the development of his region, “several times it was said that there is dearth of budget. Whereas in the areas of Ministers and their acquaintances development works are carried out without any obstacles”.

He further wrote: “I consider myself a small man. My mistake has been that I have not been part of the Kamal Nath, the Digvijaya Singh or the Jyotiraditya Singh faction. I have been only with the Congress. That’s why I have had to face so many difficulties.”

Mr. Dang wrote that no one among the leaders listened to him despite several complaints.

267,2020/03/06,Pilot project brings 794 girls to schools,"Dropping out of school a challenge that needs to be tackled intelligently: experts

A pilot project on adolescent girls’ education, operative in Ajmer district’s Srinagar block, has brought 794 out-of-school girls to the formal system of education through admissions and enrolments during the last two years. The project succeeded with the activities such as door-to-door surveys, counselling, remedial classes and enrolment campaigns.

The project’s results were analysed at a stakeholders’ workshop at Rajasthan Praudh Shiksha Samiti here on Thursday. The mobilisation of rural communities in over 80 villages to bridge the gender gap in education, which broke down barriers for young girls, was identified as a major factor leading to the project’s success.

Civil society members, educational experts, government officials and activists said the girls’ dropout from schools, reported on a large scale in Rajasthan, was a serious challenge that should be tackled with an “intelligent planning” covering different aspects of education, including the infrastructure available in villages. According to an estimate, 55,000 girls below 19 years are out of schools in Rajasthan.

The project, started by “Educate Girls” group in 2017, has benefited young girls who face challenges of physical and emotional changes and often confront gender-based discrimination. Project leader Shabnam Aziz said while the girls were forced to drop out under pressure from their families, the boys of the same age were found to have opted out on their own.

In the rural and educationally backward areas, “Educate Girls” generated awareness among villagers through Ratri Chaupals, established advisory councils for leadership development and organised remedial classes and foundation courses as academic inputs. Ms. Aziz said 1,550 girls had been identified as the target group and 794 of them were enrolled.

Depending on the educational gap duration, the girls were enrolled either in the regular government schools or the Rajasthan State Open School (RSOS). The pilot project has optimally utilised the community and government resources while ensuring that the girls, once admitted, stay in school and learn well.

Asserting that his government would take all legislative and judicial remedies to protect the interests of the people, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday ordered the constitution of a committee to evolve a comprehensive strategy in the light of the High Court order relating to the demolition in the Chandigarh’s Sukhna Lake area.

“It was not viable to displace the tens of thousands of people living around the Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh,” said the Chief Minister, while chairing a high-level meeting to discuss the issue.

The Chief Minister asked Advocate General Atul Nanda to coordinate with his Haryana counterpart to ensure a formidable defence in response to the order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court to demolish constructions in the Sukhna Lake area.

Captain Amarinder Singh also directed the Chief Secretary to designate nodal officers from Forests and Local Government Departments to assist the AG Office to prepare the State’s response in the court, said an official spokesperson after the meeting.

The spokesperson said the committee set up by the Chief Minister will be headed by Chief Principal Secretary Suresh Kumar and Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister Tejveer Singh besides Anandpur Sahib MP Manish Tewari, MLAs Parminder Singh Pinki, Fatehjung Singh Bajwa, Kanwar Sandhu and Amandeep Singh as members.

Leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Assembly Tejashwi Yadav on Thursday reiterated that if his party comes to power, it will implement a domicile policy to give 90% reservation to local youths in government jobs and educational institutions.

His party, the RJD, also announced its new national executive committee, deleting the name of imprisoned former Siwan MP Mohd. Shahabuddin from the list.

“The present double engine government of Nitish Kumar must give employment to 7 crore youths of the State or be ready to face them… when the RJD will come to power we’ll implement the domicile police by giving 90% reservation to local youths in government jobs and educational institutions,” declared Mr. Yadav during his “Berojgari Hatao” (Remove Unemployment) yatra at Patori in Samastipur district.

Mr. Yadav also slammed the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government and said: “They [NDA] were saying it’s a double engine government but look at what is the condition of education in the Sate today… teachers are not getting salaries… schools are closed. The RJD will fight for the rights of teachers and improve the educational condition in the State.”

Earlier, the Bihar government had clarified that there was no need for extending reservation up to 90% for the local people.

“If we stop other people from getting jobs in our State, they will also follow the same… you [Tejashwi Yadav] give in writing which State is giving how much reservation to their local people, then we’ll consider it,” Energy Minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav had recently said in the State Assembly.

Three Congress MLAs and an independent legislator who were allegedly taken to Bengaluru by the BJP in an attempt to topple the Madhya Pradesh government will return soon, a State Minister said on Thursday.

The BJP has denied the Congress’ charge that the saffron party was trying to poach its MLAs in a bid to bring down the Kamal Nath government.

“We are in touch with our four MLAs and they will return home shortly,” Congress leader and Madhya Pradesh Minister Jaivardhan Singh told reporters.

Asked when they will return, he said, “It is upto their wishes.”

State Congress spokesperson Shobha Oza, meanwhile, said the “operation Kamal (actions of Chief Minister Kamal Nath) had triumphed over operation lotus (the alleged attempt by the BJP, whose symbol is lotus, to topple the government).”

‘No threat to govt.’

The crisis had blown over on Wednesday itself and there was no threat to the Congress government, she claimed.

Ms. Oza also denied that the four MLAs — Raghuraj Kansana, Hardeep Singh Dang and Bishulal Singh of the Congress and independent MLA Surendra Singh Shera — were unhappy with the State government.

Like the six other MLAs who returned to Bhopal after being holed up in a hotel in Haryana, these four legislators too will come back, she said.

None of the four MLAs could be contacted over phone.

Earlier in the day, the MLAs of the SP and BSP who came back to Bhopal on a special plane arranged by Congress leaders denied that they had been ‘abducted’ by BJP leaders.

While reaffirming support to the Congress government, the BSP MLAs Ram Bai and Sanjeev Singh Kushwaha and SP legislator Rajesh Shukla denied that any BJP leader had contacted them.

The 230-member Madhya Pradesh Assembly has 114 Congress MLAs followed by the BJP which has 107 members.

The mark for simple majority is 116. Four independents, two MLAs of the BSP and one of the SP provide crucial support to the Congress government.

The person who sustained stab wounds was identified as Sanidul Islam, 21, of Barpeta district in Assam. He was attacked at Mawkhar in the city.

East Khasi Hills district’s Superintendent of Police Claudia A. Lyngwa said he was stabbed in the stomach by two unidentified persons in the afternoon. “He was attacked in a lane as he was going to a shop where he works. He is now out of danger after treatment at a hospital,” she said.

Senior police officers said security forces were mounting round-the-clock vigil in the areas of Shillong that have a mixed population. The attack happened when the curfew in the vulnerable areas was relaxed for seven hours. It was preceded by miscreants stoning a car on the outskirts of the city.

On Thursday, the violence spread to the adjoining Ri-Bhoi district, with reports of minor clashes and an attempted torching of a vehicle after it was damaged.

272,2020/03/06,Over 70 foreign tourists have “entered Kashmir without screening”,"A senior official said they have a history of travel to China, Japan and South Korea

Over 70 foreign tourists, with history of travel to China, Japan and South Korea, have arrived in the Valley without any screening in the past two months.

A senior official said 50% of the foreign tourists who visited Kashmir from January to March (around 30) were of Chinese origin. “Most of these tourists visited different tourist destinations and were not subjected at any screening at the Srinagar airport,” a senior official told The Hindu.

As many as 23 tourists, who travelled from COVID-19-hit countries like Japan, South Korea and Iran, arrived in Kashmir in March and “most of them entered the Valley unscreened.” The number excludes students and traders who travelled to these countries and returned in the past two months.

People travelling to Srinagar complained that the health infrastructure to screen suspected cases at the airport was poor. “I and some 200 others were screened today [Wednesday] at the Srinagar airport on our arrival. A person at the desk asked for my boarding card, noted my name and mobile phone number on a note book and said ‘Go,’ ” said Abrar Ali.

Under surveillance

The J&K administration said 230 people who recently travelled abroad were under surveillance. Seven people who travelled to Coronavirus-hit countries have been quarantined — two in Jammu and five in Kashmir — in two separate hospitals after they showed COVID-19 like symptoms.

“Of the 230 persons under surveillance, 162 are in Kashmir Valley and the remaining are in Jammu,” said Dr. Shafkat Khan, a designated nodal officer.

Meanwhile, two tests conducted in Srinagar SKIMS hospital have turned out negative. “We are waiting for reports of three other patients,” an official said.

“UT of J&K is in a state of alert. The surveillance for this virus has been increased ever since the first advisory was issued by the Government of India on February 2,” Rohit Kansal, a government spokesman, said.

Divisional Commissioner, Kashmir, Baseer Khan said isolation wards have been earmarked in every district hospital, SKIMS and other health institutions in Kashmir.

Presiding over a high-level meeting called to review the arrangements to combat any exigency arising out of COVID-19, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh asked the Principal Secretary (Health), Anurag Aggarwal, to issue an advisory to educate people about the symptoms and precautions to be taken in view of the virus threat.

Captain Amarinder also asked the Chief Secretary to direct the Deputy Commissioners (DC) to instruct the field staff in their respective districts to assist the health department in its mass awareness campaign. The DCs should take active steps to avert a panic situation and to build confidence amongst the people.

The State Rapid Response Team comprises four senior doctors. Additionally, a control room has been established in each district with District Rapid Response teams to maintain a 24X7 vigil.

Health and Family Welfare Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said that currently, there were 5,795 persons in Punjab with travel histories to affected countries. As on Thursday, 13 persons were found symptomatic for COVID-19.

The situation, however, was under control, and the department was fully geared to tackle any exigency, said Mr. Sidhu, urging people not to panic.

Briefing the Chief Minister about the preparedness, Mr. Agarwal said 22 district hospitals and three government medical colleges had been identified to deal with emergency cases.

Isolation wards with 649 bed have been set up in these hospitals, and as many as 24 ventilators were made available, of which 14 were in district hospitals and 10 in government medical colleges, he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kuh2w3/article30994594.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AMARINDERSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/covid-19-punjab-govt-reviews-preparedness/article30994595.ece
274,2020/03/06,Pratibha Prahalad’s love for the Lord,"At a show organised in memory of Guru Kamla Devi Gangani, Bharatanatyam exponent Pratibha Prahalad testified her grip over the medium

Sonad Venu School organised a festival in memory of Guru Kamla Devi Gangani at the India Habitat Centre, this week. The event saw Bharatanatyam and Kathak performances by seasoned artistes.As is the custom, the young disciples of the school opened the show with a group invocation to lord Surya wherein they pictured the sunrise as the deity comes on his seven-horse drawn carriage. The nritta to swar bol was notable.

Pratibha Prahalad’s Bharatanatyam was the mainstay of the show. She took up a varnam and a padam from the customary repertoire. Going by the diverse audience of the Capital, her briefing in English on both the pieces was educative. The Bhairavi varnam “Mohamana” is quite a challenge for any dancer since the lyric is wrought with amorous innuendos, oscillating between explicit invitation to love and devotional praise.

Pratibha testified to her grip over the medium with her excellent abhinaya. Though the nritta part of the varnam was optimum, maintaining the mandatory three-cycle speed, etc, it was the expressive aspect of the piece that was handled with amazing artistry and maturity. There was no clinical trimming in depicting the erotic, yet there was not an iota of vulgarity either.

The starting viruttam (verse) extolling lord Shiva with exquisite postures was like a gesture to the devotional aspect underlying the varnam to come. The artiste in Pratibha was able to show the nayika (heroine) of this composition as an earthly soul pining for union with the supreme soul (God, here lord Shiva/Thyagesha). On the physical plane, she is a temple dancer who eschews a normal life and courts a symbolic wedded relationship to serve the deity within the sanctum. Hence her erotic feelings are to be viewed in a slightly exalted light. Portraying the arrival of a miffed beloved (lord Thaygesha), she made for a convincing picture of the pining nayika suddenly evincing pleasure at seeing Him, yet perplexed by his moodiness and all the time unable to shed her inherent charm and suggestive body language.

The slightly off-colour lord also incites mirth and concern to cajole Him back to normalcy so that both are pleased with each other! It was her expertise at shringara that came to the fore as the dancer displayed varying emotions with elan. The introduction of processional deity, a la Mallari, was picturesque. A love-lorn woman’s reference to Cupid and his flower arrows (Maran in Tamil), the wind (Maruta), the cuckoo bird pair as extraneous factors to trouble her, was shown with ringing clarity.

Her second piece, a bold and beautiful Telugu padam, garbed in sarcasm was also dealt with fine artistry. The song depicts a Krishna-beloved turning around and boldly spelling out ‘open secrets’ on the other known women who comment on her infidelities behind her back. She rips them down individually by revealing their secret paramours chastising them all the while. The graceful, swinging gait with which Pratibha enters was a pointer to the theme. Her surreptitious glances of a woman in prayer, the malicious questioning of another woman’s child’s legality, emulating behind-the-back scenario made for a lively interpretation of the song. However, Thanjavur Keshavan’s power-packed nattuvangam did not find a corresponding echo in the nritta.

An eulogy to Krsna, Guru Harish Gangani’s solo was marked by deft footwork and irresistible gestures. Be it abhinaya or show of intricate technicalities of Kathak, the artiste was grace and strength personified. His rigorous chakkars and racy footwork were amazing. The combinations and permutations within taal dhamar established his forte with footwork delineations and expressive dance. India Habitat Centre played host to the performances.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/4wo0y4/article31002023.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/img795,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/pratibha-prahalads-love-for-the-lord/article31002024.ece
275,2020/03/06,Prerana Shrimali: Creative images in a garden,"Kathak danseuse Prerana Shrimali aligned her body to the verse of Delhi poets

Delhi, the voice of India, recently, has become a postcard of ruptures. In popular history, the cityscape is believed to have been destroyed seven times and re-inhabited eight times. Each time, the tapestry of the city is embellished with a cultural layer, a process that continues to reflect its resilience.

Dilli ki Sanskriti (the Culture of Delhi) was the theme of the three-day festival - “Words in the Garden” co-hosted by Sanatan Sangeet Sanskriti and IILM University at the India International Centre.

Poetry in motion

Known for her command on expressing the most complex images through subtle body movements was Kathak danseuse Prerana Shrimali. She aligned her body to the magical voice of Imran Khan singing verse of Delhi poets - Amir Khusrau, Ghalib, Mir, and Daag. The lilting sounds of the sarangi by Ahsan Ali, sitar of Fateh Ali Khan and percussion rhythmical necromancy of Fateh Singh Gangani came together to enhance the audio experience of the works performed. The metaphor of colour danced to the slow tempo of Khusrau’s poetry evolved into a journey of created images such as the binding and blending reflected in fastened chains.

The topical symbolism ‘garden’ and ‘words’ in Ghalib’s ghazal ‘jahāñ terā naqsh-e-qadam dekhte haiñ, ḳhayābāñ ḳhayābāñ iram dekhte haiñ,” (I follow footprints meandering from one flower-bed to another only to map the garden of paradise) was woven for instance in the image of the innocence of a child walking the earth comprehending his existential reality.

The final piece engaged with words displaying a fascinating technical subversion. Shrimali chose to weave into a slow tempo Tarana, the poetry of Mir and Daag. Usually, the fast nonsensical syllables of the Tarana are sung to reflect the wizardry of rhythm in a song.

The dancer, instead, chose to present stillness to the pearl-like rendering of the musical weave. Shrimali was at her best in the manner she delved into image-making. She illustrated her command in marrying linguistic comprehension to the inherent Kathak dance language.

The artist’s awareness of her depth resonated with the universe of Words in the Garden. There was for the audience a luminous equilibrium to changing appearances releasing the essentials of the poetic words, written and performed.

Naya Theatre Group calls themselves the ‘Theatre of the Ordinary’. Under the directorship of actor Ram Chander, they carry on the work of Habib Tanvir’s Chattisgarh NatakAcademy. Presenting Rang Mandali, Ram Chandra Singh, as the brilliant sutradhar (narrator) with his talented troupe, sang and danced Habib’s creative and magnificent journey. The array of chosen classic compositions written and performed so many decades ago, ironically, brought the visible present reality without denaturing it.

Habib Tanvir’s spirit

Habib’s creative genius was once again on display in “Charandas Chor” (Charan, the Thief), a satire on brainless policemen. There was not one direct reference to the present yet Habib’s work was nothing but the reality of the present. The song of renunciation from the play “Dekh Rahe Hain Nain” (My eyes are seeing) echoed as the counterfoil anthem to Faiz Ahmed Faiz's poem “Hum Dekhenge” (We too shall Witness).

The song “Chola Maati ke Ram” from the play “Bahadur Kalarin”, which was adapted in the film “Peepli Live”, spoke of the ephemeral body. The body is of mud and will dissolve in the mud. Time spares no one. The dissolution of Guru Drona and the kind Karna is a reality test we tend to forget.

One after another Tanvir’s sartorial panache was reflected through plebian images, placing the ordinary man in the centre. Tanvir’s spirit rose through the performance capturing the inner man and outer time, sacred and mundane.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/5h62ut/article31001034.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BPW4717-copy,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/prerana-shrimali-creative-images-in-a-garden/article31001035.ece
276,2020/03/06,Is dance the kingdom of the nayikas?,"Dance is one place, you would believe, where the women rule. But seeing is not believing. While women occupy the stage, men control most of the backstage

The world of Bharatanatayam is dominated by women in its imagery, aesthetic value and presence. Women decked in the finest temple jewellery and makeup, draping silk with elan, move on and off stage like divas. The dancers who come perform or even just witness a performance carry a charm and air about them. The women here look powerful, intelligent, beautiful and exquisite. It is a woman dominated space as is clearly visible; but is it really? Beneath the glam and glitter that comes across, there are layers of hidden truths to what is visible which is both liberating andproblematic, all at once.

In the Bharatanatyam scene, a woman is both the muse and the creator. She does not dance to the tunes of somebody, but demands the tune to follow her dance. The stars and faces of Bharatanatyam are all very powerful women, and yet, when you study the history of dance and its texts, one cannot but wonder why is it documented by men, coded by men and full of texts and compositions penned by men? The heroine has always been pining and dancing either for her male god or lord! The history of art as we know of today is manipulated and all the contribution by women have been systematically erased upto a certain point in time. The families of hereditary dancers was matriarchal and the art was handed down generation to generation and performed by extremely knowledgeable and powerful women. It is impossible that they have nothing to attribute to the Shastra of dance. Most compositions too clearly have been written by women but credited to men, about which there is a lot of research going on. The “purification” and the “re-christening” took away a lot from this art form. Upper class women who occupied the arts scene took moral objection to its erotic content and edited it out to be showcased as a purely spiritual and devotional form.

The dancers are women yes, but there is always a clause, It is the upper class women mostly. For dancers from Lower caste or financial strata, to become popular dancers is no less than a miracle. The disparity is huge and clearly visible.

If for once we ignore the problematic equations in the dance community and just take the scene for what it is, that too is surprisingly deceptive. While women dance and own the platforms and have a huge fan following, it is the men who mostly operate the dynamics of the scene. The organisers, financiers are all men and they do not leave any leaf unturned to establish their dominance. They have to fight for a performance space evading harassment and objectification of their bodies. These women survive cruel body shaming and racist comments and still hold on strongly to the desire of performing. While some dancers are blessed with a good support system, for most women it's a lonely battle and a dexterous support building exercise. Along with their strict diets, stamina building, costumes, make up, jewellery and hours of dancing they have to handle domesticity as well.

The male dancers who pursue this dance also have a struggle of their own. They have to boldly embrace their feminine side or learn to be abashed of their choices. Invariably, the men in this art-form understand that struggles of gender better, whilst they fight away from being labelled as being too effeminate or too stiff. There is however a breath of fresh air with this current generation of dancers who refuse to conform to gender normative roles and believe in the fluidity of gender. This is one space, where men have to fight for equal space and opportunities.

The scene is definitely evolving and there is a lot of hope. Especially, from the young generation who do not fear asking questions and do not run away from taking stands. We can see today, a Rama Vaidyanathan who proudly shows the fraternity that a woman can convene a festival and make it the talk of the season, a Narthaki Nataraj who has taken her art to such great heights that nobody would even dare to think about the politics of gender when she is around, a Nrithya Pillai who daringly takes on the system with all her strength and speaks for the minorities in the dance field, an Anuradha Venkatraman who is unafraid to protest and take political stands through her art, an Anita Ratnam who can write eloquently and fearlessly about her opinions and hold a mirror to the dancing fraternity. There are a stream of young artistes who want to create content from a feministic point of view and build a new repertoire. Things are changing for the better and there is hope! If women stand by each other and make this an equal and healthy space, it can set a precedent.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/xcblhx/article30998651.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGF,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/is-dance-the-kingdom-of-the-nayikas/article30998657.ece
277,2020/03/06,‘I requested Karnataka team management to give Mayank one more opportunity when he was about to be dropped’,"Former chief selector M.S.K. Prasad looks back at an eventful tenure and sheds light on what the role entails

Mayank Agarwal is one of Indian cricket’s biggest success stories in recent years. That story might not have progressed beyond the first chapter if M.S.K. Prasad hadn't entered the plot.

An unbeaten triple hundred for Karnataka against Maharashtra in a Ranji Trophy match at Pune, in 2017-18, turned Agarwal 's career around. The opener was on the brink of being dropped for that match, though. In this interview, former national selection committee chairman Prasad reveals — for the first time — why he wasn't.

The former India wicketkeeper from Andhra also speaks about keeping an eye on every cricketer who showed promise on the domestic circuit, enjoying the challenges of the job and dealing with the criticism that came his way during his tenure, which ended with India's recent tour of New Zealand. Excerpts:

You must be happy with the way Mayank Agarwal has become an integral part of the Test team in no time. I was told that you had requested the Karnataka team management not to drop him from the Ranji team during the 2017-18 season…

He was the Man-of-the-Series in the triangular ‘A’ series held in Chennai in 2015 [involving India, Australia and South Africa]. I had been following him since then. After coming into the selection committee, I found that he was not included for the India-A tour of Australia in 2016. After doing a bit of research, I realised that because of one poor domestic season he had been dropped.

I talked to the coaches and administrators of the Karnataka State Cricket Association and requested them to back Mayank because he had it in him to make it big. The following season he started off poorly. He failed in the first two Ranji games [including a ‘pair’ against Hyderabad]. I came to know that he was about to be dropped.

I intervened and requested the team management to give him one more opportunity. They heeded my request and played him. And he got a triple hundred; he followed it up with more big hundreds. He ended up scoring more than 1,000 runs in just five weeks. He hasn't looked back since.

How do you look back at your tenure as the chief selector of one of the world’s most followed sports teams?

Cricket is a religion in our country. We live and breathe cricket here. Being associated with Indian cricket in any form is a matter of pride. Being at the helm of affairs in the selection committee was a huge honour. I would like to thank Anurag Thakur and Ajay Shirke [former BCCI president and secretary] for the confidence they had in me and their unconditional support.

When you took over as chief selector, what were the things that you wanted to change and how much were you able to achieve?

When we took over, our team was going through a transition period. There was a change of guard in the Test captaincy, from M.S. Dhoni to Virat Kohli. In the following year, there was also a change of guard in the ODI captaincy. We have successfully overseen these transition phases.

We also wanted to develop good bench strength. Fortunately, with the cooperation of the team management of the senior team, headed by Ravi Shastri, Kohli and others, and the India-A team, headed by Rahul Dravid, we could design a wonderful programme. And that has really helped the young bunch and eased them into the senior team from India-A. The way Prithvi Shaw, Mayank, Shreyas Iyer, Hanuma Vihari, Navdeep Saini and Shivam Dube began to perform right from the start of their international careers speaks volumes about the system that was put in place.

What are the things you enjoyed about being chairman?

I really enjoyed watching domestic cricket because that is where the future of Indian cricket lies. We, the members of the selection panel, have travelled for around 1,000 days during the last four years, across the length and breadth of the country. We played our part in unearthing new talent that has helped create a solid bench in all departments of the game and across all formats.

As a player, you did remarkably well to force your way into the Indian Test and ODI team despite playing for Andhra, not a traditional domestic powerhouse. How have things changed for cricketers from smaller centres?

During my day, the exposure for players coming from smaller states was relatively less compared to the bigger ones. But today, due to the robust domestic structure created by the BCCI and also due to the developments and emergence of modern communication systems, every performance across the country is recognised in no time. So there isn't much difference between teams big and small in domestic cricket.

Rajasthan, Railways, Gujarat and Vidarbha have shown the country that success in cricket is not limited to any particular state or city these days. When it comes to the national side, the representation is from across the country, and not limited to particular regions, which used to be the case earlier.

How tough is life as a wicketkeeper? Often keepers don’t get the credit they deserve…

Wicketkeeping is a thankless job and one of the toughest disciplines in the game of cricket. Unless one enjoys this art, one cannot become a good wicketkeeper.

Talking of keeping, how do you view Rishabh Pant and the criticism that has come his way?

All of us know that Rishabh has abundant talent. He is a match-winner, and that is a rare quality. Having identified that immense potential in him, we decided to back him. I have no two views about his batting abilities. The only thing is that he needs to work on his wicketkeeping skills, which now he really is concentrating on. With time he will keep getting better. We need to have patience with him.

Which selections are you particularly happy about, besides that of Mayank?

Prithvi, Vihari, Rishabh, Shreyas and Navdeep.

How do you look back at episodes of non-selections of some established players (like Ambati Rayudu for the World Cup in England last year)?

It’s really hard to put into words certain non-selections at times, especially when it comes to a country like India that has so much of talent. You can only pick 15 members in a squad. We go by the best combinations in the best interest of the country with a belief that we can get the best possible results.

How did you feel when some former cricketers questioned your credentials?

When criticism is constructive, it can be well received. But if it is done with ulterior motives, it can be ignored. For instance, if someone asks why a particular player is not selected, then they should also specify in whose place the player they are proposing has to be accommodated. Only then will there be substance to their arguments.

How helpful has the IPL been for selecting the senior Indian team?

The IPL is a wonderful platform that throws up fresh talents every year. Since it has the best players from across the globe, the performances are duly recognised. Having said that, we consider a player's performance at the IPL for selection only to the T20 squad.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/rggp8y/article31004050.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MSKPrasadArt2,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/i-requested-karnataka-team-management-to-give-mayank-one-more-opportunity-when-he-was-about-to-be-dropped/article31004051.ece

Cricket South Africa (CSA) on Friday issued a statement to dispel fears that the series may be called off due to the threat from Coronavirus.

Chartered flights

The CSA stated, “None of the playing venues — Dharamshala, Lucknow and Kolkata — have recorded positive cases and travel between these cities will be via chartered flights reducing the risk even further.

“The risks in Dubai and Delhi are considered low.”

Fully conscious

The CSA emphasised it was “fully conscious of the risks presented in regard to the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and has engaged in a formal risk assessment process to ensure the health and safety of and duty of care to our players and staff.

“This risk assessment is informed by information provided by international experts, the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC), the World Health Organisation (WHO), the South African Department of Health and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD),” said the statement.

CSA added, “We have also been liaising with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the South African Embassy in India and Indian security and risk experts.

“The government of India has also provided the necessary assurances.

279,2020/03/06,"Hardik, Bhuvi and Dhawan set for comeback","India’s three-match ODI home series against South Africa begins on March 12

Sunil Joshi’s first meeting as the selection committee chairman is likely to be more of an injury update as the selectors will take a stock of three sidelined players who have made a strong comeback this week during an invitational T20 tournament in Navi Mumbai.

Hardik Pandya, Shikhar Dhawan and Bhuvneshwar Kumar have all represented Reliance 1 in the D.Y. Patil T20 tournament which has emerged as a star-studded prelude to the Indian Premier League over the last decade.

With all the three having recovered from their respective injuries, they are set to be recalled into India’s ODI squad for the three-match series against South Africa, starting on March 12.

Inevitable

While Dhawan and Bhuvneshwar’s return is all but inevitable with Rohit Sharma injured and Mohammed Shami set to be rested, Hardik’s return will depend on the fitness update on his back. The rejigged selection panel is likely to test his fitness ahead of a rigorous IPL.

While Dhawan (shoulder injury) and Bhuvneshwar (hernia surgery) have been steadily getting back into their strides, Hardik has had a remarkable comeback. After scoring a 39-ball 101 and picking up five wickets in a match earlier in the week, the swashbuckling allrounder blasted a 58-ball 158 (6x4, 20x6) against Shreyas Iyer-led Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) on Friday.

280,2020/03/06,T20 World Cup: Shafali — the Viru of women’s cricket,"I realised that this kid, not even 12, was something special: coach Ashwani

Her bat-swing is the prominent feature of Shafali Verma’s presence at the crease. Off the field, it is her attitude towards cricket. When she combines them it becomes a lethal weapon. The bowlers suffer as this little dynamite wades into the attack, scattering the ball with a robust touch, peppering the stands with sixes.

In Rohtak, they come to watch her practice with the boys, leaving them stunned with her cricketing prowess. They call her the Viru (Sehwag) of women’s cricket.

Shafali’s coach, Ashwani Kumar, is a man of few words. He concentrates on giving his pupils the best of facilities at the Shri Ram Narain Cricket Coaching Centre with support from Neeraj Dahiya of the centre. “I remember Shafali as a puny kid coming with her father (Sanjeev) to learn cricket. There are no dedicated cricket academies for girls in Haryana and I agreed to take her in because she was so persistent,” recalled Ashwani, a former First Class cricketer.

Besting the boys

Shafali batted for 10 days and made a huge impression with her timing and power. “I pushed her into the camps for 14-16 age group and she created space for herself. Later, at an off-season camp, she joined boys in the 15-16 age group and I realised that this kid, not even 12, was something special. She was hitting the ball harder than some of the boys,” said Ashwani.

In the 2018-19 season, Shafali participated in almost all the age group tournaments and scored consistently. A visit to the National Cricket Academy (NCA) last June propelled Shafali up. Former India wicketkeeper Ajay Ratra saw her batting and lost no time in informing Ashwani that she was an “exceptional” hitter of the ball.

Made for T20

“Her hitting ability was different. I could sense she has a future. Her style may look raw, fearless, but she is made for T20. It is good that she doesn’t know the reputation of the opponents. Any ball in her range will be smashed,” said Ratra, who also played for Haryana.

Ashwani next put Shafali in the practice session with the Haryana Ranji team. “She was quick to adapt,” he remembered.

“I also kept her engaged as a wicketkeeper but it was her batting against the men that took the breath away.

Flamboyant

“She is flamboyant in her own way. Look at her cover-drive. It is from the book.”

Roped in as brand ambassador by Pepsi, the 16-year-old Shafali holds the key to India’s success in the ICC T20 World Cup where it is pitted against Australia in the final on Sunday.

“All I have told her is that she also needs to take ones and twos,” said Ashwani. The team, however, loves Shafali as the dashing opener who compulsively looks to belt the ball.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/isfpbz/article31003443.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07SHAFALI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/t20-world-cup-shafali-the-viru-of-womens-cricket/article31003444.ece
281,2020/03/06,T20 World Cup: Veda says it’s meant to be India,"First target of reaching final achieved, says ‘finisher’

Senior India batter Veda Krishnamurthy says her team seems destined to win the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in its maiden final appearance provided it keeps its nerve against four-time champion Australia here on Sunday.

Advantage

India will have the psychological advantage going into the final as it had stunned the defending champion by 17 runs in the tournament opener.

“It’s all about destiny, and I’m a big believer in destiny. I feel this is the way it was meant to be. There is a joke going around that this World Cup is made in such a way that it’s helping us, starting from the wickets to everything else,” she was quoted as saying by the tournament’s official website.

The Harmanpreet Kaur-led India reached the final on the basis of its unbeaten record after the semifinal against England was washed out on Thursday.

Veda, who was part of the Indian team that finished runner-up to England in the 2017 Women’s ODI World Cup, understands the pain of missing out on a world title. “Being in the final is just reward for the way we played in the group stages,” she said.

Having achieved the team’s first target of reaching the final, Veda said the Indians need to hold their nerve and remain focused on the big day.

“We said the first aim was to get to the final and take it from there. We’ve crossed the first stage. We need to make sure we hold our nerve and we do what we need to do on the final day,” she said.

India has a better recent record, with Harmanpreet’s outfit chasing down 173 in the recent tri-series and beating Australia by 17 runs in the World Cup opener.

But all’s not well for Veda on the personal front. She recovered from a series of single-digit scores in the tri-series to score 20 off 11 balls in a finishing role against Bangladesh.

Though she has just 35 runs from four matches, the Karnataka batter knows her role in the team.

“The role given to me has been very consistent in the last year. And, I’ve been supported by every individual — not just one or two. The entire team, with all the support staff have shown faith in me,” she said.

“I knew coming into the World Cup, I had the crucial role of finishing innings well, which I felt I was unable to do in the last World Cup in the West Indies,” she said.

Specific roles

Veda said specific roles had been assigned to each player and they all were trying to contribute as much as they could to help the team achieve its goal.

“I’m happy we’re all putting in efforts and executing our role properly. Even if it’s a smallish contribution of saving a couple of runs, it’s all panned out really well,” she said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/sp2zsd/article31003395.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07VEDA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/t20-world-cup-veda-says-its-meant-to-be-india/article31003396.ece
282,2020/03/06,We are not short of talent: Atapattu,"‘Grooming and polishing the talent is something we haven’t done properly’

Marvan Atapattu belongs to a generation when Sri Lanka dominated international cricket. Be it the ODIs or Tests, the island nation had enough talent in its ranks to battle the odds.

But over the years, things have changed.

With some senior players retiring, Sri Lanka has been largely inconsistent. And Atapattu believes that there has to be proper planning, right from the grassroots level.

“Let’s put it very simply — the term transition doesn’t work with me. It’s lack of planning. I think there are too many things, too many cooks.

“We are not short of talent, but then, grooming and polishing the talent is something that we haven’t done properly,” Atapattu told Sportstar on Friday.

In the city for the UnAcademy Road Safety World Series, the former Sri Lanka captain was concerned about his team’s recent performances on the big stage.

Long process

“We have not been good except in the last one-day series. Of course, in Tests, we aren’t doing too badly. It’s a long process. Cricketers don't just sort of come from nowhere. They need to be groomed, given a very strong foundation in terms of technique and personality.

“You do that and the sustainability of a cricketer last longer. And that is what Sri Lanka has to sort of think and do the right things from the grassroots level,” the 49-year-old said.

Attitude is important

Asked what would be his advice to the younger lot of Sri Lankan cricketers, he said: “Attitude is very important. You have got to have that attitude where you are ready to improve yourself everyday.

“It’s a learning curve for everybody, be it batsman or bowler. You need to keep that in mind. You need learn something new every day.”

Belonging to a generation when Sri Lankan cricket was all about batting superstars, it does hurt Atapattu to see the inconsistency in the side’s batting line-up today.

“It hurts. In my opinion, it only shows your upbringing as a cricketer. Your foundation and technique, your mental ability, how much pressure you can handle. We were lucky in our generation that we had very good coaches at the start of our careers,” Atapattu said.

Seniors helped

“We had some good senior cricketers to look up to. They gave us advice on how to handle pressure on the international stage; so we were lucky. That’s the main difference that I see in batsmanship.”

With the T20 World Cup lined up this year, does he expect Lasith Malinga to lead Sri Lanka?

“I really don’t know what the plans are. I am a believer that you should not question the selectors when they are in the job. But when they are out of the job, they can be questioned and they are answerable,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/4ufwfk/article31003007.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07-ATAPATTU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/we-are-not-short-of-talent-atapattu/article31003008.ece
283,2020/03/06,It’s yesterday once more!,"Legends of the game come together for a good cause

Sudhir Kumar Gautam was back in the stands as Sachin Tendulkar walked in to bat in the nets. He waved the tri-colour, blew the conch and cheered.

Tendulkar paused for a few seconds, looked at his favourite fan and went about his business. For the next half an hour, the Brabourne Stadium witnessed the icon going hammer and tongs at the nets bowlers.

It rekindled memories. Every time Tendulkar struck a drive or went for a pull, it was a flashback to the good old times of Indian cricket. His teammates — Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammad Kaif, Irfan Pathan, Sanjay Bangar — all watched in awe as the Master sweated it out in the nets.

Who would say it’s been seven long years since Tendulkar retired from international cricket! At 46, he still looked hungry for runs.

A few metres away, one of his old friends — Muttiah Muralitharan — was spinning it out in the nets. As the spin wizard came up with the unplayable doosras, his teammates in Sri Lanka Legends, had a tough time.

And adding to their woes, on came Chaminda Vaas. Breathing fire, the former Lankan ace looked as if he was preparing for an international fixture.

Over the next couple of weeks many such freeze frames are likely to go viral as some of the legends of world cricket pad up for the UnAcademy Road Safety World Series.

A tournament for a cause, the event will see five teams — India Legends, South Africa Legends, West Indies Legends, Sri Lanka Legends and Australia Legends — slugging it out for the title.

And, as Yuvraj pointed out, there will be a lot to play for. “The body tires, but then it’s good to regroup with the legends of Indian cricket. The tournament is for a good cause — road safety.

A lot of people will be watching us, so we are looking forward to giving our best,” Yuvraj, who quit the game last year, said.

Like many of his old friends, Yuvraj is looking forward to playing under the captaincy of Tendulkar.

In the opening fixture on Saturday, Tendulkar’s India Legends will play Brian Lara-led West Indies Legends at the Wankhede Stadium and the organisers claim that all tickets for the game are sold out.

“It’s a wonderful feeling to be back as players. It’s going to be reminiscing old times and playing matches in between,” former India cricketer Sanjay Bangar said as he watched Tendulkar.

The shutterbugs gathered near the pitch, their lenses solely focused on Tendulkar. And, as he walked back to the dressing room after a long session, the huge demands for selfies said it all — it’s yesterday once more!",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/i5gzts/article31002985.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07SACHIN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/its-yesterday-once-more/article31002986.ece
284,2020/03/06,Mitchell Starc leaves SA tour early to attend wife Alyssa Healy’s women’s T20 World Cup final,"Wicketkeeper-batter Healy will be a part of Australia’s team which will take on an in-form Indian side at the MCG on Sunday

Top Australia pacer Mitchell Starc will miss the final ODI against South Africa to watch wife Alyssa Healy play the ICC Women’s Twenty20 World Cup final against India here on Sunday.

Wicketkeeper-batter Healy will be a part of Australia’s team which will take on an in-form Indian side at the MCG. The four-time champion home team would be aiming to defend the title against the first-time finalists.

There to support Healy would be Starc, who will miss the third and final ODI scheduled to be played in Potchefstroom on Saturday to be in Melbourne.

“It is a once-in-a-lifetime chance for Mitch to watch Alyssa in a home World Cup final and so we were happy to allow him to return home to support his wife and be part of a fantastic occasion,” Australia men’s team coach, Justin Langer said.

“It is something we have been talking about for a while and, given Mitch has had a considerable workload in all three formats, his heading home a couple of days ahead of the rest of the squad means he’ll have a chance to refresh ahead of our home and away ODI and T20Is against New Zealand that will wrap up our season,” Langer added.

The Australian men’s team will fight for pride having already conceded the three-match ODI series 0-2 to South Africa.

Langer believes Starc’s absence will be an opportunity for the likes of Josh Hazlewood, Jhye Richardson and Kane Richardson.

“We have plenty of fast-bowling options with us here in South Africa with Josh Hazlewood, Jhye Richardson and Kane Richardson all sitting out our previous match in Bloemfontein, and Mitch’s absence will offer one of them an opportunity to impress in Saturday’s match,” Langer said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/7x49gl/article31000546.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/STARC,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/mitchell-starc-leaves-sa-tour-early-to-attend-wife-alyssa-healys-womens-t20-world-cup-final/article31000547.ece
285,2020/03/06,"IPL very much on, all measures will be in place to handle COVID-19 threat, says Ganguly","The COVID-19 outbreak has severely impacted the global sporting schedules.

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is “very much on schedule”, the BCCI president Sourav Ganguly told PTI on Friday, asserting that all measures will be in place to tackle the rapidly-spreading novel coronavirus threat which has wreaked havoc on sporting calendars globally.

The glitzy T20 event, featuring both Indian and international stars, gets underway on March 29 in Mumbai. India’s COVID-19 count currently stands at 31, including 16 Italian tourists. Internationally, the deadly outbreak has so far killed more than 3,300 people and infected nearly 100,000 in about 85 countries.

“IPL is very much on. Everywhere, the tournaments are going on. England are already in Sri Lanka. South Africa are here. There are no issues,” Ganguly asserted.

“County teams are travelling all over the world. They are travelling to Abu Dhabi, UAE to play. So there is no problem,” he added.

Asked about the precautionary measures to ensure that players and fans are not affected, Ganguly said a medical team is thrashing out the specifics.

“We will take all precautions. I don’t know exactly what are the extra measures. It’s only medical team which will tell us about that,” he said.

“The medical team is already in touch with the hospitals so that everything is available. We will do what the doctors say. They are the professionals.

“All medical issues will be addressed by the medical team. Every tournament will go on,” he added.

The COVID-19 outbreak has severely impacted the global sporting schedules with one of the disease epicentres, Italy, banning fans from venues till April.

Olympic test events have been postponed or cancelled in Japan, another badly-affected country.

Clobbered by Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana recently, Australian pacer Megan Schutt says she hates playing against India and doesn’t want to bowl at the marauding duo during powerplay when the two teams clash in the Women’s T20 World Cup final in Sydney on Sunday.

Schutt, who took a crucial 2/17 in Australia’s five-run win over South Africa in the rain-hit semifinal on Thursday, has still not recovered from the drubbing she got at the hands of Verma in the tournament-opener.

She was hit for four boundaries by Verma in her opening over of the tournament, and Schutt admitted her concerns about bowling to Indian openers.

“I just hate playing India — they’ve got the wood over me,” Schutt was quoted as saying by the official website of the ICC.

“Smriti and Shefali have got me covered. That six Shafali hit me for in the tri-series was probably the biggest one I’ve ever been hit for.

“There are obviously some plans we’re going to revisit as bowlers. (But) clearly, I’m not the best match-up to those two in the Powerplay. They find me quite easy to play,” she added.

Schutt bore the brunt of Verma and Mandhana’s attacking fury in the very first over of last month’s tri-series as well. She was struck for four by Verma off the first ball and lifted for a six by Mandhana.

But both the sides will again meet each other in Sunday’s summit clash, where India will have an edge after stunning the defending champions by 17 runs in the tournament opener.

“We’re at that final we’ve been talking about for so long and against India, which is super fitting considering the tri-series we had. It couldn’t really be a bigger challenge for us,” Schutt said.

287,2020/03/06,You can now rent a turf in Coimbatore,"At a time when public spaces are shrinking inside the city, a few good men create playgrounds for those who still enjoy outdoor games

Nikhil S used to spend most evenings playing football on his college grounds. But once he graduated, he could not find a space to play. “I finally gave up and shifted to video games. But I always missed the field and the team spirit,” he says.

With the city growing, outdoor play spaces are rare. “These are important for emotional, physical and psychological health. Especially when everyone is glued to their phones, people need interactions with real people,” says Shreya Mythrei, Clinical psychologist, Aarohi: Centre for Mental Health. But, there is hope yet, thanks to artificial turfs. “Such initiatives are a breath of fresh air. Now I play with my friends thrice a week,” says Nikhil.

Explore spaces in the city where you can play everything from football to frisbee

Foot Work

The smiling faces of Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Frank Lampard, Luis Suárez and Didier Drogba caricatured on to the compound wall welcome players into Foot Work. The turf is inside the premises of Rajalakshmi Mills on Trichy Road, and is surrounded by trees. The founder, Ishaan Nair left his marketing job in Chennai to start this venture. He was earlier a part of his college football team in Bengaluru and has played on turfs there. “I always wanted to do something related to sports. When I decided to quit my job and launch a turf two years ago, I chose Coimbatore instead of my home town Chennai as the market was already saturated there. Coimbatore showed potential with a number of colleges and IT companies,” he says. This plot was then overgrown with shrubs and it was cleared to make way for the 6000 sq feet FIFA approved football turf. “I imported the turf from Netherlands,” he says. The turf opens at 6.00 am and closes at 12 mid night. The ground has a small gallery space that can accommodate up to 30 people. A customised shipping container works as the office. Shower and changing rooms are also available. “We have flood lights and also speakers for music. Many of our clients like music as they play,” he says. Ishaan admits that the business is unpredictable. “I have had days without bookings and then some when it was sold out,” he says. He also offers football coaching for children. “We have regular sessions from Monday till Saturday; 4:30 pm to 6:00 pm ,” he says.

At Foot Works, 564, Trichy Road, Singanallur. @ ₹1500 per hour. Call 9791177088 for bookings.

Area 641

Sam Adolf started Area 641 with six of his friends two years ago. “All of us are into corporate jobs and always wanted to do something associated with football. Though the concept of rented turf was common in metro cities, it was only catching up in the Coimbatore then,” he says. The team did market research for a year before it moved forward. The property was earlier used as a dump yard and now in its place are two artificial turfs and two crickets pitches. “Anyone can rent it out for an hour from 6:00 am to 11:00 pm. The turfs are FIFA approved and we have added rubber granules in the grass to make it softer. People usually make use of the space to play football, Frisbee, cricket, box cricket, cross fit and volley ball. We provide them with the balls and bats,” he says. They are also equipped with bowling machines for cricket practice.

For those who want to have a quick bite, there is Dugout Café on its premises. “People even come here for birthday parties. Kids cut the cake in the café and head out to play. We also have many corporate meetings happening here,” he says. The turf is equipped with locker rooms bathrooms and changing rooms. “Many of our clients and corporates go directly to their offices after a game here.” Area 641 also provides cricket and football coaching for children.“One of students, Nathania John was the official match ball carrier in the football World Cup in 2018, for a match between Brazil and Costa Rica at Saint Petersburg. That was a proud moment,” he says adding that he will soon include a gym and gallery space too.

The turf is open from 6:00 am to 10:30 pm. “Most of our clients are professionals or college students and they usually come in the mornings and evenings,” says its co-founder Mohammed Yaseen. Yaseen worked in the corporate sector for four years before he decided to start his own business. “This is in partnership with two of my friends. I always loved to play football and after college we would travel all the way to Decathalon in Neelambur from Saibaba Colony for a match. After a point it became difficult. This is how the idea of setting up a turf came about,” he says. The 7200 sq ft turf took them two months to build. “I travelled across Chennai, Bengaluru and Coimbatore to get ideas for it and started it in 2018,” he says. Now people use the turf for cricket, Frisbee, cross fit and football. STFU provides players if there are not enough people to make a football team. Yaseen also provides training in football, Muay Thai and mixed martial arts for children. Most of the bookings happen during weekends. “Our customers come here for fun. There are a few who come for fitness as well,” he says.

The 124th Ooty Flower Show will be held from May 15 to May 19, N. Subbaiyan, Director, Department of Horticulture and Plantation Crops announced on Friday.

After a meeting was held with the District Collector, J. Innocent Divya as well as district-level officials, the horticulture department announced that the summer festival season will kick off with the 11th Vegetable Show at the Nehru Park in Kotagiri on May 2 and 3. The festival will continue with the inauguration of the 17th Rose Show at the Rose Garden in Udhagamandalam on May 8. The Rose show will continue till May 10.

Next, the marquee event of the summer festival, the 124th annual flower show will be held from May 15 to May 19 at the Government Botanical Garden in Udhagamandalam, while the ninth iteration of the spice show will be held at the St. Thomas School grounds in Gudalur on 22,23 and 24 of May.

The summer festival will conclude with the 62nd Fruit Show at the Sims Park in Coonoor which will be held over three days starting from May 29 and finally finishing on May 31. With the announcement of the dates, it means that the five shows will be held across 16 separate days over the month of May.

Speaking to reporters, Mr. Subbaiyan said that the department of horticulture has already begun preparations to ensure that the five shows which will headline the summer festival season in Udhagamandalam will be a grand success.

“As this year will also mark 25 years since the opening of the Ooty Rose Garden, we have planned special events to mark the occasion,” said Mr. Subbaiyan.

Also present at the press conference was joint director of horticulture, Nilgiris, Sivasubramaniam Samraj.

Concerns over COVID-19

Hoteliers, restaurateurs and business owners in the Nilgiris said that the biggest threat that could overshadow the summer festival this year is the global outbreak of COVID-19, with the number of foreign visitors to the district already witnessing a steady decline over the last few weeks.

Luxury hotels in the district have been the ones to have been affected thus far the most. Ismael Khan, Resident Director of the Gem Park Hotel in Udhagamandalam said that the hotel had already seen cancellation of bookings by foreign tourists due to the COVID-19 outbreak. “All we can hope for is a swift containment of the outbreak that will lead to more people starting to travel again,” said Mr. Khan.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ooty-flower-show-to-be-held-from-may-15-to-19/article31000829.ece
289,2020/03/06,Traces of formalin found in fish sold in the city,"Traces of formalin, a chemical widely used as tissue preservative, was found in 70 kg of fish in a surprise check jointly conducted by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and the Fisheries Department at the wholesale and retail fish markets at Ukkadam here on Thursday.

Both FSSAI and Fisheries Department issued warning to traders not to sell fish added with the preservative. They also seized 430 kg of stale fish from the markets which was destroyed along with the 70 kg of fish found with traces of formalin, exposure to which is associated with certain types of cancer. Simultaneous raids were conducted by two teams led by food safety officers S. Vijayaraja and N. Kumaragurubaran at the two markets on Thursday morning. Inspector of Fisheries Padmaja was also part of the raids.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Vijayaraja said that traces of formalin in fish was found in a rapid test conducted using a testing kit provided by the Government. “For the test, we rub a tissue provided in the kit against suspected fish. Then a drop of reagent is dipped on the tissue. The tissue turns blue if the fish contains formalin. It becomes light to dark blue based on the level of formalin contained in the fish,” he explained.

According to him, fish brought from Kerala and Andhra Pradesh were found with traces of formalin, which traders in those places added to the consignments before they were transported to Coimbatore.

K. Tamilselvan, designated officer of FSSAI in Coimbatore, said that similar surprise raids will be conducted in future too.

Raid in Tiruppur

In Tiruppur, officials from the FSSAI and Fisheries Department inspected fish market in Thennampalayam, Palladam Road.

291,2020/03/06,HC verdict triggers mass gathering of anti-CAA protesters,"Following the Madras High Court verdict directing the police to act against protesters, both for and against Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the anti-CAA protesters gathered in large numbers at Arivoli Street on Thursday.

The Shaheen Bagh-style indefinite protests began at Arivoli Street on February 15, the day after police attacked protesters in Chennai. As the protests entered its 20th day on Thursday, the Madras High Court heard a public interest litigation (PIL) petition filed by Tiruppur-based advocate K. Gopinath, who was also the president of Hindu Munnetra Kazhagam, complaining about the alleged inconvenience caused by anti-CAA protesters to commuters.

In response to the PIL, the court directed the Director General of Police to take action against both pro and anti-CAA agitations that take place in the State without valid permission.

S. Zeelani, one of the anti-CAA protesters at Arivoli Street, said that the protesters started gathering in thousands after seeing the news on televisions about the verdict in the forenoon. He said that the protesters will not resist arrest and will request the police to remand them in prisons as opposed to merely removing the protesters. “People are fighting for their rights and they are not in a mood to disperse,” Mr. Zeelani asserted.

Criticising the HC verdict, Mr. Zeelani said that the verdict must have been similar to that of the Supreme Court, which upheld the right to protest in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh. Dismissing allegations of blocking traffic, he claimed that the protesters in Arivoli Street have been allowing ambulances to pass freely, even turning the lights off at the site to not cause any disturbances.

Sources said that nearly 300 police personnel were deployed at the protest site on Thursday. Police officers held talks with the agitators, sources added, noting that no untoward incidents occurred at the spot.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/yj7rnp/article30976515.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MadrasHighCourtvg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/hc-verdict-triggers-mass-gathering-of-anti-caa-protesters/article30994323.ece
292,2020/03/06,Poor maintenance of burial grounds a matter of concern,"‘One of the reasons for poor upkeep is the failure to issue licence to undertakers’

The road leading to the burial ground at Maniakarampalayam in Ward 41 is littered with waste on the western edge. Atop the street light poles along the edge, the fittings are bereft of bulbs. Coimbatore Corporation Crematorium reads the arch that rests on two pillars that support the gates. But one of the gates is damaged and rests along the compound wall.

Inside, the waiting room is open, giving free access to any one who wants to use it. The room is littered with hundreds of used plastic tumblers and dozens of open liquor bottles, suggesting that tipplers are using the room. Not a day passes without people misusing it to drink, rues S. Janaki of Sankaralinganar Street.

South of the waiting room is a building housing four toilets. All are open and filled with filth.

The LED bulbs on poles inside the burial ground are broken. And, the cremation platform is seeing slow encroachment by bushes.

This has been the condition of the burial ground for at least seven to eight years, complains Poovai Thangam, a Poosaripalayam resident.

As per Coimbatore Corporation North Zone records, the burial ground is one among the very few with an undertaker, M. Pattusamy, who after his father Maruthachalam's demise is the man in-charge.

In the absence of salary or wages from the Corporation and with only a licence he feels dis-empowered to question people who misuse the place. “What do you expect me to do? Ask a group of five or six to leave the place to drink elsewhere. And, what do I tell them when they ask on what authority I say so.”

A few kilometres, wards and zones away, in Kallimadai (Ward 63), is another Corporation burial ground. On the southern edge of the habitat and abutting maize fields, the burial ground is without an access road, compound, name board or anything to suggest that it is a traditional burial ground.

All that is there is a tin shed that rests on a rectangular brick structure of two to three feet.

With the residents using the place to rest their cattle, it appears more a cattle shed than a place that is used for performing the last rites.

Kallimadai Kamatchi Amman Kovil Street resident L. Ramu says the residents, mostly from the Devendira Kula Velalar, have been petitioning the Coimbatore Corporation for the past 10-plus years to provide them a decent place to bury their dead kith and kin but thus far their pleas have fell on deaf ears.

The burial ground should be 50 feet but none knows the exact extent as it appears encroached and filled with thorny bushes, he says and adds that when he wanted to bury his wife a few years ago, he had engaged earth movers to clear the bushes before performing the last rites. And, every time the residents complain, the Corporation engineers visit the ground and then deploy an earth mover to clear the bushes. Their solution remains effective for a month or two.

R. Kalaimani, another Kallimadai resident, says the Corporation's not giving a decent resting place for the dead has made him angry and sad at the same time. The poor maintenance of the burial grounds is one of the important reasons that even people who, by tradition, bury the dead, are opting for cremation. The absence of licensed undertakers only compounds the difficulty in burying the dead because there is none to issue the mandatory certificate, using which people obtain death certificates, he adds.

The picture of poor maintenance with damaged gates, broken compound wall, littered liquor bottles, etc. repeats in most of the Corporation's 83 burial grounds spread across the five zones.

In Peelamedu, it is worse – the Corporation is using the burial ground as a junk yard. The civic body has dumped its damaged bins in the ground and most of them are buried at least a foot below the ground, indicating that the Corporation had dumped it years ago. The area resident A. Madasamy says it is sad to see the Corporation pay scant regard for the upkeep of the burial ground, which once served the people of Peelamedu, right from Avinashi Road to Thanneerpandal Road.

Now, the residents cremate the dead in the nearby crematorium run by a trust, he adds.

Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam MLA N. Karthik says he is tired of raising the issue with the Coimbatore Corporation. “I've submitted at least 50 petitions on this issue in the last four years but the civic body seems to care very little to maintain the burial grounds. Right from Ondipudur in the east to Vadavalli in the west and from Thudiyalur in the north to Kovaipudur in the south, the state of burial grounds is poor.”

Corporation officials admit that one of the reasons for rather poor maintenance of burial grounds is the failure to issue licence to undertakers. The last time the Corporation issued the licence was at least 15 years ago. Or perhaps more.

It is these licensed undertakers who issue slips in triplet confirming the burial. It is based on such slips and other documents that the Corporation was issuing death certificates. Now that there are no licensed undertakers and as the number of burials is few and far between, the Corporation has given up the practise.

The officials say the Corporation has, over the years, also given up the practice of fixing the charges of burial. It used to display the charges in boards erected in the grounds. It is no more in practice.

The officials further say that the reason for Corporation showing reluctance to issue licence to undertakers is that it may open doors for further demands like permanent employment or other financial commitments.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/poor-maintenance-of-burial-grounds-a-matter-of-concern/article30994316.ece

294,2020/03/06,Plea to quash cases against anti-green corridor farmers,"Farmers opposing the green corridor project filed a plea in the Salem district court on Thursday requesting the court to quash the cases registered against them by the Salem police for conducting peaceful protests.

The farmers appeared before Judicial Magistrate II in connection with the hearing of a case registered against them at Pallapatti police station in 2019.

According to the petitioners, the Palapatti police have registered a case against the farmers under sections 143 and 341 of IPC when they attempted to meet Chief Minister Edappadi K.Palaniswami at the inauguration of the government exhibition in August last year and petition him against acquiring their land for the green corridor project.

The petitioners, in their plea, highlighted the observations made by the High Court regarding conducting peaceful protests and requested the court to quash the charges against them and take action against the police for registering cases defying court orders.

One of the petitioners said that they were not even aware of such a case against them and came to know about it only when they received the summons.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/plea-to-quash-cases-against-anti-green-corridor-farmers/article30994285.ece
295,2020/03/06,Delhi High Court bids farewell to Justice G.S. Sistani,"Justice Sistani will retire on March 10.

The Delhi High Court on Friday bid farewell to Justice G.S. Sistani, the second senior most judge, whose retirement brings down the total number of judges in the court to 33 as against the sanctioned strength of 60.

The High Court organised a farewell for Justice Sistani, who will retire on March 10, on Friday owing to the Holi break on March 9 and 10.

Once Justice Subramonium Prasad, transferred to New Delhi from the Madras High Court, takes charge as an additional judge, the strength would go up to 34.

Earlier in the day, when Justice Sistani was part of a Bench headed by Chief Justice D.N. Patel, as is the practice on the last day of a judge before he retires, lawyers in the courtroom expressed their gratitude and respect for him.

Additional Solicitor General Maninder Acharya and Central government standing counsel Anil Soni said even adverse orders against them “did not pinch” because of the smile on Justice Sistani’s face.

The same view was echoed by others present in the courtroom. In response to it, Justice Sistani said nobody ever shouted in his court so he never had to shout back either.

A farewell was also organised for him by the Delhi High Court Bar Association where large number of lawyers gathered to bid him goodbye.

Justice Sistani enrolled as an advocate with the Bar Council of Delhi in 1982 and he was appointed as an additional judge of the Delhi High Court with effect from May 29, 2006, and was confirmed as a permanent judge a year later on August 29, 2007.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/r5v1nv/article30999093.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DELHIHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-high-court-bids-farewell-to-justice-gs-sistani/article31002323.ece
296,2020/03/06,"After checking 25 bodies, a father still waits for his son","Hujefa, 18, has been missing since he stepped out for tuition class on February 22

A 42-year-old man has been doing the rounds of city hospitals hoping against hope. Mohammad Haroon has visited mortuaries of three hospitals and seen bodies of more than 25 victims, but there’s no news on his 18-year-old son, Hujefa, missing since February 22. The death toll from the communal violence in north-east Delhi continued its upward march, touching 53 on Thursday.

‘Police not helping’

Fishing out a brown envelope from his pocket in which he has kept a photo of his son, Mr. Haroon, an Urdu teacher, said, “There is a high chance that he might have got caught in the riots. Police are not doing anything. Now everything is in god’s hands.”

The father of four children said his wife has been distraught since the day Hujefa went missing. “Police are not even tracing his cell phone number and are not giving us any details. Please help us,” he said, showing the photo.

Around 10 a.m. on Saturday, February 22, Hujefa, sporting a brown salwar kameez, left for a tuition class about 500 metres from their Mustafabad home. The family has not heard from him since and his cell phone is switched off.

“He said he would attend a religious event in Old Delhi after tuition, but we do not know what happened,” Mr. Haroon said. Before they realised that Hujefa was missing, Mr. Haroon had left for a madrasa in Narela 35 km away where he teaches Urdu.

Hospital-hopping

“From Sunday, violence started in the area and I couldn’t come back as the situation was really bad and the police were not answering our calls inquiring about Hujefa,” he said.

As the situation calmed down a little, on February 29, Mr. Haroon went from Narela to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital in north-east Delhi. “They had said that there was a body that could be my son’s. I went inside the mortuary to check, but it was not him. Then I checked about 20 bodies there. I went around looking at the people admitted as well,” he said.

On March 1, he went to the police station and to RML Hospital and LNJP Hospital the next day. “At RML, I checked around five bodies... at LNJP they had already identified the bodies.”

Growing more desperate, Mr. Haroon went to GTB Hospital again with his wife. “My wife also saw the body that I had seen on my previous visit and confirmed it was not his.”

While the Delhi High Court on Thursday directed the police to publish on its website details and photographs of all unidentified victims brought to government hospital mortuaries, Mr. Haroon is still clutching at straws, leaving for Uttar Pradesh to meet a tantric. “I don’t know what to do,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/gepkfb/article30995400.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE05MISSINGSON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/after-checking-25-bodies-a-father-still-waits-for-his-son/article30995401.ece

“The abysmal condition of the Delhi University is perhaps best reflected by the state of qualified and eligible ad hoc and temporary teachers who have been endlessly waiting for permanent placements, in fact some for more than one decade,” DUTA said.

It added that teachers have been churning out batch after batch of meritorious students each year but have been subjected to constant vulnerability of jobs.

The DoE added that students of nursery and primary classes are too young to understand the risks associated with COVID-19 and thus, are more prone to infectious diseases as they mingle with classmates more often.

300,2020/03/06,Delhi govt. sets up isolation wards in 25 hospitals,"Healthcare workers call for immediate protective measures amid rise in number of confirmed COVID-19 cases

With 30 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country till now, Delhi government is setting up isolation wards in 25 hospitals, Health Minister Satyendar Jain said on Thursday. He added that 3.5 lakh N95 masks and over 8,000 separation kits for staff treating COVID-19 patients have been arranged.

Lok Nayak Hospital has set up 11 separate rooms and isolation wards to treat patients, the Minister said.

Isolation ward consisting of 14 beds has been set up at Bara Hindurao Hospital, said North Delhi Mayor Avtar Singh. Nodal officers have been deputed at Hindurao and Kasturba Hospital to report COVID-19 cases. A core team was formed to review the situation, he added.

“A total of 3,000 N95 masks have been distributed in the hospital. At zonal levels, Deputy Health Officers have been given the charge of nodal officers,” the Mayor said.

Meanwhile, front-line healthcare workers across both government and private hospitals are demanding adequate protective gears with the sudden escalation of COVID-19 cases.

“Hospitals are extremely crowded places with patients coming in with various kinds of infections. Now, with this extremely contagious virus we have to be careful. Hospitals should provide appropriate and adequate personal protective equipment at workplace without interruption in their supply and also make it compulsory to wear the same while on duty,” said the Resident Doctors’ Association of All India Institute of Medical Sciences in its letter to the administration.

301,2020/03/06,"COVID-19 | Firms promote work-from-home, suspend travel","Amid COVID-19 scare in country, smartphone makers cancel on-ground events for new product launches

Many events, including press conferences, internal company events and National Days, have been cancelled in the Capital to avoid public gatherings due to COVID-19 outbreak.

A large number of firms are promoting work-from-home among employees, while suspending foreign travel and limiting domestic travel for workers.

Precautionary measures

IT firm Tech Mahindra said it has issued a detailed employee advisory and are undertaking various preventive measures. “We have mobilised a panel of doctors on standby across all locations who are educating employees on the dos and don’ts. Restrictions have been imposed on domestic and international travel with immediate effect,” Harshvendra Soin, Chief People Officer, Tech Mahindra, said.

The company has also postponed all internal events that required large gatherings and had advised everyone to leverage technologies like tele presence and videoconferencing.

Likewise, Wizikey, a provider of SaaS platform for PR firms, said 80% of employees are now working from home and those coming to the office are being provided with masks and sanitisers.

“We have put up an hourly reminder of ‘WHO guidelines for workspaces’ like washing hands, avoiding touching mouth, eyes and nose, maintaining social distance, etc. We are checking body temperature in the morning for all our employees,” Wizikey founder and CEO Anshul Sushil said.

Amid increasing anxiousness with regards to the spread of COVID-19, two of the major smartphone makers — Realme and Xiaomi, cancelled on-ground events for their new product launches. Realme, whose event was scheduled for Thursday at Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium, launched its Realme 6 and Realme 6 Pro smartphones via a webcast.

“In light of current reports of #coronavirus impact & related advisory by health officials to maintain social distance as a precautionary measure, I’m calling off our biggest event. Will still give live speech in stadium with you watching #realme6series event online,” Realme India CEO Madhav Sheth had tweeted.

Similarly, Xiaomi vice-president and India Managing Director Manu Jain said the company won’t be holding any launch events on-ground in March. “While we have been planning for this launch for months, we believe this is an unprecedented yet extremely important step.”

Mr. Jain said the decision was taken with the objective of reducing exposure risk to COVID-19 for Mi fans, media friends, partners and Xiaomi employees.

“We are operating out of abundant caution and our dedication to keeping all of you healthy,” he said.

Embassy of Italy also cancelled their National Day event scheduled for March 17 in the Capital. Auto giant Mahindra & Mahindra, which was to host the 10th edition of Mahindra Samriddhi India Agri Awards 2020 in New Delhi to honour the heroes of Indian agriculture, postponed the event “due to unavoidable circumstances”.

Holi function

The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) on Thursday announced that it will cancel its ‘Holi event’ scheduled for March 8 “in view of COVID-19 outbreak and the appeal by Prime Minister Narendra Modi”.

“Experts across the world have advised to reduce mass gatherings to avoid the spread of COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus. Hence, this year I have decided not to participate in any Holi Milan programme,” the PM had tweeted on March 4.

Not just in Delhi, but events in other parts of the country have also dropped. Amazon Web Services (AWS) cancelled its Mumbai Summit scheduled for April 7-9 “due to the continued concerns about COVID-19... We’ve reached this decision after much consideration, as the health and safety of our employees, customers, and partners are our top priority,” a company spokesperson said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/y7ipov/article30995158.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05DELPRIYAPROTECTIVEMASKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/firms-promote-work-from-home-suspend-travel/article30995159.ece
302,2020/03/06,"Food adulteration offence under IPC, says govt.","‘The police can take action including registration of FIRs’

The Delhi High Court has been told by the AAP government that under the penal law, food adulteration is a cognisable offence against which the police can take action, including registration of FIRs.

The submission was made before a Bench of Justices G.S. Sistani and A.J. Bhambhani which had earlier said that the use of pesticides and chemicals to ripen fruits amounts to poisoning and the culprits should be sent to jail.

The Delhi government also told the court that out of the 86 fruit and vegetable samples, it had collected from various markets in the city, 15 were found to be “highly unsafe” due to “excess lead content”.

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) told the Bench that it has developed a framework for clean and fresh fruit and vegetable market to address safety and hygiene concerns.

It also said that it has identified five markets at INA, Kotla, Janakpuri, Ranibagh and Ghanta Ghar for pilot projects on food safety. Thereafter, it will be replicated in the markets of Azadpur, Daryaganj, Ghazipur and Okhla, the FSSAI said.

The Bench directed the FSSAI to consider publicising its new scheme or framework in four local languages to educate all stakeholders.

The FSSAI may also consider carrying advertisements on websites, posters, hoardings, social media, cinema halls, metro stations and bus stops, it said.

The court said that a comparative chart should also be prepared on the roles and responsibilities of the FSSAI and the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC), as also the accountability and responsibility of State governments and the interplay of these organisations, for the court to get a clearer picture of the entities involved in the matter of food safety and their respective roles.

The order came on a PIL initiated by the court to monitor the use of pesticides on fruits and vegetables.

Apart from the PIL initiated by the court on its own, it is also hearing a plea by an individual seeking directions to authorities to curb the use of pesticides and other chemicals on food products, especially agricultural produce, coming into the Capital.

According to a report filed by amicus curiae Rajul Jain earlier, due to excessive use of pesticides in fruits and vegetable, “various countries have banned the import of Indian vegetables and fruits and many more were under scrutiny”.

The High Court had initiated the issue on its own after an NGO had found that vegetables and fruits sold in the Delhi markets contained “poisons capable of causing cancer and harming the nervous system and liver”.

The court had, in the past, suggested several measures to curb adulteration of fruits and vegetables, like large-scale testing and sending back contaminated food products to manufacturers or farmers.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/food-adulteration-offence-under-ipc-says-govt/article30995150.ece

Having lost all their belongings in north-east Delhi violence, 19-year old Rukhsar’s family found themselves helpless when the groom’s parents cancelled the wedding as “there was nothing left to pay the dowry.” It was then that 23-year old Feroze, who works with an app-based food delivery service, stepped in and agreed to marry his cousin to “save the family’s honour.”

“The wedding was scheduled for March 3. But since the communal clash broke out, the groom’s family snapped all contact with us. On March 1, when we somehow managed to get through, the groom’s family asked about the dowry and refused to understand our situation,” said Feroze, a resident of Krishna Nagar.

Feroze then readily agreed to marry Rukshar and the wedding took place at the relief camp on the same date.

Sitting next to his newly-wed wife at the Al Hind Hospital relief camp, he added: “After the wedding got cancelled, it was important for someone to stand up as her family’s honour was at stake. So I agreed to the proposal when my relatives asked me.”

Rukhsar’s family was left homeless when their house in Shiv Vihar was torched by a mob on February 25. The family has been at the Al Hind relief camp since then.

A reason to smile

With the wedding, residents of the relief camp, which has been set up inside the hospital, now have something to celebrate as well.

Fatima, a resident of Shiv Vihar who took refuge at the relief camp, said, “The last 10 days have been very exhausting for us. We lost everything within minutes and are literally left with nothing.

Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has asked insurance companies to expeditiously settle the claims of Delhi riot victims and make the payments within 15 days.

In a communication to all general, life and standalone health insurance companies, the IRDAI said the violence in north-east Delhi during last week of February have had a serious impact on people, property and business in the region.

“The authority is aware that general insurers, life insurers and standalone health insurers may have written policies that extend to lives and property pertaining to the affected areas. In this situation, all insurers are advised to act immediately for fair and speedy settlement of claims,” the insurance regulator directed.

The IRDAI has asked them to engage adequate number of surveyors immediately in the affected areas to ensure that all claims are promptly assessed and payments of claims are disbursed within 15 days.

The IRDAI, in a set of instructions to the insurers, has asked them to nominate a senior officer who would act as a nodal officer for Delhi, who would be coordinating/facilitating the settlement of all the claims that are reported in the affected areas.

It has also asked them to publish in press, the contact details of offices/special arrangements set up for this purpose as well as to initiate immediate steps for quick registration of claims.

Insurers should create extensive awareness campaign in the affected areas duly highlighting the measures taken, the regulator said.

In order to gauge the magnitude of loss, insurers were advised to submit information about insurance claims related to the violence in north-east on weekly basis in a given format.

The Delhi government on Thursday said that it has distributed a total of ₹88.55 lakh as compensation to violence-hit families in north-east Delhi. It added that the Delhi Cabinet has now decided to increase the compensation to people whose houses have been damaged and the government will now treat each floor of a multi-storey building as one residential unit while paying the compensation.

“Earlier, a compensation of ₹5 lakh was being provided in case of total damage — ₹4 lakh to the owners and ₹1 lakh to the tenants. However, during disbursal of compensation on ground, it was found that there were multiple owners and tenants living in the same building. Therefore, the Delhi government has now decided to treat each floor as a different residential unit,” an official statement said.

Now, a compensation of ₹4 lakh will be provided to the owner of each floor and ₹1 lakh for loss of household items to be divided among occupants or tenants of that floor.

Cases of loot, theft

The Cabinet also decided that a compensation of ₹1 lakh will be given in cases of complete theft/looting/vandalism of residential units and ₹50,000 for partial looting and theft.

“Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had earlier announced a compensation of ₹50,000 for damage to e-rickshaw. The Cabinet has now decided to give the same amount as compensation for damage to e-scooty,” the statement said.

308,2020/03/06,A small ‘township’ has sprung up at Idgah in Mustafabad,"Advocates, doctors and college students do their bit to help victims

A pothole-ridden slushy road with open drains on both sides lead to the Idgah in Mustafabad, which has doubled up as the largest relief camp for riot-hit families of north-east Delhi.

Inside the camp, a small town has sprung up: from counters to register the riot survivors to advocates who help in registering cases for free and doctors for medical aid. The camp also has a tin-shed kitchen at the rear end and volunteers who organise painting classes for children. But a heap of waste was dumped openly inside the gate of the camp and temporary toilets set up outside the camp were on top of stinking garbage and open drains.

Ground report

At tent number 14, which is a medical camp, Shakeela Begum, 62, was lying on a wooden desk with an (IV) drip hung from the roof. “I was standing in the line to get my eyes tested when I fainted. I have hurt my teeth,” said Shakeela.

Shakeela, a mother of four and a widow, lamented that she has to marry off her 18-year-old daughter. “Look what happened. Our house was attacked and I have been here for four days and no one has filled up forms for us [for compensation],” she said.

Around 2.10 p.m., Ruksana Chaudhry, a doctor who came to check on her asked, “Have you eaten anything?”. Shakeela shook her head. The doctor gave her a packet of biscuit,‘frooti’ and some medicines too.

Many people at the camp showed an ink mark on their forefinger, which was done on the day they came to the camp to identify them. The authorities are now in the process of making ID cards.

By 2.15 p.m., hundreds of people sat on green mats spread on the ground for lunch. Though the cook said it was Matar Gosht (a curry of meat and green peas) and rice, many disagreed. “I am almost done eating and I didn’t find any meat in it. In the morning, they gave us tea and rusk and I have been hungry for a long time. There is no dearth of materials here. It should be managed better,” said Hasmudeen, 50.

Painting classes

Around, 3 p.m., about 40 children, including 11-year-old Naveed, sat down on a white foam mat and started painting rabbits, frogs, hens and crocodiles on sheets of paper handed out to them by students from a college. “I had drawn a flag, a tree and a cloud in the morning,” Naveed said.

“We wanted to take their minds off things happened back at their homes,” said Jeevan Issac, a student at Vidya Jyoti College and an volunteer.

Outside the gates of the camp, two portables toilets stood on top of stinking garbage and their outlet pipes thrown into open drains in which blackish water flowed.

The CPCB was directed to issue notice to entities that were accountable to pay compensation. In cases of non-compliance, the pollution monitoring body was asked to move the NGT.

The green panel also directed the Delhi government to set up an Integrated Drain Management Cell, to be headed by the Chief Secretary, for remediation and management of all drains in the city. Representatives from various agencies, departments and urban local bodies owning such drains, were also asked to be a part of the said cell.

The NGT also directed the Delhi government to review its “free sewer scheme” in the city while stating that such policies are contrary to the “basic tenets of civic life”.

“Such a policy is certainly contrary to the basic tenets of civic life and the fundamental duties of the authorities in charge to deter pollution of the environment. There may be no objection to freeship if, in spite of freeship, the administration discharges basic obligations to prevent discharge of untreated sewage into water bodies, which is not happening,” the Bench observed.

Stating that resources of the State were “not meant to help a polluter,” the Bench said, “Pollution remains unabated, which seriously affects the rights of the citizens to a clean environment. It is better to provide a clean environment and recover the cost of remedying the pollution than declaring free sewage treatment and not treating the sewage.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dda-told-to-form-special-purpose-vehicle-for-yamuna-rejuvenation/article30995072.ece
310,2020/03/06,‘Not a single FIR filed against alleged police atrocities’,"First step to bring back normalcy is to ensure credibility of police to act impartially: Brinda Karat

CPI(M) Politburo Member Brinda Karat on Thursday said that Delhi Solidarity and Rehabilitation Committee of the party has found that not a single FIR has been filed against the alleged police atrocities in any of the stations in north-east Delhi.

Ms. Karat said that the first step to bring back normalcy in the area is to ensure the credibility of police to act in an impartial manner and alleged that the police were either absent during the riots or were mute spectators to the violence.

She also called out the Delhi government for its “slow” verification process for compensation filing and said that it was being “inefficient”.

“Many are not able to go back to their houses fearing rejection of their compensation claims based on verification. The government can’t sit in their offices and assume the distressed to come to them. They need to go to the affected areas,” she added.

The party said that it has constituted four teams to conduct door-to-door survey of affected areas and reach out to the families of deceased and injured and aid them in filing FIRs and MLCs respectively.

“The team is doing a survey of the people affected, loss of livelihood and other damages incurred. This was necessitated since the State government released a form to be submitted by victims for claiming compensation,” the party said.

It added that the survey form of the government misses important information about socio-economic conditions of these families and does not capture full details of the violence and destruction that was unleashed on these households.

Ms. Karat also said that the party was doing a house-to-house campaign against the “politics of hate” which the RSS-BJP have been trying to rake up.

“The campaign will expose the communal agendas of the Sangh Parivar, make people aware of the devastation caused by recent communal riots and appeal to them to defeat the agenda of hate and violence,” Ms. Karat said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/not-a-single-fir-filed-against-alleged-police-atrocities/article30995068.ece

312,2020/03/06,Justice Muralidhar clears the air on his transfer,"‘Feb. 26 was perhaps the longest working day of my life’

Justice S. Muralidhar has said that February 26 was perhaps the longest working day of his life as a judge of the Delhi High Court, where he has spent 14 years on the Bench.

Justice Muralidhar, 58, who received a grand farewell on Thursday from a huge gathering including judges and lawyers amid a big round of applause, said he wanted to clear the confusion on his transfer and narrated the sequence of events from the time he received the Chief Justice of India’s communication till February 26.

A controversy had erupted after the Centre issued Justice Muralidhar’s transfer notification close to midnight of February 26 -- the day a Bench headed by him had pulled up the Delhi police for failing to register FIRs against three BJP leaders for their alleged hate speeches which purportedly led to the recent violence in north-east Delhi.

He said it began at 12.30 a.m. with a sitting at his residence with Justice A.J. Bhambhani, under the orders of Justice G.S. Sistani, to deal with a PIL filed by Rahul Roy seeking safe passage of ambulances carrying the injured riot victims.

“When I received a call at my residence from the lawyer for the petitioner, I first called Justice Sistani to ask what should be done, knowing that the Chief Justice (CJ) was on leave. Justice Sistani explained that he too was officially on leave the whole of February 26 and that I should take up the matter.

“This fact is stated in the order passed by the Bench after the hearing. Later that day, upon urgent mentioning, as the de facto CJ’s Bench, Justice Talwant Singh and I took up another fresh PIL on the CJ’s board seeking registration of FIRs for hate speeches. After the orders passed on that day, the above two PILs remained on the CJ’s Board,” he said.

Justice Muralidhar said the notification which was issued close to midnight of February 26 did two things.

“First, it transferred me to Punjab and Haryana High Court. Second, it appointed me to a position from where I can never be transferred, or removed and in which I shall always be proud to remain. A ‘former judge’ of arguably the best High Court in the country. The High Court of Delhi,” he said, following a standing ovation by all the judges and the gathering, including his family members, former judges, lawyers, court staff and media persons.

Clearing the air over the controversy on his transfer from the Delhi High Court to the Punjab and Haryana High Court, Justice Muralidhar said he had replied to Chief Justice of India S. A. Bobde’s communication that he was fine with the proposal and had no objection.

The Supreme Court Collegium, headed by the CJI, had in a meeting on February 12 recommended the transfer of Justice Muralidhar to the Punjab and Haryana High Court.

Justice Muralidhar was number three in the Delhi High Court, his parent High Court as a judge.

“In my case, the Collegium’s decision was communicated to me by the CJI on February 17 by a letter which sought my response. I acknowledged receipt of the letter, I was then asked to clarify what I meant. As I saw it, if I was to be transferred from the Delhi High Court any way, I was fine with moving to the Punjab and Haryana High Court.

“I therefore clarified to the CJI that I did not object to the proposal. An explanation for my transfer reached the press...on February 20 quoting ‘sources in the Supreme Court Collegium’, confirming what has been indicated to me a couple of days earlier,” he said.

The CJI’s letter dated February 14 was delivered to Justice Muralidhar on February 17.

Bidding adieu to Justice Muralidhar, Delhi High Court Chief Justice D.N. Patel said it was an occasion which has come with a saddening effect and his absence will be felt institutionally as well as personally.

Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra termed Justice Muralidhar as a “highly intellectual, courageous, upright and incorruptible judge” and sang the Bengali song ‘ekla chalo re’ to describe him.

Mr. Mehra said he joins the Delhi High Court Bar Association in “strongly condemning” Justice Muralidhar’s transfer.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/r7d3i1/article30995050.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE06MURALI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/justice-muralidhar-clears-the-air-on-his-transfer/article30995051.ece
313,2020/03/06,Schools in north-east release exam schedule; students recount horror,"Deputy Chief Minister interacts with parents on second day of special PTM

For 12-year-old Samir, a resident of Khajuri Khas, the last 10 days at home have been anything but a usual holiday.

In the aftermath of the communal violence which erupted in north-east Delhi between February 23 and 25, schools in the area were shut and annual examinations got rescheduled.

“The exams were cancelled due to the violence. I have five more [exams] left and I want them to be over soon so that the tension gets reduced,” said Samir.

While several students at Sarvodya Bal Vidyalaya said that they were scared of stepping out on the streets alone, others said they were ready to “face it” now.

Nazra Bi, a Class IX student of the school, said: “It all started when my History exam was on. Around 5.30 p.m., teachers escorted us out and we went home with our parents. Everyone kept saying that shoot-outs had taken place and people were very scared.”

Stating that almost all her neighbours have decided to return to their respective villages, Nazra said, “My mother also keeps saying that we should go back to Moradabad. But what is the point? The NRC will be implemented in the village as well, right? So I don’t find any logic in the statement that we will be safer there.”

Special parent-teacher meetings (PTMs) were held in government and aided schools in north-east Delhi for the second day on Thursday.

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who is also the Education Minister, visited schools in the area and interacted with the parents.

“For days in a row following the incidents of violence, people were scared of stepping out of their houses. Now, as the students have started attending schools again, they have gathered courage. They have understood that the situation is under control and that they do not need to worry about anything,” said Mr. Sisodia.

Morada, a housewife who attended the parent-teacher meeting, said: “Apart from releasing the new schedule for the examinations, the teachers also told us to ensure that we drop our children and pick them up from the school for the sake of their safety.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/5j7p58/article30995021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE06RIOTS2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/schools-in-north-east-release-exam-schedule-students-recount-horror/article30995022.ece

315,2020/03/06,CII reiterates commitment to TS growth,"New office bearers for CII-TS

Cyient Managing Director and CEO Krishna Bodanapu has been elected chairman of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Telangana for 2020-21.

Sameer Goel, managing director of Coromandel International, was elected vice chairman. This was announced by the State chapter of the industry body, at the end of two-day programme comprising the annual meeting and a conference on ‘T-SET for Growth.’

Mr. Bodanapu, who was the vice chairman, takes over as chairman from D.Raju, Managing Director and CEO of Kirby Building Systems & Structures.

According to Mr.Raju, CII, which is celebrating 125 years, organised as many as 125 events in the State this financial year. It was actively engaging with the State government and stakeholders for growth in the State.

Addressing the conference on Friday, MP Gaddam Ranjith Reddy said Telangana was one of the fastest growing states , with the rate well above the national growth rate. Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation Vice Chairman and Managing Director E.V.Narasimha Reddy said the State government and CII worked closely on key policy initiatives to make industry more vibrant. CII Southern Region chairman Sanjay Jayavarthanavelu said the present technological revolution is a time of enormous promise to accelerate progress of the economy on the lines of sustainable development goals, both broadening and deepening current action.

On Thursday evening, speaking at the CII-TS annual meeting, Telangana Energy Secretary Ajay Misra said the State is one of the few where electricity demand was growing.

Industrial growth as well as setting up new units were aspects driving the growth, he said, adding when Telangana was formed in 2014 the demand was around 6,500 MW. Last month, the peak demand soared past the 13,000 MW mark or doubled in about six years.

Noting that the State could handle 16,000 MW of demand, he said in the next couple of years it could handle 22,000 MW, with the incremental capacity coming from solar power. The solar capacity was expected to increase by about 1,500 MW to 5,000 MW in about two years.

Industries and IT Secretary Jayesh Ranjan urged CII to assist the State government in promoting industrial development, beyond Hyderabad, to Warangal and Nizamabad and help mid-scale companies adopt technology.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cii-reiterates-commitment-to-ts-growth/article31003671.ece

The bid, from the unlisted GABS Megacorp whose registered address as per official records is in West Marredpally, Secunderabad, was submitted under the e-auction process for sale of IVRCL as a going concern.

The bid follows the National Company Law Tribunal, Hyderabad Bench (NCLT), in July 2019 passing order for liquidation of IVRCL as a going concern and appointing a resolution professional (RP) for the company.

The NCLT order in turn followed the rejection of resolution plans by the Committee of Creditors, to revive the debt-laden IVRCL.

As many as 57 seized vehicles, including 37 two-wheelers, were destroyed in a fire that broke out at Goshamahal police stadium in the early hours of Friday.

It took more than three hours for four fire tenders to control the flames, which were reported around 4.30 a.m.

The damaged vehicles had been seized by the Hyderabad city police in various criminal cases.

According to Gowliguda Station Fire Officer Raj Kumar, there were hundreds of vehicles parked in the stadium for months together and quick action by the fire staff prevented the flames from spreading.

No human casualty was reported.

Though the exact reason for the fire was yet to be ascertained, the Gowliguda Station Fire Officer suspected that a spark from a high-tension wire passing over the stadium could have been the reason for the fire.

“Since the dry grass near the vehicles was more than five feet in height the flames spread quickly,” the Gowliguda fire officer said.

Shahinayathgunj inspector Chand Basha said that the damaged vehicles included more than a dozen cars and 10 three-wheelers.

Telangana IT and Industries Secretary Jayesh Ranjan on Thursday evening said a sense of panic and fear that prevailed in Mindspace, an IT hub of Hyderabad, ever since Wednesday after a woman employee of one of the firms there was suspected to have COVID-19 (coronavirus), has subsided.

“Things are looking up… definitely under control,” the senior official said, adding he had a detailed meeting with representatives of over 100 IT companies in which it was decided not to slacken the effort towards ensuring that it is business as usual.

322,2020/03/06,Rythu Sangham takes to the streets,"Farmers in Khammam allege substandard paddy seed was supplied by State public sector undertaking

Taking up the cudgels for the aggrieved paddy farmers affected by alleged substandard seed, members owing allegiance to the CPI-affiliated Rythu Sangham on Thursday laid a siege to the office of the Deputy Director of Agriculture here demanding compensation for the distressed farmers and stern action against the suppliers of the “defective” seed.

The agitators led by the CPI State executive committee member B Hemantha Rao staged a demonstration in front of the office by displaying the affected paddy plants in a symbolic protest against the alleged ill effects caused by “substandard seed.”

Addressing the agitators, Mr Rao alleged that many paddy growers, who sowed the MTU 1010 variety of paddy seed supplied by the Telangana State Seeds Development Corporation (TSSDC) in the rabi season, complained of abnormal growth of rice plants in various parts of the district.

Encouraged by copious rains that resulted in good storage in reservoirs in the last monsoon season, farmers extensively transplanted paddy in the hope of reaping rich harvest, he said, adding that most of the paddy growers used the certified MTU 1010 variety seeds supplied by the TSSDC, by relying on the State public sector undertaking.

“But their hopes dashed when they found abnormalities in the growth of rice plants in the flowering and reproductive stages,” he deplored.

The aggrieved farmers are worried over the fate of their rice plants and are agitated over the impending danger of crop failure and huge losses, he said, demanding that the State government sanction ₹ 40,000 compensation per acre to each affected paddy farmer.

‘Invoke PD Act’

He further demanded that a thorough probe be ordered into the supply of “substandard paddy seed” by the State public sector undertaking and the provisions of the Preventive Detention (PD) Act be invoked against the guilty.

CPI district secretary Potu Prasad, Rythu Sangham district president M Venkat Reddy and secretary M Nageswara Rao, among others, took part in the demonstration.

Official version

Meanwhile, a team comprising officials of the Agriculture Department and agricultural scientists inspected several paddy fields of aggrieved farmers at Timmakkapeta in Tirumalayapalem mandal late on Thursday afternoon to ascertain the facts.

Sources in the Agriculture Department said the team found delayed transplantation and use of “aged seedlings” as the main causes for the “abnormal growth” of rice plants in some fields.

323,2020/03/06,Hyderabad Metro commuters can now buy tickets via Paytm,"Trains towards Hitec City and Raidurg to be available every 2.5 minutes

There is some relief in the horizon for passengers travelling by Hyderabad Metro Rail trains towards Hi-Tec City/Raidurg with L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad (L&TMRH) stating that two new three coach trains will be pressed into service from Ameerpet to Raidurg within “10 days”.

HMR managing director N.V.S. Reddy disclosed this to the media after getting the confirmation from L&TMRH Chief Operating Officer A.K. Saini during the launch of Paytm’s QR-code based metro ticketing system at the Metro Rail Bhavan here on Thursday.

“Trains towards Hi-Tec City and Raidurg, experiencing heavy rush during the peak hours, could be available for every 2.5 minutes from then on and it should be able to tackle the situation,” he said.

The QR-code based ticketing would be providing seamless and hassle-free travel to the passengers as multiple tickets can be brought in one go and it is valid for the first and last mile connectivity commute in feeder buses too.

HMR & L&TRMH are keen to announce more initiatives for the passengers benefit but the coronavirus scare has forced them to put off them off for a couple of weeks. Among these are providing QR-code based passes for the passengers and for now these would be available through the Paytm mobile app only, he said.

Passengers can now purchase a QR ticket on their Paytm app on their mobiles and display at the Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) gates to proceed for the journey. The feature is expected to help over 14 lakh smart card holders using metro services to book their tickets. QR code tickets can also be pre-booked with a validity of one day.

The MD said ever since QR code based tickets were introduced three months ago, the number of users has jumped to 60,000 from among the four lakh passengers. “We are also following all protocols necessary to prevent coronavirus spread and all trains, stations and passenger utilities are getting scrubbed and sanitised, so it is absolutely safe to use the metro rail,” he asserted.

COO Mr. Saini observed that HMR is the first metro rail across the country to go for end to end QR code ticketing and he expects the smart cards usage to be subsumed gradually into this mode.

L&TMRH MD & CEO K.V.B. Reddy pointed out that Paytm has been involved with the HMR from the inception and expected more benefits to follow for the passengers for quicker journeys.

324,2020/03/06,"At Gandhi Hospital, it’s a long wait for diagnostic tests","Of the two CT Scan machines, one is defunct and the lone machine had to undergo a long disinfection process

Several patients at Gandhi Hospital had to put through an excruciatingly long wait to undergo diagnosis, using CT Scan machine on Sunday. The reason for the inordinate delay was quite strange — several hours were taken to disinfect the diagnosis room after performing a scanning on the 24-year-old COVID-19 positive patient admitted to the hospital.

The situation brings to fore the pending request for at least one more CT Scan machine and other critical diagnosis equipment. The hospital has two CT Scan machines. However, one among them has been under repair for over a month.

“A lot of time was taken to carry out the disinfection of the diagnosis room. Other patients had to wait for their turn. How would you feel if you are made to wait for several hours? Why do poor patients have to put up with such delays? The situation might arise again as the COVID-19 positive patient and several suspects of the infection are still admitted here,” sources in know of things said, adding there is need for repair to the existing machine or to buy a new one.

As the State-run tertiary care hospital has been under, and would remain the centre of focus in the coming days, doctors hoped that the government will address long pending need for additional diagnostic equipment. They are hoping that a part of the ₹ 100-crore temporary fund approved by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao would be allotted for the purpose.

“The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine is 13 years old and not functioning efficiently. A new one is needed. Besides, at least five more 2D echo machines are required as some of the machines are not working,” sources stressed.

Superintendent of the hospital Dr P Shravan Kumar could not be reached over phone as he went to Kerala as part of the 12-member team to study containment and prevention of COVID-19.

Officials from the State Health department on condition of anonymity acknowledged the need for more diagnosis machines. “The workload on the machines is phenomenal. There is need for at least two more CT Scanning machines. The government is contemplating to provide them. Tender process would take time,” said the official.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/12yec3/article30994376.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06GNADHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/at-gandhi-hospital-its-a-long-wait-for-diagnostic-tests/article30994377.ece
325,2020/03/06,Preventive measures continue in Hitec City,"Two patients, including a DSM employee, testing negative for COVID-19 comes as huge relief

A day after the coronavirus scare at Raheja Mind Space in Hitec City, IT companies continued to send advisories to employees discouraging direct physical contact and were busy making contingency plans.

An Indian technology company with a significant presence in the city discouraged employees from conducting ‘in-person meetings’, and instead recommended having discussions on voice conference calls or video-conferencing. “The after effects of yesterday’s panic at Mind Space are still being felt. We have been receiving constant reminders about preventive measures for coronavirus in our emails. Another thing is that those who have returned from abroad have been asked to go into isolation for a month, and then get a medical certificate,” said M A Faheem (name changed), a network security specialist.

Another multinational corporation is working on contingency plans to ensure ‘business as usual’ status. “In case there is an outbreak, plans are being made to move work to other sites which have not been impacted. To ensure safety of all employees, toilets, lifts and other common areas are being cleaned more frequently,” said Vishal (name changed), a senior manager in the company.

However, as word of two patients, including a DSM employee, testing negative for coronavirus came, several techies were in for a major relief. “Panic in Building Number 20 was contagious and we all were fearing the worst. But after we got to know that the tests were negative, the panic subsided. But this does not mean that the concern has dissipated. It is very much there,” said Yakub Ahmad, a software engineer.

Meanwhile, Cyberabad Police Commissioner V C Sajjanar, Society for Cyberabad Security Council, Hysea and NASSCOM met employees and heads of facilities of over 250 IT companies to discuss about preventing any panic inducing situation. Mr Sajjanar said that currently, the situation is business as usual, and that companies should bring any false information being spread about coronavirus to the attention of the police.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/grmoll/article30994354.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06-ITEMPLOYEES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/preventive-measures-continue-in-hitec-city/article30994355.ece
326,2020/03/06,"Monitor slums for COVID-19, High Court tells government","‘Consider distribution of sanitisers, disinfectants and masks through Public Distribution System’

Observing that possible outbreak of COVID-19 in the State capital’s slums cannot be ruled out, Telangana High Court on Thursday directed the government to ensure that all slums are regularly monitored.

Hearing a PIL plea seeking ban on celebrations of Holi festival due to coronavirus, a bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy said the government should create sufficient number of isolation wards near the slums. Distribution of sanitisers, disinfectants and masks through Public Distribution System should be considered.

Since the first person from Telangana State testing positive for COVID-19 had flown into Bengaluru from Dubai and reached Hyderabad by bus from there, the bench said the government should think of setting up screening medical teams at all major railway and bus stations in the State. A strategy to deal with such passengers travelling by buses or trains should be evolved, the bench said.

After perusing a brief note presented by senior counsel S. Niranjan Reddy, who was appointed amicus curiae in the case, the bench hoped the government too would study it. Noting that it was aware that the government had sent a team to Kerala to study the model they had adopted to tackle COVID-19, the bench said Telangana government would emulate the same. Advocate General B.S. Prasad informed the bench that so far nearly 18,224 passengers were screened for coronavirus at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport. The Institute of Preventive Medicine Director Dr. Shankar informed the bench that a laboratory for testing samples of potential patients was set up at Gandhi Hospital. It has the capacity to analyse 100 to 200 samples a day.

Action plans

Amicus Curiae S. Niranjan Reddy presented a three-page report citing details of the action plans of World Health Organisation and United Kingdom to check COVID-19. Explaining a ‘modified triage system’ adopted by Kerala State, which witnessed initial cases of the virus, the senior counsel said the State-level committees constituted there were effective.

327,2020/03/06,Sanitation goes for a toss across Hyderabad,"Private agencies yet to take up maintenance and upkeep of 709 kilometres of major roads

Scare of COVID-19 aka coronavirus after confirmation of one positive case, has put the State government on tenterhooks, but failed to move the sanitation juggernaut of GHMC.

Sweeping of the roads and garbage clearance have been hit very badly for the past few days, owing to lack of supervision at zonal-level. Complaints abound about trash piling up everywhere in the city, especially near the blue dumper bins.

Dumper bins in areas such as Nallakunta, Vidyanagar and Kavadiguda are seen overflowing with garbage, and shop keepers had to take brooms in their hands to keep the area clean.

“For the past one week, nobody is coming to sweep the area, nor to lift the garbage. We have been doing the sweeping all by ourselves, so that the shop fronts are clean,” Mohammed Jahangir, a shop owner from Ramnagar, said.

Enquiries with the sanitation staff yielded him a reply that sweeping machines were going to be deployed in the area, hence the GHMC workers are deployed elsewhere.

The GHMC has recently outsourced maintenance and upkeep of 709 kilometres of major roads to private agencies, along with sanitation responsibilities on these roads to the selected bidders.

The agencies were to assume the sanitation responsibilities from March 1. They, however, failed to do so, and sought more time to work out the logistics, officials informed. They have been given time up to March 10 subsequently.

Owing to communication lapse, the extension of sanitation services by GHMC on these respective roads has not reached the field-level staff, and the workers have not been redeployed to their previous locations, sources from GHMC informed.

Recent decentralisation of garbage transport services to the zonal-level officials too has apparently added to the problem, with no centralised authority to focus on the disarray.

Further, deployment of sanitation field assistants on a survey to enumerate illiterate persons in the city too has compounded the issue, sources say.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ockqmw/article30994330.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06GARBAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/sanitation-goes-for-a-toss-across-the-city/article30994331.ece
328,2020/03/06,‘Some musical instruments have their time’,"Father and daughter jazz musician duo, Virginia and Kirk MacDonald will end their India tour in the city this weekend

Saxophonist Kirk MacDonald has been an active player on the Canadian jazz scene, having appeared on over 40 albums as leader or sideman. For the past four or five years, he’s often been accompanied by his daughter Virginia, a clarinettist.

Currently touring India, the father and daughter duo will wind up their desi sojourn with a show in Mumbai this weekend. The two will be accompanied by Neil Swainson on bass and Morgan Childs on drums. “About 60 per cent of our concert will consist of my original compositions. The balance will be standards and some popular new tunes,” says MacDonald. “I’ve been playing with this quartet for a few years now, and we connect well musically,” he adds.

Honing improve skills

MacDonald grew up listening to saxophonists like Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins and Lester Young, and later developed a following for Wayne Shorter, Joe Henderson and Lee Konitz. “I was also lucky to play with known musicians from different regions, and though many of them were one-off collaborations, they helped me widen my horizons and hone my improvisational skills,” he says.

A high point in MacDonald's career was winning the 1999 Juno Award for Best Mainstream Jazz Album for his recording ‘The Atlantic Sessions’. “They are like the Grammys of the jazz world. So you can imagine my delight,” he says. The proud father says he was delighted to see Virginia's interest in jazz from an early age. “I guess it came naturally, given the environment at home and the fact that she regularly attended my shows. But I never played the role of teacher, though I was always ready to guide her. From the beginning, she had a wonderful sense of melody,” he adds.

Carrying on tradition

Virginia, now 25, began learning music at the age of seven. She elaborates, “I went to the community music centre, and I loved the time of the clarinet. And though my early influences were similar to my father, including Charlie Parker and John Coltrane, I was never keen on pursuing the saxophone as a career.”

Besides the older generation of jazz musicians, she listens to contemporary artistes. She explains, “It was a natural inclination, and it’s important for me to follow what others of my age are doing. I also listen to many female artistes, to understand how they think musically, and how they approach composing.”She cites American pianist Carla Bley and young Chilean saxophonist Melissa Aldana as among big influences.

Though the clarinet was very popular from the 1930s to the 1950s, thanks to artistes like Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw and Jimmy Giuffre, it was played only by a few musicians later. Virginia says, “It's hard to explain why, but I guess some instruments have their time, and they come in and go out.” She says the relationship with her father has been very special, “On the one hand, he is a parent, and he fulfills that role. But when we’re rehearsing or playing in bandstands, our collaboration is just like any other group of musicians.”

329,2020/03/06,An enchanting experience,"Despite niggling problems, vocalists Jyothi Sridevi and Sanjay Subrahmanyan provided a feast of Carnatic music to Delhiites

The Indira Gandhi National Centre For the Arts and the Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha organised a Carnatic music concert recently as part of “Sri Muthuswami Dikshidar Day” celebrations. The concert was held at the lecture hall of the IGNCA. The Delhi-based Jyothi Sridevi structured her vocal concert based entirely on the compositions of this legendary composer. Dikshidar is considered one of the musical trinity of Carnatic music (the other two being Shyama Sastri and Tyagaraja). Despite her voice not being in fine fettle on the day of the performance, Sridevi sang brilliantly by interweaving her talent in the thoughtfully selected compositions of the composer. She sang both the popular compositions as well those not heard frequently in the concerts.

Sridevi began her concert with the invocation song to Lord Vinayaka “Vallabha Nayakasya” in Begada raga. The short and creatively crafted kalpanaswaras in rupakam tala for this song as well as for the succeeding song “Swaminatha Paripalaya” in Natta and in Adi tala was reflective of her musical talent in the creative sphere.

After rendering “Sri Nilotpala Nayike” in Reetigowla and “Sri Ranganatam Upasmahe” in Poornachandrika in a delightful manner, Sridevi took up “Hiranmayeem Lakshmeem” in Lalitha and “Meenakshi Memudam” in Poorvikalyani for detailed renditions. In the detailed and unhurried alapanas, she brought out the features of these ragas to the fore in a scintillating manner. Besides, she also took up a phrase in each of these songs for neraval. These and the subsequent kalpanaswaras once again brought to fore her creative talent. The Delhi-based Uma Arun on the violin and K.N. Padmanabhan on the mridangam provided appropriate support to Jyothi Sridevi.

Two things were noteworthy in popular vocalist Sanjay Subrahmanyan’s recent concert in the Capital. One was the seating of students and rasikas of music on the stage around the area where Sanjay himself was performing, bringing the memories of similar such concerts that take place at the Madras Music Academy during the famous December season. The other was Sanjay was not in the company of his usual accompanist (S. Varadarajan- violinist and Neyveli B. Venkatesh – mridangam). Instead, he was in the company of Nagai Muralidharan (violin) and Srimushnam V. Raja Rao (mridangam), besides K. V. Gopalakrishnan (kanjira).

The beauty of Carnatic music is that every accompanying artist is an expert in his chosen field and their musical talent gel swiftly with that of the main artiste. Here too, the situation was no different and it was an enchanting musical evening.

Sanjay sang on the first day of the two-day event titled “Swar Sangam”, organised by the Gurukulam Foundation at the auditorium of the Delhi Tamil Sangam.

His central item was Marimuthu Pillai’s composition “Enneramum oru kalai” in the raga Todi, a song not heard frequently in concerts.

An outstanding raga alapana, the delightful manner in which he sang the composition to a riveting tempo and the kalpanaswaras that flowed with rich creativity were a treat to music lovers. Sadly, the Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi session (“Baktharukku Sahana Sadguru nin malaradi paniyum” in Sahana raga and set to Chadusra jathi tripuda tala) that followed did not get the kind of treatment and was not even in Trikala (three speeds). On their part, the seasoned accompanists regaled the music lovers.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/yoa17/article31002066.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sanjay-Subramanhyan-01,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/an-enchanting-experience/article31002067.ece
330,2020/03/06,Of melodies and memories,"Organised to celebrate the birth centenary of Pandit Ravi Shankar, “Smaran” saw stalwarts of classical music in sublime form

Drenched with the blessings of rain-gods, Nehru Park reverberated with the ringing voice of Pandit Ravi Shankar singing “He Nath, hum par kripa keejiye/ Duur kar andhkar, jnan ka aalok dijiye…”, his own composition in the sonorous swaras of raga Yaman. It was the background score for a short biopic on his life and music that heralded ‘Smaran’: Celebrating 100 years of the Bharat Ratna. Organised by the SRF Foundation with SPIC MACAY and RIMPA (the Ravi Shankar Institute of Music & Performing Arts), the two-day centenary celebration had just begun with the auspicious ‘Mangal-Vadya’ shehnai by Sanjeev and Ashwini Shankar, his youngest disciples playing raga Madhuvanti, that the rains resumed fiercely and the rest of the performances had to be postponed.

“Smaran” was preponed to 3 p.m. the next day and it was perfect time for Bhimpalasi, the melodious afternoon raga one rarely gets opportunity to listen to, but Pt. Vishwa Mohan Bhatt and Pt. Tarun Bhattacharya chose the regular Charukeshi for their duet on Mohan Veena and Santoor. The two senior disciples of Pt. Ravi Shankar took turns to elaborate the raga with Alap-Jod Jhala and two compositions in slow and medium Teentala. The imaginative use of the two tablas tuned to the lower and the upper Shadja got Bickram Ghosh instant applause in his opening uthaan itself. The amiable mukhda (opening phrase) of the drut gat, opening with a fast taan and resting on a melodious meend (oscillation) of Mandra Dhaivat for a surprising sam, was remarkable. There was an alluring alaap in raga Desh prefacing the concluding Vande Mataram enhanced by the Bhajaneek theka of Bickram on his broad-faced tabla that sounded like a Pakhawaj.

Echo effect

Begum Parveen Sultana fondly remembered Pt. Ravi Shankar whom she addressed ‘Kaka-Babu’ (uncle) and how he relished her cooking. She also shared an anecdote when he obliged her husband Dilshad Khan by playing raga Bihari in a concert on his request. Accompanied on harmonium by Vinay Mishra and on tabla by Akram Khan, Parveen opened with raga Madhuvanti, perhaps, unaware of the fact that the raga was already played on the Shehnai earlier. Her slow and medium tempo khayals were adorned with the usual ornamentations including her signature echo effect before she concluded with a Meera bhajan.

The sitar and sarod duet by Shubhendra Rao and Partho Sarathy with Bickram on tabla sounded like a heartfelt homage with Gangeshwari, a raga created by their Guru Pt. Ravi Shankar. Keeping in mind his love for rare and challenging talas, they presented the slow composition in Char-Taal Ki Sawari with a time cycle of 11 beats followed by the faster composition set to drut Ek-tala of 12 beats cycle and maintained it marvellously till the jet-speed jhala without taking refuge in the customary Teentala for convenience sake.

Vidushi Ashwini Bhide expressed her adoration for Pt. Ravi Shankar, accepting that without being under his direct tutelage, she has soaked in sankaras (impressions) from his music. She echoed her feelings through the composition “Eri Aali bhaag jage…..” in raga Jhinjhoti. Thinking of his penchant for different talas, she presented a Dhamar in raga Lalit-Pancham invoking Basant Ritu, with decisive design and detail. The intricate variety of ‘Bol-Baant’ dividing the 14 beats of Dhamar Tala also underlined the remarkable difference in her treatment of Dhamar with Bol-Taans and the following khayal “Khelan aye Shyam mose Hori…” with aakar and sargam taans, despite the tender touches of the twin-Madhyam of Lalit in both the compositions of Lalit-Pancham. The concluding dadra “Sakal Brij dhoom machi…” enhanced by the romantic touches of harmonium by Vinay Mishra and the Banarasi Laggi on tabla by Vinod Lele completed her well-conceived concert that vouched for her fierce integrity and power of inheritance.

“Smaran” reached its climax with the melodious flute recital by Pt. Hariprasad Chaurasia inspired by the wit and vigour of Ud. Zakir Hussain on tabla. His soul-stirring Bihag with aalap and a couple of compositions set to Rupak and Teentala and the concluding dhun in the romantic raga Pilu, was ably supported by disciples Shuchismita and Vivek Sonar on flute. The lilting gait of the dadra augmented by the charismatic inputs of Zakir, left the audience enthralled. It was after a long time that one found Pandit Chaurasia in such high spirits.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/u0vfma/article31001979.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sarod-Sitar-duet-Smaran,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/of-melodies-and-memories/article31001980.ece
331,2020/03/06,S. P. Balasubrahmanyam in nostalgic mode: 'I sat under a mango tree and cried',"Legendary singer SPB recalls his early days as a budding artiste, from getting yelled at, to welcoming a heavy cold as it suited some songs better

With a career spanning over five decades, the singer par excellence still remains unmatched. Age has not withered his voice, nor has constant singing made it stale. Veteran musicologist and critic VAK Ranga Rao once said, “S P Balasubrahmanyam is a phenomenon. He has a fine voice which always sings true. He has a deep awareness, a basic feel for aesthetics of film music. Adding to all this is a raging enthusiasm; a respect for the art, which is his profession. And an open mind.”

The raging enthusiasm is still evident in the iconic singer as he nurtures young talents week after week for close to 25 years now through a popular television programme.

SPB went down memory lane recollecting his early days as budding singer. Apart from his mentor S P Kodandapani and his bosom friend and composer Chakravarthy, it was the unassuming but greatly talented music director Sathyam (Chellapilla Sathyanrayana Sastry) helped SPB evolve as a playback singer. Much before SPB sang the semi-classical songs and won a national award for Sankarabharanam (1980), Sathyam gave him song to a sing in that genre, Naaree rasamadhuri... for Prateekaaram (1969) which was considered by critics as one of his best renditions.

S P Balasubrahmanyam with Satyam

“It was one of my favourite songs too,” recalls SPB, adding, “My association with Sathyam garu started with Palamanasulu (1968) and the first song I have sung for him was Aapaleni Thaapamaaye, a duet with the versatile L R Easwari at Golden Studios recording theatre. She was very popular at that time. I was unable to match to the expectation of Sathyam garu and he shouted at me saying incompetent people are coming to the industry. The studio was amidst a mango garden. Unable to bear the insult, sitting under a mango tree, I cried. The movie’s production manager Atluri Poornachandra Rao and production executive Y V Rao (both were later day popular producers) consoled me and took me to Sathyam, and chided him saying that, ‘He is a young boy. You shouldn’t treat him in such harsh way before the orchestra. Give him space to sing better’. Sathyam replied, ‘Yevarevarino theesukochi paadistaarandi. Yela... yeppatiki thelaali’ (You people bring somebody and ask me to make them sing, how... when can I complete the recording). Of course, he recorded the song again in my voice. That was my first experience with him.""

“Sathyam garu had no children. He always addressed me as koduku (son) and later never recorded a song without me. He used to say, ‘naa kodukoo, naa gathram naaku kaavaali (I need my son, my voice). I have rendered many melodious songs under his baton and in fact it was his composition, ye divilo virisina parijathamo (Kannevayasu -1973) that gave an amazing turning point to my singing career,"" SPB explains.

“One of my most favourite songs under his composition was, naaree rasamadhuree lahari anuraaga vallari aananda jhari written by the soft spoken and good natured writer Chervu Anjaneya Sastry. At one time, there was a great demand for the song from netizens and fortunately someone uploaded it. Do you know that I sang that song with a heavy bout of cold? For some songs, such a voice suits it perfectly!"" (smiles)

Some of the other hit songs he had rendered under a spell of heavy cold were Mama chandamama (Sambarala Rambabu), Kaluvaku chandrudu yentho dooram (Chillara Devullu), and the Tamil super hit song, Vetri meethu vetri vanthu for the MGR-Jayalalitha starrer, Thedi vantha Mappillai.

“Sathyam garu was not only a father-figure for me but also a friend and a guide who taught me the nuances of stylised singing and introduced me to Hindustani music,” signs off SPB.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/a8sop3/article30998376.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf06SP-Balasubrahmanyamjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/s-p-balasubrahmanyam-in-nostalgic-mode-i-sat-under-a-mango-tree-and-cried/article30998378.ece
332,2020/03/06,A vocal touch to the veena,"The multi-faceted musician Ramana Balachandran made good use of his vocal strengths in a recent veena concert

Bengaluru-based Ramana Balachandran, 17, who had learnt to identify ragas as a toddler and had claimed in an interview that the veena chose him (and not the other way round), came down to Hyderabad for an instrumental concert organised by Sri Karthikeya Gana Sabha recently. The weekend evening was proof of how well he has blossomed into a skilful instrumentalist over the years (he plays the mridangam too). Currently training under his musician father Balachandran, Ramana lends distinctness to his veena concerts with an appealing vocal touch.

Commencing most of his concerts by offering the audience a flavour of the vaggeyakara’s sahitya through the pallavi, he gradually progresses towards the instrumental segment and makes a surprise return to the lyrical element in a later charanam almost effortlessly. The vocal and instrumental segments seamlessly segued with his opening number, Thyagaraja’s Ninne Bhajana in Nata ragam. The many gamakas and the imaginative swarakalpana in the higher tempo gave the rendition a flourish in a ragam that is conventionally touched upon at the beginning of a concert.

His next choice was Challare Ramachandruni in Ahiri ragam. Known to evoke the karuna rasa and believed to be one of the most difficult ragas to render on a veena, Ramana displayed impressive restraint in exploring the several contours of Ahiri. The textured composition received its due on the instrument and the youngster followed it up with an assured performance of another challenging kriti Sri Narada Naada. The pensively styled composition with varying scales is always a firm test of skill for a musician. The swara delineation proved that the ornamental, gamaka-driven Kanada ragam is best savoured on the veena.

Among the many masterpieces that Balamuralikrishna has composed, Meenakshi Jayada in Hamsanandi is certainly a jewel in his crown. The ease with which the young musician balanced the veena, singing the complex charanams addressing Goddess Durga and was supported by the mridangam artiste Raghavan Sai, resulted in a compelling output that served a timely reminder of the composer’s musical genius. The majesticity of a Ghana ragam like Bhairavi was elaborated at length in Ramana’s ragalapana before presenting Thyagaraja’s Raksha Bettare. The neraval and manodharma at Sangeethapriya sustained the musician’s fine momentum.

In times when RTP rarely makes it to vocal concerts beyond the annual music festivals, it was a welcome surprise to watch Ramana take up the hummable, melodic Brindavana Sarangi ragam as the main item. Gurunatha Aruna Gurunatha Ramana Karuna Satchidananda was his choice of lyrics for the pallavi segment. The charm of the ragam comes from its glides and subtle modulation, which Ramana successfully elicited in multiple tempos. The camaraderie between the percussionist and the veena artiste made it an enriching experience as well. Rendering one of Nedunuri Krishnamurthy’s most complex compositions among the Ramadasu kirtanas, Emayya Rama in Kambhoji ragam, the musician had proved that he was prepared to take the rough road ahead. Though a few madhyama kala kritis would have made the concert livelier and could’ve provided momentary relief to the musician too, the youngster’s courageous choices showed he belonged to a different breed.

Swati Tirunal’s Vishweshwara Darshan, probably the simplest of numbers that Ramana played during the evening, worked well as an attempt to lend lingual diversity to the lineup with the brief vocal portions. Sans any showmanship, here were two confident youngsters who commanded the rasikas to sit through a nearly three-hour concert with rapt attention.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/59zj1l/article30997748.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf06ramachandran-1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ramana-balachandran/article30997749.ece
333,2020/03/06,The mechanics of crafting transitions,"For ensemble pieces in theatre, where actors never once leave the stage, what becomes all important are the transitions between scenes — how the action, settings and mood segue in transforming ways from one set-piece to the next. But often, even in projects with an extended period of rehearsals, transitions are sometimes afterthoughts put into place much closer to show-dates than might be considered desirable by an anxious stage manager. There have been cases when actors have been thrown in at the deep end, to figure their own way from one scene to the next, and they’ve, of course, been up to the task.

Fleeting, integral moments

Is a transition pure mechanics or does it involve some craft on the part of the actor? When doubling up as an almost impromptu stagehand, an actor must display precision and timing and an ability to become part of the furniture while also staying alive as a character or simply a figure in the backdrop still cloaked in meaning. Swept away or brought in, props are in essence the artificial crutches (although some have enterprisingly described them as co-actors) that help actors slip into the characters they play. But multi-tasking as a functioning extra when still mulling over a character’s motivations is a tough ask at times especially to those who might want to lose themselves in a performance, arriving at the truth by escaping the veneer of an ‘acting’ performer. It often seems like too much effort for a transition that might last all of sixteen counts. Which is why we have production assistants and fade-outs in most standard issue theatre productions.

However, fade-outs in theatre have now begun to be considered with a degree of suspicion. Things that go bump in the dark, furtive figures stumbling about, glow-tape conspicuously outlining just about anything, or simply a rupture to on-stage proceedings just when the drama was beginning to get engaging. Audiences increasingly expect both immersion and seamlessness in order to be lulled into a satisfying theatre-going experience, shorn of brass tacks and backstage intrigues. Whether they are entitled to this premeditated suspension of disbelief is another question, but usually the bums on seats model of functioning affects the way we create our theatre much more (insidiously or otherwise) than we might care to admit.

Fine-tuning performances

But, there is something to be said about actors’ labour and processes being visible on stage. Often, we don’t notice actors ‘working’ because we have bought in spectacularly into the world they have created for us with just the snap of their fingers, in a manner of speaking. The effortlessness of ‘being’ makes us believe that they presence on stage is almost facile, which it is anything but, because even actors who do not achieve any kind of virtuosity on stage put in labour. Blood-letting comes with the turf. Actors are like sportspeople in reality, they are emotional athletes who traverse lifetimes in what might be a play’s limited running time. Audiences ride along for the journey, and sometimes a performance might take an emotional toll on them, but never a physical toll. Which is why watching theatre is as vicarious an activity as any other. Which is why watching actors limber up before a show is a performative event in itself, and even a privilege, much like how the tuning of the musical instruments that comprise an orchestra takes place in full view. Those discordant beginnings are as important a part of the concert-going experience as the opening credits of a movie – we feel cheated if the opening frames jump straight into the action. Yet, we have been partial to curtains drawn shut and darkened auditorium, because the ‘start line’ of a play is still sacrosanct, and its sanctity must be preserved.

334,2020/03/06,Inside Tarun Tahiliani’s 25 years,"The rightful king of India Modern, Tarun Tahiliani, turns 25 in the industry

Tarun Tahiliani’s 25th anniversary celebrations will include a book from Mapin later this year, which will document his “journey up to this point and the synthesis”. From demonetisation to Income Tax raids to the rise of other design superstars in India, he has survived it all. More from him:

Over 25 years of swatches, sketches, mannequins and the runway. What stands out from this journey?

I think fashion is also about a deep engagement with the time and tide we live in. I am particularly anxious about trying to keep our Indian-ness because when we are westernised, it is perceived as a higher value, and we have got to change that. We have got to own our Indian-ness. Nothing stands out more than to say you’ve got to just keep swimming upstream with your convictions like the salmon going upstream; might seem suicidal but in a way, there is nothing else you can do.

Do comment on others hijacking your idea of India Modern?

Nobody owns the paisley, nobody owns the maang tikka and nobody owns India Modern. Everyone has their own interpretation for lack of a better terminology, or for the fact that it is such a good term. Everybody is free to define what they think India Modern is. As long as it is done properly it is terrific!

The challenges of attempting a synthesis of different cultures today.

The challenge is there is too much sensory overload and everybody is in some bewildered mix because as we have more urbanisation, single unit homes, single children and both parents working, there is very little time to transmit culture. Popular culture comes over phones, television and the internet and it is anyone’s guess who is watching what. There is also no censorship, which used to be there earlier so people’s minds are often unhinged. In this context, to keep harping on India may sound didactic, but it is what it is.

What went into creating your archive at the atelier?

We started organising it a few years back. We’ve always stored swatches and sketches. It is an impressive body to look at and I can assure you we have lost at least 15% of our very good quality swatches because embroiderers would take them and not return them. Now we do not allow anything out of the factory. It is a great thing for embroiderers or younger designers to look at. Like the brands abroad, if this brand has to survive, a strong archive is a necessity.

Plans for both Jamdani and New Brocade?

We work with wonderful people in West Bengal who are doing [Jamdani]. They are simple designs, so that the motifs that are used in chikankari are used in jamdani. I am dying to see jamdani with chikankari. Also, finally I have that softness and the dullness I like in our brocades. I hope to see them in every possible form. Some of the brocades I have seen people wear at their weddings... OMG, I am shocked to see that people like to wear something that garish!

If 2018 was a year of disquiet for you, what is 2020 shaping up to be?

Mad recession, crazy disquiet on internal dissent and now the [Covid-19] virus.

335,2020/03/06,Love in péro’s lane,"In an ongoing exhibition, Aneeth Arora looks back at 10 years of péro, and hopes to share the joy of creating garments with her team and a wider audience

“It is the building with red hearts,” says a person from Aneeth Arora’s team, directing me to a large yellow bungalow on Barakhamba Road. There are different-sized hearts everywhere — in an installation out on the lawn, dangling in the porch, and painted on the building. ‘Time to Love’, péro’s 10th anniversary homage to people and processes, is all about slowing down to appreciate the time it takes to create garments. “We are so caught up in this fashion cycle of doing one season and trying to be fresh every six months. We’ve lost the enjoyment of the process. The idea is not just to invite people into our world, but for them to come and view what goes behind it,” says Arora, as we sip chai and eat Parle-G biscuits from a thelewala within the courtyard of the house that was once an orphanage.

He is a live installation of sorts, capturing the slow life of sitting down on moras and watching saris waft in the breeze. The 50 pieces of fabric, from 15 to 20 regions of India, all hung on bamboo poles, are part of another installation that represents the brand’s ethos of creating their own textile. Each has a line embroidered on, about what the fabric is, where it is made, and how long it takes to make: “Cotton Silk Kota Doria, handwoven, 300 cm a day in the ancient Rajput city of Kota on the banks of the Chambal River in South Rajasthan,” reads one piece.

Slow and steady

“We decided there has to be a time aspect to everything we showcased,” says Arora. So when you walk in, there’s a seamstress working on a garment. In front of her is a screen that shows a time lapse video of how the garment has been built over a number of days. “I told the women, ‘Aaraam se karo’ (work slowly), and the joy that they felt when I said that you could see it in their work. The hemming became so beautiful.” The garment was slated to be done in time for a show planned on March 12, as part of the now-postponed Lotus Make-up India Fashion Week. The SS 2020 collection, named Millefiori (‘1,000 flowers’ in Italian), revolves around a technique of the same name that was originally used to create mosaic beads in glass. péro will use polymer clay for the first time, to fashion its buttons in a similar fashion. The exhibition began during the time of the India Art Fair, carried on through India Design ID and was meant to finish with the fashion week, so three sets of professionals could view it.

Despite that, there has been no rush to ‘complete’ the exhibition by a particular date, and rooms have been added slowly. There is a scarf room to show the different dimensions and kinds of edging done across the decade of péro’s being; a ‘Matching Centre’ where cloth is stacked, a heart at its centre; and a button room that shows more than 3,000 buttons done to date. In fact, one season, when the brand did polka dots (2013), they created 1,000 buttons. When Arora realised this, she says it made her pause: “It is making me think whether my processes are right, because maybe I’m overindulgent. Maybe I’m doing too much… Should I be impractical like the way I’ve been or should I now start to become more practical in my processes?”

The button room

The room that’s meant to induce goosebumps is the one that houses a white tent that looks into a pool of water, its reflection creating another perspective. Commissioned by the Devi Art Foundation in 2015, as a part of their show called Fracture, it is a 11 x 9 x 8 foot white crochet and lace creation that took 50 people 18,000 hours and three lakh metres of thread to create. This element of the process being collective is what Arora has tried to establish, but refusing to be the brand’s face (she enjoys being its voice though) has not been easy, with publications even refusing to do stories around it. “It is always a collective,” she says, adding that she’d rather the work speak for itself. Today, when people call the workshop they’ll ask if it’s péro speaking, and that makes her happy.

336,2020/03/06,One night at the Qutub: Celebrating 25 years of Tarun Tahiliani,"Infusing his brand with hope and resilience, Tarun Tahiliani makes his 25th anniversary extra special, with a stroll in the Qutub Minar Complex, a studio visit and a celebration at home

Bring your walking shoes, reads the invitation. For an evening stroll in the Qutub Minar Complex. But with Tarun Tahiliani zipping in and out of rooms and nimbly up the stairs at his Gurgaon atelier, that should have been a requisite for the entire day. TT (as the Delhi-based fashion designer is known in the industry) runs us through the installations — of recent innovations with brocade (New Brocade, he calls it), Jamdani, key pieces from summer wedding collections, his enviable archive room and 25 signature garments reinterpreted for the 25th year of his eponymous brand.

Also Read Inside Tarun Tahiliani’s 25 years

We spot garments and accessories worn by famous actors, royalty and Indian supermodels. He talks about modernising Indian couture by making it lightweight, and encourages closer inspection of a ‘new brocade’ pink lehenga — soft, weightless and well-suited to the drape he mastered decades ago. Stragglers among the fashion scribes and influencers, lingering over tables bearing embellished clutches (from his mother’s collection) and embroidered jewellery, are gently herded on. It is only mid-day, but the rather ambitious itinerary hadn’t accounted for Mahashivratri traffic between us in Gurgaon and the flagship store in Mehrauli. It appears Tarun’s plan to get us to see the different processes, the toiles (mockups), and the embroidery units, will have to wait.

Women who have influenced Jaswanti, my mother, encouraged me in the arts; Sailaja pushed me to study [at FIT], has always been a guiding light, and Ensemble was her idea; Tina, who partnered me and ran and built the retail for years. We have a mutually mothering relationship; Mehr [Jesia], who is a friend, model, fashion muse and more. It is incredible how grounded and pure she has stayed; and Minal Modi, my style mentor. There are so many more who have taught me, from Mallika Srinivasan and Simi Garewal to Swati Piramal and others.

Message from the HQ

Designed about 12 years ago, by French architect Stephane Paumier, this expansive studio with exposed brickwork and vaulted skylights is where Tahiliani spends much of his day. With a workforce of about 950. At the entrance, two T-shaped pillars mimic the logo of his brand, while the arches inspired by the Islamic monuments in the capital point to his passion for architecture and the synthesis of different cultures.

Tahiliani, 57, that rare breed of designer who can promise relevance and longevity with his garments, is typically forthright. The Wharton-educated son of an Indian Navy admiral wishes aloud that the fashion industry would work together than against each other. When someone in the group brings up the legacy of his brand, he says, “Legacy is too pretentious a word. We have understood construction and draping.” He talks about a time when specialists who draped (in India) never embroidered, when the tailoring was “so bad and the armholes so tight”. He remembers how everyone wanted to design for “women in lycra petticoats who who ate three lettuces a day”.

That said, his studio is extremely conscious about fit. “Everyone has a need, that’s how [Coco] Chanel found her tweed,” he quips. The TT Bride — he has dressed about 15,000 — wants her lehenga to be light enough to dance in all night. “A lot of girls just buy off the rack. And while we are not principally bridal, there is a push for us to do more — the boho bride, the gypsy bride, the khadi bride…” He admits they like to be a little sexy, a little sheer, often with a tulle veil anchored to the head with a single pin. His most recent celebrity bride, the talented actor Devika Bhise, who wore Tarun Tahiliani to almost all her Indian ceremonies, might be a case in point.

Open to influences

It isn’t just his industry that Tahiliani is outspoken about. He has stated his views on the Citizenship Amendment Act, one of the few designers to do so. Supportive of his embroiderers, most of them Muslim — “it is true that a lot of the craft is done by Muslims of all ages as embroidery was part of their tradition” — he recognises individual talent.

On recent reports About embroiderers in fashion houses, mostly Muslim artisans specialising in zardozi, tilla, mukaish work, etc, returning to their villages amid growing unrest: “Absolutely not. We are working at full capacity. There are certain days when people close to those areas feel insecure and stay in. I’m sure people have been affected in East or North Delhi, and it is tragic that the cops have not been active in stopping it. What’s worse is these rumour mills are fuelling more insecurity. It is up to the political leaders to make people feel secure and to look to the economy, neither of which they seem to be doing. That’s what the real problem is. I think there have been a lot of lay-offs.”

This is reiterated by his staff. Masuma Naqvi, 34, who heads his Embroidery Concepts team, says Tahiliani encourages new learning, be it with draping, painting, embroidery or digital prints. Trips to museums and monuments in Agra, Jaipur and, last year, Egypt, are organised for a wider view of cultural motifs and architecture, which is then interpreted on the design floor. It is something she, with 10 years in the industry and a stint with Anju Modi, had not experienced earlier. “They bring something of their heritage, their understanding of art, their hand,” explains Tahiliani, whose inspirations are wide-ranging, be it the Kumbh or, this year, the Qutub Minar.

On the one hand he remains faithful to both shape and drape, but he is also open to contemporary design intervention. Former associates like Amit Aggarwal have gone on to find independent success (Aggarwal’s futuristic design vocabulary with recycled polymers and water-finished metallic chiffons, makes him one of the most interesting Indian designers to track today), and Tarun continues to mentor some of them.

Past meets present

The studio has large blow-ups from past photoshoots, mostly of all-time muse, Mehr Jesia. Jesia, who accompanies us later on the Qutub Minar walk, says she finds TT creations as relevant and wearable today as they were 25 years ago. Our visit ends with the big celebration at Tahiliani’s home, featuring a South Indian menu and some of his dearest friends. It is, as his beautiful wife, Sailaja (or Sal), puts it, a typical day in her husband’s life. “He goes to the studio, then the store, makes time for an evening walk in the Qutub Minar complex, and then comes home.”

It is a boring life, jokes Tahiliani. Then adds, “I always love walking in the Qutub Minar. Most of my friends in Delhi have not seen it (lit up at night, a recent government initiative), and I thought most of you would not have seen it either.” He is right about that. It is also the perfect setting to think about divisive politics, our diversity, and a past we are proud to have in our present.

337,2020/03/06,Why Aza Fashions has a penchant for glamour,"Aza Fashions’ Hyderabad trunk show will feature big names in the fusion design and sustainable sub-cultures of luxury fashion

There is something about a trunk show that implies exclusivity, and one curative name which has done well in furthering this is Mumbia-based Aza Fashions. Saloni Sancheti, social media manager and marketing pro at the company, unravels some interesting research, the luxury fashion world requires.

“We believe that there is more to fashion than just picking up an outfit that seems attractive. We constantly make an attempt to make our trunk shows more experiential and conversational, and a lot of efforts are put in curating different experiences for each city,” explains Saloni, “For instance, in Dubai we had held a brunch-of-sorts for our visitors and when we did a show in Kolkata, we had a photoshoot and party with famous stars of Tollywood. Of course, it’s about investing in these garments, but we want to give our visitors a truly luxurious experience and service while they are at it, which extends beyond just being able to touch and feel the outfit.”

Speaking of Dubai, Saloni says there are major similarities between the India and Dubai markets, “Both markets enjoy a penchant for wearing luxurious styles and have a similar appreciation for designers like Anamika Khanna, Manish Malhotra and Tarun Tahiliani, to name a few. When it comes to enjoying grandeur, both India and Dubai have a taste for it.”

Coming to Hyderabad, Aza Fashions has to mould their curations to the city’s personality. “For Bengaluru, we carried a vast rage of summer-friendly pieces featuring more neutral colour palettes, easy silhouettes at a reasonably price point. For Hyderabad, we are carrying more fusion styles and designers like Astha Narang, Avvantikaa Parwani, Niharika Kamani, Sana Barreja, etcetera, which are perfect for the upcoming wedding season.”

Aza Fashions also has sustainability is a big part of their mission, “As a brand, we always make conscious efforts to not add to our carbon footprint. We usually have a great mix of designers, and for the Hyderabad show, we have labels like Pramaa by Pratima Pandey and Tokree who are doing their fair share in making sustainable fashion extremely chic.”

Bent on trends?

Saloni amusedly points out that, at this point of Aza Fashions’ lifetime, nothing really surprises them anymore in terms of trends, adding, “We have been the arbitrators of style for some time now and this always helps us forecast apropos trends for the season. If you talk about Spring/Summer 2020, we’re seeing a lot of print-on-print. You’ll spot this in collections by designers Payal Pratap, Aarti Vijaygupta Rajdeep Ranawat to name a few. This season is also a lot about wearing a lot of vibrant colours like neon hues; think Papa Don’t Preach and Arpita Mehta, and the king of kitsch, Manish Arora. We’re also seeing a slow rise in the number of people who are choosing to mix high-and-low fashion, like wearing your shirt with lehengas and saris. There’s no hard and fast rule about dictating personal style anymore. You will see that the line separating your western closet from your ethnic one is really blurring.”

The Aza Fashions trunk show will be taking place on Saturday March 7 from 11 am till 8 pm, at Park Hyatt, Road Number 2, Banjara Hills.",fashion,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/d2ibnj/article30999757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Niharika-Kamani,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/aza-fashion-trunk-show-march-2020-hyderabad-luxury-and-sustainable-designers/article30999761.ece
338,2020/03/06,House of cards,"IIM Kozhikode uses poker to teach MBA students competitive strategy. With India’s first National Poker Series 2020 around the corner, meet the academic players who leave nothing to chance

Eyebrows were raised when professor Deepak Dhayanithy suggested introducing poker as an elective at IIM Kozhikode six years ago. While the faculty committee listened to his proposal intently, the most obvious question arose: “Are you going to teach students to gamble?”

“It was a good question,” says Dhayanithy. “Because what most people don’t know about poker is that those who do well in the game are not winning by chance. They are working really hard towards it. This question called out the elephant in the room.”

He was able to convince the faculty body on the efficacy of using the game to teach strategy. So, ‘Competitive Strategy — the Game of Poker’ was included in the second year MBA elective course in 2014. Since then, the number of students who choose the elective has been on the rise, he says. MIT, University of Berkeley, Harvard and Yale offer opportunities, including courses on poker theory and analytics. Some of these universities offer online courses on poker as well.

Now, as online poker portal PokerBaazi hosts India’s first National Poker Series 2020, a live poker tournament in the end of April, with an aim to promote poker in India, the game is back in the spotlight. It has always been of academic interest globally, triggering endless debates that analyse whether it is a game of skill or luck. This 19th century game that is believed to have originated in the US, has caught on all over the world, from casinos to websites. India has a growing number of poker players, who take the game seriously, spending hours playing and mastering their skill. Several FB groups of online poker players exist, with an increasing number of members.

The premise that Dhayanithy built on was that playing poker demands discipline. “I was born and brought up in Chennai and I grew up playing cards. I have seen a few people who always won. This led me to the notion that they are not winning purely by chance.” Poker, according to Dhayanithy, can help students experience competitive strategy, complementing their learning from text books. “It can teach students plan, ploy, position, pattern and perspective — Canadian academic Henry Mintzberg’s five Ps of strategy. The game deals with probability, competition, resources management and decision-making challenges. As the student gains practice in the game, he or she also imbibes these concepts that have applicability in the real world, explains Dhayanithy.

Bridging it Much like poker, Bridge, a card game is popular in IITs and IIMs. “It can be employed as an effective tool to teach management,” says Professor Robins Jacob, former Head of the Department of Economics, St. Alberts College, Kochi and the former president of the Kerala Bridge Association. “It is a partnership game and one has to communicate effectively with a mimimum vocabulary of 15 words.

One also learns team dynamics, and social interaction,” he says.



Jacob says introducing Bridge at the school level would help children understand the importance of planning, sequencing and timing, which can be imbibed through the game. In fact, bridge is already taught in school in countries like Netherlands and the US.

Ashik Vadakkan, a business associate at 9 Stacks, an online poker company that runs tournaments for IIMs every year, is a recreational player. He spends about an hour a day playing. “It is exciting as it is pure mathematics. Poker is an easy game to learn, but extremely difficult to master,” he says. Ashik has been playing for four years. “I know of serious players who invest a lot of time in the game. It is a 4:1 ratio, where in they spend four hours playing and one hour to learn the subtler, more complicated nuances of the game. Many of them would easily spend up to 10 hours, playing four to five tables simultaneously.”

While live poker cannot be played in India, as casinos and “gambling” are illegal; online poker is legal as long as the website deduces taxes from the players. The Karnataka High Court had legalised poker in a verdict in 2013, which declared it could be played in recreational clubs. In States such as Goa, Sikkim, Nagaland and Daman, where casinos are legal, it can be played.

Corporate companies too are promoting poker as a mind game. “Poker helps you understand the opponents’ psychology and your own – for example, deep insight into how do you feel when you win versus how you feel when you lose,” says Dhayanithy.",colleges,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/education/colleges/iim-kozhikode-uses-poker-to-teach-strategy/article31001362.ece
339,2020/03/06,Man assaulted for entering temple with his scheduled caste wife,"A couple has complained that relatives of the husband, Balamurugan (41), a caste Hindu, beat him and his wife belonging to Scheduled Caste as they offered prayers at a village temple near here.

In a petition submitted to the Superintendent of Police, P. Perumal, the woman has complained that the Aruppukottai Taluk police have not registered a case under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and have not taken any action so far.

The man, a bus driver in a private company, had married the woman from a Scheduled Caste.

“Though my parents have accepted us, my relatives objected to my wife entering the Ramar temple and assaulted her and abused her denoting her caste,” Balamurugan said.

“We had come to our village on February 29 and my 18-month-old son entered the temple. I followed him and sat during the bhajan session,” the husband said.

His wife, who came in search of them, also entered the temple. “As the deeparathana was going on then, my wife also offered prayers. It was then that my relatives, Velmurugan, Narayanasamy and Muthukrishnan held her by her neck and pushed her out of the temple abusing her,” he said.

When Balamurugan tried to prevent them, he was also beaten up.

He suffered injuries and was admitted to the Government Hospital in Aruppukottai for five days.

340,2020/03/06,MLA joins in dharna for drinking water,"300 families had no water supply for the past three months

MLA Geetha Jeevan, who got elected in 2016 with the poll promise of ensuring drinking water supply everyday, staged a dharna in front of the Corporation on Friday seeking drinking water connection to a residential area, which is a ‘waterways poramboku land’ as per government records.

After Ooruni Oththaveedu with 300 families became part of ward 51 of the Corporation, drinking water supply given to this area even as it was a village panchayat, was stopped three months ago. Even as the residents were seeking drinking water supply from the Corporation, Ms. Geetha, along with the women from Ooruni Oththaveedu, staged dharna in front of the Corporation for a while on Friday.

When the protestors submitted petition to Commissioner V. P. Jayaseelan to press their demand, he told them that domestic drinking water connections could not be given to the houses as this area had been classified as ‘waterways poramboku land’.

“The only solution is that every five houses of the area can be given a drinking water tap in common to solve the problem,” Mr. Jayaseelan said.

341,2020/03/06,Boating services at Karankadu to resume in a week,"Certain modifications in the mechanised boats like removal of roofs have been undertaken as a safety measure.

After a month since boating services inside the mangrove forests at Karankadu here were temporarily stopped, the facility will resume in a week’s time, said Forest Department officials.

Dinkar Kumar, Chief Conservator of Forests (Virudhunagar circle), A. S. Marimuthu, Wildlife Warden, Ramanathapuram, P. Arun Kumar, District Forest Officer, and S. Ganesa Lingam, Assistant Conservator of Forest, conducted an inspection at the eco-tourism site on Friday to assess the availability of facilities and the upgradation of safety measures.

The Forest Department has been running an eco-tourism project at Karankadu where tourists are taken in mechanised boats inside the mangrove forests on a one-hour ride. The services were temporarily stopped after a six-year-old boy fell down from a boat and drowned in the backwaters in January.

Ramanathapuram forest range Officer S. Satish said that 30 new life jackets were brought from Andaman and Nicobar Islands. “In addition, a separate life jacket point has been started to ensure that every rider wears a life jacket during the boat trip,” he said.

He also added that certain modifications in the mechanised boats like removal of roofs have been undertaken as a safety measure. New toilets and dressing rooms have also been constructed, said Mr. Satish.

Mr. Marimuthu said that a meeting was held with the members of the fishermen community last week regarding the functioning of the eco-tourism site. “The community urged us to revive the project soon. In addition, we have got the clearance from the District Collector too. Hence the services will be resumed within a week,” he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/o0bbhj/article31002882.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA07MANGROVERMD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/boating-services-at-karankadu-to-resume-in-a-week/article31002883.ece
342,2020/03/06,"₹1,000 crore sought to make Kanniyakumari an international tourist destination","The ITDC should conduct packaged tours to places of worship in the district besides taking the visitors to the picnic spots like Maathur Thottipaalam, Thirparappu Falls

The Union Government’s Department of Tourism should allocate ₹1,000 crore for creating tourist-friendly amenities in Kanniyakumari to transform it into an international tourist destination, MP H. Vasanthakumar has said.

In a memorandum submitted to Meenakshi Sharma, Director, Department of Tourism, Government of India, Mr. Vasanthakumar said Kanniyakumari, which was attracting over a crore tourists every year including foreign visitors coming to neighbouring Kerala, had to be given a makeover with more tourist-friendly facilities to receive more tourists. Since the livelihood of a good number of people from this region chiefly relies upon tourists visiting the southern tip of the country, the Union Government should invest a decent sum of ₹1,000 crore to take the tourism industry to the next level.

The Department of Tourism, through Indian Tourism Development Corporation, should create visitor-friendly hotel and dormitories with better facilities including a travel desk in Kanniyakumari, which should be declared as a ‘national tourist destination’. Since this windy place is known for its fierce waves throughout the year, water surfing and yacht racing sport should be created, he said.

Besides keeping the beaches clean, facilities to attract tourists like shades, giant umbrellas, toilets, protected drinking water etc. should be created along the beaches. Electric cars or battery-operated vehicles should be introduced in Kanniyakumari so that visitors can visit all the points without polluting the area. For children, toy trains should be introduced to take them to the important places in Kanniyakumari. Clean and tidy toilets should be constructed at vantage points in and around Kanniyakumari.

A giant statue of late Chief Minister K. Kamaraj, whose contributions had taken Tamil Nadu to greater heights, should be installed near the statue of Thiruvalluvar. A centre for showcasing the culture of Tamil Nadu and the martial arts of the land should be established.

The ITDC should conduct packaged tours to places of worship in the district besides taking the visitors to the picnic spots like Maathur Thottipaalam, Thirparappu Falls etc.

Since Kanniyakumari is the southern tip of the country’s mainland, the Government of India should construct a fitting structure like Gateway of India near ‘Triveni Sangamam’ Kanniyakumari where a 1,000 feet-tall mast should be erected in a sprawling park for hoisting the national flag with impressive illumination.

An aquarium showcasing the marine life of this region should also be created.

“I have invited Ms. Meenakshi to visit Kanniyakumari to understand its tourism potential so that sufficient funds can be allocated to make it an international tourist destination,” Mr. Vasanthakumar said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/433t6a/article31002866.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA07VASANTHTVL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/1000-crore-sought-to-make-kanniyakumari-an-international-tourist-destination/article31002868.ece

344,2020/03/06,BB Kulam channel presents a sorry picture,"It has turned into a dump owing to public apathy

Madurai

Around a year back, Madurai Corporation officials had cleared around 750 kg of waste from BB Kulam channel and the stormwater drains on Gokhale Road. This was done to direct water from the Periyar irrigation channel to BB Kulam channel and finally drain into the Prasanna Venkatachalapathy Temple tank in Tallakulam through the stormwater drains on Gokhale Road.

The efforts of the civic body paid off as water was stored at the tank for nearly five months, which, in turn, helped to improve the groundwater level in nearby areas.

But, today the BB Kulam presents a sorry picture at Chokkikulam here, as it has again turned into a receptacle for household garbage and waste. It was filled with layers of garbage and plastic waste- all on a bed of sewage.

R. Subburaj, a resident of Gokhale Road -Lane 1, said that the absence of door-to-door collection of waste by Corporation workers had forced the residents to dump waste on the banks of the channel.

“Some residents also directly dump the household waste into the channel,” he added.

Adding to this problem is the shortage in the number of dumper bins present in the locality, said Vimala, another resident.

“The dumper bins are all present far away from our residences. Also, it is common to see these dumper bins overflowing as the Corporation workers clear the waste only thrice a week,” she complained.

But, it is the duty of every resident to protect the water bodies, said S. Eswaran, an autorickshaw driver. “To achieve this, the officials must collect fine from those littering the waterbodies,” he said.

City Health Officer (in-charge) S. Senthil said that after the commissioning of 41 micro composting centres in the city, door-to-door collection of waste from all residences will be guaranteed.

“At Thathaneri and Menendhal, where the MCCs are currently functioning, there are no dumper bins present in those areas. So, 75% of the problem will be solved once all the MCCs are commissioned,” he said.

But, residents must understand that it is a shared responsibility and stop dumping waste into the channel, he added.

“This can be achieved when we create a behavioural change among residents. Once waste from all households is collected by the workers, the peer pressure from other residents will discourage people from dumping waste into waterbodies,” he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/1jvoi7/article31002694.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA07CITY-BBKULAMCHANNE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/bb-kulam-presents-a-sorry-picture/article31002695.ece

An autorickshaw driver, S. Jayakumar (40) of V. Perumalpatti was arrested after he reportedly sexually harassed a minor girl in his vehicle near Usilampatti on Thursday night.

The police said that the girl, who is studying in class 10 in a school in Pappapattti, was returning home from school. She had boarded the share-autorickshaw at Thottappanaickanur junction. There were no other passengers when the girl hailed the share auto at around 7 p.m.

Claiming the passenger seat was oily, the driver asked her to sit besides him in the front. On a secluded rural road, the driver allegedly molested her. When the girl resisted, the driver had reportedly pushed her down from the vehicle and she sustained injuries on her knees.

After she complained to her parents about the incident, the girl’s father had gone to the spot and shouted at the driver at Thottapanaickanur. Meanwhile, another person, S. Kasimayan, abused the man using derogatory words denoting his caste and assaulted him.

Based on the complaint from the mother of the girl, the Usilampatti Taluk police have booked both the accused for using abusive language, criminal intimidation, assault and under the provisions of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.

349,2020/03/06,Toll plaza at Vandiyur comes under High Court scanner,"There are no toilets and drinking water at toll plazas, and no parking bay for lorries on this stretch

Recently, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court restrained the State Highways Department and the concessionaire from collecting toll at the newly-opened Vandiyur toll plaza after taking into account that there was no dedicated lane for emergency service and exempted vehicles.

Also read: No additional cash lanes after January 15 at toll plazas

Vandiyur toll plaza on Ring Road is one of the three new toll plazas apart from those at Chintamani and Valayankulam. All these toll plazas are located within a 27-km-stretch from the Sivaganga Road-Ring Road junction to Kappalur. The court had passed the direction on a batch of public interest litigation petitions.

In 2017, the Madras High Court, in its order, had directed that the concessionaire should provide an ambulance service with all facilities for emergency assistance which must be stationed at the toll plazas. Also, there must be a dedicated lane in both directions for ambulance and other exempted vehicles.

Further, the court had directed that boards be placed indicating the exempted lane and to fence it off with a chain to prevent other vehicles from entering it. The concessionaire must provide a complaints book which shall be regularly verified, the court said.

Also read: Does Ring Road offer a four-lane highway experience?

The contention of the petitioners in the present case is that the toll plazas are in proximity to each other and the guidelines given by the High Court for maintaining the toll plaza is not followed. With the land for the exempted lane yet to be acquired, an undertaking was given by the concessionaire that till then toll would not be collected at Vandiyur plaza and the loss would not be recouped at the other toll plazas.

The further contention of the petitioners is the very need for three toll plazas in the stretch. Commuters, students and the general public are affected by this arrangement, they said in their petitions.

They pointed out that as per Rule 8 of the National Highways Fees Determination of Rates and Collection Rules, 2008, there should be a distance of 60 km between two toll plazas. However, in the present case, this was not so.

President of Madurai Lorry Owners’ Association C. Sathiah says despite this stretch being busy as it is the prime link to Chennai from southern districts, there are no basic amenities such as toilets and drinking water at the toll plazas. There is no no parking bay for lorries on this stretch. If there is one toll plaza it is fine, but why three.

Advocate T. Lajapathi Roy is of the opinion that the Corporation should have taken control of the toll plaza instead of a concessionaire. But then when the government collects road cess, why it collects toll too.

The Kappalur issue

This is not the first time that the High Court has restrained the concessionare from collecting toll. In 2018, a public interest litigation petition was filed before High Court Bench complaining of the bad condition of roads in Kappalur. After the condition of the road was ascertained by the High Court, a Division Bench of the court directed National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the concessionaire to slash the toll by 50%.

The court held them accountable for the bad condition of the highway from Madurai to Virudhunagar and ordered that till that stretch was repaired and rendered safe for vehicle users, only the reduced toll fee should be collected. The court observed that roads should be maintained in accordance with standards stipulated by the Indian Road Congress.

The High Court has adjourned the Vandiyur toll plaza case to March 26 to hear further arguments.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ax9v2b/article30997385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06MACITY-TOLLPLAZA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/toll-plaza-at-vandiyur-comes-under-high-court-scanner/article30997386.ece
350,2020/03/06,Ensure conduct of post-mortem: HC to GRH Dean,"The victim, hailing from Madurai, met with an accident in Bengaluru

MADURAI

After police of two States refused to give requisition for the conduct of post-mortem of a Madurai man who died here after meeting with an accident in Bengaluru, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday directed the Dean of Madurai Government Rajaji Hospital to ensure conduct of a post-mortem.

The family of the deceased, Selvaraj, moved the Madras High Court Bench as the post-mortem was not conducted after the police refused to give a requisition letter. Selvaraj, hailing from Madurai, was working in Bengaluru when he met with an accident on February 23.

He was admitted to the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru, but got himself discharged against medical advice. He subsequently got admitted to a private hospital in Bengaluru, and on February 29 got admitted to the GRH here for further treatment.

But he slipped into coma, and died on March 4. However, the post-mortem was not conducted in the absence of a requisition letter. The body was kept in the mortuary with the family anxious to perform the last rites of the deceased.

While Madurai police denied the letter on the ground that the accident did not take place within their jurisdiction, Bengaluru police denied the letter stating that no complaint was lodged after the accident and the death had not occurred within their jurisdiction.

Hearing the peculiar case, Justice G.R. Swaminathan observed that it was not a matter in which one could adopt a technical approach. Allowing the petition, the judge said that he understood the agony and the pain of the family and directed the GRH Dean to ensure that the port-mortem was conducted and the body handed over to the family on the same day.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ensure-conduct-of-post-mortem-hc-to-grh-dean-madurai/article30994472.ece
351,2020/03/06,"Yes Bank | In RBI bailout, SBI to pick up 49% stake for ₹2,450 crore","PSU bank to invest ₹2,450 crore; reconstruction scheme will protect jobs for a year; new, six-member board set up.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday announced a draft reconstruction scheme for the beleaguered Yes Bank, aimed at protecting depositors’ funds while bringing in the State Bank of India as an investor. For employees of the bank, service conditions, including remuneration, will remain the same, at least for one year. This does not, however, include key managerial personnel, on whom the Board can take a call.

According to the draft resolution plan, the authorised capital for the reconstructed bank will be ₹5,000 crore, with 2,400 crore equity shares of ₹2 each aggregating to ₹4,800 crore.

The SBI, which had earlier said its Board was exploring an investment in Yes Bank, will pick up a 49% stake, according to the scheme. The deal would be at a price not less than ₹10 per share with face value of ₹2. The SBI cannot reduce its holding below 26% before completion of three years from the date of infusion of the capital, the RBI said. To pick up 49% stake, SBI will have to invest ₹2,450 crore, sources said.

On March 5, the government had put a moratorium on Yes Bank till April 3 following its deteriorating financial condition and the banking regulator superseding the board and appointed an administrator.

The new Board will have at least six members, an MD & CEO, a non-executive chairman and two non-executive directors, while the remaining two nominee directors would be appointed by the SBI. “The members of the Board so appointed shall continue for a period of one year, or until an alternate board is constituted by Yes Bank Ltd., whichever is later,” the RBI said.

“All the deposits with and liabilities of the reconstructed bank, except as provided in the scheme, and the rights, liabilities and obligations of its creditors, will continue in the same manner and with the same terms and conditions, completely unaffected by the Scheme,” it said.

However, Additional Tier 1 capital which was issued by the Yes Bank under Basel III framework, “shall stand written down permanently, in full, with effect from the Appointed date,” the scheme said.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has said the resolution of Yes Bank would be done swiftly.

“The resolution (of Yes Bank) will be done very swiftly, it will be done very fast. The 30 days which we have given, is the outer limit,” Mr. Das said at the sidelines of an event.

The scheme has taken care of the employees as it mandates that they will continue to with same same remuneration and service conditions at least for one year.

However, the board will have the freedom to discontinue the services of the Key Managerial Personnel (KMPs) at any point of time after following the due procedure. There will be no change in the offices or branch network of the reconstructed bank.

Comments have been invited for this draft scheme by Monday, March 9, after which RBI will take a final view.

354,2020/03/06,Moody’s downgrades Yes Bank’s ratings,"‘The ratings remain under review, with the direction uncertain,’ Moody’s said, downgrading Yes Bank Ltd’s long-term foreign currency issuer rating to Caa3 from B2

Moody’s Investors Service on Friday downgraded Yes Bank Ltd’s rating following the RBI imposing a 30-day moratorium that prevents the lender from making payments to its creditors.

“The ratings remain under review, with the direction uncertain,” Moody’s said, downgrading Yes Bank Ltd’s long-term foreign currency issuer rating to Caa3 from B2.

Moody’s has also downgraded the bank’s long-term foreign and local currency bank deposit ratings.

The downgrade “is a result of an event of default triggered by the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) 30-day moratorium, which prevents Yes Bank from making a full and timely payment to its senior creditors,” the rating agency said in a statement.

Also read: “I want to assure every depositor that their money shall be safe,” says FM Nirmala Sitharaman | Moratorium on Yes Bank credit negative: Moody’s

“Despite the event of default, the Caa3 rating takes into account Moody’s expectation that although recovery rates for the banks’ senior creditors may be high given the close involvement of the Indian authorities and stated intention to resolve the bank quickly, the ultimate timing and form of eventual resolution remains uncertain.

“Actions by the authorities to date have not reduced the probability of default as evidenced by the moratorium announcement, and highlights the continued uncertainty around private sector bank resolutions in India and the recovery prospects for senior creditors,” it said.

Also read: Yes Bank: 30 days to find resolution, says RBI governor

Moody’s said it expects a higher probability of low loss rate for depositors. “The assurance made by the RBI to protect depositors’ interests provides greater certainty that the risk of losses to depositors is lower.”

Yes Bank’s long-term ratings remain under review with the direction uncertain, reflecting Moody’s expectation of a potential for different outcomes.

A prompt resolution of Yes Bank, that minimises losses to depositors and creditors could result in a stabilisation or upgrade of the bank’s ratings, it said adding a protracted resolution that extends the moratorium could result in lower recovery rates for the bank’s creditors and could lead to a further downgrade of the bank’s ratings.

“The RBI action also confirms Moody’s view that the bank’s standalone viability, in the absence of extraordinary support from Indian authorities, is in question,” the statement said. “Nevertheless, Moody’s expects high recovery prospects for the principal and interest on the bank’s deposits, as indicated by the final rating on those instruments.”

Moody’s could upgrade the ratings or change the outlook to stable if authorities conclude a material capital raise, reconstruct the bank’s assets and liabilities, or amalgamate the bank with another stronger bank, such that any action taken reduces the risks of losses to senior creditors and depositors.

On the other hand, a further downgrade is in the offing if authorities are unable to resolve the bank within the planned moratorium period or if the moratorium is extended, such that it further impairs the bank’s ability to make timely payments to depositors and senior creditors.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/3a61x6/article31002159.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/YEKB,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/moodys-downgrades-yes-banks-ratings/article31002160.ece

India’s information technology services sector is facing adverse impact on the operational front following the outbreak of coronovirus (COVID-19) in several countries, an IT industry expert said on Friday.

Former NASSCOM President R. Chandrashekar noted that overseas and international travel had been impacted following the scare.

“While the lot of the industry today is about remote services, it is certainly backed by a certain percentage of actual travel and face-to-face interaction as well. So, complete elimination of that will obviously have an adverse impact,” he told the PTI in Bengaluru.

Even within offices, since there are large number of people who gather together, a single incidence of infection within that organisation immediately necessitates some kind of measures, the former Telecom Commission Chairman pointed.

“People have been asked not to come to office and work from home. While the nature of the business allows people to work from home, it’s not as if 100%of work you can do from home. So, there are always different kinds of face-to-face interactions required, within the office. So, completely bypassing that will create some constraints,” he said.

According to him, global uncertainty, slowdown and fears of recession, as well as uncertainty with regards to the economic trajectory definitely have implications for investment and IT spends.

“Therefore, the overall slowdown in terms of IT projects, IT spends is quite likely in the short-term, (but) it does not affect India’s relative position,” Chandrashekhar, a former Secretary of the Department of Telecommunication, said.

359,2020/03/06,Third-party motor insurance premium rates set to go up,"On notification, the new rates will come into force from April 1

Third-party motor insurance premium for cars, two-wheelers, good carriers, buses, including school buses, and a host of other automobiles looks set to increase, sharply for some, with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) proposing an increase in the rates for 2020-21.

Among private cars, those above 1500 cc or luxury cars is the only sub-segment where the rate of premium is proposed to be kept unchanged, at ₹7,890.

Also read | Motor insurance: What is third party liability?

For cars below 1000 cc, a segment popular with those migrating from two-wheelers to cars and comprising the popular Alto model, the premium rate proposed is ₹2,182 or an increase of 5.3% from the existing rate of ₹2,072. The rate proposed for 1000-1500 cc cars is ₹3,383 (₹3,221) or an increase in excess of 5%.

With GST, the cost of purchasing the mandatory, TP motor cover will be still higher.

Unlike in 2019-20 when it maintained the rate of premium to be paid for bikes above 350cc, the regulator has proposed an increase for all two-wheelers. The rates proposed are: Below 75cc – ₹506 (₹482); 75-150cc – ₹769 (₹752); 150-350cc – ₹1,301 (₹1,193). For bikes with engine capacity of over 350cc, the premium is proposed to be increased to ₹2,571 (₹2,323).

According to the draft, TP cover rates for two-wheelers below 75 cc is proposed at ₹506, up from the existing ₹482. Hike has also been proposed for those between 75 cc and 350 cc. The hike in bikes with engine capacity exceeding 350 cc has been proposed at ₹ 2,571 from ₹2,323.

The increase in the premium proposed for public goods carriers (other than three-wheelers), depending on the Gross Vehicle Weight, ranges from ₹346 to ₹2,896. For private goods carriers, the hike proposed, again depending on their GVW, is from ₹169 to ₹498.

For school buses, IRDAI has proposed to increase the basic rate of premium from the existing ₹13,874 to ₹14,338. This apart, the other component, which is the premium levied per licensed passenger or the number of seats, will increase to ₹876 (₹848). For other buses, the basic rate proposed is ₹14,978 (₹14,494) and ₹916 (₹886) per licensed passenger.

In the exposure draft issued on Thursday, which will be open for comments till March 20, IRDAI said a discount of 15% is proposed for electric private cars, electric two wheeler, electric goods carrying commercial vehicles and electric passenger carrying vehicles. The proposed discount will incentivise usage of environmental-friendly vehicles.

A discount of 7.5% on the Motor TP premium rates has been proposed for hybrid electric vehicles. This again is to act as an incentive to use environment-friendly vehicles. On notification, the new rates will come into force from April 1.

The central bank on Thursday imposed a moratorium on the capital-starved Yes Bank, capping withdrawals at ₹50,000 per account and superseded the board of the private sector lender with immediate effect.

For the next month, Yes Bank will be led by the RBI-appointed administrator Prashant Kumar, an ex-chief financial officer of State Bank of India (SBI).

Moody’s said it expects Indian authorities will take steps to prevent the weakness in the bank’s viability from significantly impacting its depositors and senior creditors.

The board of SBI on Thursday gave an “in-principle” approval to invest in the capital-starved Yes Bank, which has been struggling to execute a capital raising plan for the last six months.

Its core equity tier-I ratio had slipped to 8.7% as of September.

The bank had also delayed its December quarter results.

The last lender to be placed under a similar action was PMC Bank in September last year. While the withdrawal limits have been increased over time to ₹1 lakh now, many PMC Bank depositors are still in the lurch.

364,2020/03/06,Disabled and extremely poor,"There is a link between disability, loss of employment and impoverishment in rural India

Of the world’s population, 15% live with some form of disability. Are disabilities associated with economic hardships through loss of employment and consequent impoverishment in rural India? We tried to answer this question by using the two rounds of the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) data for 2005 and 2012.

We compared poverty outcomes in 2012 and the prevalence of disability in 2005. The sequence of analyses summarised below is first, factors associated with disability; second, the relationship between rural employment and disability; and third, between poverty/or a welfare metric and disability in rural India. The central argument resting on these building blocks is that disabilities are likely to rise; they are associated with loss of long duration of employment; and thus, with a rise in poverty.

Patterns of disability

The prevalence of disability was 9.70% in the rural population in 2012. Of the disabled, more than half (51.3%) suffered from two-four disabilities. Persistence was also largest in this range of disabilities (about 31% remained disabled between 2005 and 2012). The share of those suffering from one disability was largest in the age group 31-50 years, followed by 51-60 years. In the case of two-four disabilities, the largest share was found among those aged 31-50, 51-60, and then, among the older group, 61-70 years. The share of those suffering from more than four disabilities rose from those aged 31-50 years old to 61-70 years and then declined. Among the youngest (15-30 years), about 98% did not suffer from any disability. This declined among older age groups (just under 50% among the oldest, more than 70 years of age). In the 31-50 years age group, a vast majority did not suffer from any disability, and small proportions suffered from a single and multiple disabilities. A similar pattern was observed among those in the 51-60 years age group, with substantially lower proportions without any disability and larger proportions suffering from single and multiple disabilities. Among those aged 61-70 years, the proportion without disability was considerably lower, but those with single and multiple disabilities rose (about 30% had more than four disabilities).

Employment in rural areas is disaggregated into categories: no employment, or less than 240 hours in the previous year (i.e., before 2012); part-time employment, or more than 240 hours; and full-time employment (at least 250 days and at least 2,000 hours). What is indeed striking is that among the disabled, the proportion of those not employed is just under half, and markedly lower in part-time and full-time employment.

Instead of using a poverty cut-off, we used terciles of per capita expenditure (at constant prices). The bottom tercile denotes extremely poor, the next middle class and the third affluent. As non-disabled households are a huge fraction, it is not surprising that their shares are highest in each tercile. In the non-disabled households, the proportions are almost equally distributed among the terciles. In the lowest disability group (<0.31), the proportion in the first tercile is lowest, and highest in the second and third terciles. The highest disability group (>0. 60), however, offers a contrast. Their proportion in the lowest tercile is highest compared with other disability groups but slightly lower than the proportion in the second tercile. Their proportion in the third tercile not just within this disability group but also across all other disability groups is lowest. Thus, highly disabled are largely confined to extreme poverty. They face barriers to long-duration employment including discriminatory practices in hiring the disabled.

Ironically, while the SDGs assign high priority to preventing and overcoming disability, the Budget for 2020-21 is almost cruel to those experiencing persistent health deprivation by cutting the health outlay.

365,2020/03/06,The search for dignity in a neat little square,"Tiny spaces mark zones of privacy for riot victims in relief camps

Neat little squares tell a tale of their own at relief camps. Neat little squares, made up of meagre belongings, delineate the lines between one family and another. When you report on relief camps and speak to the victims, you note that these lines are lines of dignity, of a semblance of privacy, a remembrance of the homes they have fled, which had walls to protect them. The squares are a desperate attempt at a sense of order for men, women and children whose lives have been thrown out of gear and who are trying to retrieve something, anything, from their past that will quell their fears.

In Delhi, the squares are beginning to form again, as victims of the mob violence of last week come to terms with what they have lost. Many still don’t know the fate of their loved ones, and walk around with photos on their phones, asking anyone who visits to help find them.

Delhi violence | Looted, burnt out homes offer little welcome to Shiv Vihar’s riot victims

I first remember seeing those squares when I was 11, and had gone to deliver clothes at Delhi’s Lajpat Bhawan, where hundreds of victims of the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 had taken refuge. Lajpat Bhawan was run by the Servants of the People Society (SOPS), a civil society organisation started by Lala Lajpat Rai in the 1920s in his hometown Lahore, and then moved to Delhi post-Partition. Apart from providing other social services, SOPS would sell home-ground masalas, thus giving needy women a livelihood as well. The mob violence had affected both the rich and the poor. As relief trucks would come and dispense clothes, footwear and utensils, they would take them gratefully and then line their personal squares with them. Inside those squares the women would peel vegetables, make their children study, and try to recreate a small sense of home for themselves, something the smell of masalas in the air helped with.

In 2002, in Gujarat, I saw those squares again, while reporting on the mob violence that killed more than a thousand people, as the police stood by. Outside the Shah Alam relief camp, the violence continued to rock parts of the State for months, but inside it, those squares gave people a sense of safety. Often when we would go to interview them, they would lead us to their square so as to speak to us from the privacy of their “home” about the horrors they had faced.

In 2004, after the tsunami, I saw the squares once again, when I met a young couple at a camp in Port Blair. They had been evacuated from Car Nicobar. Each day, Indian Air Force planes would bring in survivors to the main island, and the husband and the wife would take turns to go look for their daughter, who was missing, leaving the other to guard their square. As journalists, we are schooled not to get personally attached to stories, but this story couldn’t but disturb. Their five-year-old daughter had gone to stay with her grandparents on the night of the tsunami, and there had been no word from her or their family since then. On our way back from the camps each day, my cameraman and I would stop at their square to check on them. When we found them both gone one evening, we were filled with foreboding. Fortunately, it turned out that their daughter had been found and they had gone running to see her, leaving their square unguarded for the first time in days. As they brought her back to their square, the whole camp cheered for that one moment of joy amidst all the sorrow. Taking a rare break from protocol, both my cameraman and I sat down and wept instead.",comment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/196n7z/article30994589.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Delhi-relief-centrejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/in-relief-camps-the-search-for-dignity-in-a-small-square/article30993263.ece
366,2020/03/06,Should the sedition law be scrapped?,"Given its frequent misuse, either the courts must strike it down or Parliament ought to revoke it

On March 2, a 43-year-old man was charged with sedition after he allegedly chanted pro-Pakistan slogans before the mini Vidhan Soudha at Kundapur in Karnataka’s Udupi district. Last month, the police arrested a school principal and a parent in Bidar, Karnataka, for an allegedly seditious and inflammatory play against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). Over the last few months, many people protesting against the CAA have been charged with sedition across the country. In a conversation moderated by Jayant Sriram, senior Supreme Court advocate Sanjay Hegde and Delhi government’s addition standing counsel (criminal) Nandita Rao discuss why sedition still exists in the statute book, its misuse, and whether it should be done away with. Excerpts:

It is a matter of concern that a large number of sedition cases have been filed against people for protesting against the CAA. Data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) show that 194 cases of sedition have been filed since the CAA was passed on December 11, 2019. More cases of sedition have been filed since December 11 than in the last three years put together, according to NCRB data. The data also show that while the number of sedition cases filed has been going up every year (numbers for sedition cases started being recorded from 2014) in the last four years, only four cases actually resulted in conviction. So, how useful is the sedition law?

Sanjay Hegde: The point of the sedition law is essentially that of suppressing free speech and free thought, both of which are unpopular with the government. Where a critic can be silenced by the mere fact that there is a possible life sentence — that itself acts as a deterrent. These cases are often invoked against show-piece dissenters so that the rest fall in line. Governments are not really interested in convictions. In many of these cases, sanctions are also not given, but it is a useful tool in the hands of the local policemen who can first register a case. It’s also a useful tool in the hands of a local leader or the head of some faction who wants to shut down a particular dissenter in the locality. He can just rush to a police station, file a complaint, and urge them to take action. He then gets his nationalistic brownie points. And the speaker is often left wondering whether that case will proceed further. It has a chilling effect on people who think and speak freely. I don’t think any government is interested in actual prosecution. Most cases that are filed would not end in conviction if Section 124A, as read by the Supreme Court in Kedar Nath Singh (1962), is actually applied — often the speech complained about does not result in any actual incitement to violence whatsoever.

Nandita Rao: Sedition is an offence which existed in our Indian Penal Code (IPC) before we got Independence because the colonial master wished to penalise anybody who was trying to overthrow the state. But the irony is that in independent India, of late, this provision is being used to bully and terrorise citizens. And in the Bidar case, where a parent and the principal of a school were charged with sedition for staging a play critical of the CAA, we saw that it was used — or rather misused — to bully and terrorise small children and a young woman. So, I think when the state begins to terrorise people with laws, then we are dangerously flirting with fascism.

The Supreme Court, in its interpretation of Section 124A, clearly says that it has to be against the state, not against the government. I can criticise the BJP, I can criticise the Congress, I can criticise Mamata Banerjee, I can criticise the Communist parties. That is not sedition. When I start criticising the constitutional state of India, that is when I invite the charge of sedition and even there the Supreme Court clearly says that there has to be a direct incitement to violence. So, sedition is a very specific and a very serious offence, and when it is used to silence and terrorise the ordinary citizen who is raising a grievance, it is terrorism by the state. I really think that the National Human Rights Commission is duty-bound to map all these misuses of the sedition law. It should make the Commissioner of Police of that State personally responsible.

Sedition is a colonial relic and I think we can all agree that it’s being misused widely. Why then has it not been repealed yet? Why has it survived in the IPC for so long?

Sanjay Hegde: Sedition as a concept comes from Elizabethan England, where if you criticised the king and were fomenting a rebellion, it was a crime against the state. When they ruled India, the British feared Wahhabi rebellion. They brought the [sedition] law in, and it was used against our freedom fighters as well. You must remember that both Mahatma Gandhi and [Bal Gangadhar] Tilak were tried under this law and sentenced. When we became free we thought this law would go.

Everybody promised that it would, but nobody actually did it. And they didn’t do it because every administrator has this thought that dissent is okay, but beyond a certain point it gets dangerous and an administration must have the means to control it. Now we have to ask, who controls it? It’s not a wise administrator who controls it or administers it. It is administered from the police thana level. Previously policemen were much more independent. But since Indian independence, the independence of the police has also been severely compromised. So, any local leader can almost bully a policeman into registering a case. After a case is registered, its purpose is done because it may get government sanction to proceed to trial. Or it may not. Now, with the explosion of the media, the social media and with other pressures, people find it more convenient to just sanction the prosecution and say, let the courts take care of it. But what this has led to is a situation where the process itself becomes the punishment and the process itself becomes a demonstration.

The Congress party manifesto for the 2019 general election promised to do away with sedition. I’ve heard senior Congress leaders say, which idiot asked the manifesto committee to include this because it looks so ‘anti-national’ in the eyes of the voters. The average voter unfortunately just thinks that if you say something against a government elected by any majority, you are speaking against the nation. I think we need to do away with this law as soon as possible if we are to be a truly free and independent country.

Nandita Rao: I don’t think one needs to remove this law. It falls on the judiciary to protect Articles 19 and Article 21 of the Constitution. Justice Kurian Joseph recently made some anguished remarks that the police is neither independent nor professional. My position is that the time has come for the judiciary to set up a search committee in every State, and a particular judge of the High Court has to suo moto check each sedition case being filed. And if it is baseless, if it has been used to only terrorise the ordinary citizen expressing his views, it must be quashed without putting the onus on the citizen to come to the court. It’s true that the police have become totally politicised, but who is to stop this? Who is to guard us? It is the judiciary that has been charged with this job and they can’t expect the ordinary citizen to always come to the court. Our legal aid system is just not as robust as it should be. The problem is not with the section, but with its abuse.

Sanjay Hegde: I think the problem is with the section itself. As somebody correctly said, the essence of tyranny is in the making of harsh laws and then using those laws selectively against the people. The only current conviction which still stands under sedition, to my mind, is that of Binayak Sen and that was under the UPA government.

So, it’s like this, administrators like this tool handy. Take away the tool and come back with specific laws on hate speech and speeches that incite violence. That is understandable, but to elevate ordinary dissent into an anti-national insurrection or uprising is certainly not on. The point is that if you keep a harsh law on the statute book, there will be misuse. And there’s no sense applying ointment thereafter. This has been on the statute book for more than 100 years. Experience has shown that it does not actually work. Experience has shown that it has led to great abuse. It’s time that we scrapped it and came up with something else.

NR: One thing here is that hate speech is a totally different offence from sedition. Hate speech is when you provoke violence between two communities. You are not abusing the state. You are not telling people to revolt against the state. When you challenge the constitutional scheme of India, that is sedition. But when you provoke violence against a particular community, that is hate speech. It’s irrelevant which political regime has misused this. The question is, why has the guardian of our Constitution, the judiciary, with all its powers, failed to put an end to it and reassure the citizen that the right under Article 19 right is protected by the judiciary? So, any provision can be misused. If this law is removed, some other law will be misused. The judiciary really needs to start acting.

Will the impetus to repeal or change the law come from the judiciary or will it be Parliament that initiates the change?

Sanjay Hegde: I don’t think that there is a case for continuing this law, but there will never be political will to do away with it. Therefore, it just may be that the judiciary will have to re-look its earlier judgments and say that these filters simply do not seem to be working with the passage of time. What we had earlier held to be constitutional with safeguards and riders is no longer constitutional. It may just be that if the politicians don’t do it, then one day the judiciary in a Bench larger than five may have to take a fresh look at the sedition law and strike it down altogether. I don’t know which process will be longer.

Nandita Rao: I don’t agree because our judiciary has always been pro-executive. Also, it is only Parliament that revoked a law like POTA [The Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002], which was draconian and flagrantly misused. All these laws have always been upheld by the judiciary. It is only the parliamentarians, when they get a push from the public, who swing into action. So, I do have that little faith in Parliament.

It’s just that today we have an authoritarian Parliament, which does not respect our Constitution. I correct myself, our constitutional freedoms.

367,2020/03/06,Read them the riot act: On police inaction during Delhi violence,"Those responsible for dereliction of duty in the Delhi Police should face action

As smoke thins out and facts emerge, the role of the Delhi Police during the communal violence that gripped the north-eastern parts of the city from February 24 to 26 turns out to be disturbing and chilling. The circumstances and origins of the violence are important, but what is of utmost urgency for the rule of law is the behaviour of the police and other arms of the state. The catalogue of infractions by the Delhi Police, unearthed by media platforms and civil society groups, is long and detailed. In one case, Faizan, a 23-year-old Muslim man, was seen in a video being beaten by the police who were forcing him to sing the national anthem. Illegally detained for over 36 hours, denied medical attention and released with his body turned blue, according to his mother, Faizan died. It took the intervention of the Delhi High Court for the police to give protection to victims as they were transported from an inadequate facility to a government hospital. Videos of personnel in uniform actively participating in violence, and smashing CCTV cameras installed by the Delhi government, have emerged. All these incidents require detailed investigation.

The Delhi Police also came under attack by mobs; one of their men was lost, and several were injured. But that is no reason to excuse their failure to ensure public order in a riot situation. Even after the global spotlight on their blatant partisanship during the days of the ugly violence, the Delhi Police have chosen to brazen it out. Not only have FIRs not been filed against four BJP leaders who were clearly instigating violence, there were more mobs roaming the heart of the capital city, unchallenged by the police in the days following the riots. Meanwhile, the police sought action against social activist Harsh Mander, whose speech on peaceful protest and communal harmony was presented to the Supreme Court as incitement to violence. Far from taking the officials to task and pinpointing individual accountability, the Central and Delhi governments have either remained quiet or come out in support of them. The responses of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Union Home Minister Amit Shah to the violence emboldened the mob and condoned police partisanship. Had there been timely and impartial assertion of political or judicial authority over the police as they drifted from one excess to the more egregious next over the last three months, Delhi would not have fallen into this furnace. There can be no further loss of time in acting against the perpetrators of violence and those who miserably failed in their duty. India needs an assurance that its security forces will uphold the rule of law at all costs, and not allow themselves to be manipulated by those aligned with the ruling establishment.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/read-them-the-riot-act-the-hindu-editorial-on-police-inaction-during-delhi-violence/article30993647.ece
368,2020/03/06,Truly Malay: On Mahathir’s legacy,"Attempts to privilege the Muslim majority over others will hurt Malaysia’s pluralistic ethos

The drama behind the developments that catapulted Muhyiddin Yassin to Malaysia’s premiership could go on, unless his predecessor Mahathir Mohamad decides to call it quits. But Mr. Mahathir, who resigned last week, seems no less determined to fight on than when he staged a spectacular comeback as Premier in 2018 after spending nearly two decades in political retirement. On that occasion, Mr. Mahathir forged the Pakatan Harapan (PH), a multiethnic coalition, with his erstwhile arch-rival Anwar Ibrahim. The sole mission of that alliance was to remove the government of United Malay National Organisation (UMNO), the party of Malay nationalism which was at the time embroiled in a multibillion-dollar scandal. But the PH collapsed last week when some splinter groups tried to form an alliance with UMNO, leading to Mr. Mahathir’s resignation. But as soon as Mr. Muhyiddin, Interior Minister in the previous administration, was sworn in as the new Premier on Sunday, his ex-boss challenged the legitimacy of his appointment. While claiming the support of 112 MPs in Kuala Lumpur’s 222 member legislature, Mr. Mahathir has also objected to Mr. Muhyiddin taking the support of the UMNO. Given the UMNO’s overt assertion of Malaysia’s majority Muslim interests, Mr. Mahathir’s claim appeared to resonate among sections of the country’s diverse ethnic minorities.

Meanwhile, the PH is organising roadshows to explain to supporters and voters the events that led to the breakup of the coalition, ahead of its attempt to move a vote of no confidence in Mr. Muhyiddin’s leadership. But the plan could hit a roadblock following the Speaker’s announcement on Wednesday of postponement of the next parliamentary session until May. But Mr. Mahathir’s capacity to convert the coming weeks to his advantage cannot be underestimated. Few would have taken seriously his launch of a comeback bid in 2017, when he aligned with Mr. Anwar, his one-time protege whom he had incarcerated on politically motivated charges of sodomy in the 1990s. Crucially, the latter appears to stand by his mentor now, even though the promise of being handed the baton has not materialised so far. Conversely, gains from the byelections last year are bound to renew the Opposition’s hopes to consolidate its position. The prevailing uncertainty could also distract attention away from Malaysia’s economic priorities. Equally, the revival of the old narrative to privilege the country’s Muslim majority would prove detrimental to its plural ethos. As he constitutes a new Cabinet, Prime Minister Muhyiddin would do well to build on the inclusive legacy of the past two years. At the same time, Mr. Mahathir might ponder the democratic case in making way for a successor.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/truly-malay-the-hindu-editorial-on-mahatir-mohamads-legacy/article30993663.ece

370,2020/03/06,COVID-19: Chennaiites put visits to cold places in the north on hold,"Residents are cancelling pilgrimages to north India and abroad, as well as putting holiday plans on hold, travel agents say

With the government advising precautions in travel as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic, a number of people have reportedly been cancelling their travel plans. With health advisories asking people to avoid crowded places, people are avoiding going to even holy places within the country, especially destinations in the north.

R. Anand, Travel India, said that though the season for visits to Kailash Mansarovar has begun, travellers are worried since it is a cold place. “We have been advised to wait till May to arrange the trip. I have not submitted tge passports of over 20 persons for the trip. Hoteliers in places like Haridwar are informing us that they will not allow people from affected countries. Similarly, people don’t seem to want to visit places like Simla and Darjeeling,” he said.

Fathima Muzaffar, CEO, Millath Haj Services said that many of their clients were avoiding visits to crowded places and even Haj pilgrimages, since the United Arab Emirates has also recorded cases. “Even those who had planned to visit other important religious sites are cancelling tickets. They don’t want to visit places that are high risk,” she said adding that for Haj, airlines have asked people to either reissue tickets or take refunds.

No impact on buses and railways

However, the scare has not had any impact on buses and railways. A senior official of the State Transport department said the passenger population in the State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) has not seen any reduction and has been maintaining an average of more than 65,000 passengers per day.

He said that normally passenger movement would be lower during March-April due to examinations. Officials in the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation and Kerala State Transport Corporation too said examinations were the reason for low passenger traffic this season.

D. Maran, treasurer, Tamil Nadu Omni bus owners association, said that as on date, trips to Kerala or Hyderabad have not been affected. Around 600 Omni buses are operated from Chennai to various districts and to other States every day. Close to 400 people travel to Kerala daily and around 1,000 to Andhra Pradesh and Telengana. “We are planning to have hand santizers in the bus and also paste notices on safety precautions,” he said.

Officials in Southern Railway too said they have not witnessed any panic cancellations this past month. “Our 420 long distance trains have not seen any dip in the number of travellers. We plan to create awareness regarding the preventive measures to be followed by the public through posters and announcements over the public address system,” said a senior official.

International travel takes a beating

Airport sources estimate a dip of at least 20% in passenger traffic. The number of passengers travelling from the city to the Far East, Middle East and even Europe has come down this last month, said airline and travel agents. “We see about 50% drop in the number of people flying the past month. The panic is so bad that a few people tell us that they are scared to eat or touch anything in the aircraft. We don’t know how long this is going to last,” an official of a leading international airline said.

Usually, this is the peak time for travel when hundreds of people make plans for vacations in the next few months. “Now they wouldn’t want to take their children and go to either tge Far East, Middle East or Europe; that leaves them with other options such as Sri Lanka, Maldives or US,” he said.

M.K. Ajit Kumar of Asia Pacific Tours said both inbound and outbound passenger traffic have been affected. “Because of all this fear, there are many who will look for options for holidays within India,” he added.

City-based hoteliers said that they have seen major drop in bookings and cancellations in January and February. “We were to get people from Italy and Germany on business trips but they have cancelled,” said a hotelier.

371,2020/03/06,Getting serious about comedy with Nishant Suri,"Nishant Suri steps away from his Comicstaan material to try something new at today’s stand-up show in the city

Nishant Suri was practically unknown before he turned up on the first season of Amazon Prime’s reality show, Comicstaan (2018). As a struggling stand-up comic for three years before that, he had made a conscious decision to not upload his work on YouTube — he considered it a saturated market. Since winning the show, however, his videos have garnered millions of views each. “It made me a very recognisable brand, opening doors to private/corporate events, which is how we earn our bread and butter. On YouTube, they might see a clip of five to seven minutes, but on the show, they create an attachment since they know you more as a person,” he says.

In Chennai this weekend with an hour-long solo special titled Why So SURIous, the Noida native is no stranger to the city. He has performed here twice before. “We also lived in Avadi for three years when I was really young, but I don’t remember much,” he laughs.

Although his initial material was about his experiences as an engineer and later, a wedding photographer, he is going further with this set. “Now, I’m trying to write about things I’m thinking about or what’s happening with me right now. I hope people here can still relate to what I’m talking about,” he says.

Thinking of laughter

Admitting he is a “lazy writer”, who took a year to put together the material for this show, he says, “Creating the joke is the most challenging part… And I don’t tell stories – so this becomes even more difficult. Once you’ve written the joke and tested it out, it becomes easier.” He adds that he tends to compare himself to others in his field, and that it is not a good space to be in. “I quit my job because I wanted to do what I liked. Once you begin comparing, you’re constantly at war with yourself,” he says.

One of Suri’s aims is to move away from region-based comedy. If he is to cater to an international audience, it requires simple content that transcends borders. And within the country’s current political atmosphere, he does not miss an opportunity to share his opinions, albeit in a safe way. “I do slip in a subtle joke, on the sidelines of something else... It makes it more palatable to people who may not agree with me.”

Today’s show marks the end of his 11-city solo tour that has taken him across North and Central India. And one thing is for sure: he needs a break. “You need a life apart from stand-up that you can derive your material from. Otherwise, you don’t grow as a person and your comedy becomes stagnant,” he says. What’s on the cards for his big hiatus? “I’d love to travel outside of India, but something tells me the Coronavirus is going to make that pretty difficult. I’ll probably just head off to the mountains, do a little trekking instead,” he concludes.

Catch Why So SURIous on March 7 at SOCO at Bamboo Bar, Hotel Savera. From 5.30 pm.

372,2020/03/06,Geriatric ward opened at Dr. Rela Institute and Medical Centre,"The emergency ward has been customised to the needs of senior citizens

An exclusive geriatric emergency ward was inaugurated at the Dr. Rela Institute and Medical Centre (RIMC) located in Chromepet on Friday.

Sally McCarthy, president, Australian College of Emergency Medicine, and James Ducharme, president, Canada Association of Emergency Physicians and International Federation for Emergency Medicine, inaugurated the ward.

Dr. McCarthy appreciated RIMC for setting up such a facility for senior citizens.

Sai Surendar, Senior Consultant and Clinical Head, Department of Emergency Medicine of RIMC, said senior citizens normally need specialised medical attention and so this exclusive suite would be open round-the-clock to take care of their health needs. The emergency suite provided with two beds, has been customised to the needs of elderly patients, with wheelchairs, buzzers, and soft lighting. Also separate doctors and nurses have been allotted for the ward to help monitor patients regularly.

373,2020/03/06,NGO to restore water bodies in rural areas of Chennai’s neighbouring districts,"The Environmentalist Foundation of India is joining hands with the district administration to rejuvenate several water bodies in Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram and Chengalpet districts

As part of its efforts to restore lakes in and around the city, the Environmentalist Foundation of India (EFI), a non-governmental organisation, is joining hands with the district administration to rejuvenate more water bodies in Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram and Chengalpet districts.

The voluntary organisation, which has been involved in restoration of water bodies in urban and peri-urban areas, has expanded its project to those in rural areas. EFI has got the nod from the district administration to improve 20 water bodies in these neighbouring districts. It aims to rejuvenate different kinds of water bodies to benefit people, including the farming community. The water bodies identified in Tiruvallur include those in and around Tiruttani taluk and near Outer Ring Road, Pattabiram.

The voluntary organisation expects to begin work in water bodies in Morai, Koladi and Muthapudupet near Avadi on March 22 when World Water Day is observed.

Some of the remaining water bodies in Chengalpet district include those in peri-urban areas such as Perungulathur, Maraimalai Nagar and near Singaperumal koil, Egatur and Thiruporur.

EFI had earlier rejuvenated three water bodies around Poondi reservoir region under Tiruvallur district’s ‘Mummari’ project. Alleri lake, located within MEPZ, Tambaram, was improved as an collaborative effort. The water body, located between Kadaperi and Thiruneermalai lakes, also has birds nests installed in the bamboo garden created.

This year, the organisation will take up improvement works in lakes and ponds with sizes varying between 10 and 80 acres. EFI’s founder Arun Krishnamurthy said restoration activity in rural water bodies was more of a precautionary approach as exploitation of these bodies was not as much as those in urban areas. In urban lakes, the organisation uses more of a remedial approach. “We normally face issues such as invasive weeds, siltation and damages to inlets and surplus courses. These have the potential to be developed as habitat of flora and fauna and help the farming community,” he said.

In the Perungulathur region, small ponds would be improved to serve as a source of groundwater recharge and help deal with floods and droughts. These lakes are being undertaken for restoration, apart from those being improved along with Greater Chennai Corporation, he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/7w2tav/article30998837.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06MARTH-Lakejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ngo-to-restore-water-bodies-in-rural-areas-of-chennais-neighbouring-districts/article30998838.ece
374,2020/03/06,COVID-19 | Chennai airport screens all international passengers,"Since early Thursday, nearly 10,000-12,000 passengers from different international ave been screened for signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, better known as novel coronavirus.

According to officials of Airports Authority of India (AAI), they received directions to screen all passengers. “There are about 50 international movements on a daily basis. We have been screening all passengers in a systematic way,” an official said.

Officials said, the screening of passengers from the 12 countries including China, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Nepal and Indonesia and the those arriving from other remaining countries are done separately in two different parts of the terminal.

“The passengers from the 12 countries are checked as soon as they step out of the aircraft and reach the aero bridge. Whereas, those arriving from other countries are screened just before they reach the immigration area. All passengers have to fill up the self declaration form indicating if they have any illness,” another official said.

Sources said, owing to this, the amount of time passengers have to wait to clear immigration may take longer than usual. “We have been monitoring the situation everyday and we are trying to do everything possible to ensure the process gets done smoothly and is not very time consuming,” sources said.

They added that there is likely to be a dip in the number of people who have travelled from Chennai airport in the last two months and also in the number of aircraft movements as well. “We are estimating the numbers and should know the exact figure in the next few days,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cbam31/article30998511.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Coronavirus-Raghu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-chennai-airport-screens-all-international-passengers/article30998607.ece

Three nasal and throat swabs, besides blood samples, which were sent for testing to the King Institute of Preventive Medicine, have returned negative for COVID-19.

The Health department has lifted samples from two more persons, officials said. With this, a total of 54 samples have returned negative for COVID-19.

According to the bulletin issued by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine on Thursday, five persons are under hospital quarantine and 1,243 are under home quarantine.

All passengers from all international flights are being screened in the airports at Chennai, Tiruchi, Madurai and Coimbatore. A total of 1,00,111 passengers were screened till date.

To enable screening of passengers of all international fights, the Health Department has scaled up the number of medical and paramedical personnel at the Chennai airport, Health Secretary Beela Rajesh said.

“We have increased the number of doctors, staff nurses and health inspectors to carry out screening. There are a total of 75 persons on duty at the Chennai airport.

377,2020/03/06,Many international flights cancelled following COVID-19 scare,"FRROs told to liaise with airport authorities and screen flyers

Amid escalating threat of COVID-19, at least three international flights to Chennai scheduled to land late on Wednesday night were cancelled, sources in the intelligence agencies said on Thursday.

With few passengers, mostly Indian nationals returning home and foreigners on compelling trips landing at Chennai International Airport since Tuesday after the COVID-19 scare spread across South Asian countries, the Frankfurt-Chennai-Frankfurt Lufthansa flights LH-758/759, Bangkok-Chennai-Bangkok Thai Airways flights TG 337/338 and Hong Kong-Chennai-Hong Kong Cathay Pacific flights CX 631/632 were cancelled.

While airline officials refused to comment on the reasons for the cancellations, airport sources said these flights had announced operations as per schedule on Thursday.

“The flow of passengers in the international terminal has drastically come down in the last few days. There have been many cancellations after the spread of COVID-19. Adequate immigration and health officials have been deployed for conducting medical screening of all passengers irrespective of their nationalities,” a police official told The Hindu.

While the medical screening was made compulsory for passengers arriving from 12 countries on Monday, the Government of India extended it to cover all passengers irrespective of their nationalities and country of origin.

All Foreigners Regional Registration Officers (FRROs) were told to liaise with airport authorities and carry out medical screening of passengers. While foreigners refusing to cooperate with the authorities in the screening or sharing details of their stay would be denied entry, Indians shall be compulsorily quarantined, police sources said.

“It may be ensured that the phone number, address of all passengers (Indians and foreigners) coming from these destinations may be compulsorily collected. Those Indians who do not divulge the information may be cautioned of compulsory quarantine and those foreigners who do not provide information may not be given entry,” the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a note to FRROs.

These measures will be in addition to passengers giving an undertaking that they don’t have symptoms of COVID-19. “Passengers from a few countries have been asked to get a certificate from the competent health authority in their respective cities that they tested negative to COVID-19.” Sources in the Chennai Port Trust said that the Secretary, Ministry of Shipping, reviewed through video conferencing the measures taken to prevent COVID-19 with port officials across the country. “Instructions have been issued to start 100% screening of all the crew and passengers of foreign vessels irrespective of the country on arrival. A team of health officials was being sent to Delhi for a training programme on the latest instructions on precautionary measures to be taken to avert the spread of COVID-19,” a port official said.

Southern Railway issued an alert to all major stations on the preventive steps to be taken and announcements were made informing passengers that they could contact the respective Train Captains or Station Managers in case of any COVID-19 symptoms. Travelling Ticket Inspectors were told to keep a watch on sick passengers.

379,2020/03/06,How can police allow illegal protests despite filing FIRs: HC,"No protester can block roads, says court

The Madras High Court on Thursday wondered how the police could allow pro- or anti-CAA protesters to continue blocking a road in Tiruppur town despite having registered as many as 20 FIRs over the reported inconvenience caused to schoolchildren and others who use the road.

Justices M.M. Sundresh and Krishnan Ramasamy raised the question while hearing a public interest litigation petition filed by advocate and Hindu Munnetra Kazhagam president K. Gopinath, seeking a direction to the Director General of Police (DGP) not to entertain any form of protest in Tiruppur or elsewhere.

His counsel S. Pattabiraman claimed that the road on which the anti-CAA protesters had been squatting since February 15 was the one that connects Kangeyam Road with Uthukuli Road and serves as a link road.

In response to the PIL petition, State Government Pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayanan told the court that the Tiruppur police had registered 20 FIRs so far, and charge-sheets had also been filed in some of the cases. However, in reply to a specific question from the Bench, he conceded that despite cases having been registered, the protests were still going on. Observing that such an approach of the police cannot be countenanced, the judges said that once FIRs had been filed, and had culminated in the filing of charge-sheets, nothing can prevent the police from taking further action to ensure that no such protests take place in public places without valid permission or authorisation.

The object of filing FIRs was to set the law in motion and prevent illegal activities, the Bench said. It added that there was a difference between the right to protest and the consequent obstruction caused by hindering ingress and egress to a public road used by schoolchildren and even by patients to access hospitals and so on.

The judges recalled that another Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha had passed a detailed order on the issue on February 18 on yet another PIL petition seeking to restrain the Federation of Tamil Nadu Islamic and Political Organisations from laying siege to the Secretariat on February 19.

Later in the day, when a group of advocates led by Sudha Ramalingam made a representation before the Bench that the police were disturbing even those who were protesting peacefully across the State without causing any disturbance to the public, the judges directed the Registry to list the case once again on Friday for passing appropriate orders.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/how-can-police-allow-illegal-protests-despite-filing-firs-hc/article30994719.ece
380,2020/03/06,Centre sanctions eight food processing projects for T.N.,"At a cost of ₹220 cr., they are likely to generate 8,000 jobs

The Union government’s Inter-Ministerial Approval Committee has sanctioned eight food processing projects worth ₹220 crore for Tamil Nadu.

The projects, which would be implemented in eight districts, are likely to generate around 8,000 jobs and benefit 32,000 farmers, according to an official press release.

At a meeting in New Delhi on Wednesday, the Committee, headed by Union Minister for Food Processing Industries Harsimrat Kaur Badal, sanctioned a total of 10 projects worth ₹301.54 crore with grant-in-aid of ₹67.29 crore under the Agro Processing Cluster Scheme of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana of the Ministry of Food Processing Industries.

At the meeting, Tamil Nadu was represented by Principal Secretary (Agriculture) Gagandeep Singh Bedi and Commissioner of Agricultural Marketing and Agri-Business Shunchonngam Jatak Chiru. Of the cost of projects for the State, the central grant accounts for ₹48 crore and the State government’s unsecured loan ₹82 crore, with the remaining cost to be met through equity and loan. The unsecured loan may be converted into a grant at a later date, a State government official said.

The Union Minister expressed “satisfaction over proactive approach” of the Tamil Nadu government to the food processing sector through measures such as the formulation of policies on food processing and farmer producer organisations and the enactment of a law on contract farming.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/centre-sanctions-eight-food-processing-projects-for-tn/article30994697.ece
381,2020/03/06,HC dismisses PIL against Mettur surplus water project tender,"The Madras High Court on Thursday dismissed a public interest litigation petition filed against notification issued by the Public Works Department calling for tenders worth ₹445 crore for diversion of flood surplus water from the Mettur Dam to the dry tanks in the Sarabanga basin in Salem District for lift irrigation.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha dismissed the PIL petition filed by Arulnambi Engineering Consultants of Mettur though the company was not even interested in participating in the tender process. It claimed that the case had been filed only to ensure the tender rules were followed scrupulously. On the other hand, Advocate General Vijay Narayan contended that all rules had been followed meticulously and that the litigant had placed wrong information before the court. Agreeing with him, the judges said, “The petitioner cannot don the role of an expert adviser or that of a moral police.

“Any Government tender is not an easy process. There are experts in different fields and in this case, the irrigation specialists who are fully qualified and who know the job and the cost estimate for the work have planned on behalf of the Government. Tenders, when they are of high value, have their own inbuilt checks and balances.

“If such petitions are allowed by the court, the administration will come to a stand still. This petition is purely based on an apprehension. It can also be seen as shadow boxing by vested interests who are keen on stalling the tender process.

“Thousands of tenders are floated by various government departments in a year. Public interest litigation cannot be misused as a tool to stall them unless there is a clear case of violation of Article 21 (right to equality) of the Constitution of India. The infirmities pointed out by the petitioner appear to be ill conceived and disruptive,” the judges observed.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/yj7rnp/article30976515.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MadrasHighCourtvg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-dismisses-pil-against-mettur-surplus-water-project-tender/article30994685.ece

383,2020/03/06,Study to identify gaps in city’s water distribution network,"Metrowater initiative aims to improve infrastructure

Some of the chronic problems that have remained unaddressed in the city’s water supply network for many years may soon have a remedy. Chennai Metrowater will shortly launch a study to identify inadequacies and improve water distribution infrastructure.

The study would be taken up in the core areas where the network dates back to several decades. This is being done on a large scale as part of the desalination plant to come up in Perur along East Coast Road with a capacity of 400 million litres a day.

A robust network to convey drinking water was one of the requirements of Japan International Cooperation Agency, which has been roped in to fund the nearly ₹6,078-crore project. The aim is to provide adequate pressure in the network to ensure uniform water supply in all areas and eventually reduce groundwater dependence in the city, noted officials of Chennai Metrowater.

Officials said the same project management consultant for the desalination plant, SMEC International Limited in consortium with Tata Consulting Engineers and NJS Engineers India, would conduct the study in core areas of Chennai.

Preliminary study

A preliminary study was already done by another consultant for the desalination project, Nippon Koie Limited, Japan. It had identified broad areas that need to be improved. The study had suggested replacement of old pipelines running for a distance of 375 km in areas such as Tondiarpet, Royapuram, Anna Nagar, Kodambakkam and Thiruvanmiyur and also improving water pressure in the distribution pipeline in various areas.

It was suggested that pipelines covering a distance of 113 km be laid in uncovered streets in areas such as Kodambakkam, Royapuram and Perambur to enhance water supply. Besides metering system and addition of more overhead tanks for storage, the study also recommended establishment of district metered areas where water flowing into a particular area is metered and monitored for leaks and reduce non-revenue water.

The State government has already sanctioned ₹750 crore towards improving the water distribution network. “We want to get into the finer details of the gaps in the infrastructure. The preliminary survey would be the base of the detailed study of the entire network,” said an official. The consultant would soon start the study and trial pits may be dug to identify issues. The project is set to be completed within 24 months, the official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/study-to-identify-gaps-in-citys-water-distribution-network/article30994655.ece
384,2020/03/06,"City to get ₹5,000 cr. for water security, disaster preparedness","World Bank funding to cover eco-restoration of 25 waterbodies

Civic agencies in the city are likely to get funding from the World Bank for projects to improve water supply and promote disaster resilience. A team of World Bank officials met with officials of various civic agencies on Thursday to finalise funding for the projects. The meeting will be held for a few more days.

According to official sources, World Bank is planning to give funds to the tune of ₹5,000 crore for improving water supply and resilience during disasters.

Chennai Corporation is likely to get funding for eco-restoration of 25 waterbodies in various parts of the city. “The eco-restoration work is expected to improve groundwater level and promote resilience. Many areas affected by the floods in 2015 are likely to improve after the eco-restoration,” said an official.

World Bank is also planning to achieve 100% networking of households in the water supply system. The World Bank officials have been focusing on projects that provide piped water supply to all households in the city. According to sources, the World Bank is likely to increase the funding to ₹10,000 crore for improving the city’s water supply once the civic agencies submit proposals with better coordination. However, the civic agencies are yet to coordinate in a proper manner to give proposals that will solve the problems faced by residents during periods of water shortage.

As most of the houses in slums do not have piped water supply, the projects to give a makeover to slums remains the most important challenge for 100% networking of houses in the water supply system.

“Over 30% of the houses in the city do not have water supply. It requires huge funding and a makeover of the existing infrastructure,” said an official.

World Bank is also expected to fund projects of the TNSCB to build alternative houses for slum residents and also provide funding assistance for Metrowater proposal to give 24X7 water supply to all houses.

The Public Works Department is expected to build major drains and canals to promote resilience during floods.

He said that while CMCHIS was highly successful, hernia surgery was not covered under it in private hospitals.

Arguing that people from poorer economic backgrounds were at a disadvantage because of this, he appealed to the Chief Minister to consider including laparoscopic hernia surgery under the scheme.

387,2020/03/06,"Hostels remain unregulated and in bad shape, 15 months on","Only 19 hostels have been issued a licence in a city where hundreds of them operate

A little over a year after an announcement was made to the effect that hostels without registration would be shut down, little has changed on the ground in Chennai.

Hundreds of hostels continue to operate without proper licences. Till date, only 19 hostels in the city have been issued a licence to operate while 1,058 have applied for registration and are awaiting approval from the Collectorate.

Fifteen months ago, a complaint was lodged about cameras being found in a women’s hostel in Adambakkam.

The State government immediately mandated that all hostels should be registered under the Tamil Nadu Hostels and Homes for Women and Children (Regulations) Rules, 2015.

Hostels began queuing up for registration and, in June 2019, the then Collector A. Shanmuga Sundram said that 227 hostels in the city were under the scanner for operating without licences. He also said that special teams had been formed to look into these cases.

Now, things are back to what they used to be two years ago and working women continue to live in unhygienic spaces and eating poor quality food, despite paying exorbitant rent.

Tedious process

“I applied for registration and was asked to submit a few more documents. By then the concerned officials were transferred and after that I haven’t followed up on the status of the application. The Collector was also transfered. Whenever there is a problem, the government comes up with some rules, but after few months people forget it,” said a hostel owner in Thyagaraya Nagar, who has over 60 working women staying at his premises.

Three different hostel owners had the same response. “The last time I met an official regarding registration he told me that women staying at my premises should be given a minimum of 120 sq. ft. of space (per person). There are thousands of women coming to Chennai in search of jobs every week and all they need is a space to stay. Since there was no noise on this issue, I'm running my business without any hassle,” another hostel owner said. His hostel on Velachery Main Road has bunk beds in a room which is less than 80 sq. ft. and charges ₹7,500 per bed (without food) a month.

Crowded space

Ball park estimates show that there are over 4,200 hostels in Chennai and the industry is worth over ₹1,300 crore. On an average, 10 new hostels open each month in the city in places like Guindy, OMR, T. Nagar and Anna Nagar. According to online classifieds platform Sulekha, there are over 2,200 hostels listed in its database and 100 more are getting added every month. Fearing closure, many hostels are now running as paying guest accommodation.

Some hostels which are run in apartments have advised inmates to tell neighbours that they are family members. Amala (name changed), who has been living in various hostels in Chennai over the last four years, said, “I stay in a hostel which is inside an apartment. The owners have picked up three flats on lease. We have strictly been instructed not to speak to neighbours and if asked, to say that we are techie friends who are staying on rent.”

Need for regulation

Nine other girls whom The Hindu spoke to said that the State government should do something to regulate the industry which is unorganised, and running without providing amenities and following safety measures.

The girls suggested that the government should even put names of blacklisted hostels on its website so that its easier for women coming to the city for the first time.

“In the last two years, our room rents have been hiked twice citing water crisis. But till date, water is a challenge and we continue to stay without basic amenities,” said Shanthi (name changed), who resides in a hostel in Guindy.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vaqzfv/article30994602.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Hostelcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hostels-remain-unregulated-and-in-bad-shape-15-months-on/article30994603.ece
388,2020/03/06,Men’s hostels should get more attention,"With the government paying more attention to regulating women’s hostels, many feel that men’s hostels have gone below the radar.

There are close to 700 men’s mansions and hostels in the city that are registered with the Chennai Mansion Owners Association. Apart from these there are more than 500 that function outside this association.

Though there are no regulations in place for men’s hostels, inmates staying in mansions and hostels claim that there is an urgent need to bring in some monitoring at the earliest. “There have been instances when I have helped nab offenders who escape from their district and take refuge in the city. When they approach my hostel for lodging, I alert the police,” said a hostel owner in Choolaimedu.

S. Dastagir, secretary, Chennai Mansion Owners Association, said most of the men’s hostels are monitored by the respective police stations. “We have to submit details about the guests on a daily basis. If we don’t do this we will be pulled up. Usually we do not allow local residents to book rooms in our mansions,” he said.

He said that many mansions are increasingly adopting a no-liquor policy. “They will not be permitted to drink on the premises. They also cannot entertain guests after 10 p.m.,” he added.

Most of the men staying in the hostels and mansions are either college students or working professionals. “My room is neat and outside every room there is a CCTV camera. I pay ₹6,000 as monthly rent. There are rooms for ₹3,000 too,” said Sabeel from Kerala, who stays in a mansion in Triplicane.

Shyam Sundar, a student from Andhra Pradesh residing in a mansion in Triplicane, said that the rooms are dingy and there is water scarcity. “They charge me ₹2,000 for a room. There is no canteen and the building is old,” he said.

Nivin Peter, a college student residing in a hostel in Choolaimedu, said that in his mansion rent receipts are usually not given. “They give it only if I ask. There are no CCTV cameras too,” he said. A hostel owner in Choolaimedu said that amidst mansions and private hostels that follow rules, there are a few that do not. “These are the ones that rent out their residential property to multiple youngsters,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mens-hostels-should-get-more-attention/article30994591.ece

A group of Class XI students from Sishya School have raised ₹57 lakh through crowdfunding platform ‘Fuel A Dream’, and donated the money to General Cariappa Higher Secondary School to educate 250 poor students like Dinesh. Students like him are expected to get support to realise their dreams using the funds donated by students of the Sishya School.

To felicitate the students of Sishya for their exemplary service, the Guild of Service (Central) organised a function on Thursday at the General Cariappa School in Saligramam. The school has over 840 students from poor families.

S. Harishraj, a student of Class VIII from the school, who received the funds, said he wanted to become an IAS officer. His parents have been unable to pay his school fee.

Thanking Sishya School students for the help, another student, G.S. Vijay Ishal, said that he would work hard and become an advocate.

“My role model is Mahatma Gandhi. My father died when I was an infant. My mother is a typist at a private company. Her income is insufficient for my education,” he said.

S. Yamuna, whose mother is a tailor, said that her mother has been unable to finance her education her after the death of her father. She wants to be a doctor.

390,2020/03/06,Two arrested for hurling bomb at moving SUV,"Four surrender before Madurai court; police cite gang rivalry

Four persons surrendered at a judicial magistrate court in Madurai district on Thursday, in connection with the hurling of country bombs at a moving car on Anna Salai on Tuesday. The Teynampet police have arrested two other suspects.

A little after 4 p.m. on Tuesday, two youth on a motorcycle hurled two bombs at an SUV, moving on the opposite side of the road, near the Anna flyover.

After scrutinising CCTV camera footage, the Teynampet police arrested two youth, Mahesh and Akash, both college students in the city.

Meanwhile, the police said that Kamarudin, Johnson, Prasanth and Rajasekar surrendered before a court in Madurai.

Establishing motive

A senior police officer said, “We have arrested two persons and four persons have surrendered before the court. We will take them into police custody and interrogate them. Only after that can we establish the motive behind the attack.”

Police sources said that the incident was the fallout of a gang war. They suspect that the two persons in the SUV, who escaped unhurt, were ‘A plus’ category gangsters — C.D. Mani and Kakkathoppu Balaji. Despite an attack on their lives, those in the SUV have not lodged a police complaint.

The arrested and the surrendered men were with rival gangsters Thamba and Senthil, the police said. They had followed the SUV from the George Town court.

392,2020/03/06,China’s high-tech battle against COVID-19,"Technology is aiding the state’s fight against the virus, and also helping people cope with the stresses of a quarantined life

While the world grapples with the rapid spread of COVID-19, the tide seems to be turning in China, where the outbreak first began. On March 4, China reported 119 new infections — the lowest in six weeks — of which there were only four new cases outside of Hubei Province, the epicentre. Earlier, on March 1, Hubei had for the first time reported fewer than 200 new infections. If official Chinese statistics may not inspire confidence, there are other more tangible indicators that back up the numbers. In the city of Wuhan, where the epidemic began, authorities on March 1 closed the first makeshift hospital — one of the 16 that the government rapidly constructed — citing the recovery of all of its patients and the declining number of new infections. Fever clinics around the country are reporting a decline in patients.

Chinese officials are rightly cautioning that the fight is far from over. Risks remain when many of the 750 million people, who have been in some form of lockdown, return to work, as they will have to sooner rather than later, to aid an economy now at a standstill. Questions remain about China’s initial response and the cover-up by Hubei authorities which resulted in crucial time — and hundreds of lives — being lost between early December, when the first cases were reported, and the belated acknowledgement of a major outbreak on January 20.

Lockdown of Hubei

The response since late January has, however, underlined the two sides of the Chinese system. If the nature of an authoritarian system, that prides security above all else and stability at all costs, tacitly encourages the kind of cover-up seen in Hubei, it also enables a massive top-down response when the entire machinery is pressed into action. The response since, described by the WHO-China Joint Mission in a February 28 report as “perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history”, has begun paying dividends. The most prominent step was the January 23 lockdown effectively quarantining close to 60 million people, which slowed the spread outside of Hubei but also imposed untold costs on the people of the province.

For countries where mass lockdowns are too draconian to contemplate, other Chinese measures, particularly those employed outside of Hubei, may offer some lessons. As epidemiologist Bruce Aylward, who led the Joint Mission comprising 25 Chinese and international doctors, was quoted as saying, “I think the key learning from China is speed. The faster you can find the cases, isolate the cases, and track their close contacts, the more successful you’re going to be.” Two other key steps, he noted, were ensuring free treatment and testing, as well as providing prescriptions for patients for three months rather than the usual one month, to ensure supply of medicines.

Apps for tracking and testing

What has particularly stood out is the role of technology in this effort. One example is a new COVID-19 app that tells people whether they have been in close contact with anyone confirmed infected, based on flight and train records. A government-run close contact detector platform allows companies to check if any employees have been in contact with those infected by checking their national identification numbers. The main telecom operators are sharing location data with authorities to help contact tracing. In the southern city of Wenzhou, which saw a burst of cases because of the city’s traditional business links with Wuhan, more than 3,000 people who visited a noodle shop whose owners contracted the virus were traced through phone data. An app called Pingan Good Doctor, which has 300 million users and connects patients at home with doctors and pharmacies, has noted a surge in the number of users this past month.

In Hangzhou, a city famous for its technology companies, e-commerce giant Alibaba’s Alipay app has rolled out a health QR code system, assigning colour codes to citizens marking their risk level, drawing on their travel history and contacts. A green code means you can travel freely, yellow requires seven days of quarantine, while red requires a 14-day quarantine. This has been rolled out in Zhejiang, Sichuan, Hainan and Chongqing covering close to 200 million people, although the system is far from perfect. Chinese media have reported of numerous cases of wrong codes being assigned, preventing many low-risk citizens from using public transport or going to work. Then there are the privacy issues, with Chinese technology companies and mobile operators freely sharing users’ information with the authorities and police without their consent in the effort to trace and track possible patients.

Coronavirus | China turns to Artificial Intelligence, big data

China, which has invested billions of dollars in new Artificial Intelligence technologies, is deploying some of them in fighting the outbreak. Beijing-based Face++ has come up with a sophisticated temperature screening tool that can work in crowded places and screen thousands of people. It is now deployed in some of Beijing’s subway stations and government offices. In Sichuan province, doctors are using a new 5G telecom network to help remote hospitals — as well as overburdened doctors in the Hubei province epicentre — promptly assess CT scans to detect COVID-19 cases.

Two other prominent AI players, Baidu and SenseTime, are helping police identify people who aren’t wearing masks in public places and offices. In northwestern Yinchuan, authorities have deployed drones armed with loudspeakers — reminding residents to keep a distance from each other and to wear masks — and to spray sanitisers.

Technology is also, in less direct ways, helping a hunkered down population cope with the many stresses of living amid an outbreak. While schools remain closed, classes haven’t stopped, with millions of students receiving lessons every day through live-streaming apps.

Food delivery apps, enabled by a legion of delivery workers who are the unsung heroes of China’s COVID-19 crisis, are delivering essentials on a daily basis, so much so that the Sun Art Retail Group, the country’s biggest hypermarket operator, said its revenues hadn’t declined even though 80% of its outlets were closed. Food delivery app Meituan and e-commerce giant JD have deployed autonomous vehicles for “contactless” deliveries to hospitals and high-risk areas. While the outbreak has crippled much of China’s economy, some businesses have thrived. Virtual classes are booming, whether for fitness, cooking or music. And one of the most popular selling items during China’s COVID-19 crisis? Yoga mats.

Social unrest and economic ruin are self-inflicted while the health contagion of COVID-19 disease, caused by the novel coronavirus, is an external shock. I deeply worry that this potent combination of risks may not only rupture the soul of India but also diminish our global standing as an economic and democratic power in the world.

Delhi has been subjected to extreme violence over the past few weeks. We have lost nearly 50 of our fellow Indians for no reason. Several hundred people have suffered injuries. Communal tensions have been stoked and flames of religious intolerance fanned by unruly sections of our society, including the political class. University campuses, public places and private homes are bearing the brunt of communal outbursts of violence, reminiscent of the dark periods in India’s history. Institutions of law and order have abandoned their dharma to protect citizens. Institutions of justice and the fourth pillar of democracy, the media, have also failed us.

Charred soul of the nation

With no checks, the fire of social tensions is rapidly spreading across the nation and threatens to char the soul of our nation. It can only be extinguished by the same people that lit it.

It is both futile and puerile to point to past instances of such violence in India’s history to justify the present violence in the country. Every act of sectarian violence is a blemish on Mahatma Gandhi’s India. Just in a matter of few years, India has slid rapidly from being a global showcase of a model of economic development through liberal democratic methods to a strife ridden majoritarian state in economic despair.

At a time when our economy is floundering, the impact of such social unrest will only exacerbate the economic slowdown. It is now well accepted that the scourge of India’s economy currently is the lack of new investment by the private sector. Investors, industrialists and entrepreneurs are unwilling to undertake new projects and have lost their risk appetite. Social disruptions and communal tensions only compound their fears and risk aversion. Social harmony, the bedrock of economic development, is now under peril. No amount of tweaking of tax rates, showering of corporate incentives or goading will propel Indian or foreign businesses to invest, when the risk of eruption of sudden violence in one’s neighbourhood looms large. Lack of investment means lack of jobs and incomes, which, in turn, means lack of consumption and demand in the economy. A lack of demand will only further suppress private investments. This is the vicious cycle that our economy is stuck in.

Adding to these self-inflicted woes is the real threat of the COVID-19 epidemic that has originated in China. It is still unclear how far this global health hazard will spread and impact the world. But it is very clear that we should be fully prepared and ready to counter it. A health epidemic is one of the most dangerous threats that a nation can face. It is imperative that all of us collectively prepare to face this threat. We have not faced a public health crisis in contemporary times at the scale that the current crisis threatens to unfold. It is therefore important to launch a full-scale, mission-mode operation to counter this threat immediately.

Dealing with COVID-19

Nations across the world have sprung into action to contain the impact of this epidemic. China is walling off major cities and public places. Italy is shutting down schools. America has embarked aggressively both to quarantine people as well as hasten research efforts to find a cure. Many other nations have announced various measures to address this issue. India too must act swiftly and announce a mission critical team that will be tasked with addressing the issue. There could be some best practices we can adopt from other nations.

Regardless of whether this virus will enter our shores on a large scale or not, it is now evident that the economic impact of COVID-19 will be very big. International bodies such as the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have already pronounced a sharp slowdown in global economic growth. There are reports that China’s economy may even contract, which, if it happens, will be the first time since the Cultural Revolution of the 1970s. China today accounts for nearly a fifth of the global economy and a tenth of India’s external trade. The forecast for the world economy is quite dire. This is sure to impact India’s economic situation too. Millions of small and medium businesses in India that account for more than three-quarters of all formal employment are part of the global supply chain. In such an integrated global economy, the COVID-19 crisis can further slow India’s GDP growth by half to one percentage point, other things being constant. India’s economic growth was already tepid and this external health shock is bound to make things much worse.

Bringing in reforms

It is my belief that the government must quickly embark on a three point plan. First, it should focus all energies and efforts on containing the COVID-19 threat and prepare adequately. Two, it should withdraw or amend the Citizenship Act, end the toxic social climate and foster national unity. Three, it should put together a detailed and meticulous fiscal stimulus plan to boost consumption demand and revive the economy.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi must convince the nation, not merely through words but by deeds, that he is cognisant of the dangers we face and reassure the nation that he can help us tide over this as smoothly as we can. He must immediately provide details of the contingency plan for the threat of the COVID-19 scare.

A moment of deep crisis can also be a moment of great opportunity. I recall that in 1991, India and the world faced a similar grave economic crisis, with a balance of payments crisis in India and a global recession caused by rising oil prices due to the Gulf War. But we were able to successfully turn this into an opportunity to reinvigorate the economy through drastic reforms. Similarly, the virus contagion and the slowing down of China can potentially open up an opportunity for India to unleash second -generation reforms to become a larger player in the global economy and vastly improve prosperity levels for hundreds of millions of Indians. To achieve that, we must first rise above divisive ideology, petty politics and respect institutional salience.

It is not my desire to offer a dire prognosis or to exaggerate fears. But I believe it is our solemn duty to speak truth to the people of India. The truth is that the current situation is very grim and morose. The India that we know and cherish is slipping away fast. Wilfully stoked communal tensions, gross economic mismanagement and an external health shock are threatening to derail India’s progress and standing. It is time to confront the harsh reality of the grave risks we face as a nation and address them squarely and sufficiently.

It is understandable that the COVID-19 outbreak has instilled fear in the minds of the general population in India, as elsewhere. In the olden days, people perished in their thousands in pestilences. But the world is now in a better position to cope with the outbreaks of infectious diseases and minimise casualties. India cannot afford to be complacent. Transparency, as against secrecy, is vital. It will take time to develop a vaccine. As of now, what we can do is to take special care to avoid being exposed to the virus. The WHO has recommended simple measures like avoiding contact with infected persons, keeping some distance from anyone coughing or sneezing and hand-washing with soap and running water. It is believed that in India, the hot weather may act as a defence and a deterrent against the virus and deny it the stage for its destructive dance, though this has not been conclusively proved.

G. David Milton,

With reports of at least 30 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in India, it is time the nation woke up to the stark truth that we are not immune to the deadly effects of new strain of virus. Though the threat has set alarm bells ringing and triggered panic across the country, it is the manner in which the administration has been going about dispelling fears in the minds of countrymen that has added to the confusion. With no known antidote or vaccine to neutralise its effects, the halo of ‘invincibility’ the virus has earned for itself has had a paranoiac effect on the masses. The fourth estate, with its alarmist coverage about the ‘progressive onslaught’ of the rampaging virus, has only made people more apprehensive.

Making it to the IITs

The seamy side of the IIT success story of Andhra Pradesh makes one wonder: at what cost the parents are pushing their children towards the IIT goal (Editorial page, “Dark tales in Andhra Pradesh’s IIT success story,” Mar. 5)? The enormous mental pressure and physical strain of preparing the students from Class VI for the IIT entrance examination is a sure recipe for distorting the psychological wellbeing of the students for the rest of their lives. This is a very high price to pay, given the fact that as small as 3%-4% of the total students finally succeed. The rest are deprived of a normal healthy life during most of their teenage years. The only way to save these children from the clutches of these “corporate schools” is to change the pattern of IIT and other entrance examinations every year and make them unpredictable. A normal, intelligent and hardworking student is always prepared to face any test of knowledge, whatever be the pattern. There could be an argument that such changes would put the rural students at a disadvantage. A way to address the issue is to strengthen rural education rather than make compromises detrimental to the larger good.

Kosaraju Chandramouli,

Hyderabad

It is indeed saddening that students are put under immense pressure to join IITs. While many crack the exam, it is vital to understand rote learning never makes a person understand concepts deeply. Many go into depression if they fail to crack the exam after years of toil. After working in the U.S. for many years and watching many executives, I have come to the realisation that following one’s passion is important for one to thrive and excel. By forcing children to neatly fit into identified career paths, parents will never be able to do justice to the full potential of their wards. It is prudent then to identify the child’s passion and encourage them to go deep even if it doesn’t agree to the society’s norms.

India’s loss in New Zealand

India’s 0-2 Test series loss to New Zealand has brought to the fore the age-old problem of our batsmen’s technical inadequacy and vulnerability in tackling quality pace and swing bowling on seaming foreign wickets. Even captain Virat Kohli, the best batsman in the world, had no clues to the craftiness of the Kiwi pace attack as he scored just 38 runs in the entire series (Editorial, “Flow and ebb”). The Men-in-Blue’s 5-0 T20 series win hardly manifests their true skills and reputation, as in demanding conditions in Tests they were found wanting. Similarly, sitting atop the points table in the World Test Championship is no justification to India’s No. 1 Test ranking, as most of its wins so far have come on home soil. Succinctly put, the wings of the Kiwis opened up impressively in white flannels and flew sky high, leaving the Indians completely grounded.

395,2020/03/06,'Palasa 1978' movie review: The strong script makes it a compelling watch,"Director Karuna Kumar's film is a gritty story of folk artistes picking up guns for survival

Karuna Kumar who made National award-winning short films earlier, is a native of Palasa in Srikakulam district. He hence had drawn inspiration from an incident he had witnessed years ago and fictionalised it. Palasa is known for its cashew business and power politics. The movie begins showing how people, mostly women are employed in factories and are involved in all stages of cashew business — from cultivation to packaging. Illiteracy is an issue and caste subjugation is rampant. The narrative begins in 1978 and moves to 2018 and shows the evolution and ageing of characters too. We take little time to register as to what is happening but once that done, there is no budging from the seats.

The people in Palasa work hard in the mornings and by dusk they tie anklets and pick up the musical instruments to indulge in music. The prime characters belong to such family of folk artistes but circumstances lead them to give up their art form and take to violence. There are so many twists in the story that we don’t see it coming. What hooks our attention apart from the story is the performances. The entire cast comprise of newcomers barring an actor Thiruveer who worked in George Reddy.

Director Karuna Kumar did a great job of training these newcomers and extracting natural performances from them. They speak in an endearing Srikakulam dialect. Baby Pasala, who became an overnight singing sensation on Internet, gets to sing her first song with SP Balasubramanyam for this movie. Raghu Kunche’s rural and retro music and earthy RR lends value to the story and acts as a catalyst in moving the plot ahead. Raghu plays a villain and sinks into his character well.

It is about two brothers — Ranga Rao (Thiruveer) and Mohan Rao (Rakshit) belong to backward community and are drawn into a web of politics and exploited by another two high caste brothers for their dominance and survival in the village.

Rakshit, Thiruveer, Nakshatra, Raghu Kunche and other characters — small and big — make the story a compelling watch. The camera has captured every emotion brilliantly and it is hard to believe it is the director’s first film. However, redundancy in dialogues towards the end of the film would help fine tune the story. The climax isn’t what you expect and you notice that none of the characters in Palasa are vulnerable, they are all strong. The pace of the film is fast, yet keeps the curiosity intact. This one is a compelling watch.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/srkd02/article30999800.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy07palasa1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/director-karuna-kumar-weaves-a-gritty-story-in-palasa-1978/article30999802.ece
396,2020/03/06,‘Pedal for a purpose’,"Madurai is all set to host its first biggest cyclothon on Sunday, bringing together cycling enthusiasts from various walks of life

The Executive Director of Thiagarajar Mills, Hari Thiagarajan, also appointed Chairman of CII-TN earlier this week, recalls how as a child, he would cycle around in the Kodai hills during summer vacations. When he bought his first cycle in Chennai, he often took it to the beach there. And after Decathlon set shop in Madurai, he bought a new-age gear cycle and followed his passion with more regularity. That was about five years ago when he started riding along the smooth road from Thiagarajar College of engineering (TCE) to the Madurai airport, taking in the scenic views of paddy fields.

“Apart from being a good physical exercise, it is a great stress-buster. I continue to cycle on the 20 kilometre stretch at the break of dawn, at least two to three times a week or whenever I am in Madurai,” says Hari. Most days, he pedals alone and sometimes, is joined by like-minded friends.

Around the same time, in another part of the town, Kutti Muthukumar took to cycling because he wanted to lose weight. He lost 20 kilos and also gave up his job as a distributor in a private company. “I became obsessed with cycling. The geared, sporty ones of today fascinate me no end,” says Muthukumar. He opened a bicycle store and also launched the City Cycling Club in 2015. Over the years, close to 500 cycling enthusiasts joined him and some of them have also turned pros and cycling brevets.

The humble bicycle thus saw a rebirth in the city and it also timed well with the entry of sports shop Decathlon. The store established its own Cycling Club with its band of dedicated customers around the time, another association of youngsters got together to establish Madurai Pedallers Club in 2016. “We were a small group of about a dozen cruising on the city’s familiar routes around the Meenakshi Temple, Race Course ground, the Vaigai Bank or the hills every morning to get and remain fit,” says businessman and cycling enthusiast Shenher Lal. Today, they are a group of 60 and are drawn from different professions to cycle for fun, fitness and friendship.

It was around the middle of the last decade, that cyclists became the new ‘minority’ in the city attracting the gaze of onlookers with their stylish and colourful helmets, hand pads, reflective neon-striped T-shirts and sports shoes on bicycles equipped with speedometers, gears, loaded handlebars, powerful head and tail lights and what not.

When the city’s marathon scene picked up, with the fourth edition of the annual Madurai Marathon attracting 5,000 runners in January this year, Hari decided to call out to all cyclists and celebrate the spirit of the city. “In the last few years, I saw many of my friends buy the stationary cycle to exercise indoors, but nothing beats the energising outdoor experience,” he says and adds, “On every ride, you discover a new path and new elements en route.”

Hari came up with the idea of a public initiative to cycle for a social cause. “Since March 8 was co-incidentally chosen as the day to kick-start the cyclothon, we thought of pushing people to think about women’s health and in particular, breast cancer, given its high incidence,” he says.

And so ‘Pedal for a Purpose’ was conceived as a concerted campaign to help women understand how to manage breast cancer. Under the banner of TCE, the cyclothon has already received 750 registrations online. “This is a good number from our city, marking the beginning of an annual flagship event,” says Muthukumar, who along with the other cycling groups joining the event, hopes the efforts will revive cycling culture in the city.

“Cycling has always been a friendly community and we want to take it beyond a hobby,” adds Hari. “We do not want to make the event competitive but want people to enjoy the sport and feel a sense of accomplishment while raising awareness about a health issue.”

The Hindu is the print media partner for the event.

Bring your own bicycle to participate in the first TCE Cyclothon 2020 on March 8.

Assemble by 6 am at TCE grounds and collect your kits (containing T Shirt, cap, energy bar and water).

Registration fee (includes breakfast after the event): ₹300 for men, ₹150 for women and ₹100 for children (above 12 years) to college students.

On-the-spot registrations will be allowed depending on the numbers

The cyclothon will be conducted in two categories: 20 kilometres for men and women and 10 kilometres for students

Participants from outside Madurai city can drop their bicycles at five collection points that will be operational from Saturday evening — at Decathlon store, Ulaganeri; Pandiyan Hotel, Alagar Koil Road; Green Trends Salon Bypass Road; New Jail Road opposite Madura Coats and Thiagarajar College of Arts, Teppakulam. The cycles will be brought to the venue by the volunteers on Sunday morning.

A lucky dip will decide five random women who complete the cyclothon as recipients of health insurance policies with one year premium paid.

397,2020/03/06,On Annapurna Sweets’ new home in the capital,"The Bengalis have a way with sweets, especially when it's milky and fried

There is something about the word singara. It is the Bengali for samosa, of course, but has its own charm. For one, the Bengali singara is vastly different from its North Indian counterpart. The potatoes are not mashed, but are in small pieces, and you will find bits of peanuts and sometimes even potato skin in the stuffing.

Then there is a cauliflower singara, in which the filling consists of florets usually sautéed with potatoes. And, as I found to my pleasant surprise some years ago, there is even something called Kheerer Singara, a sublime sweet with a stuffing of thickened, sweetened milk.

I first had this sweet at a small eatery called Ramakrishna Sweets in I.P. Extension. I was floored. It looked beautiful, and the taste was superb. It’s called a singara only because it is shaped like one. But the outer casing, as well as the filling, is of sweetened, thickened milk.

Some days ago, we were given a boxful of this sweet. It came from a place called New Annapurna on Yusuf Sarai. I thought it was the best sweet I’d had in a very long time. So I decided I had to renew my friendship with this sweet shop that was once a favourite haunt of mine.

I have old links with Annapurna Sweets. The original sweet shop in Chandni Chowk was the first selling Bengali sweets in the city. The owners, the Mukherjee family, came from Lahore and set up shop near the fuara (fountain), opposite Gurudwara Sisganj, in the market area. Over the years, branches have sprung up.

There was a time when I used to go to the Yusuf Sarai Annapurna for its samosas. I loved the potato filling and the dry green chutney that came with it. You had to dissolve the paste in water and you had a tangy chutney you could dip the samosas in.

Then I heard, a few weeks ago, that the shop had moved to another end of the Yusuf Sarai Market. The old Annapurna sweet shop has its shutters down. The new one is two buildings away — and is called New Annapurna Sweets (G 12, Rakesh Deep Building, Balbir Saxena Marg, Yusuf Sarai; phone: 011-4213 8143, 9958047810).

The Kheerer Singara (₹25 for a piece, ₹750 for a kilo) was even better than what I had eaten some weeks ago; this had gur in it, which of course added to the taste. I also ate some Shor Bhaja (₹25 a piece, ₹450 for a kilo), and found it absolutely A-class.

This is a sweet made out of layers of malai thickened, sweetened, and fried. I had it for the first time way back in the ‘70s when my friend Kajal Ghosh got the sweet from Krishnanagar, a city in Bengal known for its Shor Bhaja and Shor Puriya. It was love at first bite.

New Annapurna has all the other Bong favourites, too — from Dorbesh and Rajbhog to Khir Kadam and Chomchom. The small Misti Doi (₹30), Sankh Sandesh (₹16) and Kancha Golla (₹25). The savoury counter has singaras (₹16), paneer chop, vegetable cutlet (₹30) and even kachoris (₹25).

I had the aloo and the cauliflower samosas, and thought they were delicious. The cauliflower one, in particular, was superb; the florets had been fried with potatoes and spiced well.

It is good to know that the Annapurnas — old and new — are all thriving. What could be sweeter than more sweets?

398,2020/03/06,Candy crush: The Bombay Sweet Shop opens in Byculla,"Mithai gets an update at the new Bombay Sweet Shop, where ghevar turns tart and puran polis make their way into softies

Byculla Zoo is home to seven Humboldt penguins, of which six have paired up, leaving behind a lone ranger, Bubble. A short distance away, another lone penguin vies for attention. This one, however, sports a jaunty hat and is made of chocolate, honey and milk. The Boarding School Shake is a popsicle with flavours familiar to those who drank tall glasses of chocolate milk for breakfast before school. It is also exactly what the Bombay Sweet Shop (BSS) aims to be: a tribute to the past, but reinterpreted.

The new venture from Hunger Inc Hospitality’s co-founders Yash Bhanage and Sameer Seth, and chef Floyd Cardoz — who reimagined Indian food at The Bombay Canteen (TBC) and Goan food at O Pedro — aims to recreate the magic of Indian mithai in a way that’s familiar, accessible and fun. “The idea was born in October 2016, when Yash was travelling to the US, wondering what gifts he could carry that were quintessentially Indian. His ‘aha’ moment happened at Istanbul airport when he saw the Turkish Delight shops and the experience they create around sweets. It triggered a conversation about looking at Indian sweets with that same lens,” says Seth. Thus began two years of research into creating an ‘experience’ around Indian mithai.

Getting chikki with it

The shop is no ordinary mithai place. It is a mithai factory, divided into a Mithai Bar, with a gifting counter, and a café serving street snacks and Indian drinks (the liquor license is yet to come). There are different stations for hot and cold sweets, an open kitchen, and a storage room.

You can watch the sweets being prepared in the kitchen, beyond a glass window proclaiming ‘Hello from the Halwai side’. At the chikki counter, you can customise your own and get it in eight minutes. If you’ve had a surfeit of sweet, counter it with a fizzy banta soda. Or take some time out to click photos at the statement wall, with its laddoo-stealing monkeys gathered around a mithaiwala making jalebis; the sweet isn’t on the menu yet.

Touch of spice The café is a tribute to all things street. There is a Burmese Bhel (₹225) with noodles tossed in a chilli chutney, an Avocado Papdi Chaat (₹295) with millets, and for refreshments, a Clarified Masala Iced Tea (₹160).

Months of research and trials have gone into each sweet — visiting halwais across the country, learning to recreate recipes (often made without any measurements) and discovering lost ones. And much like their offerings at The Bombay Canteen and O Pedro, the food is experimental and delicious; it is also vegetarian. “If you decide on mithai as an experience, it starts with the products. We have a little bit of the traditional, with a twist, and we also have things that are completely new,” says Seth.

Some could polarise people’s opinions. For purists, they have favourites like motichoor laddoo, pedas and kaju katli (served as halves or ‘cutting katlis’). Elsewhere, kaju katli becomes Kaju Bon Bons, coated in chocolate and filled with salted caramel; motichoor laddoo gets spiked with rum and dark chocolate; and patissa turns into delicate Coconut Caramel Patissa Fingers with layers of peppery caramel and coconut. Everyone’s favourite gola is a popsicle with flavours like Anglo Indian (caramel custard, rum and vanilla). Even crispy ghevar becomes a tart in Mamma Mukherjee’s Tiramisu Ghevar Tart, layered with rasgulla and topped with mascarpone.

Boxes and honeycombs

“We’ve stayed true to the way mithai is traditionally made, but presented it in a different light. When you close your eyes and eat it, you know what it is, but when you look at it, it is different,” says Cardoz.

BSS’ sweet treats will be available online and at the partner restaurants. But the full magic is on offer at Byculla, where, with architect Shonan Puri Trehan, they’ve created a space that focusses on the nostalgia associated with sweets. The décor includes bumblebees on the floor, weights moulded into tables, rose and pista colours, geometry displayed through honeycombs and diamonds, and concession stalls inspired by those found in single-screen theatres. They also have a Rani Baugh collection inspired by the zoo.

It has taken the team two years to put together this ‘labour of love’. “It’s like an elephant... been in labour for that long,” concludes Cardoz.

The Bombay Sweet Shop in Byculla East is open all week, 11 am to 9 pm.

399,2020/03/06,Why India’s popular restaurants are creating delivery-only brands,"They have loyal walk-in customers, but established walk-in restaurants are also catering to the whole different set of needs that at-home food lovers have

We all have our favourite restaurants, that we walk into for the familiar comfort of it, for the ambience, for the DJ who gets it just right, for the waiter who knows our go-to order, or for memories shared with friends, families or dates.

And then we have our favourite order-at-home options, which may or may not be (and usually are not) the same as our walk-in haunts.

Often, the latter is not a full-fledged restaurant but a cloud kitchen — one that focusses on how to portion and package a meal for one, indulgent or guilt-free, ideal for solitary binge sessions at the end of a long, hard day that leaves us too drained to cook. Restaurants are increasingly aware of why at-home diners prefer cloud kitchens over them. A large part of it has to do with serving size. First movers in India’s cloud kitchen scene — like Rebel Foods, the Pune-based entity that owns Faasos, Lunch Box, Behrouz, The Good Bowl and Oven Story among others — tend to have menus featuring either single-person dishes and combos, or party sizes fit for at least four to five people. Both tailored for a night in, be it social or solitary.

Restaurants and cafés, on the other hand, serve items that are either meant to be shared by two people, or that come with their share of frills in terms of sides, sauces and platings. Attractive when eating out, cumbersome when dining in.

So a few of them have started changing things around. Take, for instance, the 11-year-old chain Smoke House Deli, which has branches in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi and Kolkata. The brand has started relaunching its restaurants as Smoke House Deli 2.0, the fourth and most recent one unveiled in Delhi this week.

In a company statement, Smoke House Deli 2.0 boasts healthier options in its menu, a “more airy, open, and modern” ambience, and more importantly, a grab-and-go counter which has its own, separate presence on food delivery platforms Swiggy and Zomato. The latter is called Goodness To Go by Smoke House Deli, and features a menu curated by brand head and head chef Jaydeep Mukherjee.

According to Jaydeep, the idea is to provide “a station where patrons can step in to grab quick meals, healthy smoothies, salads, sandwiches etc. Easy and convenient, it allows patrons to keep up with their busy lifestyle on-the-go, while still eating mindfully.” The packaging keeps that in mind, making the food easy to “grab” not only for rushing customers, but also for delivery personnel.

Meanwhile, Chennai-based Ciclo Cafe, which expanded its presence to Bengaluru and Delhi, has now scaled back into its hometown and is “working on regrouping,” says marketing head Amrutha Anandanathan. The café has launched a health-based delivery vertical called Ciclo Life, which features a salad bowl and meals, with plenty of quinoa, millets and cauliflower rice making their presence felt. Says Amrutha, “We don’t want to call it health food completely, but rather delicious food with a healthy leaning. The menu also includes popular staples that we have taken from Ciclo Cafe, and given healthier variations, including multigrain and keto-friendly options.” The service has three successfully running branches in Chennai alone — RA Puram, Anna Nagar and OMR — and is now confident of expanding well in other cities. “We have experienced chefs, and a team that knows how to run things. We are strengthening our home base first,” adds Amrutha.

In terms of operations, this system seems to be working out to the restaurants’ advantage, with the basic infrastructure already built in and a whole new clientèle to reach out to. With the same team and kitchen staff handling these new verticals, restaurants can retain the image and branding that provided them loyal customers over the years, instead of depending on the outsourced kitchens and infrastructure provided by delivery platforms, that many cloud-only kitchens tend to depend on.

Swiggy, for instance, is reportedly tying-up with Bengaluru-based restobar chain Gilly’s, for the operation of two new delivery-only brands. One is called Kitchens of Punjab, and the other is Kitchens of China. These outfits operate out of infrastructure that are already existent at Gilly’s outlets, and be run by the existing Gilly’s staff. Swiggy does not offer any infrastructure in this case; it only helps with delivery, according to Swiggy. Only the menu and the online presence will be separate from the motherbrand, and will be focussed entirely on delivery, according to Swiggy.

Similarly, Goodness To Go by Smoke House Deli operates out of a central kitchen that is otherwise used for coordination between its various Mumbai branches. While Goodness To Go is mainly present as a counter within each Smoke House Deli 2.0, a standalone outpost operates inside a Crossword bookstore in Mumbai’s Kemp’s Corner, and depends entirely on this central kitchen. On delivery apps, too, this vertical stands on its own with a full menu. More are to follow, in other bookstores and unexpected hangouts. The idea, as chef Jaydeep puts it, is for it to metamorphose “into an artfully imaginative, wholesome and evolved version of itself.”",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/r1m76r/article30998981.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06mpfood2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/why-indias-popular-restaurants-are-creating-delivery-only-brands/article30998987.ece

401,2020/03/06,The Corona ripple,"The masks are going on, as the flights are emptying out. There’s always a silver lining

Corona, in the beer world, is only conspicuous by its general lack of any particular taste. It is a beer for non-beer drinkers, just like Rolex is a watch for the rich but unimaginative.

The Corona virus, by contrast, has shown itself to be a lot more spirited and masala-packed. It has managed to do two seemingly impossible things — bring China to its absolute kankles and make the beer brand loathed even more than it already was.

But just as there is an upside to everything — it is the natural duality of the general state of things, don’t blame me — the spread of this virus has meant some blessings in disguise. I will first list them before discussing the one most relevant to me.

Dogs and cats might finally get spared from becoming main courses on the mainland. Sharks and chickens, unfortunately, have no such respite in sight yet.

The student protests in Hong Kong have almost died down which is good for China, but not so much for democracy.

Flights and airports are emptier than our politicians’ promises.

Now the dog/cat bit is brilliant, the HK curfew, not so much. But it is the flight situation that really works out well.

Now, I rarely venture to the other side of the galley, but every now and then for short-haul sorties, I still allow myself to sit in the cosier (read: coach) section. It is a tough world out there; if business class is brutal, economy is akin to an episode of The Hunger Games. But ever since the virus did a Thanos and clicked its gauntlet-ed fingers, the numbers flitting about the globe are sparser than a Trump rally. What this means is:

1. Quicker check-ins for starters. More seating options, too.

2. You will also possibly get more seat for your money — the three-set economy row will become the new full-flat albeit bumpy bed.

3. Bathrooms will remain freer. Also, devoid of pesky tots, flights will be generally quieter.

4. Food options, which never last beyond the emergency row, will now hopefully be available right into the rear galley, which means you can order what you like, maybe even twice!

5. No more fast track privileges needed as immigrations will push you out like a runny egg. But, on the flip side, the health inspectors might hold you up for a longer probe.

The only downside is that if the airlines and the airports deploy lesser people at their posts, chances are a lot of the inefficiencies that currently prevail won’t stand mitigated. In fact, since the smarter of the set will stay home, we’ll be riddled with the dumber of the lot, which could then mean even longer waits.

The virus hasn’t hit Indian shores properly yet, so domestic flights remain full of apathy and the stench of selfishness, not unlike our politicians. But I certainly hope that Covid-19, in its travels through our subcontinent, takes down a teeming million or few of those masquerading as upholders of the law by taking it into their own hands. Trouble is, I am sceptical it will have any effect on them goons — it might not even find a way through their thick skins considering how logic, reason or any sense of empathy have failed insofar.

402,2020/03/06,Is your house eco-logic?,"Buildings are built completely out of natural resources, yet they do not become a part of nature and blend with it. By Sathya Prakash Varanashi

We have millions of buildings and we are building millions more. But let’s imagine the shocking possibility that at least 75% of buildings will get demolished during the next 200 years and wonder where all the debris would go. Sounds absurd when we think how every shelter every other animal makes, returns to nature.

Look at the total weight of a building - floors, walls, roofs, doors, windows, toilets, everything. We build them to carry the load of us and our belongings. The building weight would be far more than our total weight. How illogic when we see a bird’s nest weighing less than its occupants. Today buildings figure in books, seminars, schools and tax papers - more as owned asset, social image, family aspiration, functional performance, capital investment, operational costs, iconic architecture, innovative ideas, human creativity and many others.

Reality is buildings are built completely out of natural resources, located on a natural site, yet they do not become a part of nature - buildings that may blend with nature and become incognito are not always heard of.

Architecture started with shelter making, followed by need for shade, security, storage, space, safety, protection, familiarity, comfort and such others – on most occasions, each one of these criteria is overdone in our design and construction industry.

From being ecological animals, we have shifted to being economical animals. From economical, it became personal and now we all live our individual aspirations with no due recognition to the eco-impact we are causing.

Connection to nature

We have forgotten that we vibrate better with natural materials due to our connection to nature vide geo, bio, electric, magnetic energy waves surrounding all of us. Of course, we study bio-mimicry, bio-morphism and bio-philia to design bio-climatic architecture, with recent thoughts on building biology also. But how many of us do all this, out of world population?

Our architecture need to evolve from nature, made of nature and made for nature. Only then, it will become part of nature or someday become nature itself. That’s the simplest mode to realise eco-logics.

Eco-logic is not a great new term. It is what has created our only home called the Earth and the early tribes still live with the logic of their contexts.

Developed human societies created a human knowledge system called rational logic and told us to follow it in every aspect of our lives. In recent centuries, we have evolved modern human logic, as an opposite to eco-logic.

Will the human logic someday overpower the eco-logic is unknown to us, but the way climate change is threatening to change the course of our future, it appears like eco-logic will prevail over human logics.

May be its time to change our courses before we too become victims of what we have unleashed on the Earth – the age of Extinction.

403,2020/03/06,How these women are setting examples to grow pesticide-free vegetables and fruits at their homes,"Both homemakers and working women have created green spaces for edibles in the backyards and rooftops of their houses

When Sujitha KJ’s landlord told her to remove the passion fruit vines from their house, she was heartbroken. Luckily, within a few months, her family bought a house of their own. Today, this home at Ariyottukonam near Pothencode, which stands on less than five cents, has a terrace garden, which bagged the State award for the best terrace garden in the district in 2019.

Sujitha is among the many women to have set up vegetable and fruit gardens at their homes to promote a healthy lifestyle. With organic farming gaining root, kitchen gardens have become a norm and many women, both homemakers and working women, grow vegetables and fruits in the backyards or terraces of their homes, thus saying no to pesticide-laden vegetables and fruits that flood the markets. These women are also creating an income as they sell their produce at organic bazaars. In connection with International Women’s Day, MetroPlus catches up with a few women who have created green spaces for edibles.

In good company

Padma Suresh calls the 500-sq-ft terrace of her home “the happiest place”. This home-maker from Pappanamcode starts her day in the company of plants, while listening to songs on the radio. “I can’t live without the company of my plants, they are like my children. I cherish every moment I spend in my garden,” says Padma, whose garden received the State award for the third best terrace garden in the district.

“Even though I used to accompany my father to the paddy fields as a young girl, I never imagined that I would take up farming one day. I first got hooked to orchid farming and then jasmine cultivation. One day, I came across a newspaper report about R Ravindran from Kochulloor, an expert in organic and terrace farming, and the large African yam he cultivated. A meeting with him inspired me to start my own vegetable garden. Today, I grow over 20 varieties of vegetables and sell them regularly at weekly organic markets,” says the 42-year-old.

Ushakumari GS, a teacher at Government Model HSS, Pattom, started growing vegetables at her home on a trial basis. “We wanted to consume healthy, home-grown food. We have fruit-bearing trees around our house. There is mango, jackfruit, avocado, sapota, mangosteen… I was keen on growing flowering plants at first. But later, my husband, L Suresh Kumar, and I wanted to try our hand at growing vegetables. We started out with ivy gourd and green chillies. Once we got an excellent yield, we moved on to other vegetables. Today, we have a full-fledged garden where we grow mint and coriander as well,” says Usha.

Age doesn’t come in the way for 65-year-old Vijaya Bhaskar from Aruvikkara who manages a flourishing vegetable garden on her terrace and a kitchen garden too. “It was after my husband, Bhaskaran Nair, retired from his job that we decided to take up vegetable farming. So we attended a four-day class to learn more about terrace farming. In the last five years, we have rarely purchased any vegetables from the market,” says Vijaya, adding with pride that their garden has been featured in several magazines and television programmes.

Most of these women find market for their produce at the farmers’ bazaar organised at Gandhi Bhavan, Thycaud, or at Pillaveedu Nagar, Kesavadasapuram. Social media has evolved as a learning platform as there are several groups dedicated to farming on WhatsApp and Facebook where these farmers can clear their doubts and exchange suggestions and advices.

However, there is more to having a vegetable garden than watering and applying manure. Pests are a constant threat. “Some pests finish off eating entire plants overnight. This often happens with mint and coriander. So we have to patiently inspect every plant,” says Usha. Vijaya adds: “One has to make it a habit to check the plants both in the morning and evening. That makes it a refreshing exercise for us.”

One should also be willing to learn and read about farming methods from magazines and classes. Sujitha, who is also the secretary of Thiruvananthapuram Karshaka Koottaayma, points out that one should be open to experimentation as well. In her case, besides the common varieties of vegetables, she grows cabbage, cauliflower, yam (kaachil), ginger, turmeric and paddy on her terrace. She has also taken up hydroponics and aquaponics. On another five cents near her home, she cultivates nearly 200 varieties of grafted fruit-bearing plants in containers.

She also holds classes on terrace cultivation and is now giving guidance to 20 houses of a residents’ association in Pettah to set up rooftop gardens. “Soil preparation, use of quality seeds, pest control methods and preparing compost at home are some of the topics I cover in my classes. For working women, I suggest irrigation techniques such as wick irrigation and drip irrigation so that they can save on the time needed to water the plants. My suggestion is start on a small scale and unless you find it enjoyable, don’t push yourself into doing it. I talk to my plants and, for me, being in the garden is a good way to relieve stress. When you are passionate about something, you will definitely find time to pursue it,” she says.",homes and gardens,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/1f85e0/article31000123.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07TVMORGANIC,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/how-women-are-setting-examples-to-grow-pesticide-free-vegetables-and-fruits-at-their-homes/article31000128.ece
404,2020/03/06,Lush greens on bare rocks,"If you follow the rule of nature and grow plants that suit the ecology of the place... Nandhini Sundar steps into a paradise

For any sort of greenery to prevail, the least expectation is for the land to be cultivable with a reasonably fertile top soil. Bald rocky surfaces sans top soil are certainly not in the order list and most definitely not one on which such green experiments would be ventured. Yet, Binay Kumar Singh certainly did so, on 6 acres of totally barren land that was bereft of even a blade of grass, the terrain rocky, the surface bald, swept clean of any remnants of soil that may have prevailed.

A software engineer by profession, Singh took it up as a challenge in 2013 and volunteered to work on the terrain and bring in the greens using the technique of permaculture on the rocky expanse of land belonging to the Art of Living on the outskirts of Bengaluru. What then ensued in the next six years, ‘after letting nature takeover’ as Singh would like to call it, were thick greens housing fauna of all kinds, be it the creepy crawlies, mammals, reptiles or the winged type.

As for the variety of flora, the list is expansive, starting from fruit trees to vegetables, herbs and flowers. A charming lily pond prevails amidst the thickset greens where many exotic winged friends visit unfailingly every morning. “The site was earlier a dump yard for vegetable peels from the kitchen and garden waste for conversion into compost”, says Singh, pointing to the now thick woods that nestle amongst the surrounding agricultural lands, standing testimony to what permaculture can do to even the most hostile landscape.

“When it comes to vegetation, the fundamental requirement is water, not soil; how much of water you have collected, conserved and managed to percolate deep into the earth. Instead of sucking our groundwater dry, we need to focus on harnessing rain and surface water”, states Singh. “When the groundwater table is addressed, nature takes over and vegetation automatically happens, whatever be the topography.”

To explain his point, he refers to the mountain slopes thick with vegetation. “Groundwater is high here, permitting vegetation to grow naturally, without human intervention, on what essentially is a rocky terrain beneath the top soil nurturing this growth.”

For effective percolation of rainwater, Singh insists on the water spreading over a larger area and sinking into the ground slowly. “The catchment area should be large, the percolation slow to permit the ground to absorb and not let the rainwater gush out along with the fertile top soil.”

On the 6 acres of hilly barren land, Singh addressed this requirement of water by digging trenches in strategic spots, enabling the rainwater to percolate slowly into the ground. “This pushed up the water table gradually to a level where at one point of time a lovely natural spring came up from the saturated water table.”

Greened with compost

Singh decided to layer the land with six inches of rich compost. “The compost was made from kitchen waste, dead leaves and branches, mixed with copious amounts of cow dung from the goshala here and this became a rich top soil from which a range of flora grew unassisted. There was minimal sowing of seeds and saplings, with many fruit trees and vegetables coming up on their own from the seeds thrown in the kitchen waste”, he adds.

Given the objective of having minimal human intervention, the average number of workers taking care of the 6 acres of vegetation is less than two per day across the year. “Keeping human intervention minimal takes care of the ecology better just as it does in the thick wilderness of hills and forests”, states Singh. With thick vegetation covering the once bare rocks, Singh set about planting fruit trees, multiple varieties of herbs and vegetables amidst the lush greens. “The shorter varieties of plants were planted on the peaks of the hill and taller varieties in the valleys to bring in a semblance of order to the wilderness”, he adds. Zonal categorisation was also done in the planting, with varieties requiring maximum attention planted in easier-to-reach sections.

The 6 acres are now home to over 60 varieties of fruits, herbs, vegetables and flowers that include bananas, almonds, pomegranate, papaya, mangoes, guavas, and chickooamongst the fruits trees; turmeric, ginger, chillies, palak, coriander, lemon, drumstick, tomatoes, potatoes, and pumpkin among the vegetables; amruthavalli, tulasi, aloe vera, vettiver and many more among the herbs.

Singh has one strong advice: “It is important to keep it simple, follow the rule of nature in terms of water flow and grow plants that suit the ecology of the place, the season, type of soil and availability of water.”

405,2020/03/06,Construction going digital,"IoT is expanding its sway on civil engineering, and robots too have a role to play in this sector. By M.A. Siraj

Construction, being the least digitalised industry, awaits induction of latest technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Though it is two decades since the ongoing Industrial Revolution entered its fourth phase, only 10 per cent of Internet users in India say they know the IoT. The fear that AI will replace humans is misplaced just as computers did not eliminate jobs.

These and several other trends formed the highlight of the national seminar on ‘Recent Developments in Design and Construction Technologies’ (REDECON) o organised by the Association of Consulting and Civil Engineers (ACCE). ‘Urban Challenges and Civil Engineering Opportunities’ was the theme of the seminar.

A machine to cut rods

Speakers asserted that technology should not remain a prerogative of only the hundred-and- odd smart cities being built in India, but should find induction in a wide spectrum of urban infrastructure and buildings. Chandramouli S.V., professor, PES University, said the sway of IoT is expanding and is likely to connect as many as 37 billion new objects. The IoT solutions will range from waste management and smart roads to smart parking, easing traffic congestion, detection of forest fires, tracking of wildlife, energy and water use in buildings, checking water quality, radiation level, pollution, and even surveillance of patients.

Prof. Chandramouli, who was associated with the construction of Crusell Bridge in Finland, said the 175-metre-long and 25-metre-wide bridge was the first bridge to be built using comprehensive building information modelling. He said the bridge was a dual-spanned, asymmetric cable-stayed structure where BIM was extensively used for fabricating the components and managing the supply chain, for designing the framework and temporary structures, for quality control using laser scanning, and for construction planning using 4-D animation. The sensors on the bridge collate information such as corrosion of components, water quality, status of aquatic life underneath, and dimension and load of vehicles using the bridge, and can constantly monitor structural health.

Latest technology helps in precision construction

Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, who inaugurated the conference, said the Karnataka government will soon set up a centre for training and certification of skills involved in construction. He said currently anyone can be a contractor without qualification while the pharmacy business requires a qualified pharmacist. While highlighting the widespread concern over the city’s management, he indicated that the government is thinking of setting up a third-party task force for checking of quality of infrastructure.

M.U. Aswath, president, ACCE, announced the setting up of a centre for excellence under the aegis of the Association of Consulting Civil Engineers in Bengaluru. He stressed the need for bringing together all civil engineers and government bodies for induction of Artificial Intelligence, BIM and digitalisation in the construction sector. He said the ACCE has prepared a manual for civil engineers and was working closely with the Bureau of Indian Standards and Engineering Council of India.

‘Inadequate’

BBMP Health Officer M.N. Sandhya, speaking on ‘Waste management in B.lore’, said even the best of expertise deployed by the civic body is proving inadequate in keeping the city clean due to people’s lack of awareness and insensitivity about the environment. She said the villages around the city were repulsing the city’s waste and there was need to go for localised composting of biodegradable waste. The BBMP has invested ₹350 crore on setting up eight processing plants in the city which process 800 tonnes of waste daily. But there was opposition to more such plants from developers as no one wants to see waste being unloaded and processed anywhere in their vicinity.

She said there was a need to completely discard single-use plastic items and replace them with cloth bags and steel tumblers and spoons. She pointed out that the city was the first to do away with waste bins and it was for the citizenry to desist from attitudes like NIMBY (Not-In-My-Back-Yard) as health and garbage were interconnected issues.

407,2020/03/06,Olive Ridley turtle hatchlings let out into sea in Puducherry,"The first batch of 240 hatchlings were released on Friday, in a joint initiative by the Forest Department and youth volunteers, as part of conservation efforts of the species

The first batch of 240 Olive Ridley hatchlings were let out into the sea in Narambai near here on Friday, in a joint initiative by the Forest Department and youth volunteers as part of conservation efforts of the species.

The Forest Department collected about 10,300 eggs laid by turtles since mid-January, with the help of youth volunteers and kept them at temporary hatcheries in Narambai and Pudukuppam for safe hatching.

Classified as ‘vulnerable’ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Olive Ridley turtles visit the Puducherry coast from January to March for laying eggs.

“The conservation programme started a few years ago to protect and release the turtles into the sea after the breeding season. A total of 21 nests are ready and the department will release them into the sea as and when the eggs start hatching,” said a Forest Department official.

The staff of the Forest Department along with youth volunteers also reach out to the fishing community to create awareness among people about collecting and protecting the turtle eggs till they are hatched. Over the years, several volunteers from the fishing community have joined the drive to collect the eggs and protect them, the official added.

A significant portion of the world’s Olive Ridley population migrates every winter from the Southern Indian ocean to Odisha for mass nesting. The coastline of Puducherry is used as a migratory route by these sea turtles listed under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. About 60-400 km stretch of the coast of Puducherry is largely used by migratory sea turtles from October to April every year.

408,2020/03/06,Kiran Bedi welcomes High Court order on Puducherry SEC appointment,"The Madras High Court had dismissed a writ petition challenging the Lieutenant Governor’s decision to reject the nominee of the Cabinet for the State Election Commissioner’s post

Welcoming the order of the Madras High Court dismissing a writ petition filed by Minister for Public Works A. Namassivayam challenging the Lieutenant Governor’s decision to reject the nominee of the Cabinet for the State Election Commissioner’s post, Kiran Bedi, on Friday, said the court decision would pave the way for establishing grass-roots democracy in the Union Territory after a gap of 10 years.

In a WhatsApp message to reporters, the Lt Governor said “the court decision ensures that local body elections to rural and urban bodies will be conducted by a duly selected public official approved by the administrator (L-G) and not merely appointed without a selection process. It opens up opportunities for people to take grassroots governance in to their own hands.”

The absence of elected local bodies for 10 years had deprived the people of several of their rights. Many public service buildings constructed using borrowed money remained un-utilised. Rural libraries are functioning without adequate books. Overhead water tanks have shown signs of dilapidation due to lack of maintenance, the Lt Governor said.

409,2020/03/06,Adishakti theatre fest explores range of aesthetic formats,"baseCollective’s Truth and Lies in Times of Fake News provides a challenging experience for both the audience and artistes

Over a series of solo and group acts, performative speech and demo sessions, a two-day festival of ideas at Adishakti challenged notions of theatre and experimented with a range of aesthetic formats.

The baseCollective research festival Truth and Lies in Times of Fake News was as much a challenging experience for the audience as it was for the artistes who were presenting a theatrical debut of concepts and themata evolved during a three-month residency at Adishakti.

The festival started with the lecture performance “The Future-Box”. Two actresses, Ruchita Bhujbal and Susanne Valerie Granzer appeared on stage as blindfolded oracles, who vanish into a cardboard box. Though invisible to the audience, their voices can still be heard.

The spectacle aspect of theatre gives way to philosophical, and even political, thought as ethereal voices of ancient and contemporary philosophers advance their visions of a future for humanity.

For instance, Immanuel Kant’s promise of a future of humanity, in which citizenship will have become a transnational affair.

Or Hannah Arendt’s plea to reflect the abyss that shows up between the rights a state grants its citizens and the human rights, which claim to be universal, despite of somebody’s nationality.

Also to arise is the voice of the tantric master Abhinavagupta with a call to the audience to adopt a harmony of heart and mind and embrace a pluralistic universality by placing themselves into the position of others.

In other words, a call for becoming pluralist, decentred, open minded and heart-minded. Whenever the two oracles exit the ‘Future Box’, the Viena-based philosopher Arno Boehler and baseCollective founder appear on stage to transform these voices of the past into a voice of a promising future.

His appearance on stage was accompanied by a sound carpet, produced by the sound artist Nina Bauer.

“The emphasis, from the opening, was clear that this festival did not intend to entertain the audience. It rather transformed the audience into artistic researchers who were called to sense, and simultaneously reflect their being-in-the-world collectively,” said Arno Bohler, who cofounded baseCollective with spouse and actress Susanne Valerie Granzer.

The subsequent sessions would progressively delve deeper and deeper into the theme of the festival — “Truth and Lies in Times of Fake News”.

Interactive mode

In true interactive mode of the festival format, the audience would continually be invited to discuss the significance of fake news in our post-truth times.

The audience was encouraged to read and interpret texts collectively, listen to a rap song (Niels Wildschut, Nina Bauer), watch a faked Pac-Man video animation (Ruchita Bhujbal) and visit performative installations (Namrata Chhabria Arjun, Nina Bauer, Alla Charnagalov, Lisa Großkopf, Manu Sharma), which involved body exercise.

Sandra Noeth, Professor from the University of Arts Berlin, while delivering a talk, confronted the audience with the disturbing fact that in the context of different migratory movements in the European Union, refugees started indeed to fake their fingerprints by various techniques — transplanting skin from the feet to the fingers; biting up the fingertips; etching them with acid; swallowing chemicals that cause mutation to dismember themselves from their scanned identities. “The word “fake” takes on an entire new meaning in such uncanny gestures,” she said.

Solo performances

Six solo performances were shown in the course of the festival in which the question of fake news became an artistic matter of experimental theatrical investigations on truth and lies.

Ruchita Bhujbal explored the phenomenon in the context of mythological narratives, Prasanna B. Hambarde in socio-political respects, Savita Rani, Anuradha Upadhya and Bharati Kapadia from the perspective of a novice faced with an uncanny bluring of facts and fictions, and also in respect to gender issues.

Varun Aiyer examined the ritual question of truth. Nothing encapsulated the festival doctrine better than a dissection by Soumyabrata Choudhury, professor at JNU, of the problem of truth and lies in relation to the magic power of performative speech acts, according to Mr. Bohler.

Speech acts is where one just declares something to be truth, without considering the facts, or reasonable arguments. If a powerful person, e.g. a Head of State, declares that climate change is no fact, but just an opinion, truth is reduced to a verbal speech act uttered by somebody having the conventional right and power to speak the truth.

Under such conditions, Prof. Choudhury claimed, truth becomes grotesque, because it becomes obvious for everybody, self-contradictory.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/ki1470/article30994578.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06PONDYAUDIENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/adishakti-theatre-fest-explores-range-of-aesthetic-formats/article30994580.ece
410,2020/03/06,Auroville to host ‘Freedom from Fear’ workshop,"Event to be held today at the Centre for Research in the Performing Arts

A presentation on ‘The Beloved Sakhis and Vision of Kabir’ by Sehdev Kumar, author and Professor Emeritus in Canada, is scheduled on Friday at the Centre for Research in the Performing Arts (CRIPA) in Auroville.

413,2020/03/06,Chaos at Marappalam exasperates residents,"Traffic jams are a regular feature at the busy junction

The stretch from Marappalam to Ariankuppam junction is slowly emerging as a major trouble spot for motorists.

Traffic snarls during peak hours have become a common sight on the stretch. The Marappalam junction, where four roads meet, turns chaotic whenever the automatic signalling system fails.

A bus stop near the signal compounds the problem with buses going towards Cuddalore stopping there to pick up and drop passengers, triggering traffic jams.

“There has been phenomenal rise in the number of vehicles, particularly two-wheelers, plying on this stretch in the last few years. But the road improvement work has not been taken up on the stretch. While the number of vehicles is increasing, the size of roads remains the same. During peak hours, the stretch handles 1,000 to 1,500 vehicles,” said Kuzhanthai Raj, a resident of Ariankuppam.

Hardship to pedestrians

For pedestrians, it is a challenge to cross the stretch during peak hours. With heavy vehicles too taking this stretch, driving on this road has become highly risky for two-wheeler riders.

“Though there is a ban on entry of trucks during the day, heavy vehicles continue to enter the town area causing traffic obstruction. If the automatic signal at the junction is not functioning due to technical snag or power outage, it will be chaotic. In such situations, a lone traffic personnel posted there cannot manage the traffic,” said A.S. Kumar, a resident of Velurampet, who works near Cuddalore. Mr. Raj said if the police carry out vehicle checks in the nearby areas it will compound traffic woes. Seeking deployment of more traffic personnel during peak hours at Marappalam and Ariankuppam junctions, Mr. Kumar said there should be mechanism to regulate traffic near link roads at Velurampet, Thoolakathamman and Sudhana Nagar.

S. Senthil, a resident of Murungapakkam, said several accident victims, particularly those in critical conditions, were referred from Cuddalore to Jipmer every day.

The condition of the road and the heavy traffic make it tough for ambulance drivers to reach the patients to hospital, he added.

Poor lighting on many stretches on the Cuddalore road is another problem that affects motorists and pedestrians. There is a delay in replacing damaged streetlights on several stretches, said Mr. Senthil. Mr. Kumar said a flyover or a grade separator could solve the problem.

Plans afoot

Minister for Public Works A. Namassivayam told The Hindu that the government had proposed to widen the road by another 30 metres. However, the plan was yet to take off due to constraints in land acquisition, he said.

During the recent visit of Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari, the government had placed before him a proposal to build an express way from Ariankuppam to a point near the Sivaji Statue, connecting Marappalam, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi signals and Kokkupark. “Vehicles coming from Cuddalore and Chennai can have easy access if the plan materialises. Local residents too can use the road below. The Minister has agreed to examine the proposal and we will be certainly following it up,” he added.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/jiu1lx/article30994389.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THPONDYUTMATTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/chaos-at-marappalam-exasperates-residents/article30994390.ece

The Chirayinkeezhu block panchayat’s digital geographical information report will help plan development activities incorporating the special features of each area, Minister for Local Self-government A.C. Moideen has said. He was speaking at a function to release the report here on Wednesday.

Mr. Moideen said the information recorded now would be studied by future generations, adding that the block panchayat’s activities were a model for others.

Such study reports would help expand the activities of local self-government institutions, he added.

415,2020/03/06,Silver jubilee of SCERT begins in Thiruvananthapuram,"State for education system led by people: Minister

An education system led by the people and guided by humaneness, which recognises the abilities and limitations of each child, is being put forward by the State, Minister for Education C. Ravindranath has said.

He was inaugurating the year-long silver jubilee celebrations of the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) here on Thursday.

Guiding light

The Minister said the SCERT had been guiding education from the preschool to the higher secondary level for the past 25 years. It had been developing school curriculum, textbooks, and reference books for teachers, students, and parents, based on scientific research.

It had also contributed to teacher education, continuing education, and informal education. Through novel initiatives, it had been able to lead the education sector forward.

Seminars, exhibition of learning models, and book exhibitions will be held as part of the celebrations. A six-month teacher training course was launched by the Minister on the occasion.

O. Rajagopal, MLA, presided.

416,2020/03/06,Poonthura breakwater project to take off soon,"700-m offshore structure to be built using geo-tubes

Decks have been cleared for the construction of the proposed offshore breakwater at Poonthura. The government has accorded final approval for the project after the completion of the tender formalities.

Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma, replying to questions in the Assembly on Thursday, said that the construction of the breakwater, the first-of-its-kind in the State, would commence later this month.

The pilot project was being undertaken with the technical assistance of the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), which has successfully established a similar breakwater system in Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu.

The 700-m breakwater, proposed to be constructed using geo-tubes, is expected to protect the coastal areas of Poonthura and Valiathura which have intense coastal erosion.

The technique could help the State overcome the difficulty in procuring granite for coastline protection. Besides, it also held the potential of bringing down granite quarrying, she said.

By July

Ms. Mercykutty Amma said the ₹17.8-crore project was expected to be completed before July.

The effectiveness of the breakwater in protecting the coast from the rough seas would be assessed before taking a call on replicating the method at Shanghumughom where a 6-km breakwater had been proposed.

She also had to fend off criticism raised by Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala who accused the government of doing little to address the problem of coastal erosion, particularly in areas such as Haripad, Ambalappuzha, Chellanam and Ponnani, which faced coastal erosion.

The Minister said the offshore breakwater project demanded a two-year study for which the NIOT assessed various parameters, including wave strength.

Based on the success of the project, the technique would be implemented across the State, she said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/poonthura-breakwater-project-to-take-off-soon/article30997473.ece

Kerala Institute of Local Administration director Joy Elamon said facilities should be in place for ensuring the health of the youth.

418,2020/03/06,Directive to change order on insulin pumps,"Type 1 diabetic students now required to hand them over to invigilators

The Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has recommended that authorities withdraw a directive to hand over insulin pumps attached to the bodies of Type 1 diabetic students, insulin pens and sweets to be eaten during emergencies to invigilators in examination halls.

A commission division bench, comprising chairperson P. Suresh and members Fr. Philip Parakkat and K. Nazeer, made the recommendation on the basis of the finding that the order that water, sugar tablet, chocolate, candy, fruits, snacks, and insulin pumps be left with invigilators could adversely affect students’ health.

The General Education Department had issued an order on February 28 last year that allowed children with Type 1 diabetes to carry insulin pumps, insulin pens, water, sugar tablet, chocolate candy, fruits, and snacks inside examination halls.

Health problems

However, a circular issued by the department directed that these items be handed over to invigilators. The complaint that taking off the insulin pump that can be attached to the body round the clock could lead to health problems was serious.

419,2020/03/06,COVID advisory unlikely for Pongala,"But questions are raised about Health dept. move which entails considerable risks

Attukal Pongala, the single largest congregation of women in the State slated to be held here on Monday, at a time when the threat of a COVID-19 outbreak is looming large, has caused the Health Department to tie itself in knots as to what advisory they should issue to the public.

Senior Health Department officials say that they have been asked to “leave Pongala alone” and given clear instructions not to commit anything as to whether the mass gathering of such a magnitude poses a public health threat against the background of the COVID-19 threat.

For informed decision

“Our instructions are to clearly reiterate the IEC [information, education, communication] messages through television and FM radio that the public should avoid mass gatherings and practise social distancing, follow all respiratory hygiene guidelines in the current scenario and to hope that the ‘aware’ public would take note of it and take an informed decision on participating in pongala,” a senior official said.

In short, the Health Department has decided not to issue any special advisory in connection with the pongala. However, there are many who feel that the department is being downright irresponsible in not advising the public correctly and in expecting the general public to understand the technicalities involving COVID-19 and to make a “prudent” decision.

“It is a tricky situation. The Prime Minister and President have decided to avoid Holi celebrations as Delhi has reported new COVID-19 cases and all precautions have to be taken. Kerala, however, claims that it has successfully contained the virus causing COVID-19. No local transmission of the virus has been documented so far. It would thus be difficult to convince the public that a mass gathering like the Attukal Pongala could pose a public health threat,” an official said.

World over, sporting events, conferences and church services are being suspended because the situation involving COVID-19 is still fluid and there could be undetected virus transmission in the community.

“It is the government’s call to take a policy decision and to educate the public accordingly. When we say that we do not have silent local transmission of COVID-19, it should be remembered that we have no data to substantiate it and that the disease has no specific symptoms in the initial stages. The only advice we are prepared to give the public right now is to stay home if at all you are sick or have the beginnings of a respiratory illness like mild fever and cough,” a senior official said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/66mx51/article31001410.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06tvtvVILAKKUKETTU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/covid-advisory-unlikely-for-pongala/article30995098.ece
420,2020/03/06,Pathrakulam takeover: High Court orders status quo,"Sabha says property not listed under Anantha

The Kerala High Court on Thursday ordered that the status quo be maintained with respect to the takeover of 65 cents of property, including the Pathrakulam pond, under the possession of the Sree Vidyadhiraja Sabha at East Fort, Thiruvananthapuram, where the Theerthapada Mandapam is located. The court passed the order while admitting a writ petition filed by R. Ajay Kumar, secretary of the sabha, challenging the eviction of the sabha from the property and its takeover by the revenue authorities.

When the petition came up for hearing, senior counsel for the sabha N. Nandakumara Menon contended that the government order cancelling the assignment of the land to the sabha was illegal as it had been enjoying absolute possession of the land for the past 44 years.

The cancellation of the assignment of land given 44 years ago was nothing but the outcome of the rivalry between two coalition partners of the ruling dispensation.

The senior counsel pointed out that the Sree Vidyadhiraja Sabha and the Trust had decided to build a memorial for Sree Vidyadhiraja Chattamby Swamy at ₹15 crore on the property.

Foundation laying

The foundation stone was scheduled to be laid on March 10. The trust had invited Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to lay the foundation stone for the memorial.

The petition pointed out that the property had not been included on the list of properties to be cleared under the Operation Anantha project prepared by the Disaster Management Authority for preventing floods in the East Fort-Thampanoor area.

The ground for cancellation of the assignment was that the land had been transferred by the sabha in favour of the trust. It was factually and legally untenable, the petitioner said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/pathrakulam-takeover-high-court-orders-status-quo/article30995073.ece
421,2020/03/06,University denies delay in NAAC re-accreditation steps,"Measures initiated well in advance, awaiting intimation: PVC

The University of Kerala has brushed aside allegations of an inordinate delay in approaching the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) for re-accreditation following the expiry of the previous accreditation.

The university dispensation has had to defend itself in the backdrop of a complaint submitted by former Vice Chancellor P.K. Radhakrishnan to the Governor in which he flagged the expiry of the NAAC accreditation on March 2.

He also accused the university of ‘culpable negligence’ for failing to initiate the necessary steps for the third cycle of accreditation.

While the university had been first accredited in 2003 with B++ grade, the long-delayed steps for the second cycle of accreditation was initiated in 2014 during the tenure of Dr. Radhakrishnan as the Vice Chancellor.

The efforts came several years after the five-year period of the initial accreditation had expired in 2008.

The university was subsequently re-accredited in the second cycle with A Grade on March 3, 2015.

‘Half-hearted steps’

In his complaint, the former Vice Chancellor alleged that the university authorities had taken only ‘half-hearted steps’ and the Internal Quality Assurance Cell, which was mandated primarily with ensuring re-accreditation, had been conducting some peripheral activities alone without prioritising its primary responsibility.

He lamented that the alleged delay could adversely affect the career prospects of students.

However, Pro-Vice Chancellor P.P. Ajayakumar said the university had initiated the necessary steps for re-accreditation well in advance.

The Institutional Information for Quality Assessment, the submission of which marked the first step in this regard, had been sent to the NAAC prior to the expiry of the previous accreditation. The requisite fee had also been paid.

“We have been awaiting an intimation from the NAAC following which we will upload the Self-Study Report. The process will be followed by a visit by a peer team of the NAAC to assess various parameters,” Dr. Ajayakumar said, adding that the student community was not bound to be affected in any manner in the interim period of assessment.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/university-denies-delay-in-naac-re-accreditation-steps/article30995067.ece
422,2020/03/06,Collector for 3-pronged punishment,"‘Undeclared strike, blocking of vehicular traffic by KSRTC staff unjustified’

District Collector K. Gopalakrishnan has recommended a three-pronged mode of punishment against the crew of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) buses which were left on the city roads for hours on Wednesday following a flash strike by the staff.

A departmental inquiry into the violations of the Motor Vehicles Act and exemplary punishment to the erring bus crew to prevent such incidents in the future have been mooted.

As part of preparing a detailed report, the Collector visited the site where three KSRTC personnel were taken into custody and where a passenger T. Surendran collapsed at East Fort.

He spoke to Assistant Transport Officer, KSRTC, N.K. Sam Lopez, passengers, crew of private buses and representatives of KSRTC trade unions. Trade union representatives told the Collector that the unions had not given any call for stir. Mr. Lopez said he was not aware of the happenings as he was in the police station.

The police have been approached to make available CCTV visuals from Vazhayila to East Fort to track the movement of the private bus involved in the incident that reportedly sparked off the incidents.

The Collector said the final report would be submitted soon. He said the undeclared strike and the haphazard parking of buses on the road blocking vehicular traffic could not be justified. He also recommended to bring the services of the KSRTC under the Essential Services Maintenance Act.

The government has also sought a report from the KSRTC on the incident and the loss sustained by the fleet. The Regional Transport Officer has asked for the details of the bus crew who were on duty on Wednesday.

The police have also started collecting the details of the KSRTC drivers who abandoned the buses on the road.

Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran will take a call on the preliminary report of the Collector and the one submitted by the RTO, Thiruvananthapuram.

Body handed over

Meanwhile, the body of Surendran, the passenger who collapsed and died at the East Fort bus stop, was handed over to the relatives after a post-mortem examination at General Hospital and was taken to Vithura. Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran said the government would extend support to the family of Surendran.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/collector-for-3-pronged-punishment/article30995049.ece
423,2020/03/06,Punargeham to relocate fishers’ families to safer areas,"18,685 to be provided houses under the scheme; 120 fibre reinforced plastic boats distributed

As many as 18,685 fishworkers and their families will be relocated from vulnerable areas of the coast to safer locations and provided houses or apartments under a phased project, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

Speaking after inaugurating a State-level project named Punargeham on the Shanghumughom beach here on Thursday, he said 8,487 families would be shifted in the first phase, with the rest to be relocated in the subsequent two phases.

Mr. Vijayan said the government accorded priority to protecting the life and property of fisherfolk and securing their livelihood.

Society’s responsibility

Recalling the selfless service rendered by fishers during the floods, he said it was society’s responsibility to give them their due.

The government was offering an assistance of ₹10 lakh for the coastal families to buy land and construct houses. Apartments would be provided for those who failed to identify land.

The Chief Minister said the government had done everything possible to help the fisherfolk who bore the brunt of cyclone Ockhi.

Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan distributed 120 fibre reinforced plastic boats and kits to fishermen. Deputy Speaker V. Sasi distributed 2,000 cycles to girls hailing from families in the coastal belt.

Presiding over the function, Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma said the government was working on several programmes to empower fisherfolk. Another 200 fishers would be provided with boats and nets, she said, adding that the construction of an offshore breakwater at Poonthura would commence soon.

Mayor K. Sreekumar, MLAs K. Ansalan and V. Joy, Palayam Imam V.P. Suhaib Moulavi, Principal Secretary, Fisheries, Ishitha Roy and District Collector K. Gopalakrishnan were present.

425,2020/03/06,ISL: CFC favourite to make the final,"FC Goa has uphill task after big reverse in the first leg

Under head coach Owen Coyle, Chennaiyin FC (CFC) has turned things around in a manner seldom witnessed in the short history of ISL.

From being ninth in the table after the first six matches, CFC has fought back in style and remained unbeaten in its last nine games — a club record.

With a 4-1 cushion over FC Goa from the semifinal first leg in Chennai, CFC is brimming with confidence and will be the favourite in the second leg at the Nehru Stadium here on Saturday. Goa now needs to win by a margin of more than three goals to make it to the summit clash. The 53-year-old Coyle sounded optimistic of the away team’s chances of making it to the final.

“In the last eight games, we took more points than anybody.

“We know we have good players, we have shown the desire and fire. We didn’t lose in the last five away games where we have shown different aspects to our play,” he said. CFC forward Andre Schembri described the change in club’s fortunes to the change in management. “There was a change in management, a change of philosophy and a change of mindset, and a change of culture,” he said.

Fight to finish

Meanwhile, Goa’s interim coach Clifford Miranda insisted that though it might appear difficult his team would fight till the finish.

“To overcome the deficit, we have to fight till the final whistle. But this particular game has a different dynamic. We have our back to the wall. We will try everything we have,” he said.

Goa has been strengthened with the return of three key players — Hugo Boumous, Brandon Fernandes and Edu Bedia — all of whom missed the first leg. Miranda was happy to have them back.

“Their absence was felt not in terms of scores but as a group. It is a different environment when you have all the players,” he said.

Remain confident

Boumous exhorted his teammates to remain confident.

“We need to be confident. It’s not easy but we can do it. There is no dearth of motivation, we have to manage the mental side and keep calm during the game,” he said.

427,2020/03/06,Paraguay police question Ronaldinho over alleged ‘adulterated’ passport,"Ronaldinho’s lawyer told said the ex-Barcelona player and his brother Roberto Assis spent around eight hours with officials

A lawyer for former Brazil striker Ronaldinho Gaucho said his client will remain in Paraguay to help police with their enquiries into why he entered the country in possession of an adulterated Paraguayan passport.

Adolfo Marin told reporters the ex-Barcelona player and his brother Roberto Assis spent around eight hours with officials in Asuncion on Thursday before being released.

“He and his brother have no restrictions on them concerning their freedom,” Marin said. “But Ronaldinho has taken the decision to remain in Paraguay and await the proceedings.”

Paraguayan prosecutor Federico Delfino told a news conference earlier on Thursday that Ronaldinho and his brother were detained in Asuncion on Wednesday in possession of what were believed to be adulterated Paraguayan passports.

Delfino said the pair left Guarulhos airport in Sao Paulo with Brazilian passports and were given Paraguayan ones “as soon as they got off the plane” in the Paraguayan capital.

“Both Mr Ronaldinho and his brother said they were a gift,” Delfino told reporters.

Initial investigations indicated the numbers on the passports corresponded to other people, Delfino added.

“They have not gone through the process of obtaining Paraguayan nationality,” Delfino said. “To get Paraguayan nationality or to be naturalised as a Paraguayan you have to have resided in the country.”

Reuters has contacted Assis to request comment on the allegations.

Good faith

Marin said Brazilians do not need a passport to travel between Brazil and Paraguay, both of which are members of the Mercosul bloc.

He could not explain why they showed Paraguayan passports when they had travelled recently on their Brazilian passports to China, Europe and the United States.

Marin said they were surprised by Paraguayan authorities, and asked for more time to see the formal accusations.

“I think they showed good faith but were taken by surprise,” Marin said.

The Paraguayan public prosecutor’s office, which collaborated with the police in their investigation, said its officials seized the pairs cell phones and passports during a visit to their hotel on Wednesday.

The brothers were invited to Paraguay by a local casino owner and had arrived on Wednesday to take part in a soccer clinic for children and a book launch.

Ronaldinho, who also played for Atletico Mineiro, Flamengo and Paris St Germain, last featured professionally in 2015.

Ronaldinho, 39, was the best player in the world at his peak in the early part of this century.

He was named FIFA World Player of the year in 2004 and 2005 and won the World Cup with Brazil in 2002 and the Champions League with Barcelona in 2006.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/12fihl/article30995855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PARAGUAYBRAZILRONALDINHODETAINED,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/paraguay-police-question-ronaldinho-over-alleged-adulterated-passport/article30995856.ece
428,2020/03/06,"Antique structure of 1,200-year-old Sivan Temple restored","Devotees led by D. Chandrasekar, an alumnus of IIT-Madras, floated the Thiruthalaiyur Heritage Trust to carry out the renovation over the last four years

A 1,200-year-old Sivan Temple in Thiruthalaiyur village associated with the staunch devotee of Lord Siva, Rudra Pasupathy, one of the 63 Nayanars, has been restored by ardent devotees, retaining the antiquity of the 18,000 sq ft structure at a whopping cost of ₹3.8 crore.

Rudra Pasupathy Nayanar is said to have attained liberation by chanting Krishna Rajurveda Rudra Suktha daily, standing in neck-deep water in the temple tank, as per Periyapuranam, one of the Tamil literary masterpieces.

and to restore the glory of the once-prosperous temple, after securing the consent of the Archaeological Survey of India and the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department.

The work was carried out based on a conservation note prepared in 2009 by the National Centre for Safety of Heritage Structures functioning out of the IIT-Madras.

The temple had structures such as Mahamandapa and Agaramandapa linked to various periods. The mandapas, built later, were made to rest on the earlier temple structure, exerting pressure on the inter-linked beams, and ceiling slabs. In the past, additional roof courses were added, increasing the dead weight over the ceiling and causing disintegration of lime and mortar. Due to this, there was constant leakage all over the mandapas and the incessant dampness precipitated the impact of the dead weight, according to the Conservation note prepared by the experts.

In 2016, the Trust identified a Coimbatore-based Stapathi Mariappan, and started the work by indexing all floors and columns. The restoration work involved reinforcing five feet concrete beneath each of the 16 granite columns and linking all of them.The concrete roofs that were causing burden on the structure were replaced with lime and mortar. Ultimately, the structure has been restored without use of cement, steel or concrete.

The structure took about 20,000 man days for restoration, Mr. Chandrasekar said. “We are certain the temple will start attracting devotees in large numbers henceforth after the Kumbabishekam slated for March 12,” Mr. Chandrasekar said.

In a gesture to the residents of the village, the Trust has also decided to renovate the mandapam of the Kali temple in Thiruthalaiyur, Mr. Chandrasekar said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/antique-structure-of-1200-year-old-sivan-temple-restored/article31000732.ece

431,2020/03/06,Metro Cricket Club to celebrate diamond jubilee,"Playing for the club a dream for every budding cricketer in Vizag

The character of every city or town is characterised by a number of things such as its people, cultural and historical heritage and its love for sports.

Visakhapatnam has always been a paradise for sportsmen and its denizens were passionate towards a number of sports such as football, hockey and cricket.

A few individuals and clubs from the 1950s contributed immensely for the development of the games be it football, hockey or cricket, and one such club is Metro Cricket Club, which is celebrating is diamond jubilee on Sunday at Visakhapatnam Public Library.

Inception

The Metro Cricket Club was started by group of passionate cricketers in the summer of 1959. It is probably the second oldest club in the city and still continues to be one among the top most clubs in this part of the State, and it can take the credit of producing over 40 Ranji Trophy cricketers and at least two cricketers, Y. Venugopal Rao and K. Srikar Bharat, who have represented the country at the international level.

The main architects in the formation of the club were S.M.N. Ramabhadra Raju and K. Peddi Raju in 1959.

A group of youngsters comprising M. Shyam, P.V.V. Mohan Rao, Y. Ramu, B. Ramesam, Aarif Ibrahim (Ibbu), K. Muralidhar, K. Parthasaradhi, P.R. Narayanaswami, K. Shankara Rao, R.V.V.K. Prasad were roped in to form two teams (Senior and Junior). Others non-playing members who contributed to its formation and development were Gainedy Kodanda Rama Rao ( Bangi), D. Kripanidhi (Kripps) and Voriganti Mohan Rao.

It was at this point of time that K. Sudarshana Rao the then Physical Director of Andhra University, K. Narayana, Physical Director of Andhra Medical College, V.B. Naidu of port Gymkhana Club and importantly G.S.N. Rao (Ayya) played a major role in providing facilities at the respective playing fields, for development of cricket in the city, says K. Parthasarathi (Butchi), secretary of the VDCA and of the MCC.

According to him, in those days cricket was primarily played between clubs and from Monday to Friday we would practise at Port Gymkhana and on Sunday’s there would be a full-day 50-over-a-side match.

The Visakhapatnam District Cricket Association (VDCA) was formed in 1963 and from 1965 the district league format cricket was started. Since then MCC has the distinction of topping the league chart in the A Division in most of the seasons.

Playing for Metro CC is a dream for every budding cricketer, as you are exposed to quality cricket within the team and you have to play against the best teams. That is why the club was able to produce about 41 cricketers who have played or playing Ranji trophy, said Amit Pathak, who played Ranji for Andhra Pradesh from 1991 to 2004, scoring over 4,700 runs with 11 centuries.

Meeting tomorrow

On the occasion of its diamond jubilee celebration, a meeting is being organised at Visakha Public Library on Sunday and former president of ACA P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju is expected to attend. The programme will begin at 5 p.m., said D.S. Varma, president of MCC.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/metro-cricket-club-to-celebrate-diamond-jubilee/article31001946.ece
432,2020/03/06,COVID-19: panic grips parents of techies working in Hyderabad,"Demand for hand sanitisers and masks peaks in city

The parents of IT employees from the city, who are working in Hyderabad have been counting anxious moments ever since suspected COVID-19 cases surfaced in the Telangana capital.

Even as one confirmed case was reported from Hyderabad a few days ago, the fear escalated after after an IT firm evacuated employees from the office building after one of their staff developed COVID-19 symptoms on Tuesday.

Many parents are advising their children to opt for work from home instead going to the office or apply leave and return home.

A number of parents were seen sending hand sanitisers and face masks to their children in Hyderabad, as stocks either ran out or were being sold at exorbitantly high prices there.

“As the number of suspected COVID-19 cases has increased in the last two days, I have asked my son, who is living in Madhapur, not to go to office till the situation improves,” says N. Jagadeesh.

S. Sai Ram said that his son has been asked to work from home, while his daughter-in-law was not given that option. “Not all IT firms have given the facility to work from home. My daughter-in-law has to go her office. We are very worried and calling them at least four to five times a day,” he said.

Meanwhile, the rise in the number of suspected COVID-19 cases in both the Telugu States in the past two days, the demand for face masks and hand sanitisers has gone up in the city.

Cashing in on the demand, many medical shop employees are selling a normal surgical face mask somewhere between ₹30 and ₹40, while the N-95 masks are being sold for around ₹300 a piece.

Many people on Thursday complained that masks and hand sanitisers were not sufficiently available in many medical shops in the city. “I had to cough up ₹1,200 for four N-95 masks today. Yet, I have no clue whether they is original or duplicate. I have no other option,” complained a customer.

Fake messages creating panic

Even as no positive case has been reported from the State till date, fake messages are doing the round on social media platforms, especially WhatsApp groups.

These messages are causing panic among the people. On Tuesday, a few messages claimed that a student from Visakhapatnam had been tested positive. However, the authorities dubbed it as a rumour.

6,634 people screened

The official statistics suggest that as many as 6,634 passengers have been screened at the city airport and another 703 at the sea port.

As many as 101 persons have been kept under observation. Of the 10 persons admitted to hospitals, five have been confirmed negative, while test results for the rest are awaited. As many as 23 persons are still under observation, the officials said.

‘Say namaste’

Tourism Minister M. Srinivasa Rao advised people to use the traditional Indian salutation of ‘Namaste’ instead of shaking hands while greeting others, in order to check the spread of COVID-19.

Allaying fears among the people on the spread of the virus, Mr. Srinivasa Rao told reporters on Thursday that the State Government was fully geared up to face the challenge.

“Spreading of rumours would not serve any purpose other than to destabilise markets,” the Minister said. Timely intervention would help treat a person infected with the virus within two weeks, he added.

The Minister, however, urged people to observe basic precautions such as using sanitisers, wearing masks at crowded places and avoiding handshakes.

“Screening centres have been set up at Visakhapatnam Port, Gangavaram Port and Visakhapatnam International Airport to keep a tab on travellers coming from abroad. Besides King George Hospital, isolated wards have been set up at Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases in the city and Government Hospital in Anakapalle,” the Minister said.

Asked to comment on the financial losses suffered by the State government due to the coronavirus threat, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said that there were no estimates on that count available with him. However, he admitted that there was unrest across world due to the challenge posed by COVID-19.

Mr. Rao said he would speak to the Collector on setting up a toll-free helpline to enable people to communicate with doctors if they begin exhibiting any symptoms of the disease.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/n0nycm/article30995167.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06VZ3CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/covid-19-panic-grips-parents-of-techies-working-in-hyderabad/article30995169.ece

Efforts will be made to resolve the ‘Panchagramalu’ land issue with the cooperation of the Simhachalam Devasthanam Trust Board, Minister of Tourism, Culture and Youth Advancement Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao has said.

Addressing a gathering after the members of the new trust board took charge on Thursday at the Simhachalam Devasthanam, in the presence of chairperson P. Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju, Mr. Srinivasa Rao dismissed the criticism that the new trust board would be used for land grabbing.

“Using the Devasthanam for furthering personal gain cannot be allowed at any cost,” he asserted.

437,2020/03/06,Kerur Vasudevacharya’s Indira comes across as a novel that professes an orthodox point-of-view on women’s emancipation,"Social-reform from a conservative standpoint

Kerur Vasudevacharya’s Indira, published in 1908, comes across as a novel that professes an orthodox point-of-view about women’s emancipation to the point of being seen as an ‘anti social-change’ novel. This is in stark contrast to almost all the early Kannada social-realist novels that spoke positively about women-centric social change and against injustice to women. We get an insight into the author’s world-view as early as in the ‘introduction’ itself where he says: Today we see many young women, educated under the existing system, bringing happiness to everyone without causing any harm to ‘streejati.’ But we also see women who rebel against the present social structure and want to be more independent than men. They feel that they should follow women of other countries and that men need not be given the same kind of respect that they have been receiving till now. There is no dearth of such free women who have started to destroy our social equilibrium.

Indira is essentially a story of the romance between Indira and Ramakantha. Ramakantha's father, Kamalakantha, Indira’s father, Jayarao, and Devayani, a young educated widow, were friends in their youth in Bangalore. Kamalakantha and Jayarao were both students in Mumbai and were positively inclined towards social change. They return to Bangalore and meet Devayani, and both develop a liking for her, but she has a soft corner for Kamalakantha and wants to marry him. Jealousy, lies, misunderstanding, dejection, and hurt – all these thwart their union. The men go their separate ways and Devayani chooses to remain a widow.

Jayarao shifts to Srirangapattana, and so does Devayani, who has now become an accomplished painter. Jayarao's business interests meant frequent trips outside his town and Indira grows up into an educated young girl under the loving care of Devayani. Devayani had not forgotten Kamalakantha and when she learnt that his son, Ramakantha, had come to Bangalore in search of a job, she wanted to see him and through a mutual friend, requests him to come and see her. Ramakantha comes to Srirangapattana and in course of time meets Indira in Devayani's house.

Friendship soon turns to love. Jayarao sees this growing intimacy with increasing concern. He wants to get his daughter married to an aristocratic young man, through whom he could acquire the ‘Rao Bahadur’ title from the British. He tries to separate them by offering jobs to Ramakantha in other cities. Many such attempts and misunderstandings later, Indira and Ramakantha come together finally to get married.

In between the many fluctuations in the romance between Indira and Ramakantha, Vasudevacharya introduces a group of ‘social change agents’ with whom Indira and Ramakantha are seen engaged in debates on women-centric social issues. Vasudevacharya takes this opportunity to lampoon well-known reformers and their reform activities.

Pandita Ramabai, who was well-known across the major cities of India during the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a committed social reformer, is caricatured here as Pandita Radhabai. Pandita Ramabai‘s widowhood and her conversion to Christianity are mocked. In Indira, Pandita Radhabai is shown as having married three times and that she had converted to Christianity after her marriage to Father Cunningham. Seshadasacharya Adya (author of an early Kannada social play, Suvadana Bhaskara) is lampooned here as Phanindracharya Adya. Phanindracharya is shown here as marrying Nagalakshmi, who has been widowed thrice and that he is not bothered about her not being a virgin-widow. The language used here is coarse as Nagalakshmi is described as a woman who was ‘savoured’ by three husbands previously.

The meetings of the reformers at the Upasana Samaj is described by Ramakantha as being similar to Church sermons and rituals, with chapters being read out from The Bible. Vasudevacharya makes it clear that he sees all these reform activities as Western and more specifically Christian.

In the novel, Indira and Ramakantha do not suffer any personal indignities, nor are the impending reforms going to affect them in any way. They seem to merely act as the author’s mouthpieces. On one occasion when asked by Radhabai about his opinions regarding remarriage, women’s education, and emancipation, Ramakantha says, “Women should get higher education, but I cannot tolerate their exaggerated desire for freedom.” To a similar question, Indira says: “I don’t know what you call independence. After we get married we go to our husbands’ houses and enjoy our rights to food, clothing and ornaments. From whom are we to become independent? Should we fight with our husbands who protect and take care of us and call that freedom? Now we see more of harassed husbands who are in the clutches of their wives. Do these wives need freedom, or do these poor husbands need freedom, who have become servants in their own homes?”

Vasudevacharya was a student in Pune during 1889-1890 and was witness to the reformist-conservative debates on women’s rights. These debates would have influenced Vasudevacharya and coming from an orthodox, priestly family, he seemed to have leaned towards the views of the conservatives.

Apart from presenting the contemporary conservative attitude towards reforms, Vasudevacharya makes the novel topical by introducing elements like names of newspapers that Ramakantha reads like Indu Prakash, Bengali Times, Bandhu, and Kesari, the Kannada-Marathi language debate, B. Venkatacharya‘s popular translation of Bankimchandra‘s Vishavriksha that Indira reads, names and activities of religious and social reformers and long discussions on reforms. Vasudevacharya was partial towards decorative classical descriptions of nature and one can see that in his depictions of the Cauvery river, gardens, and woodlands in Bangalore and Srirangapattana.

Kerur Vasudevacharya was a prolific writer across genres – he wrote novels, short stories, plays, and edited journals – and his name continued to remain in public memory during his lifetime and later too. As a result of this literary fame, his one and only social-realist novel, Indira, did not suffer from lack of attention from publishers and critics. Indira has seen at least five more reprints after 1908. In 2007, Manohara Grantha Mala, Dharwad, brought out Vasudevacharya’s collected works in three volumes.",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/jojdjp/article30998461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06bgfrbookjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/kerur-vasudevacharyas-indira-comes-across-as-a-novel-that-professes-an-orthodox-point-of-view-on-womens-emancipation/article30998465.ece
438,2020/03/06,There’s no end to imagination in the ‘kitchen’,"The tag ‘Kitchen Literature’ weighed heavily on women who wrote in the early 20th century. The criticism was not always aesthetic. However, in terms of the variety, maturity, innovation and tremendous creativity, women’s writing in Kannada cannot be marginalised now because it is the mainstream

Is male criticism of women’s writing always grounded on aesthetic norms or is it that the aesthetic norms are only a thin mask over unconscious misogyny or at least deep suspicion about women’s writing? Are male aesthetic norms universal and gender neutral? When women writers criticise the male dominant literary critical establishment for its indifference and insensitivity, are they pleading for looser norms or are they arguing seriously that women’s writing being rich, heterogeneous and distinctive, demands a different framework?

These and related questions whenever they come up in the Kannada context, a reference is always made to the controversial episode in which Masti Venkatesh Iyengar wrote a long and harsh piece of criticism on Nanjanagudu Tirumalamba, one of the earliest women writers who wrote between 1911 and the 1930s prolifically. She was a novelist, poet, dramatist (who also directed some of her plays), essayist, editor of journals and publisher. She published her own books and other books through ‘Sati Hitaishini Grantha Male’ her home publication. By all accounts she was a gritty, courageous hardworking crusader for women’s education, for better treatment of widows and against dowry. Her novels were popular and were prescribed as text books in educational institutions in Madras and Bombay presidencies as well as in Mysore region. She kept up a bold dialogue mixed with severe criticism, educated the civil society of her times. Even her devoted followers knew the flaws of her fiction such as long ‘lectures’, exaggerated moralizing, ‘dear readers’ type of harangues, a self-conscious ‘literary’ style which was in contrast to the lucidity with which she attacked her adversaries supporting evil social practices. She was a committed activist, orthodox in her lifestyle and most of her beliefs were against the caste system, the obligatory purity of women, compulsory abstinence and chastity of widows.

But at a time when speaking in public and writing were considered a taboo for women, Tirumalamba lashed out at the foul practices at temples and monasteries and at the hypocrisy of the dual moral standards imposed by men. In retrospect, it is clear that she was very much a product of the period when missionary critiques of Hindu practices, socio-religious reform movements and colonial modernity had converged to foreground the woman question. Pitched battles were taking place around the Sharada Bill (against child marriage) and women’s education. The orthodox backlash in Karnataka was also severe. Education for women was considered a corruptor of their morals and destroyer of the feminine values of unstinted devotion to the husband and children. There was a collective anxiety about a ‘modern’ woman bringing shame to the ancient Indian values. Almost all the first generation women writers in Kannada like Shyamala Belgaumkar, Kalyanamma, Giribale took to journalism and writing to fight for women’s rights. In no sense were they radical feminists, but were remarkably forthright and courageous in crusading for women’s education and against dowry and ill treatment of widows. Writing was a means to engage with social debates and therefore, they were not overtly concerned with the aesthetic norms of fiction and poetry.

Masti did two things which is hard to defend. He failed to contextualise women’s writing in its first phase and criticised Tirumalamba more harshly for her opinions than for obvious aesthetic failings. He vents his anger at her denigration of young men, denunciation of all temples and monasteries and for teaching young women readers to speak impolitely to the elders. As Vijaya Dhabbe, the feminist critic admitted his comments on the shoddiness of her writing are well taken. But if one looks at the works of fiction in Kannada from the 1890s to the first decade of the twentieth century Masti’s comments would be in place for most of the fiction. Surely, his own sparse anti-romantic style was not the favourite model for writers of the period. So why did he subject Tirumalamba’s writings to such harsh critical scrutiny? The paradoxical truth is that this writer of the liberal humanist tradition, who wrote out of deep sympathy and understanding about all human relationships including adultery and incest, was conservative and protectionist about traditional social structures and values. His piece on Tirumalamba is over-emphatic, cruel in sarcasm and wrong-headed. Surprisingly, the same Masti went out of his way to publish Belagere Janakamma’s poems and wrote a sensitive introduction to Rangavalli, an anthology of women writing.

Kodagina Gouramma whose short story was the first contribution in this anthology, later wrote about the frustrating indifference of critics to such writing. She sadly wondered why such competent writing was considered too inferior to respond to. There are any number of similar references to the bias among critics and readers. There were also instances of important male writers like Bendre writing insightfully about Kodagina Gowramma, though unfortunately she did not live to read it.

It is only after the feminist project of rediscovering the ‘lost texts’ was carried out by Vijaya Dhabbe, B.N. Sumitrabai, Nemichandra and others that the major writings of women in the first phase became available for discussion. This fact itself is an indication of the discrimination against women’s writing. Curiously enough, in the great realist phase of Kannada fiction, the major works of Kuvempu, Masti and Shivarama Karanth are women-centric. Navya or modernist writing of the 1960s and 70s with its rebellion against middle-class values and its openness about sexuality, indirectly motivated women poets to write boldly and differently. But paradoxically again with the exception of Shanthinath Desai, most of the male Navya writers conceptualized women as only the liberators of their libidinal desires.

P. Lankesh after he reinvented himself as the editor of ‘Lankesh Patrike’, in his later phase went on to create very memorable women characters. However, it was ‘Lankesh Patrike’ which brought to the forefront greatly talented women writers like Vaidehi, Sara Abubakkar, B.T. Jahnavi and others. The tabloid reformulated writing as a personal, creative act, accessible to all who could write honestly as they are. It also liberated writers from the anxiety of structural and formal perfection and complex symbolic expression which had inhibited many from writing.

The later Dalit and Bandaya (rebel) literary–cultural movements also created a platform for women writers from different social locations. Interestingly, the question ‘Why do Dalit women speak differently’ has been addressed only recently in Kannada. Most women critics agree that women writing has been closely affiliated with the literary cultural movements. It has been an astonishing unraveling of the complex experiences of women in the last four decades. In terms of the variety, maturity, innovation and tremendous creativity, women’s writing in Kannada cannot be marginalised now because it is the mainstream. While Vaidehi is the most accomplished short story writer after U.R. Ananthamurthy. Lalitha Siddabasavaih, Pratibha Nandakumar and Savitha Nagabhushana have created rich poetic worlds which demand dedicated reading. Nagaveni’s Gandhi Banda is a classic novel reconstructing a society in transition with astonishing narrative power. There are at least a dozen hugely talented women poets.

With all this has the Kannada literary-critical establishment recognized that the age of women writing has arrived in Kannada? While leading critics like G.S. Amur, H.S. Raghavendra Rao, and T.P. Ashoka have written enthusiastically about women writing, one wonders if criticism has come far away from its denigration of women writing as ‘Kitchen Writing’. The problem remains the same.

“Well women do write passionately and raw honesty about experiences the male world had no access to. But does the writing have depth, complexity and sense of form?”. I don’t think the question deserves any answer. The question to ask of all literature is whether it has made a substantial difference to our understanding of the world we live in. Every reader has to ask this question and seek the answer individually. When that happens, gradually the institution of literary criticism also begins to do the same collectively. It happens through acts of reading, analysis and comparison. These are acts which cannot be done when surrounded by noisy polemics. There is a very substantial body of women writing in Kannada demanding us to practice the basics of literary criticism.

439,2020/03/06,Vastrakala: putting Sriperumbudur on the French map,"The intricate work of Vastrakala’s embroiderers travels the world. Now, a French award is ensuring their confidence in their craftsmanship is recognised

It is 10.30 on a muggy Monday morning at Vastrakala, the Chennai-based embroidery atelier. But today, dark heads are not bent in concentration over wooden frames, fastidiously pulling thread through cloth. Instead, the 220 embroiderers are milling around the high-ceilinged, capacious factory — the men in white kurtas and the women in bright saris. It is a big day: their ‘boss’, Jean-François Lesage, is to receive the Chevalier (Knight) Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and two of their own are to be presented the Médaille d’Honneur du Travail (medal of labour).

An hour passes, interrupted by coffee, conversations and selfies, before the Consule Generale de France, Catherine Suard, arrives, to pin the medals on the three men’s lapels in a short, simple function. But the event itself is not simple. In a country where craft is on shaky ground and artisans are often overlooked, it signifies something more: pride, accomplishment and a hope for the future. “It is the first time that the French government is awarding Indian craftspeople,” Lesage tells me, explaining that though he was conferred the honour two years ago, he wanted to receive it with his employees. “Togetherness is very important to us at Vastrakala. We have a common language, embroidery — an old and solid bridge between India and France, for the last two to three centuries — and it was important for me to signify that to my embroiderers.”

An artisan-driven story

Praise where it is due According to Lesage, the two awardees represent two aspects of craft. Gopi Narayanaswamy, 54, is a leader, an organiser, who lives and breathes embroidery. “He is always fighting for the craft he believes in, motivating the others,” he says. Magesh Mani, 35, on the other hand, works in a more intimate manner, “putting all his energy in mastering embroidery at a level that very few people in the world have reached. He is always experimenting, learning new techniques, going through our archives and asking me questions.”

As family members examine the medals and pull them in for group photos, I overhear them recounting their stories. Narayanaswamy talks about learning embroidery as a kid and working with zardozi in Mumbai before joining Vastrakala 25 years ago. But it is Mani, who comes from a family of embroiderers and took up the needle when in class seven, who is eloquent. “In our area, once there were over 10,000 people doing embroidery. Today, hardly 100 pursue the craft. They don’t know its value,” he says. “Now that people know they can get recognition like this, it could inspire them to come back into this field. There will be more demand for handwork in the future, so I want to start teaching my children.”

The Frenchman — the third generation of the 160-year-old House of Lesage, whose forebears created embroideries for Napoleon III’s court and whose father worked with fashion maisons like Balmain, Dior and Balenciaga — has often said that if he’d been Indian, he would’ve been born in Sriperumbudur. It is not a flippant statement. “I belong to their community,” he stresses. “Besides the fact that we were not born in the same country, and defined by our own sets of surroundings and contexts, we belong to the same group. I believe passions can unify people wherever they are born.”

This belief is at the core of Vastrakala, set up in 1993. Lesage began with two embroiderers producing cushions. Today, Chanel is on board as a major stakeholder; they embroider for haute couture and bespoke furnishings (an influential Mumbai family has ordered 72 pairs of embroidered curtains); and their work can be spotted from Victor Hugo’s house in Guernsey (recreated embroidered panels) to the Rashtrapati Bhavan (draperies in the banquet hall). Through everything, Lesage has ensured that his artisans drive the story. “The biggest problem of craft is that the people believe they belong to the past. It is important to restore their confidence, pride and sense of belonging,” says the master embroiderer, adding that the French award (Vastrakala is an Indo-French company) is a step in the right direction.

However, he also feels the tide is slowly changing. Enormous value is being given to craft, inspiring young people to work with their hands rather than sit in front of a screen. “It is a movement that is gaining in strength and will also hit India,” he says. And until it does, everyone who is involved in it must continue to celebrate craft and its people, “so that they don’t lose hope. Because when you stop practising, you lose your art very quickly”.",luxury,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/luxury/dg8fk4/article31000635.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07WKVastrakala-3,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/luxury/vastrakala-putting-sriperumbudur-on-the-french-map/article31000639.ece
440,2020/03/06,Harness the sun’s power with light tubes,"Solar light tubes are ideal for cramped spaces, says Anupama Mohanram

In the context of our cities today, where the affordable land area available per person is limited, it is common to see landlocked built spaces with limited to no access to the outdoors. This results in certain areas not having direct access to natural light and ventilation.

This not only affects the general health of its inhabitants, but also results in high electricity bills as lights and air conditioners are switched on even during the day. Sensible design is one way to ensure adequate openings to the outdoors in the case of limited space. Opting for open plans, skylights or sky windows are other features to consider.

Building technology

Although the fast paced of growth of our cities has resulted in unhealthy built environments, it has also led to research and innovation in the space of environmental technologies. In the field of daylighting, a ‘light tube’ or a ‘light pipe’ is one such technological innovation seen in contemporary architecture since the late 1980s (after it was patented by Solatube International, an Australian firm).

A light tube (also known as a tubular daylighting device or TDD) is a tube lined with a highly reflective material that transmits light either from a point on the roof or an external wall, all the way through a building. A diffuser is used to spread light into the space. A solar collector — which is in the shape of a dome — is placed on the external surface to collect and direct light into the solar tube. Some collectors also have additional reflectors or lenses that aid in better light collection and minimise losses in light transmission.

It is interesting to note that the first commercially available reflector lighting system was designed in the 1850s by Paul Emile Chappuis, a photographer. He manufactured daylight reflectors from his factory in London until it was destroyed in a fire during World War II.

Flexi tubes

Solar tubes are widely used today in large spaces to bring in natural light (horizontally) from the nearest exterior wall surface. They are also used vertically from the roof, alongside columns, to get light indoors. Long, angled and even flexible tubes can be used for the purpose, although the transmission efficiency is the most when the tubes are kept short and straight.

To increase efficiency and optimise the collection of daylight, a heliostat — a sun tracking device — can be installed on the exterior surface. This allows for light collection at almost all times of day, including the capture of moonlight at night.

441,2020/03/06,Give your home a Scottish touch,"Opt for neutral colours, a tartan rug and quilts in herringbone patterns. By Teja Lele Desai

Gorgeous skies, spectacular landscapes and scenic vistas — Scotland has a lot going for it. If you can’t get enough of the country, we suggest you get home a little Celtic charm. The best part is that this traditional and tasteful look can be dressed up or down.

Choose rich colours: Go for a rich colour palette and aim for colours that echo the landscape. Deep lichen greens, rainy grays, cranberry red, moat blue, malt and butterscotch are colours that evoke the Scottish feel. Amber, gold and emerald also work exceptionally well.

Opt for Scottish patterns. Look for patterns that are true to Scotland. Try herringbone, tweed, lace and argyle. Explore ways of incorporating them into furnishings, be it as cushions, runners, quilts or curtains.

Play with accessories. Add colourful and unexpected accessories to up the Scottish feel. Shot glasses or whisky tumblers with Scottish motifs will look good in the bar; a framed picture of the Scottish flag or a vintage map in an attractive frame will add interest to a wall.

Make friends with tartan. This pattern comprising criss-crossed horizontal and vertical bands in multiple colours has long been associated with the highlands and lowlands of Scotland.

Show off the wood. Materials associated with Scottish style have patina and a sense of age about them. Think woods like mahogany, chestnut and oak. Warm bronze and pewter. Candlesticks and vases with Celtic designs.

Look for leather. Try leather and faux leather accessories to introduce a bit of the Scottish manor look into an apartment. Look for a recliner for the living room, and toss a tartan cushion on to it. Small storage boxes and trunks in faux leather piled on top of each other make for a good side table.

Don’t miss these motifs. Motifs that have long been seen in Scottish castles and homes include keys, thistles, antlers, knots, crests and shields. Use them on DIY wall art, coasters, trays, canvas pillows and lamps. Reproductions of vintage Scotland travel can be framed to add style to a laidback lounge.

Do up the rooms. In the bedroom, pair velvety woodland-print or tartan pillows with a tufted linen headboards in muted hues. A woollen tartan rug is just the right thing to get up to on a wintry morning. Rugs, wall hangings or art featuring animal silhouettes — be it a deer or a terrier — help recreate an edgy feel. They can also be silk-screened on lamps or pillow cases.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/41av9r/article30999545.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-96891016,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/how-to-give-your-home-a-scottish-touch/article30999546.ece
442,2020/03/06,Anoo sisters on their journey: From a garage to a global market,"Ahead of International Women’s Day, the Anoo sisters recall their 37-year-old journey in the beauty business

Women entrepreneurship never had it easy. In the 80s, the complexities were more due to lack of awareness and business acumen. ‘Grooming’ and ‘styling’ were not common practises unless you were in showbiz and working for hospitality industry. So to be a beautician was an uphill journey. But with a self-belief and their parents’ support, four sisters, Anuradha Chepyala, Polsani Annapurna and twins Takkallapalli Anupama and Anirudha Miryala — known as ‘Anoo sisters’ — changed the face of beauty business in Hyderabad. On a mid-week visit to the Anoos Beauty School building in Somajiguda, one finds it is business as usual. Annapurna, one of the sisters, is busy poring over files. She takes a step back to recall their 37-year journey and the roadblocks they faced.

How it started

“Imagine a beauty parlour in a garage,” laughs Annapurna. Yes, a garage was the starting point of their start-up, an idea mooted by their father Thirupati Rao, a municipal commissioner. The girls pursued their studies and their interest in beauty too. “We had no restrictions and could pursue whatever we wished to. My father was a feminist and a visionary. He encouraged us and also my mother to study and take competitive exams.” When Anuradha and Annapurna started beauty salon Anoos in their garage of their Tilak Nagar house, the colony witnessed a big celebration. “Most of the residents were our acquaintances and were happy and proud of our venture. My mother’s friends used to bring their daughters for bridal make-up, waxing and facials.” Initially, their clients were just a handful, but the numbers grew rapidly. The four siblings joined by two of their cousins needed a bigger space and extended the salon to one portion of their house (“With an income of ₹2000, we paid ₹400 rent to father”). They brushed aside snide remarks from their uncles and aunts who disapproved of the girls cutting other people’s hair!

The sisters then got married and moved to different areas in Hyderabad. Their business too expanded to Vidya Nagar, Himayath Nagar and Secunderabad. Annapurna calls their beauty venture ‘a need-based one’ and explains that her own desire to get the hair on her chin removed led to their interest in unwanted hair removal methods and electrolysis.

She says, “Initially, there was no competition in the market, but women were not ready for this culture of beauty. Now, there is more focus on looking good and the competition too has increased with many global brands launching their services here. The beauty industry is growing rapidly.” The sisters enrolled at Butic College of Beauty in Mumbai and Christine Valmy Beauty School in New York and opened their Anoos Clinic and Beauty School in Somajiguda in 2006. While Annapurna, Anuradha and Anupama live in Hyderabad, Anirudha lives in the U.S. and opened an Anoos branch in Florida.

Growing market

The market grew and with it their business too; their pan-India and overseas market became a boost to the lifestyle industry. Around 500 girls enjoy employment opportunities working in their institutes. Discussing her views on women’s emancipation, she says, “Most of the girls are from less-privileged backgrounds and are pressured to juggle various roles at home. We often share our stories to tell them about the hard work we put in to reach here. We help them understand that they are the best managers. I feel proud to see them support themselves and their families too.”

Talking about the hiccups, she says, “It is tough for us to constantly adjust with the system. We faced many roadblocks as our business faced rough weather with the Telangana agitation and the GST period. We struggled to pay salaries to our employees. We have regained our foothold now by focussing more on treatment-based procedures.”

Annapurna is now a grandmother and says she draws her energy from her 85-year-old father. “He scolds me if I don’t leave for office by 9 am,” she laughs and adds, “We took years to build this brand and continue to work with the same passion.”",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/yzj3ct/article30998474.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym06anoo3,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/anoo-sisters-share-the-inspiration-and-how-they-changed-the-face-of-beauty-business-in-hyderabad/article30998476.ece
