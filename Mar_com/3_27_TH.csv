0,2020/03/27,Age factor worries Tarundeep Rai,"But says, ‘the good thing is that we have already qualified’

Following the postponement of the Tokyo Games, 36-year-old archer Tarundeep Rai has only one concern – he is getting older.

Waiting to compete in his third Olympics in his 17-year international career, two-time World championships team silver medallist Tarundeep is assessing the challenges the new scenario may pose for him.

Loss for athletes

“The postponement is a loss for every athlete. In my case, I am 36 years old. Next year, I will be 37. I am not getting younger, but if I train harder, then I will not lag behind. But, I have to start afresh,” Tarundeep told The Hindu.

Tarundeep, who competed in 2004 Athens and 2012 London Olympics, bagged recurve men’s team silver medals in 2005 Madrid and 2019 Den Bosch World championships.

The Armyman looked at the brighter side. “We have to take it positively. The archery community may suffer, if we look at the negatives. The good thing is that we have already qualified. The younger generation of the country can also get a chance (as the quota place belongs to the country), and should grab it as they will not get another such opportunity.”

Sharing his ideas about training during the lockdown, Tarundeep said, “Whatever archery-specific exercises are there, one should do that. In this age of internet, everything is available on the phone. One should take advantage of that. When the lockdown ends, then one should be ready to resume shooting.”

Stuck away from home

Tarundeep, who has not been to his home in Sikkim for about a year now, was part of the national camp at the Army Sports Institute, Pune. Even after the camp was shut down on March 22, he could not go home owing to the lockdown.

In the time of social distancing, Tarundeep, nevertheless, is happy to have stayed connected with his family from a distance. “At least, I am safe here and my family is safe in Sikkim. I am getting a lot of time to speak to my family,” he said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/fxkpo7/article31186872.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28ARCHERY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/age-factor-worries-tarundeep-rai/article31186873.ece
1,2020/03/27,Disappointing to see our sincerity questioned: Badminton World Federation,"Badminton

The Badminton World Federation said it is “disappointing” that some top players questioned its “sincerity and motives” when it continued with the All England Championships despite the rapidly-growing threat of COVID-19 pandemic. The decision to conduct the event came for sharp criticism from the top shuttlers of the world, including Saina Nehwal, who had accused the administrators of placing money above players’ safety.

In an open letter, BWF secretary general Thomas Lund said the decision to go ahead with the All England Championships was made based on the best advice at that time.

“It has been very disappointing to see some members of the badminton community speculate on the sincerity and motives of the BWF in this time of crisis,” Lund wrote. “Our number one concern has always been the health and safety of all of our participants.”

“However, at the same time, we are deeply concerned about the cancellation of tournaments and the flow-on effect this has on elite players and coaches whereby they could now be in a position of temporary unemployment and loss of income.”

Tough to take decisions

However, Lund said it was tough to take decisions in a “fast-changing landscape” where guidelines were revised on daily basis and the approach of different governments was also not consistent.

“Given the fast-changing landscape unfolding with governments implementing measures in inconsistent ways and with many considerations and speculations within our own community, it has therefore been challenging to meet all global expectations from all of you,” he said.

“Of course, hindsight is a wonderful thing. It was not difficult to argue that “wrong decisions” had been taken in an environment changing on nearly an hourly basis, with further decisions therefore required.

“This has not only been the case for BWF, but most authorities around the world. However, we maintain that BWF made the best possible decisions at the time and with sincere motives to protect both the health and livelihood of all participants.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/disappointing-to-see-our-sincerity-questioned-badminton-world-federation/article31186858.ece
2,2020/03/27,Coronavirus | Sporting heroes doing their bit,"Cricketer Joginder, boxer Akhil and kabaddi player Ajay doing police duty in the battle against COVID-19.

They were at the forefront of pursuing glory for the nation as athletes and now some Indian sporting heroes are playing a key role in the raging battle against the COVID-19 pandemic -- manning the streets as police officers persuading people to stay home amid a national lockdown.

T20 World Cup-winning cricketer Joginder Sharma, Commonwealth Games gold medal-winning boxer Akhil Kumar and Asian Games champion kabaddi player Ajay Thakur have one thing in common. They are all full-time police officers, jobs which they got thanks to their sporting accomplishments.

Joginder and Akhil, both Haryana police officers and good friends, listed the challenges that come with “doing duty” during an unprecedented crisis.

“I have been a DSP since 2007. This is one of a kind challenge for me because of the general fear and I can tell you that I have seen quite a few challenges in my years of service,” said Joginder, the all-rounder who bowled the final over in the triumph against Pakistan in the 2007 T20 World Cup in South Africa.

The 36-year-old is currently posted in Hisar as the nation observes a 21-day lockdown.

Helping those in need

“Our duty time starts around 6 a.m. and we help those in need of essentials or medical aid and take action against those who try to defy without any good reason,” Joginder said.

Serving with the Gurugram Police as ACP since September last year is Akhil, the flamboyant bantamweight boxer, whose perilously low guard at the peak of his career became the style statement that many in Indian boxing continue to try and emulate.

“People are generally cooperative and in any case, essential services are being kept open so there is not much panic,” said Akhil, who turned 38 on Friday, a working birthday for him.

The two-time Olympian and Arjuna awardee has also been pooling money with his colleagues, including another boxer-turned-policeman Jitender Kumar, to buy essential food items and sanitisers for the underprivileged.

Ajay, an Arjuna awardee and Padma Shri winner, is a DSP in Himachal Pradesh and has been in service since 2017.

3,2020/03/27,Olympics | Qualification intact for Tokyo-bound athletes,"Around 57% of the 11,000 scheduled participants for Tokyo had already made sure of taking part when the IOC pushed the Games back.

Athletes who had already qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics before it was postponed will keep their places when the showpiece takes place in 2021, sources said.

Around 57% of the 11,000 scheduled participants for Tokyo had already made sure of taking part when the IOC pushed the Games back.

The IOC and 32 international sports federations held a teleconference on Thursday where it was decided to respect the qualification process.

“Thomas Bach (the IOC President) first explained the reasons for the postponement of the Games, then said that the athletes qualified for Tokyo 2020 would automatically be qualified for 2021,” one of the participants in the conference told AFP.

“One of the main subjects was to know when and how to organise the qualifications.

“In some federations, many sportsmen and sportswomen are not qualified and it takes at least three months for the Olympic Games to organise them.”

4,2020/03/27,Key questions that Wimbledon faces,"The All England Club will hold an emergency meeting next week to discuss the possible postponement or even cancellation of Wimbledon in the light of the coronavirus pandemic.

AFP Sport looks at the key questions facing the organisers of the world’s most prestigious tennis tournament.

What are the options for Wimbledon this year?

Wimbledon, scheduled to take place from June 29 until July 12, has been staged every year in peace time since 1877, shelved only during the two world wars.

The grass court season is relatively short, five weeks for the leading events, so Wimbledon would appear to have time on its side.

However, building and preparation work at the All England Club site in leafy south-west London takes two months to complete and is set to start at the end of April.

There is also the issue of when the coronavirus will peak and the United Kingdom has been badly hit.

Health is the top issue for an event which attracts not only the superstars of the sport, but also close to 500,000 spectators each year as well as 6,000 staff and around 3,200 accredited media.

Why can’t the tournament be played later in the year?

A slot has opened up in the calendar after the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics until next year.

However, Wimbledon organisers know that a postponement by a just fortnight to take advantage of that opening would solve little.

“At this time, based on the advice we have received from the public health authorities, the very short window available to us to stage The Championships due to the nature of our surface suggests that postponement is not without significant risk and difficulty. Playing behind closed doors has been formally ruled out,” said a spokesman.

What would be the financial implications of a cancelled Wimbledon?

The tournament is an annual money-spinner. For example, in the 2017-2018 fiscal year, it was reported that Wimbledon generated $336 million with a pre-tax profit of $52 million. Over 90%of that was ploughed into British tennis.

The BBC, which broadcasts Wimbledon, will have a two-week black hole if the event is called off. It reportedly shells out around $72 million a year for the rights.

Who would be the losers of a cancelled Wimbledon?

As well as the purely sporting implications of a binned Wimbledon, Britain’s well-heeled would suffer a jolt to their busy summer social season.

The Henley Royal Regatta on the River Thames, a feature since 1839, has already been cancelled. Wary eyes will now be cast towards June’s Royal Ascot, which has drawn British royalty and the cream of society since 1911.

The British tabloids would also be stripped of their two-week Wimbledon headline bonanza and celebrity fix.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/mu7ve/article31186937.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28WIMBLEDON,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/key-questions-that-wimbledon-faces/article31186939.ece
5,2020/03/27,‘Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ offers island escapism in the time of lockdown,"Live out your very own island paradise in Nintendo's adorable new game that will consume your time in the best way possible

The latest social simulation game from the Animal Crossing universe could not have arrived at a better time. Where everything in the world is doom and gloom and we have several more days of a lockdown to get through. New Horizons is a gem that will liven up the mood with the prospect of an island getaway — even if it is through the tiny screen of your Nintendo Switch. Bringing out the creator and collector in you, this game will consume your time in the best way possible, as long as you are open to a slightly different experience.

Animal Crossing New Horizons Developer: Nintendo

Publisher: Nintendo

Price: ₹4999 for Nintendo Switch

You create your character, which is immediately dropped into an island setting of your choice, save for a few villagers and the enigmatic Nook of Resident Services. This slice of digital life is yours to make whatever you want of it; there are no objectives, except for the first few ‘days’ which serve as a tutorial to set up the island and familiarise yourself with the various mechanics. We recommend choosing northern hemisphere with its seasons that are much like ours.

If you are used to games telling you what to do, you would be instantly lost in New Horizons. The beginning is a slow burn as you get into the habit of making your own objective plan for the day, something that came naturally to my seven-year-old daughter, who collected bugs, and dug around for fossils. Earn enough Bells, the local currency, and you can kit yourself, your home and your island out with the latest gear.

Profitable spaces

New Horizons’ customisations extend to the island as you craft new tools that actually terraform the island. At first, the map you select may not allow you to access most parts of it, being blocked off by tiny rivers. As you proceed, you can build bridges, houses for your residents, to attract more island-folk. My daughter, the collector, has a museum setup so that the residents and visitors can enjoy her collection.

The game changes things up daily, with new ways to make more money: selling fruit, keeping an eye out for what different sellers want to buy and selling them at a high price, or finding messages in bottles. You can also go to a nearby island to obtain new species of fish or bugs, maybe get some materials to build new tools.

The game falters in the grinding, in that you need to manually hit up every rock or tree to see what falls. It is repetitive, but also therapeutic. Once you have your island in place, you can sit back and relax after a hard day’s work and watch the sunset.

The verdict?

New Horizons is incredibly cute, with its humanoid animals and excellent writing. Beautifully minimal, it just works with its intuitive controls and user interface.The best part is, you can show it off to friends. Via local Switches, you can invite friends over to your island to play or if you have Switch pals online, you can invite them over or be invited over to see their creations. While there is not much to do but mill about with them, it is still fun.

6,2020/03/27,"Coronavirus | Italy reports 919 new deaths, highest daily tally since start of outbreak","Prior to Friday's figure, the largest daily toll was registered on March 21, when 793 people died

The death toll from an outbreak of coronavirus in Italy has surged by 919 to 9,134, the Civil Protection Agency said on Friday, easily the highest daily tally since the epidemic emerged on Feb. 21.

Prior to Friday's figure, the largest daily toll was registered on March 21, when 793 people died.

The 919 people who died over the last 24 hours compares with 712 deaths on Thursday, 683 on Wednesday, 743 on Tuesday and 602 on Monday.

The total number of confirmed cases rose to 86,498 from a previous 80,539, taking Italy's total past that of China, where the coronavirus epidemic emerged at the end of last year.

The United States already surpassed China's tally of cases on Thursday.

In Italy, of those originally infected nationwide, 10,950 had fully recovered on Friday, compared to 10,361 the day before. There were 3,732 people in intensive care against a previous 3,612.

The hardest-hit northern region of Lombardy reported a steep rise in fatalities compared with the day before and remains in a critical situation, with a total of 5,402 deaths and 37,298 cases.

That compared with 4,861 deaths and 34,889 cases reported up to Thursday.

Friday's cumulative death tally included 50 fatalities that actually occurred on Thursday in the northern Piedmont region, but whose notification arrived too late to be included in the official figures for March 26, the Civil Protection Agency said.

This has led to some confusion and means that some media outlets are reporting the Friday daily tally at 969, rather than 919.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/b4cyzd/article31186658.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDITALY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-italy-reports-919-new-deaths-highest-daily-tally-since-start-of-outbreak/article31186659.ece

German researchers plan to regularly test over 100,000 people to see if they have overcome infection with coronavirus (COVID-19) to track its spread, an institute behind the plan confirmed on Friday.

A spokeswoman for Brunswick’s Helmholtz Institute for Infectious Disease Research confirmed a report in news weekly Der Spiegel that large-scale testing for antibodies could start in April if researchers are given the green light.

“You could give immune people something similar to a vaccination certificate that could allow them exceptions from limits on their activities,” Helmholtz Institute epidemiologist Gerard Krause told Der Spiegel.

German schools, non-essential shops and restaurants are now closed and public gatherings of more than two people banned.

Dr. Krause would work institutions on the front line of Germany's response to the virus, including disease control authority the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and Berlin's Charite hospital.

By Friday, the RKI reported over 42,000 confirmed coronavirus infections in Europe's most populous nation, and 253 deaths.

“Results from the study will make it easier to decide when schools could be reopened and large events permitted,” Der Spiegel wrote.

The first results are expected in late April.

Russia ordered its vast network of State-run hotels, resorts and recreational facilities to shut down from March 28 until June 1, as its number of confirmed coronavirus cases rose past 1,000.

The official tally of confirmed cases jumped by a record daily amount for the third day in a row on Friday, bringing Russia’s total to 1,036 a day after it moved to suspend all international flights. Four people have died.

Russia’s mass domestic tourism and recreation sector is still dominated by the State, a legacy from Soviet era. Millions of Russians still holiday each year at vast State-run hotels, resorts, health spas and children’s camps.

President Vladimir Putin has declared next week a non-working week, and Moscow, the country’s worst-affected area, will this weekend close all cafes, restaurants and shops apart from those selling food and medicine, until April 5.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Russia remains much lower than in many European countries, but the mayor of Moscow told Putin on Tuesday that the real scale of the problem in the capital far exceeded official figures.

An opinion poll by the Moscow-based Levada Centre showed the majority of Russians, some 59%, do not believe the official figures. Twenty-four per cent said they “absolutely” did not believe them and 35% said they only partially believed them, the poll showed.

13,2020/03/27,Coronavirus | South Africa reports first two deaths as lockdown starts,"Cyril Ramaphosa has ordered Africa's most industrialised nation to stay at home for 21 days joining other countries across continent.

South Africa recorded its first two deaths from the novel coronavirus on Friday as the number of confirmed cases breached the 1,000 mark just hours after a three-week nationwide lockdown swung into action.

“This morning we wake South Africans up with sad news that we now have our first deaths resulting from COVID-19,” Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said in a statement.

President Cyril Ramaphosa has ordered Africa's most industrialised nation to stay at home for 21 days, joining other countries across the continent which have imposed strict measures to halt the spread of the disease.

But many people defied the order which came into effect at midnight Thursday, lining up outside food stores or at bus terminals.

Police appeared overwhelmed in downtown Johannesburg on Friday where hundreds of shoppers pushed and shoved trying to force their way into a supermarket.

""The lockdown is a good thing for the country, even though I feel that a lot of people and taking it for granted, saying this virus is not for us... which is bad because by the time we wake up this thing will have spread enormously in the country,"" said bank employee Dumisani July, 39, wearing a mask and black latex gloves.

Mkhize said the two people died in the Western Cape province, and announced that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases have topped 1,000.

On Thursday, the country had reported 927 confirmed cases, a jump of more than 30 percent from the previous day, with Ramaphosa projecting it could reach 1,500 ""within a few days"".

Kenya, Rwanda and Mali are some of the African countries that have imposed restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which has been confirmed to have infected more than 3,200 people and killed 89 across the continent.

Although Africa's toll is far lower than in Europe, the United States and the Middle East, health experts say the world's poorest continent is especially vulnerable and the figures likely fall far short of the reality.

'Invisible enemy'

Donning a camouflage uniform complete with a cap, Ramaphosa on Thursday saw off soldiers before they deployed from a military base in Soweto township outside economic hub Johannesburg.

“This is unprecedented, not only in our democracy but also in the history of our country, that we will have a lockdown for 21 days to go out and wage war against an invisible enemy coronavirus,” he said.

During the shutdown, jogging, dog-walking and the sale of alcohol are banned across the country, which so far has the highest number of detected infections in sub-Saharan Africa.

Violation of any of the regulations will carry a six-month jail sentence or a fine.

In West Africa, Nigeria's government warned Thursday that Africa's most populous nation could soon see an ""exponential"" increase in infections unless contacts of confirmed cases are tracked down more rapidly.

'War against invisible enemy'

Kenya, which has 31 cases, on Thursday recorded its first death — a 66-year-old Kenyan man who had travelled from South Africa on March 13.

The east African country will begin a night-time curfew on Friday to try curtail the spread.

In the Sahel, Burkina Faso, which last week recorded sub-Saharan Africa's first death, announced that eight towns, including the capital Ouagadougou, would be quarantined from Friday.

""Quarantined means that nobody will enter or leave the towns involved,"" Communication Minister Remis Fulgance Dandjinou said, adding that the measure would be applied for two weeks.

14,2020/03/27,Hundreds killed in Iran over false belief that poison kills coronavirus,"Iranian media reports nearly 300 people have been killed and more than 1,000 sickened so far by ingesting methanol.

Standing over the still body of an intubated 5-year-old boy wearing nothing but a plastic diaper, an Iranian health care worker in a hazmat suit and mask begged the public for just one thing — Stop drinking industrial alcohol over fears about the new coronavirus.

The boy, now blind after his parents gave him toxic methanol in the mistaken belief it protects against the virus, is just one of hundreds of victims of an epidemic inside the pandemic now gripping Iran.

Iranian media reports nearly 300 people have been killed and more than 1,000 sickened so far by ingesting methanol across the Islamic Republic, where drinking alcohol is banned and where those who do rely on bootleggers. It comes as fake remedies spread across social media in Iran, where people remain deeply suspicious of the government after it downplayed the crisis for days before it overwhelmed the country.

“The virus is spreading and people are just dying off, and I think they are even less aware of the fact that there are other dangers around,” said Dr. Knut Erik Hovda, a clinical toxicologist in Oslo who studies methanol poisoning and fears Iran’s outbreak could be even worse than reported. “When they keep drinking this, there’s going to be more people poisoned.”

For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.

The pandemic has swept across the world, overwhelming hospitals, crippling economies and forcing governments to restrict the movements of billions of people. Particularly hard hit has been Iran, home to 80 million people.

As of now, there is no known cure for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Scientists and doctors continue to study the virus and search for effective medicines and a vaccine.

But in messages forwarded and forwarded again, Iranian social media accounts in Farsi falsely suggested a British school teacher and others cured themselves of the coronavirus with whiskey and honey, based on a tabloid story from early February. Mixed with messages about the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, some wrongly believed drinking high-proof alcohol would kill the virus in their bodies.

Also read: Coronavirus | Iran death toll rise to 1,566; total infections exceeds 20,000

The Islamic Republic has reported over 29,000 confirmed cases and more than 2,200 deaths from the virus, the highest toll of any country in the Middle East. International experts also fear Iran may be under-reporting its cases, as officials for days played down the virus ahead of a parliamentary election.

That fear of the virus, coupled with poor education and internet rumors, saw dozens sickened by drinking bootleg alcohol containing methanol in Iran’s southwestern Khuzestan province and its southern city of Shiraz. Videos aired by Iranian media showed patients with IVs stuck in their arms, laying on beds otherwise needed for the fight against the coronavirus, including the intubated 5-year-old boy. Iranian media also reported cases in the cities of Karaj and Yazd.

In Iran, the government mandates that manufacturers of toxic methanol add an artificial color to their products so the public can tell it apart from ethanol, the kind of alcohol that can be used in cleaning wounds. Ethanol is also the kind of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, though its production is illegal in Iran.

Also read: Iran announces 149 more coronavirus deaths, toll rises to 1,433

Some bootleggers in Iran use methanol, adding a splash of bleach to mask the added color before selling it as drinkable. Sometimes it is mixed with consumable alcohol to stretch supply, other times it comes as methanol, falsely advertised as drinkable, Hovda said. Methanol also can contaminate traditionally fermented alcohol.

Methanol cannot be smelled or tasted in drinks. It causes delayed organ and brain damage. Symptoms include chest pain, nausea, hyperventilation, blindness and even coma.

""It is rumored that alcohol can wash and sanitize the digestive system,” said Dr. Javad Amini Saman in Iran’s western city of Kermanshah, where dozens have been hospitalized, “That is very wrong.”

Even before the outbreak, methanol poisoning had taken a toll in Iran. One academic study found methanol poisoning sickened 768 people in Iran between September and October 2018 alone, killing 76.

Other Muslim nations that ban their citizens from drinking also see such methanol poisoning, although Iran appears to be the only one in the pandemic so far to turn toward it as a fake cure. In Buddhist Cambodia, police said they seized 4,200 liters (1,100 gallons) of methanol from a man who unwittingly planned to make toxic hand sanitizer because of the virus outbreak.

Muslim drinkers in Iran can be punished with cash fines and 80 lashes. However, minority Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians can drink alcoholic beverages in private.

While police occasionally announce alcohol busts, the trade in nontoxic alcohol also continues. Locally made Iranian arak from fermented raisins, known as Aragh sagi, sells for $10 for a 1.5-liter bottle. Imported vodka sells for $40 a bottle.

""Every year during Nowruz, or the Persian New Year holidays that begin March 21, my customers double,” said Rafik, an Iranian-Armenian who makes vodka in the basement of his Tehran home. He spoke on the condition that only his first name be used for fear of arrest. “This year, because of corona, it jumped up by four- or five-fold.”

Farhad, a self-described heavy drinker who lives in central Tehran, said alcohol remains easy to find for those looking for it.

""Even you can find it offered when you are walking down the street, “ he said.

Since 1979, Iran’s 40 alcohol factories have seen their production changed to pharmaceutical needs and sanitizers. Others had been left idle, like the abandoned Shams alcohol factory east of Tehran.

But now, in a time when even some mosques in Iran hand out high-proof alcohol as a sanitizer, officials plan to start work again at Shams to produce 22,000 liters of 99% alcohol a day.

Pakistan on Friday opened its borders with its all-weather ally China for a day to accept Chinese medical supplies to fight the growing coronavirus outbreak in the country which has infected 1,235 people and claimed nine lives, officials said.

China on Thursday asked Pakistan to open the border between the two countries for one day on Friday so that medical supplies to fight coronavirus pandemic could be transported into the country.

According to Pakistan’s health ministry, the number of confirmed cases are nearly 1,235 with Sindh province on the top with 429 patients.

The largest province of Punjab followed with 408, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) with 147, Balochistan 131, Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) 91, Islamabad 27 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) with 2 patients.

According to the government data, nine patients have died, 23 have recovered and seven are in critical condition.

One new case was reported in PoK, taking the tally to 2. Complete lockdown has been imposed by the regional government and strict measures were taken to prevent the further spread.

China was providing critical medical supplies to Pakistan and the Khunjerab pass between the two countries was opened on Friday to let the goods enter Pakistan, according to the Chinese embassy in Islamabad.

“Medical supplies from Xinjiang, China to Pakistan is delivered through Khunjerab (5,000m) port today, highest land port on Earth. Both sides from China and Pakistan braved the cold, cleared the roads, made good preparations for the delivery of the medical supplies at the Khunjerab Pass, the Chinese embassy in Pakistan tweeted on Friday.

Meanwhile, several cases of extreme negligence were also being reported from different areas.

A person with suspected coronavirus infection in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was allowed to go home after giving samples on March 24, Geo News reported.

Later, he was tested positive and the authorities took him to a hospital and put the entire village in quarantine.

On Wednesday, Bhara Khahu town in Islamabad was sealed after several cases emerged in the locality. Earlier, a village of Mardan area was sealed after spike in the cases.

16,2020/03/27,Iran’s army sets up hospital in virus-stricken capital,"The new facility, which includes three units and several isolation wards, was set up in just 48 hours

The Iranian military has set up a 2,000-bed hospital in an exhibition center in the capital to shore up the local health care system as it battles the worst coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East, state TV reported.

It said the new facility, which includes three units and several isolation wards, was set up in just 48 hours. It will be used for patients who are recovering from the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus.

News Analysis | India’s health diplomacy cannot ignore Iran

State TV on Thursday quoted Gen. Ali Jahanshahi, the army’s deputy coordinator, as saying the hospital has been handed over to medical staff and will begin receiving patients next week.

Iran is battling the worst outbreak in the region, with more than 2,200 deaths among nearly 30,000 confirmed cases. Authorities have urged people to stay home but have not imposed the sweeping lockdowns seen elsewhere in the region.

Iranian officials have repeatedly insisted they have the outbreak under control despite concerns it could overwhelm the country’s health facilities.

Singaporeans could be jailed for up to six months if they intentionally stand close to someone else, under tough new rules announced Friday to halt the spread of the coronavirus.

The city-state has introduced a series of new measures to tackle the virus, including closing bars and cinemas as well as banning large events.

One step aimed at ensuring “social-distancing” – a key approach being used worldwide to halt the spread of the contagious disease – is a ban on individuals standing less than one metre (three feet) apart in certain settings.

People are barred from intentionally standing too close to someone else in a queue, or sitting on a seat less than one metre from another individual in a public place, according to the regulations.

Those found guilty of breaking the rules face a jail term of up to six months and a maximum fine of Sg$10,000 (US$7,000).

Business owners are also required to take steps such as putting seats not fixed to the ground at least one metre apart, and making sure that people keep their distance when queueing.

They face the same punishments if found to have broken the rules.

Singapore, known for having a low crime rate and a tough approach to law and order, introduced stricter curbs after a spike in infections being brought in from overseas.

The health ministry said earlier this week that “we must implement tighter safe distancing measures now to minimise activities and exposure”.

Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he discussed the COVID-19 outbreak “in great detail” with the Chinese president.

China’s presidency of the 15-nation Council will end on March 31 and no meeting is scheduled on the programme of work of the Security Council for March to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the rapidly deteriorating situation and the outbreak’s dire health, security and economic consequences on nations.

A UN diplomat told PTI that “the silence of the Council on an issue impacting human security in such a profound manner reflects that it is obviously not fit for purpose for the challenges of our times.”

The Security Council held a video-conference on Thursday chaired by China’s Ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun and discussed the work of United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL).

A statement issued by the Chinese Mission to UN after the meeting said that Council members “also expressed concern at the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Libya and called on the parties to de-escalate the fighting urgently, to immediately cease hostilities and to ensure unhindered access of humanitarian aid throughout the country.” That was the only reference to the COVID-19 crisis in the entire statement.

The Dominican Republic will assume the Council Presidency for April.

A U.S. State Department official said the Security Council had a unique and important role to play in combating the global coronavirus pandemic that poses major risks to international peace and security.

Earlier this month, as he took over the presidency of the Council, Zhang was asked whether China planned to discuss the coronavirus emergency.

He responded that there was no need to panic over the coronavirus epidemic and Beijing did not plan to discuss the situation in the Council during its presidency, asserting that the world was not far from the defeat of COVID-19 “with the coming of spring”.

Also read | The race to find a cure for COVID-19

With regard to the Security Council, at this moment, is the general feeling of Members States, while we watch closely the situation, especially the new development, we do not need to go panicky about that epidemic, Zhang had said.

He added that the issue of coronavirus fell within the concept of global public health while the Security Council’s primary responsibility was dealing with the geo-political security and peace matters.

President of the 74th session of the General Assembly Tijjani Muhammad-Bande will brief the 193 UN Member States Friday “on the challenges posed by COVID-19 to the work of the Organisation and the activities of its principal organs.”

He will be joined by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, United Nations Economic and Social Council President Mona Juul and Zhang.

An NBC News report said that talks among Security Council nations over a joint declaration or resolution on coronavirus remain in stalemate over Washington’s insistence that such a resolution should explicitly state that the virus originated in Wuhan, China, as well as exactly when it started there.

The package | All about COVID-19

Beijing’s diplomats are enraged at this and even want to put their own language into the statement praising China’s efforts to contain the virus, the NBC report said.

A French diplomatic source told PTI that there are different attempts to have a UN text but there is nothing precise for the moment.

The State Department official said that all Security Council members must recognise the threat that China’s mishandling of the outbreak poses to international peace and security.

The official said China had been more interested in saving face than saving lives. The official added that the World Health Organization and Chinese officials themselves had acknowledged that the outbreak began in Hubei Province, and Chinese authorities were the first to learn about it.

As such, they had a special responsibility to be fully transparent about the virus’s spread but instead they suppressed information and punished doctors and journalists who raised the alarm, the official said.

The official said while Washington cannot predict how Beijing or Moscow will vote on a UN Security Council resolution, history will take note of countries who fail to take action in a transparent and objective manner for the good of the world for parochial political interests.

This is not the time to bicker but time to rise up to this unprecedented challenge, the official said.

The official said the U.S. would support a resolution that underscores the need for sustained and concerted international action to slow the spread of COVID-19.

China’s Mission to the UN tweeted Thursday that COVID19 “is a common enemy of all of us. China is also a victim.

Five members of the team are women.

Afghanistan's government late on Thursday announced a 21-member team to negotiate with the Taliban in a tentative sign of progress for the United States-brokered peace deal.

The list announced by the country's State Ministry of Peace would be led by Masoom Stanekzai, a former National Directorate of Security chief, and included politicians, former officials and representatives of civil society. Five members of the team are women.

It was not immediately clear whether President Ashraf Ghani's political rival Abdullah Abdullah would endorse the team selected, which diplomats have said would be vital given his camp's strong influence in much of the country's North and West.

Following the selection of the government's negotiators, the next step should be to convene talks with the Taliban as part of a process aimed at ending America's longest war and bringing peace to Afghanistan.

Mr. Abdullah's spokesman did not immediately reply to request for comment.

The United States signed a troop withdrawal deal with the Taliban in February, but progress on moving to negotiations between the militant group and the Afghan government has been delayed, in part by the political feud between Ghani and Abdullah with both men claiming to be Afghanistan's rightful leader following September's election.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo failed to mediate between the two men to create an “inclusive” government during a day-long visit to Kabul on Monday, and announced a $1 billion cut in U.S. aid to Afghanistan, which he said could be reversed.

The government announced this week it would begin releasing Taliban prisoners at the end of March, edging closer to removing an obstacle to talks. The Taliban had demanded the unconditional release of 5,000 prisoners before starting talks with the government. Ghani countered with an offer to free 1,500 prisoners, and has since said he would release 100 at the end of March.

23,2020/03/27,U.S. increases support for Taiwan in recognition battle with China,"While the United States, like most countries, has no official relations with Taiwan, the Trump administration has ramped up support for the island, with arms sales and laws to help Taiwan deal with pressure from China.

U.S. President Donald Trump has signed into law an act that requires increased U.S. support for Taiwan internationally, which will likely infuriate a China already angry with Trump's criticism of the handling of the coronavirus outbreak.

China claims democratic and separately ruled Taiwan as its own territory, and regularly describes Taiwan as its most sensitive and important issue in ties with the United States.

While the United States, like most countries, has no official relations with Taiwan, the Trump administration has ramped up support for the island, with arms sales and laws to help Taiwan deal with pressure from China.

The Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act, signed by Mr. Trump into law on Thursday with strong bipartisan support, requires the U.S. State Department to report to Congress on steps taken to strengthen Taiwan's diplomatic relations.

It also requires the United States to “alter” engagement with nations that undermine Taiwan's security or prosperity.

Taiwan complains that China is poaching the dwindling number of countries that maintain formal ties with Taipei and has prevented it from participating in bodies like the World Health Organization. China says Taiwan is merely one of its provinces, with no right to recognition as a country.

Taiwan's foreign ministry welcomed the U.S. law and thanked the United States for its support for Taiwan's “diplomatic space” and right to international participation.

“We are also willing to work with the United States and countries with similar ideals to promote the shared common goals of freedom and democratic values, and continue to strive for even wider international space for Taiwan,” the ministry said.

There was no immediate reaction from Beijing, which is already angry about Trump's accusations that China poorly handled the coronavirus outbreak.

China's defence ministry on Thursday accused the United States of playing a dangerous game with its support for Taiwan, after a U.S. warship passed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait.

One of the act's authors, Senator Cory Gardner, said the law was needed to respond to Chinese pressure on, and bullying of, Taiwan.

“This bipartisan legislation demands a whole-of-government approach to ramp up our support for Taiwan, and will send a strong message to nations that there will be consequences for supporting Chinese actions that undermine Taiwan,” he said in a statement.

The United States has been particularly concerned about China hiving off Taiwan's allies in the Pacific and Latin America, areas of the world Washington traditionally considers its zone of influence.

The Indian Embassy here has announced free online yoga classes for the millions of Americans to keep them “healthy” and “cheerful” while they are forced to stay indoors and work from home due to the fast spreading novel coronavirus that has taken the lives of more than 1,100 people.

The free yoga class would be imparted daily from Monday to Friday at 5 pm. It would be streamed live through the Facebook page of the Indian Embassy.

We are happy to announce the online Yoga classes during weekdays @ 5 PM EST, starting from Monday, March 30, 2020. The classes will be live streamed through the Embassy’s Facebook page,” the embassy tweeted.

“A good initiative by the Embassy to keep healthy and cheerful while working from home,” Taranjit Singh Sandhu, India’s Ambassador to the US, tweeted.

The online yoga teaching would be imparted by Moxraj, the teacher of Indian culture at the Indian Embassy.

Such an announcement by the Indian Embassy comes days after the Harvard Medical School recommended yoga, meditation and controlled breathing to address anxiety issues related to the novel coronavirus.

“Regular meditation is very calming. Many apps teach simple forms of meditation, such as Headspace or Calm,” wrote John Sharp, a board-certified psychiatrist on the faculty at Harvard Medical School and the David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles.

“Not a yoga person? No need to start now unless you’d like to try it. Sometimes trying new things and discovering new activities you can benefit from and enjoy can be a welcome, healthy distraction. Yoga Studio and Pocket Yoga are good apps to consider,” he said.

In an email to her constituents, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell also recommended Yoga, among other things, to stay calm and healthy.

25,2020/03/27,Working together with G20 countries on coronavirus: Trump,"“We talked about the problem and hopefully won’t be a problem for too much longer. The United States is working with our friends and partners around the world to stop the spread of the virus and coordinate our efforts,” Mr. Trump told reporters at a White House news conference.

The U.S. is working with its friends and partners around the world to stop the spread of the virus and coordinate their efforts, President Donald Trump said on Thursday after an emergency virtual meeting of G-20 leaders on COVID-19.

“We talked about the problem and hopefully won’t be a problem for too much longer. The United States is working with our friends and partners around the world to stop the spread of the virus and coordinate our efforts,” Mr. Trump told reporters at a White House news conference.

Describing it as a great meeting, he said, “We have a lot of different ideas, a lot of good ideas, we are working together. The leaders gathered virtually around the world to discuss the whole subject of the problem that right now 151 nations have got”.

Mr. Trump said they discussed how vital it is for all of these nations to immediately share information and data.

“We have been doing that to a large extent but we will do it even more so and to inform each of us on the fight that we’ve got going one way or the other. It is a little bit different but we are handling it in different ways but there is great uniformity,” he said.

There was tremendous spirit among all of those countries, he said.

Later in the day, Mr. Trump spoke with President Emmanuel Macron of France. During the telephonic conversation, they discussed the latest efforts to combat coronavirus and its economic effects.

“The two leaders agreed on the importance of close cooperation through the G7, G20, and P5 to help multilateral organizations, including the World Health Organization, International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank, eliminate the pandemic quickly and minimize its economic impact. The leaders also discussed important regional and bilateral issues,” the White House said in a readout of the call.

Meanwhile, Us Chambers of Commerce praised the G-20 Summit Statement on COVID-19 in which they affirmed their commitment to enhancing cooperation to fight the pandemic, safeguard the global economy and address international trade disputes.

“We are encouraged by the G20’s pledge to strengthen global cooperation to combat COVID-19. To realize this goal, the Chamber urges G20 members to work urgently to ensure a transparent and stable trade environment, which is critical to ensure sustained and equitable access to lifesaving supplies for patients and medical providers,” said US Chamber of Commerce executive vice president and Head of International Affairs Myron Brilliant.

“The business community stands ready to support the G20 in their efforts to develop coordinated responses to the pandemic, including collaboration with the G20 Ministers of Health as they prepare for a virtual meeting next month, he said.

26,2020/03/27,Brazil’s governors press Bolsonaro for more coronavirus support,"Confirmed cases in Brazil had roughly doubled in four days to 2,915 on Thursday, according to the health ministry, with 78 dead from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus.

Brazil's governors pressed President Jair Bolsonaro on Thursday for more federal support in the coronavirus battle after he blasted them as job-killers and undermined their orders with a decree keeping churches open at evangelical preachers' request.

Mr. Bolsonaro has increasingly echoed the view of U.S. President Donald Trump that jobs should be prioritized over restrictive measures to slow the outbreak, as world health experts suggest. ”This wave of panic and hysteria is bigger than the virus itself,” he said on a Facebook Live broadcast.

But Mr. Bolsonaro did lobby on Thursday for a subsidy for Brazil's poorest that was passed by the lower chamber of Congress later in the day. The subsidy is meant for informal workers and small business people and amounts to 600 reais ($119.46) per month for three months. The bill still requires Senate approval.

The amount was a significant increase over previous versions of the bill. The executive had initially pushed for only 200 reais before Mr. Bolsonaro modified his proposal.

Earlier on Thursday, in a public letter, Brazil's governors argued that the federal government had not done enough to fund the fight against the virus that has infected about half a million people globally.

Confirmed cases in Brazil had roughly doubled in four days to 2,915 on Thursday, according to the health ministry, with 78 dead from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus.

In the state of Rio de Janeiro, which relies on dwindling oil tax revenue to keep public services running, Governor Wilson Witzel said he may have to loosen an order closing businesses if the federal government does not offer aid.

“The people will only accept confinement if they're able to eat. Business leaders will only pause activity if they have conditions for financing,” Mr. Witzel told Reuters. “I can't ask people to go hungry.”

The governors' letter listed eight proposed measures for Mr. Bolsonaro to take, such as suspending state payments to the federal government and helping states buy medical equipment.

Brazil's economy minister Paulo Guedes, a pro market economist who generally opposes government subsidies, tested negative for coronavirus, the ministry said on Thursday.

Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria, who campaigned alongside Mr. Bolsonaro in 2018 but has become one of his chief critics during the public health crisis, said he expected to see concrete federal aid measures implemented within 72 hours.

Mr. Bolsonaro is under growing pressure over his handling of the outbreak, which he initially labeled a “fantasy” and continues to characterize as “a little flu.”

Across cities, protesters have been banging pans in almost nightly protests, and Mr. Bolsonaro's support is down in opinion polls, with Brazilians clearly favoring the governors' response.

After Mr. Bolsonaro blasted some governors on Wednesday for the ”crime” of shutting down businesses amid the outbreak, he undermined their efforts with a decree on Thursday exempting churches from closure orders, heeding requests from evangelical leaders, an important constituency for the president.

In Sao Paulo, the country's most populous state, which has been most stricken by the epidemic, Doria recommended that churches close their doors for 60 days.

27,2020/03/27,"Coronavirus | China reports one local COVID-19 case, 54 imported; cuts international flights","The total number of infections for mainland China now stands at 81,340, according to the country’s health commission.

Mainland China reported its first locally transmitted coronavirus infection in three days and 54 new imported cases, as Beijing ordered airlines to sharply cut international flights fearing travellers could reignite the coronavirus outbreak.

The 55 new cases reported on Thursday was down from 67 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said in a statement on Friday. There are now 81,340 confirmed cases in mainland China.

The death toll stands at 3,292 with five new deaths.

Imported coronavirus cases, mostly Chinese nationals returning home, now pose the biggest concern for authorities.

Shanghai reported the most new imported cases with 17, followed by 12 in Guangdong and four each in capital Beijing and nearby Tianjin.

Hubei province, a region of some 60 million people where the virus first appeared late last year, reported zero new cases on Thursday - a day after lifting a lockdown and reopening its borders as the epidemic there eased.

China on Thursday ordered local airlines to maintain only one route to any country and limit flights per such routes to one per week, effective March 29. Foreign airlines have also been ordered to cut routes to China to one and limit flights to one per week, although many had already stopped flying to China.

China will temporarily suspend the entry of foreigners with valid Chinese visas and residence permits starting on March 28, as an interim measure, the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/o8usnu/article31178495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKAPTOPIXVIRUSOUTBREAKCHINA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mainland-china-reports-first-local-coronavirus-transmission-in-3-days/article31178496.ece
28,2020/03/27,"Coronavirus | US tops world in COVID-19 cases, overtaking China and Italy","At least 1,178 people have died of COVID-19 in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University.

The United States on Thursday took the grim title of the country with the most coronavirus infections and reported a record surge in unemployment as world leaders vowed $5 trillion to stave off global economic collapse.

More than 5,00,000 people around the world have now contracted the new coronavirus, overwhelming healthcare systems even in wealthy nations and triggering an avalanche of government-ordered lockdowns that have disrupted life for billions.

In the United States, more than 82,000 people have tested positive for COVID-19, edging out Italy, which has reported the most deaths, and China, where the virus was first detected in December in the metropolis of Wuhan.

With fears mounting of a global recession if not depression, leaders from the Group of 20 major economies held crisis talks by video link Thursday, pledging a “united front” to fight the outbreak — along with an enormous financial injection.

“The virus respects no borders,” the leaders said in a statement. “We are injecting over $5 trillion into the global economy, as part of targeted fiscal policy, economic measures, and guarantee schemes to counteract the social, economic and financial impacts of the pandemic.”

They also pledged “robust” support for developing nations, where coronavirus could next take hold after ravaging China and then Europe.

But the unity pledged by the G20 has been in short supply with China and the United States trading barbs over their handling of the coronavirus crisis.

And Italy as well as Spain, which has the second-highest death toll, objected to a draft economic plan by the European Union which they saw as too weak.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte wants a “strong and sufficient” financial response that deploys “innovative financial instruments truly adapted to a war,” his office said.

Record one-day toll in France

Alarmed by the rapid spread of the sickness in Italy, France has taken aggressive action to stem the virus and went under lockdown on March 17.

But the 365 deaths reported Thursday was its highest in a one-day period and, alarmingly, included a 16-year-old girl — a rare case of a young person succumbing to a virus that has devastated the elderly.

“It is very difficult to estimate when the peak will come,” French health official Jerome Salomon said. “People who are ill now were infected before the confinement began.”

“Now there is less contact, people are going out less and get infected less. So we hope there will be fewer people getting sick next week and fewer people going to hospital,” he told reporters.

With hospitals under severe strain, medical workers in Italy and Spain are making painstaking choices.

“If I've got five patients and only one bed, I have to choose who gets it,” Sara Chinchilla, a pediatrician at a hospital near Madrid, told AFP. “People are dying who could be saved but there's no space in intensive care.”

In Britain, the National Health Service said London's hospitals are facing a “continuous tsunami” of seriously ill COVID-19 patients, despite a lockdown imposed this week.

And in New York, the virus hotbed in the United States, authorities hope to stem the growth of infections as the city needs to more than double the number of available hospital beds.

“Almost any scenario that is realistic will overwhelm the capacity of the current healthcare system,” Governor Andrew Cuomo warned.

Economic devastation

The pandemic has already, and rapidly, been catastrophic to the global economy.

In the United States, the world's largest economy, the Labor Department reported that 3.3 million people applied for unemployment benefits last week — by far the highest number ever recorded.

Job losses have swept across sectors from food services to retail to transportation as nearly half of the country has closed to “non-essential” businesses.

“It is staggering. We are only seeing the initial numbers; they will get worse, unfortunately,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters, estimating that half a million people in the city would lose work.

But Wall Street soared for a third straight day, recouping more of this month's hefty losses, on expectations for the largest stimulus in U.S. history.

The Senate early Thursday unanimously passed a $2 trillion package that will provide cash payouts averaging $3,400 for a family of four.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi voiced confidence that the House of Representatives would follow suit on Friday.

President Donald Trump, who has been hoping that a strong economy would win him re-election in November, has been one of the few U.S. leaders to seek a quick return to normal.

Priests at risk

The global lockdown — which also hemmed in India's huge population this week — tightened further on Thursday as Russia announced it was grounding all international flights, while Moscow's mayor ordered the closure of cafes, shops and parks.

Tokyo's millions of citizens have been told to stay home, too, just days after the city was forced to postpone the 2020 Olympic Games for a year.

China said it was barring entry to most foreigners, fearing that imported cases were undermining its success in bringing domestic transmissions way down.

And South Africa braced for a nationwide lockdown as its cases climbed to more than 900 — about a third of Africa's 2,975 cases.

The impact of the virus has stretched well beyond frontline health workers, with billions trapped in their homes and facing what experts say could be lasting psychological harm.

In virus-stricken Italy, clergy members have been among the worst affected. Out of Italy's more than 7,500 deaths, 67 have been priests.

But offering a glimmer of hope, both Italy and Spain have seen lower daily rates of new infections this week.

The World Health Organization called Italy's numbers “encouraging signs” but warned it was “still too early to say whether the pandemic is peaking.”

29,2020/03/27,Sri Lanka frees soldier who killed 8 Tamils,"In 2015, Staff Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake was convicted for the killings in Mirusuvil, Jaffna Peninsula, and sentenced to death.

Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Thursday pardoned and released an Army man who was on death row for killing eight Tamil civilians, including a five-year-old and two teenagers, in 2000 during the civil war.

“The President has instructed the Ministry of Justice to release Sgt Ratnayake from prison,” a spokeswoman at the Presidential Media Division said.

In 2015, Staff Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake was convicted for the killings in Mirusuvil, Jaffna Peninsula, and sentenced to death.

In 2019, the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence.

TNA condemns pardon of murder convict

The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), Sri Lanka’s main party representing Tamils of the north and east, condemned President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s decision to pardon and release the Army officer.

“If true, we condemn the opportunistic action of Prez @GotabayaR under guise of dealing with the issue of prisoners at a time like this. This is one case in which a person was actually convicted. Other cases weren’t even prosecuted or were acquitted,” the TNA tweeted.

Sri Lanka has been on a near-total lockdown and enforced curfew for a week now, with a total of 104 COVID-19 patients reported so far.

In 2015, Staff Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake was tried before a three-member bench at the Colombo High Court. He was convicted for the murder in Mirusuvil, Jaffna Peninsula, and sentenced to death. In 2019, the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and the sentence.

Rare instance

The case is widely cited as a rare instance of accountability, amid lingering concerns over impunity for war-crimes committed during Sri Lanka's three-decade civil war.

Issuing a statement, rights watchdog Amnesty International said using the pandemic as an opportunity to release those convicted for heinous crimes is reprehensible. “Victims have a right to justice, and Sri Lanka has an obligation to ensure that justice is done.

Semblance of justice

After many long years, the victims of the Mirusuvil massacre from 2000 finally got a semblance of justice in 2015. It is despicable to have that justice reversed through an arbitrary executive decision,” Amnesty regional director Biraj Patnaik said.

Asked to comment on the Presidential pardon, Nimal Siripala de Silva, Minister of Justice, Human Rights and Legal Reforms, said a report had been called from his Ministry. “The final decision is with the President. He can overrule anything. He has the absolute power to grant pardon, no one can question him,” he told The Hindu, adding that the constitutionally mandated procedure for the pardon was followed.

M.A. Sumanthiran, former Jaffna MP and a senior lawyer, said the executive pardon in the “rarest of rare cases” that ended in a conviction confirms that the Sri Lankan state “will never” exercise accountability for war-time atrocities.

“All the institutions of the state will eventually conspire together and let the offenders go free,” he told The Hindu.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/irlma0/article31177306.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Gotabaya,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-frees-soldier-who-killed-8-tamils/article31177308.ece
30,2020/03/27,"Angelina Jolie donates $1 million to feed underprivileged kids, in wake of coronavirus pandemic","Actor works with the charity No Kid Hungry to feed low-income children and their families

Actress Angelina Jolie has donated $1 million as an effort to feed underprivileged children whose access to school lunches has been cut off due to closures amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

She has given $1 million to the charity No Kid Hungry, which says it has so far spread $2 million across 30 states to feed low-income children and their families, reports dailymail.co.uk.

“As of this week, over a billion children are out of school worldwide because of closures linked to coronavirus,” said Jolie, 44.

“Many children depend on the care and nutrition they receive during school hours, including nearly 22 million children in America who rely on food support. No Kid Hungry is making resolute efforts to reach as many of those children as possible,” added the actress, known for her philanthropy.

She has worked extensively with the United Nations and co-wrote a Time essay promoting UNESCO’s new Global Education Coalition, which seeks to facilitate remote education as schools close around the world.

In 2006, the star and her former husband Brad Pitt started their own charity named after their eldest son Maddox, 18, and focused on his native Cambodia. The organisation keeps 10 schools running in Cambodia. Jolie separately funds girls’ schools in Afghanistan and Kenya.

31,2020/03/27,Web-series ‘Hunters’ is a bit too risky in a world full of Holocaust conspiracy theorists,"Is the pleasure of watching Al Pacino pull off complicated Yiddish phrases worth it?

You’re a real-life Jew-perhero now,” goes a line from Amazon Prime Video’s Hunters, the alternative history thriller series that premiered last month — it’s a significant line for a show that directly references superhero comics in nearly every episode. In a way, it betrays both the strengths and the weaknesses of the story; it has the raw energy of a comic-book adventure, but at crucial moments, its style seems dissonant with the truly horrific Holocaust accounts it presents.

The premise is simple (even if its plot fluctuations are not): in 1977, a group of New York-based Jews assemble and form a Nazi-hunting team, dedicated to capturing and killing the proverbial wolf in sheep’s clothing — former Nazis living in the U.S. under new identities. The team is led by the super-rich, super-resourceful Meyer Offerman, played by Al Pacino (the iconic actor’s first appearance in a series since HBO’s Angels in America in 2003). Other notable members include moviestar and master of disguise Lonny Flash, played by the perfectly cast Josh Radnor (better known as Ted from How I Met Your Mother), plus Saul Rubinek and Carol Kane teaming up to play Murray and Mindy Markowitz, the team’s middle-aged electronics and signals experts, respectively.

Too much flair

All the actors turn in fine performances, with Pacino and Radnor leading the way. Hunters is also well served by its crew: the action scenes are superbly shot, the Holocaust flashback set pieces crafted with more than a touch of flair. Indeed, some would say too much flair at times: the first episode has a scene with a fictional SS officer playing on a giant chessboard with human pieces — if the piece dies, the person dies as well. Apart from this one off-putting scene (which for some reason channelises medieval monarchs) the flashbacks are, as a rule, very effective indeed.

Hunters is part of a well-documented tradition in British/ American books, movies and television — ‘what if’ stories involving World War II and the Nazi regime. Philip Roth’s masterful novel The Plot Against America, Quentin Tarantino’s 2009 film Inglourious Basterds and Amazon Prime’s own previous show The Man in the High Castle (based on Philip K. Dick’s novel of the same name) — all were very well-received by both audiences and critics.

What gives, then, with Hunters? Why did Stephen D. Smith, Director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, condemn the show, demanding that Amazon cancel it? Smith’s argument is simple, and I must say, quite iron-clad: a show like Hunters, which plays fast and loose with history, is simply too much of a risk in a world where holocaust conspiracy theorists are still legion (“its pernicious blend of fact and fiction risks being weaponised by Holocaust deniers”). In some places, the show’s writers present real personalities like Simon Wiesenthal (Judd Hirsch) with a remarkable degree of historical accuracy. But in other places, well, human chessboards abound.

Smith writes: “The problem is the premise. Survivors of the Shoah sought justice, not revenge. Not so in Hunters. The series’ specious spectacle of eye-for-eye justice (a term one of the ‘Hunters’ uses verbatim in the fifth episode) collapses all meaningful differences between victim and perpetrator.”

And that, really, is the kicker: in a world rampant with ‘both-sideism’, do we really want to provide additional fodder to bad-faith commentators, trolls looking to downplay (or worse, outright deny) one of the darkest chapters in human history?

Is the pleasure of watching Pacino pull off complicated Yiddish phrases worth it? I’d say no — but the ball is in Amazon’s court.

32,2020/03/27,COVID-19: Radio jockeys with private FM stations in Kerala are working from home during lockdown,"Live calls cannot be taken, so the jockeys interact with listeners through their official or personal social media handles

“I am speaking to you from the attic and I hope my words are reaching all of you staying safe at home,” announces RJ Joseph Annamkutty Jose from his home at Karukutty, near Angamaly.

While some FM stations in Kerala have minimised operations from office with few RJs coming in, presenters in Red FM, Big FM, Radio Mirchi and Radio Mango have completely moved to work-from-home mode in view of the current lockdown to contain the spread of Coronavirus.

“All five RJs of our station have been provided with the equipment to set up a radio booth at our homes. Although a basic frame to play the songs has been put in by our scheduler, our RJs can change the song using their phone, if needed, or can make suggestions,” says Firoz A Azeez, RJ and programming head, Big FM – Kerala.

Listeners have been informed that their favourite RJs are working from home, so live calls cannot be taken. Instead, the jockeys interact with listeners through their official or personal social media handles. “They can send us messages to our official WhatsApp number or Facebook page. Technical snags might be there, but we are looking at the brighter side. Although we had the option to play songs back- to-back we want to work this way to keep the listeners engaged,” says Parvathy Nair, senior programming head, Red FM-Thiruvananthapuram. Some of them post videos about how they record their shows at home as well.

On air, from home A software has been installed on their laptops in place of the studio equipment. The arrangement is such that recordings on their phones are transferred to the laptop and edited using the software before they are sent to the music scheduler/manager who plays the song. In some stations the schedulers too are working from their homes.

The content has been revised without games and comedy capsules. RJs have been directed to be sunny and positive instead of concentrating on the downside of the outbreak. So they give pointers about social and physical distancing, as well as remind people about precautions to be taken. “We give information about how many people have recovered after testing positive for COVID-19, air their bytes and get brief interviews from ministers, health experts and celebrities on how to stay safe. We have tweaked the content to include topics such as ‘how to stay healthy and positive while at home’,” says Firoz.

According to Ravindran Nair, director of programmes, Radio Mango-Kerala, Association of Radio Operators for India (AROI), the official association of the private commercial radio stations in India, has formed a group with officials of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India, who disseminate information and updates related to the disease. “This information is passed down to the listeners by our RJs. We also get constant updates from the District Collectorate and the State Government. We try to keep our listeners calm and make them stay at home,” he says.

33,2020/03/27,Nintendo Direct Mini announces a wave of new games for the Switch,"Avid gamers, mark your calendars for a busy year ahead with some of Nintendo’s highly-anticipated releases, just for the Nintendo Switch

Nintendo has been having a successful couple of years, with the Nintendo Switch being one of the most favoured hand-held gaming consoles ever made. On March 26, through Nintendo Direct Mini (a live video presentation by Nintendo) shined the spotlight on a breadth of different types of games launching for the Nintendo Switch system in 2020.

Big numbers Though the Nintendo Switch launched four years after the first launch of Xbox One in 2013, the Switch managed to surpass Xbox One in sales. As of late January 2020, the 50 million Nintendo Switch devices were sold internationally. Clearly, the Japanese gaming company is having its time in the sun. Financial datasets from Nintendo reveals that between March 2018 and March 2019, net sales were valued at US$11,070,000,000 and forecasts predict a steady increase for March 2020.

According to Nick Chavez, Nintendo of America’s Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, “In addition to Nintendo franchises, 2020 will see the Nintendo Switch library grow even more with strong support from a diverse field of publishing partners like 2K, Electronic Arts and Square Enix.”

What’s available?

Games featured in the video include sprawling role-playing adventures like Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition and Bravely Default II. Plus, classic franchises like Borderlands, XCOM 2 and BioShock coming to a Nintendo system for the first time. For the sake of nostalgia, one can look forward to remakes of fan favorites like Burnout Paradise Remastered and Panzer Dragoon: Remake. Titles perfect for both casual and longtime gamers include Good Job!, Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics and Animal Crossing: New Horizons (which is already available, but there is a seasonal Easter event and Earth day special with an update).

Marvel gaming fans can get their hands on a third expansion pack, Shadow Of Doom, for Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order. The add-on sees Doctor Doom versus Marvel’s first family, Fantastic Four. The Fantastic Four and Doctor Doom are now playable characters as they fight through a new story campaign.

Sold out internationally, Ring Bit Adventure has been wildly popular — especially during the COVID-19 lockdown for its approach to fitness. Nintendo Direct Mini announced a new Rhythm Game mode, an option to switch to a female voice and to change the language of the in-game voice, and more. In the Rhythm Game mode, move to the beat of a dozen music tracks from Ring Fit Adventure and a few tracks from popular Nintendo games, including Super Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 2 and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

The announcement comes at a time when the country is going through a 21-day lockdown to contain the spread of COVID 19.

The original telecast

The 74-episode Ramayana was telecast from 25 January 1987 to 31 July 1988 and the 90-episode Mahabharata from 2 October 1988 to 24 June 1990.

“DD was already in talks for reacquisition of iconic serials several weeks prior to this situation. That process will continue. Right now, the lockdown being the priority, the content has been shared in national interest,” a senior Prasar Bharati official said.

35,2020/03/27,Here’s how bakers and dancers are keeping people engaged through social media during lockdown,"Dance, bake, workout and enjoy your time at home as more and more courses are available online

Usually, Faiz Begum’s schedule is packed with high energy workouts at her fitness studio where she conducts Zumba, Tabata and Zaco. Now the lockdown of the State left her with a lot of free time. Like a lot of us out there, all Faiz did was receive and read worrisome news about the virus and the death toll. “It started taking a toll on my mental health and I realised that there were a lot of people like me who weren't used to staying at home. So I started with instagram workout sessions where I conducted classes by going live on my handle,” she says.

These days she looks forward to these classes that she conducts in the mornings and afternoons. “I have made a schedule of nine exercises that are to be done in three rounds. I have designed these routines keeping in mind that people are home and have limited space,” adds the Visakhapatnam-based trainer.

Faiz has been a fitness trainer for over a decade now. However, this is the first time that she has moved her classes online. “It is new and it is fun as there are no geographical boundaries when it comes to online classes.” But she admits that this cannot be a long time option. “As an instructor my job is not just to teach workout routines but also to work on the individual posture and movements of my clients That is not possible when the classes are conducted virtually.”

While Instagram came to Faiz’s aid, Ramya Adimulam, a wellness coach who runs the gym Fitness Edge has been encouraging her students through WhatsApp. “ We have a group with gym members added in it. I post a new workout routine every day. Since people can no longer step out for gyms they can use these routines to keep themselves healthy,” she explains.

Social distancing has helped Ramya discover her love for yoga. “I spend at least one hour in the morning doing yoga along with my kids. Including kids is important as they too get affected by being confined to the house,” she says. She posts most of these videos of her workout on her Instagram and encourages people to do the same.

Wake and Bake

Twenty-four year old Divya Gopal is busy putting together recipes of ‘Quarantine snacks’. A medicine student, Divya is using her time at home to conduct baking classes online. “I took to baking two years ago. This summer I had planned to conduct baking classes. However, with social distancing, I had to cancel them. But I wanted to help people get their minds off the difficult times. So I decided to start the classes online. Till now I have conducted two live sessions on Instagram and they have been quite successful,” she says.

In the upcoming sessions of ‘Quarantine snacks’ she will share recipes that are quick and contain no maida or white sugar. “The session will include chocolate muffins and fudge which are comparatively easy and quick to make. I will also make jeera cookies that people can enjoy during their tea time,” she adds.

Divya, who runs the handle @sweet_toothhhh tweaked her recipes to make them as simple as possible. “ I am aware that people may not have all the ingredients in abundance at home so I am putting out only those recipes that can be made from basic ingredients.”

Dancing alone together

Always wanted to learn the perfect moves, but were too shy or too busy to go for a dance class? Then you are in for some good news, as dance studios in the city are conducting free online classes.

After Sharat Pirates was forced to shut the doors of his dance studio- Broadway Dance Academy to keep his students safe, he decided to keep them active by conducting classes online. Now, every alternate day, he goes live on his facebook page (Sharat Pirates). “ It is not just a dance class but a dance-based class where people are also taught fitness regimes. I try to keep my steps simple and easy to follow as I have no idea who my audience is,” he says.

Interestingly, Sharat himself learns through online conference classes. “Online classes have been around for a while now, it is just that they are discovering their potential now,” he adds.

Since he does not have to physically visit his dance classes, Sharat is enjoying his free time home. “I have dogs at home, so now I spend more time with them. I am also working on myself and learning more styles of dance online.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/maiaws/article31184561.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BAKING,https://www.thehindu.com/society/heres-how-bakers-and-dancers-are-keeping-people-engaged-during-the-lockdown/article31184563.ece
36,2020/03/27,Quarantine tales: Who fed the dogs out?,"The lockdown has shut down restaurants and pushcart vendors that were a source of food for many strays. Luckily, the feeders are still doing their jobs providing meals for dogs in and around their locality, some of them armed with passes

Gandhinagar’s furry four-legged inhabitants can recognise this two-wheeler from miles away. After all, this is their regular buffet-on-wheels service. Every morning at 4.45 am, Radhika Kasturirangan loads her scooter with two big buckets of food and takes it for the strays around her locality. Ever since the Government called for a 21-day lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19, her radius has extended to include areas towards Kotturpuram. “Now that the roads are empty I feed them at 5.30 in the evening,” says Radhika, who has been at this for the last 15 years. She feeds 70 dogs regularly, but given the current situation and with a number of restaurants and push carts shut, she says that around 20-25 new dogs have joined the party.

It’s not just food, sometimes finding water too becomes a task for these animals. “Today I noticed a water bowl was empty outside one of the shops and there were a few animals around, looking expectantly at it. I filled it. The staff used to fill it everyday for the animals on the roads but they are on leave now,” she says.

Latha Thampy, coordinator of People For Animals in Thiruvananthapuram also urges people to set out water for their neighbourhood's community dogs and cats. She says, “Since it is summer, water is a must for all animals. Dry food, especially pet food makes them thirstier. So I cooked rice and fish waste that I got from Palayalam market to feed the dogs.”

When the stay-at-home orders were first implemented, a few 'feeders' were uncertain about what it meant in terms of going about their usual routines. Some were apprehensive after watching videos of food delivery executives being beaten up by a few cops in other cities. Fortunately a recent statement issued by the Animal Welfare Board of India on Monday, helped clarify the rules: It states that “feed and fodder for large animals and food for companion and stray animals is an essential service and maybe kept operational during lockdowns.” To help aid better facilitation, Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) and animal rights activist, on Twitter announced the availability of 100 passes for feeders per district.

“This pass helps in case the police or anyone stops you,” says 23-year-old Anoushka Mehta, who, three days back, got into trouble with her neighbours, despite social distancing and being out alone, for feeding her regular pooches on the streets. “This is an essential service,” she reiterates, adding, “I also get the dogs neutered, and feeding them means they are more manageable. Some people don’t understand that.” The Delhi-based dentist has been feeding dogs in her locality in Lajpat Nagar as well as in Faridabad where she went to college. “Now that we are under lockdown, I managed to source 100 kilograms of dog food with the help of generous people on social media. I’ve delivered it to my college — shut for now —where the watchman on duty feeds the dogs on campus and around.” Anoushka gets chicken and rice cooked at home for 150 dogs in her neighbourhood.

Dinesh Baba, who started Cloud No 9 Kennel and Nursing Care in Chennai says, “While it is important to feed animals, it is also imperative to follow social distancing.” He advises going out alone rather than taking to the streets in a group and defeating the purpose of a lockdown. He also suggests cooking a little extra if possible and leaving the excess food outside the house so animals can help themselves to it. Strays in residential areas will somehow get a meal, he believes. His concern is dogs who live in non-residential areas like highways and railway stations.

Dinesh and his jeep — laden with a big degchi full of rice and dal or chicken or eggs — are a familiar sight on the stretch that runs from Injambakkam to Porur. That is the feeding ground for nearly 300 wagging tails that await him. He also has a few vegetables to feed the cows that amble along.

Dinesh says the Chennai police have been cooperative, as long as he travels alone. “They are, in fact passionate towards animal and point you to a few more hungry ones,” he says. Meanwhile in Thiruvananthapuram, a few volunteers, despite possessing I-cards issued by FIAPO (Federation of Indian Animals Protection Organisation), faced problems in a few places. Since Tuesday, activists of People for Animals (PFA), Street Dog Watch (SDW) and FIAPO have been out in the streets to feed stray dogs.

“I put up a post on Facebook and exhorted people to give ₹10 to feed a dog. It elicited a good response and I bought biscuits with that money,"" says Parvathy Mohan, coordinator of FIAPO, adding that she managed to feed about 300 dogs with the money.

37,2020/03/27,"In Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram’s WFH population is still getting used to the concept","As many in Thiruvananthapuram get familiar with working from home during the coronavirus lockdown, they talk about its pros and cons

In his 23-year-old career, R Jayaram, an Under Secretary with the General Administration Department, Government of Kerala, in Thiruvananthapuram is working from home (WFH) for the very first time. He is not alone. Employees in different fields are experiencing what it is like to share their home with their workspace.

Until now WFH was considered a privilege that was available only to a few in the IT sector and a handful of others whose work allowed them the ‘luxury’ of choosing to work from home. However, since the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, people in the city have begun comparing notes about WFH. Opinions are as divided, even as a new work culture is being shaped.

WFH boon

While a colleague writes a verse in praise of “office is heaven”, there are others talking of the benefits of WFH. “In fact, many are following posts on social media that are giving out tips on how to efficiently work from home,” says Nipun Varma, offshore delivery manager with an MNC in Technopark.

Although some of them admit that they miss the coffee breaks, gossip and banter, many who are parents, especially those with school-going children or infants, are happy with the advantages. Since all schools, crèches, and day care centres have closed, the WFH has come as a boon for hard-pressed parents.

“My five-year-old son often knocks at my door since he knows I am around and even picks up some of the calls if I am not near my phone! But I am able to save the time driving from my home at Vattiyoorkavu to Technopark, 18 km away,” says Neethu Rajagopal, a systems analyst with an MNC.

For teachers like Remya Krishna, a CUEMATH teacher, it was all about adapting to a new system to ensure that her students did not miss out on their lessons. “My students are excited about doing digital workbooks on laptops or desktops. They finish the assignments faster than before and I am able to give realtime feedback as well. We have two classes of one-hour duration each every week and it is the younger kids who look forward to this than those in higher classes,” she says.

What does 46-year-old Jayaram think about it? “I handle a section where I have to verify several documents before preparing the final report. This takes at least an hour in certain cases. It becomes difficult to concentrate when you are in office because of the inflow ofvisitors, meetings or outdoor work, whereas there is nobody to disturb me at home,” saysJayaram.

WFH? Not a fan

A Central government employee in an R&D organisation, however, feels that virtual meetings and online classes for engineering students are not the same as face-to-face interactions and working from office.

Techie Priya Sankar, who has worked from home in the US, points out that things can be stressful as the team is not working at the same place. “Work-related interactions and discussions happen over phone or chats and it is time-consuming. I find that I end up taking more time to finish my work,” she says.

EXPERTS SPEAK

Entrepreneur Minu Mary Mathew has been working from home ever since she quit her job in the retail industry five years ago. She gives a few pointers on how to make the arrangement work.

* Maintain a morning routine.

* Dress like you would go to work and be presentable on your video calls.

* Get a work spot at home and don’t snuggle up on the bed or the couch.

* Speak to your family about work time and break time. Take breaks and get exercise.

* Stay hydrated and air out rooms and windows to feel fresh.

* Catch up with colleagues on video calls to stay connected and informed.

* Since you save time you'd otherwise spend on commuting to work, utilise that by enrolling for online courses and workshops, or engage in a hobby/art project.

Ayyappan Nair, scientist with a company in the United States, started working from home nearly four years ago. “I have never worked from home before that and it was difficult for me to adjust in the beginning. But it changed my life. In my case I am free during the day and that’s when I involve myself in hobbies and outdoor activities. Before the lockdown was announced, I used to go cycling. I get my calls between 6 pm and 4 am and they are not random calls but those that have been planned a week in advance.

* The most important tip for anyone working from home is that one has to be disciplined, both in your work and lifestyle.

* Watch out for distractions when you are with family.

* Avoid the temptation to snack or watch television.

* Interact more with your family and community in your leisure time. Follow your passion or hobby, if possible.

* Since you don’t commute to office, make use of that time to exercise. That will make life better.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/120kqz/article31183923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27TVMWORK,https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-thiruvananthapuram-in-kerala-is-getting-used-to-the-work-from-home-concept/article31183924.ece
38,2020/03/27,No laughing matter,"Is it time to develop a healthy sense of humour about our traditions, culture and glorious past?

“When we were wishing each other with a namaste – they laughed. When we were washing our hands and legs before entering our homes – they laughed again. When we followed a pure vegetarian diet – they laughed at that, too. When we were doing yoga – yes, you guessed right, they laughed. When we were burning our dead, ditto. And when we bathed after attending a funeral – heck, they laughed uproariously. And, finally, now that the world is suffering, we, deservedly, as was expected, as we always do in the end, are the ones ROFLing.”

When I got this message on WhatsApp for the 32nd time, I had no choice but to respond. The lucky winner was my childhood friend from Seattle, Shanks Shankaran, CEO (laid off) of Thillana Tech.

‘Who, da?’ I texted him.

‘What do you mean ‘who’?’ responded Shanks.

‘Who laughed? When we were doing these fantastic things, like namaste, yoga, being vegetarian, and having post-funeral baths with ancient Liril soap under a gurgling waterfall like a pre-vedic Karen Lunel, which fool was laughing? Please let me know. I want to write him a stiff letter.’

Shanks sent one smiley with dark glasses, one smiley with tears and two brown-skinned thumbs-ups as a response.

‘I don’t get it, da,’ I texted. ‘Please elaborate. I want to set them straight. Do you mean the Mughals? Were they the culprits, eating large plates of biryani with onion raita and laughing inappropriately at us while we ate keerai vadai? Was it the Brits, then? Their stiff upper lips quivering with vulgar mirth? Or was it aliens from Rahu–Ketu? Who was laughing at us?’

‘All of them. Except the aliens. That’s plain stupid,’ he replied.

‘So you think we shouldn’t be made fun of?’ I said.

‘Yes. How dare they?’

‘Who isn’t made fun of? Everyone is,’ I said.

I got a shrug emoji. A second or two later, inexplicably, two balloon ones.

‘Are you saying other great civilisations like Greece and Egypt weren’t made fun of?’ I persisted. ‘You think satire and mockery were invented by the Mughals and Brits for the sole purpose of demeaning our unsulliable culture alone? And ours is the greatest, fabbest, coolest, cleverest, uniquest culture that just can’t be lampooned?’

Shanks sent me four emojis. The first three were of the middle finger. The last one was an anthropomorphic representation of what we refer to as asingam in our culture.

I went on: ‘Tell me, do you think ancient Greek, Egyptian, Arab, Mesopotamian, Roman and the myriad Native American cultures, to name a few, didn’t have a whit of common sense or wisdom?’

‘What’s your point?’ said my friend. Between ‘your’ and ‘point’ was a word no one in our ancient culture would have used.

‘Listen, no one is making any more fun of us than they are of anyone else. We aren’t that special.’

My friend sent me instructions that, were I to follow, would involve a corkscrew, industrial glue and a couple of double-strength rubber bands. And a specific part (or two) of my anatomy that one doesn’t discuss in polite company.

‘One more thing, Shanks,’ I texted. ‘Today, we may be buying up masks, sending heart emojis to our cooks or hiding petrified under our beds. But we aren’t LMAOing, ROFLing, or even LOLing, trust me. No one is. Not us. Not them. Not you. The only one laughing like Surpanakha is Covid-19. Hope you’ve stocked up on the toilet paper.’

39,2020/03/27,The effect of Coronavirus lockdown on dogs in Coimbatore,"The Humane Animal Society and the people from The Pawsome People Project say Coimbatoreans have been largely compassionate towards dogs, both pets and those on the streets

A friend calls frantically. “They say pets will transmit the coronavirus. What do I do about my dogs?” Mini Vasudevan, co-founder of Coimbatore’s Humane Animal Society (HAS), sighs, “It’s 100% false but there’s so much misinformation going around.” Admitting that people, including her staff, were getting scared, she says, “We are working on overcoming that by disseminating correct information.”

HAS is also dealing with panicked calls from people wanting to give up pets. “I haven’t heard of any actual cases of abandonment,” says Mini cautiously. “But there have been calls asking if they can drop off the pets at the shelter. Some threaten to abandon the dogs if we don’t take them in but so far we’ve managed to convince them. For now we’ve closed our out-patient dispensary.”

Megha Jose of The Pawsome People Project | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Megha Jose, founder of The Pawsome People Project, agrees that people are not abandoning pets in the city but “we’ve got calls regarding pets stuck in cages and not being fed. We’re trying to get to those dogs and feed them as the owner can’t reach them.” Speaking of which, Mini brings up pet shops where the animals are kept in tiny cages behind closed doors. “The only agency that can take action is the SPCA and we don’t have one in Coimbatore. I shudder to think of what’s happening behind those closed doors.”

Ahalya Chinnaraj with a street dog | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Pet owners who are not falling for the fear mongering are coping, says Ahalya Chinnaraj, who owns 14 rescued dogs. She takes them for a walk down her street late at night when no one is around. “And wash them down once we’re home.” The bigger problem, according to her, is feeding the street dogs. “Some families, including ours, in Sivananda Colony, Tatabad, would leave food before our houses. Suddenly we’re noticing that there are more dogs.” Megha has an explanation for this. “A few of our volunteers stepped out to feed street dogs and we noticed that they had moved from their original spots. This is probably because they were moving in search of food.”

Ahalya is grateful to a veterinary clinic that donated some bags of commercial dog food. “We’re keeping that for the street dogs. But even for our dogs we’d only stocked up for around a week to 10 days. We didn’t expect a three-week lockdown.”

All three make the same point: street dogs usually congregated around meat stalls or small tea shops or restaurants and found a meal there. But now with all these closed, the dogs are struggling. “In some areas, dogs are howling and crying for food and rummaging through trash cans,” says Megha. “So we’re trying to cover as many areas as possible through our volunteers and feed them. We have appealed to people through our social media handles to feed as many dogs as possible.”

Megha says The Pawsome People Project volunteers have not been stopped in any way — “what’s nice is that the cops in the city are letting us do this and we’ve faced no issues so far”. Ahalya, who is in touch with other volunteers, says they haven’t faced any trouble either. However, Mini has another tale to tell. “Our staff coming to work were stopped. Even when they tried explaining that the veterinary sector comes under the exempt category, they wouldn’t let them go. Even our ambulance was stopped. The police are not accepting our identity cards, so we’re now creating letters with photos for all our staff on the official letterhead. People who are enforcing the law need to be clear about what they are enforcing.”

Megha, Mini and Ahalya also emphasise that these are early days but they have a lot of faith in the people of Coimbatore. “Those who feed these dogs regularly will manage,”says Ahalya, while Mini narrates a story of someone who created a feeder and a water trough for dogs. “Our people are very kind, they will help,” she says confidently.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/ar2k1i/article31181258.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/STREETDOGS,https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-are-pets-and-street-dogs-in-coimbatore-coping-during-lockdown/article31181259.ece
40,2020/03/27,World is now in recession: IMF,"Virus-hit developing nations need dollops of funding

The COVID-19 pandemic has driven the global economy into a downturn that will require massive funding to help developing nations, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said Friday.

“It is clear that we have entered a recession” that will be worse than the one in 2009, following the global financial crisis, she said.

Also read: How can India contain the economic impact of COVID-19?

With the worldwide economic “sudden stop,” Ms. Georgieva said the fund’s estimate “for the overall financial needs of emerging markets is $2.5 trillion.”

But she warned the estimate “is on the lower end.”

Governments in emerging markets, which have suffered an exodus of capital of more than $83 billion in recent weeks, can cover much of that, but “clearly the domestic resources are insufficient” and many already have high debt loads.

Over 80 countries, mostly with low incomes, have already requested emergency aid from the International Monetary Fund, she said.

“We do know that their own reserves and domestic resources will not be sufficient,” she said, adding the fund is aiming to beef up its response “to do more, do it better, do it faster than ever before.” She also welcomed the $2.2 trillion economic package approved by the U.S. Senate, saying “it is absolutely necessary to cushion the world’s largest economy against an abrupt drop in economic activities.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rlnjie/article29740241.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THRDKRISTALINAGEORGIEVA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/world-is-now-in-recession-imf/article31187068.ece

Ola Group and employees will contribute an initial capital of ₹20 crore to the fund. In addition to this, the company’s co-founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal will forgo salary for a year, as per a company release.

The fund aims to support auto-rickshaw, cab, kaali-peeli and taxi drivers, through contributions from the Ola group, investors and via a crowd funding platform for citizens and other institutions. The proceeds of the fund will help towards the welfare and upliftment of drivers and their families who have been affected by the restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The mobility industry has been brought to a grinding standstill during these stressed times, and the driver community has been finding it hard to pay for their family expenses without a source of income. “Ola’s initiative aims to bring together multiple stakeholders in the ecosystem such as customers, investors and partner organisations to participate in supporting millions of drivers and their families,” said Ola.

44,2020/03/27,"COVID-19: Metropolis Healthcare commits to undertake 2,000 tests a day in Mumbai, Pune","Metropolis Healthcare Ltd., a leading pathology company which has been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to conduct COVID-19 test, has committed to undertake 2,000 tests per day in Mumbai and Pune to expedite the disease handling process.

“Testing is an important way to contain the spread as we have seen in other countries like South Korea. This will help identify positive patients quickly and help reduce the spread of infection,” said Ameera Shah, managing director, Metropolis Healthcare Ltd.

“We now know that it is possible for people to spread the infection even while they display no symptoms. This is also the reason why the WHO has also been recommending widespread testing,” she added.

As an approval criteri,a the ICMR has approved labs that have NABL accreditation and have previously conducted Swine Flu testing.

The logic behind this move is that the sample collection guidelines and protocols for Swine Flu and COVID-19 are similar.

“The challenge for all laboratories in the beginning was to set up isolation units for testing samples. Because unlike Swine Flu, where vaccine is available, there is no such safe zone with Covid -19 samples. Besides that, training of technicians and preparing them for this challenge is very important,” she said.

“Our staff is already trained to collect Swine Flu Samples. Our technicians underwent rigorous training for collection of samples for COVID-19, especially the precautionary measures that are needed to ensure there is no room for infection,” she added.

Ms. Shah said the company’s lab officials are fully protected with protective gear, masks and goggles. No part of the body is exposed.

Metropolis is offering home collection of samples.

45,2020/03/27,Markets give thumbs down to RBI rate cut,"Sensex yo-yoes to settle in the red

After three successive sessions of gains, the benchmark Sensex ended in the red on Friday even as the Reserve Bank of India announced a slew of measures to boost the economy, including significant cuts in key rates.

The Sensex, that surged by more than 1,100 points during the morning session, pared all its gains and closed at 29,815.59, down 131.18 points or 0.44%.

The broader Nifty settled at 8,660.25, up by a marginal 18.80 points or 0.22%.

Market participants were of the view that investors were disappointed since the central bank refrained from making any projections related to growth or inflation thereby raising more concerns on the potential hit to the economy due to COVID-19.

“The bleak outlook from the Reserve Bank of India brought the market down as investors booked profit after three days of rise,” said Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst, Reliance Securities.

“The uncertainty will keep the markets nervous and going ahead markets would now focus more on global cues and fresh news flow of COVID-19 pandemic,” added Mr Jain.

Meanwhile, the massive cuts in key rates along with a moratorium on loans announced by the RBI pushed up the banking and financial stocks during the first half of the session before selling pressure gripped the bourses.

Stocks like Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank were among the top gainers in the morning session though some of these ended in the red as the session came to an end.

46,2020/03/27,India Inc. welcomes repo rate cut,"‘Current economy requires massive dose of monetary stimulus, RBI has done it’

The Reserve Bank’s rate cut of 75bps will bring down the cost of borrowing and the CRR cut of 100bps will help in infusing the desired liquidity requirement in the system, corporates and industry associations have said.

The three-month moratorium on EMIs will reduce the repayment pressure on the borrower during this crisis period, they felt.

“All in all, it is a very welcoming policy. The government has announced corrective measures to combat the current pandemic situation which would help in bringing financial stability into the system.” Umesh Revankar, MD & CEO, Shriram Transport Finance.

Welcoming the slew of measures announced by the RBI, Sangita Reddy, president, FICCI, said, “This has been a very comprehensive set of announcements and highlights action in all the key areas that were expected.”

Extremely fragile

“The current situation in the economy and financial markets is extremely fragile. It required a massive dose of monetary stimulus to be injected at the earliest and the RBI has done just that.”

Commenting on the rate cut Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, CII, said the substantial reduction in the CRR will help banks to reduce their lending rates and aid monetary transmission.

He said given that the current lockdown is expected to have a negative impact on the cash flows of firms, the moratorium on repayments of term loans for a period of 3 months will help companies tide over this period.

Murthy Nagarajan, head, Fixed Income, Tata Asset Management, said: “This is the RBI response to the adverse macro economic situation due to coronavirus. The RBI Governor has promised more conventional and unconventional measures, in the coming days. This may see RBI cutting rates further by 50 to 75 basis points in the current financial year,”

Gautam Hari Singhania, CMD, Raymond Ltd., said, “The moves announced by the RBI are decisive and a comprehensive package to ensure stability of financial markets.”

D.K. Aggarwal, president, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said, “These measures will provide adequate liquidity in the system, bring down the cost of capital and mitigate the impact of pandemic COVID-19.”

Rajiv Agarwal, MD & CEO, Essar Ports, said, “RBI’s move to reduce interest rates and infuse liquidity is a welcome move.

The Indian financial markets which are facing heightened volatility due to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic could stabilise with the Reserve Bank of India unveiling measures to infuse liquidity and reducing the repo rate by 75 bps to 4.4%.

“The large rate cut, the adjustment in capital conservation buffer, the moratorium on repayments and the bazooka of conventional CRR cut and unconventional liquidity measure of incentivising banks to support the CP market will all help financial markets stabilise, lead to immediate rate transmission and address the credit needs of the real economy,” SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said. Zarin Daruwala, CEO, India, Standard Chartered Bank, also said that steps taken should help financial markets tide over the current situation.

“The three-year targeted long term repo operations will decongest credit channels and lower cost of credit, providing much needed relief to corporates,” she said.

Mr. Kumar also said that the decision of allowing Indian banks to participate in non-deliverable forwards (NDF) market was a positive step in broadening market participants and better rate discovery. The action could help the rupee find support, given that it had come under pressure recently as foreign investors are exiting emerging economies, he said.

Padmaja Chunduru, MD & CEO, Indian Bank said, “It [the RBI move] is a welcome and a commendable step. It will revive growth and preserve financial stability and ensure normal functioning of financial markets.”

49,2020/03/27,"Home and auto EMIs, credit card dues deferred by three months","Regulator announces moratorium on term loan repayments

In a move to protect borrowers financially amid the nationwide lockdown, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed all banks and financial institutions, including non-banking finance companies, to extend a three-month moratorium period on the instalments due between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 for all term loans.

The relaxation is also applicable on consumer loans such as auto loans, home loans and personal loans, as well as credit card outstanding dues. A consumer may now choose not to pay the monthly equated instalments on their loans for the next three months.

“The repayment schedule for such loans, as also the residual tenor, will be shifted across the board by three months after the moratorium period,” the RBI said.

The banking regulator clarified that interest would continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loans during the moratorium period.

The credit score of the borrower will not change due to the non-payment since the loan will not be classified as ‘non-performing’ by the lender.

State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar clarified that the moratorium is applicable for all borrowers of term loans and banks would have no discretion.

He also said that a customer who wanted to continue with the EMIs for the next three months could do so.

However, it is not clear yet as to whether the customer has to apply for the moratorium on instalments or it would happen automatically. EMIs paid through the electronic clearing service are automatically debited to the customer’s account.

The RBI has also permitted the lenders to allow borrowers of working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of cash credit or overdraft, payment of interest by three months outstanding as on March 1, 2020. “The accumulated interest for the period will be paid after the expiry of the deferment period,” the RBI said.

“The three-month moratorium on all term loan instalments, along with deferment of interest on working capital, will help mitigate debt servicing burden due to COVID-19 disruption, and prevent transmission of financial stress [to] various sectors of the economy,” Punjab National Bank MD and CEO S.S.

With its current trajectory, the M&E sector is expected to cross $34 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 10%, the study projected.

While television and print retained their positions as the two largest segments, digital media overtook filmed entertainment in 2019 to become the third largest segment of the M&E sector. Digital subscription revenues more than doubled from 2018 levels and digital advertising revenues grew to command 24% of total advertising spend, as per the study.

The sector continues to grow at a rate faster than the GDP, driven primarily by growth in subscription-based business models and India’s attractiveness as a content production and post production destination.

With a population of 1.3 billion, a tele-density approaching 89% of households, 688 million internet subscribers and nearly 400 million smartphone users, India’s telecom industry is poised to become the primary platform for content distribution and consumption.

The Automotive Component Manufacturers Association also added that its members are working to ensure that no jobs are cut and salaries are paid on time for both permanent and contractual employees. Further, the industry body has also created a task force to evaluate the possibility of manufacture of face masks, hand sanitisers by its members, or import ventilators using their CSR funds.

“The auto component industry stands by the government in this hour of challenge. However, with complete stoppage of production in the vehicle industry and scarcity of working capital, the situation in the component manufacturing units, including the tier-2s and tier-3s has become quite acute, threatening their survival,” ACMA president Deepak Jain said in a statement.

“We have requested the government for helping us with immediate relaxation of borrowing norms and statutory payments, extension of moratorium on payment of principal and interest of loans for a year, among others,” he added.

ACMA has also sought relaxation in fixed electricity charge and in levy of demurrage charges for at least seven days for import cargo clearance.

Mr. Jain said auto component manufacturers, especially the tier-2 and tier-3, are facing severe hardship on the cash flow front, which if not immediately addressed will lead to insolvency of several companies. “Further, there is no clarity on how the market will pan out in the ensuing months, thus further eroding the industry’s confidence.

According to the company, both the acquisitions are subject to satisfaction of customary conditions.

NEEPCO has an operational capacity of 1.5GW, with 600 MW under construction. THDC has 1.4GW under operation, with 1.44GW of power plant capacity under construction. The acquisition will add about 3GW of operational capacity to NTPC’s existing operational capacity of 58.5 GW.

Motor third party insurance premium rates will remain unchanged for now with insurance regulator IRDAI extending validity of the existing rates beyond March 31.

All insurers shall continue to charge the rates currently being charged for the cover from April 1 onwards until further orders, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) said on Friday.

In an order, Chief General Manager (Non-Life) Yegnapriya Bharath said the validity of premium rates for Motor Third Party Liability Insurance Cover for 2019-20 stands extended beyond March 31.

What this means for vehicle owners is that a revision in the rates, primarily an increase for several category of automobiles, IRDAI had proposed for 2020-21 will not be implemented until further notice.

The rates for the third party cover, which is mandatory for all automobiles, are decided by IRDAI, while the rate for Own Damage, another key component of motor insurance, is de-tariffed or in other words insurers decide that.

The third party rates are reviewed by the regulator for every financial year, a process that kicks off with an exposure draft on the new rates in March seeking comments from the stakeholders.

While Friday’s decision of IRDAI extending validity of the rates would mean no change for now, there always is the possibility of the regulator asking insurers to recover the differential amount later from those who buy the cover in the interim.

The exposure draft, on the rates for 2020-21, had mooted an increase in the MTP premium rates for cars, two-wheelers, good carriers, buses, including school buses. The increase mooted was upwards of 5%, with only a few sub-segment of automobiles spared.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/8jaaxj/article31194845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THBUCAR,https://www.thehindu.com/business/no-change-in-motor-third-party-rates-for-now/article31185436.ece

A Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta divided the inventory of these vehicles into two categories — vehicles that were sold before March 31 and not registered; and those that remain unsold with the dealers.

The court said the first category of vehicles could be registered after the lockdown was withdrawn. As for the unsold vehicles, dealers could sell 10% of the stock after the lockdown was lifted. However, dealers in Delhi-NCR have been denied the relief owing to the high levels of the pollution in the national capital.

Short sale window

The court has indicated that dealers, other than those in Delhi-NCR, would be given a short window to sell 10% of their unsold vehicles. The Bench would finalise the time frame of the window in its order, which is yet to be published. However, lawyers involved in the case have said it may be 10-14 days after the lifting of the lockdown was lifted. The case was heard through videoconferencing.

Senior advocate K.V. Vishwanathan and Raghenth Basant appeared for the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA). Additional Solicitor-General A.N.S. Nadkarni appeared for the Union government. The FADA had filed the application for an extension of the deadline.

In his oral arguments, Mr. Vishwanathan said the pandemic was an “unforeseen eventuality”. The FADA argued that though March 31 was the deadline, some States had started implementing the bar on the sale and registration of BS-IV vehicles as early as the last week of February. The application said invocation of Section 144 of the Cr.PC. (to prohibit the assembly of four or more people in an area) had caused the footfalls to drop.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has opened up the liquidity floodgates for banks even as it reduced the key interest rate sharply by 75 bps and allowed equated monthly instalments (EMIs) to be deferred by three months in a move to fight the economic impact of the countrywide lockdown to check the spread of novel coronavirus.

The repo rate was reduced to by 75 bps 4.4% while the reverse repo rate was cut by 90 bps point to 4%. The higher reduction in the reverse repo rate was aimed at prompting banks to lend more rather than keeping their excess liquidity with the RBI.

Unprecedented crisis

“We are living through an extraordinary and unprecedented situation. Everything hinges on the depth of the COVID-19 outbreak, its spread and its duration,” RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said.

“Clearly, a war effort has to be mounted to combat the virus, involving both conventional and unconventional measures,” Mr. Das said.

The meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) which was scheduled for March 31 and April 1,3, was advanced to March 27 due to the unprecedented crisis.

While cutting benchmark rates, the RBI has continued with its accommodative stance. Four of the six members of the monetary policy committee voted in favour of a 75 bps rate cut.

Apart from cutting the repo rate, RBI has also reduced the cash reserve ratio of banks which released ₹1.37 lakh crore liquidity. This, along with other measures, will see an infusion of ₹3.74 lakh crore into the banking system.

RBI has also allowed banks to defer payment of EMIs on home, car, personal loans as well as credit card dues for three months till May 31. Since non-payment will not lead to non-performing asset classification by banks, there will be no impact on credit score of the borrowers.

State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, promptly responded to the RBI’s action and reduced the lending rates linked to a external benchmark and the repo rate by 75 bps. Interest rate on external benchmark linked loans was cut from 7.8% to 7.05% and those are linked to repo rate were cut to 6.65%. “Consequently, EMIs on Home Loan accounts get cheaper by around ₹52 per 1 lakh on a 30-year loan,” SBI said.

61,2020/03/27,American business chamber calls for second round of measures from govt.,"‘Indian businesses will also need some sort of support as well to help them deal with the havoc being wreaked by this pandemic’

As analysts weigh the economic impact of the 21-day lockdown and the 1.7 lakh crore package announced by the government on Thursday, an American business chamber said there is a need for a second round of measures to support businesses that are heavily impacted because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The government has tried to build a safety net today for India’s poorest and ensure them basic essentials at this time. I think Indian businesses will also need some sort of support as well to help them deal with the havoc being wreaked by this pandemic and we will wait for that second wave of measures to help industry,” said Nisha Biswal, President of the U.S. India Business Council (USIBC) in an interview to The Hindu, adding that the USIBC is in a “two-way” conversation with the government on steps to mitigate economic impact on businesses, particularly those that serve as a “services hub” for the world.

Impact on GDP

In the wake of the PM’s announcement of a 21-day shutdown, analytical firms have expressed concerns over its impact on India’s GDP. While brokerage firm Barclay’s brought down the 2020 GDP forecast from 4.5% to 2.5% in the calendar year, Nomura Research said its estimates suggest that 75% of the economy will shut down due to the measure, and that there would be a slide in the GDP as well.

While lauding PM Modi for taking the “important and necessary step” of the lockdown, the USIBC called for more uniform implementation of the exemptions for essential services during the lockdown, which are being disrupted at present. “India is a services hub for the world. Virtually every data processing company has a back office interest in India. Major banks, insurance companies, payment companies, process transactions not only in India but in other countries. That’s a real challenge...The government has put these in essential services, but the challenge is in the implementation,” Ms. Biswal added.

‘Work together’

She further added that the countries need to work together and coordinate their responses. “We need consistency in approaches. This pandemic has two big impacts. Health and safety of the population is one priority, but it is also breaking up the interconnected economy that is keeping us afloat…stocking markets and manufacturing, and for the economy to play that role.”

In addition, India’s fight against the pandemic would also require companies to be able to import necessary chemicals for pharmaceuticals, bring in testing kits and ventilator parts. “Other countries need to be able to support the supply chain. Our letter was to identify some of those issues, and ways in which businesses in India can continue to service the needs,” she said.

In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24, the USIBC also pitched for a task force to be set up in the government to coordinate with industry groups regarding the resources, essential goods and services and technical capabilities that they can provide in responding to COVID-19.

Sector-specific

While Thursday’s announcement from the government was welcomed across various industry sectors, almost all sought similar sector-specific measures. “[The measures announced] will certainly entrust the faith of the vulnerable section of our society on the government and support them in dealing with the immediate concerns caused by COVID-19. We hope the government will also soon announce measures to support the automotive industry,” Rajan Wadhera, President, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, said.

Likewise, the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI) said the Garib Kalyan Scheme was the need of the hour and the industry is “eagerly awaiting” the economic stimulus required for its revival.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/american-business-chamber-calls-for-second-round-of-measures-from-govt/article31177492.ece

As the ICMR on Friday confirmed 75 fresh cases and 17 deaths in the COVID-19 outbreak, the Union Health Ministry announced that it was scaling up measures to combat the virus by bringing in 40,000 more ventilators in the next three months.

According to data released by the Ministry, a total of 724 individuals have tested positive; 27,688 samples from 26,798 individuals have been tested for the SARS-CoV2 virus as on March 27, an ICMR release said.

According to reports from States, the toll from the outbreak has touched 21, with 159 fresh cases in the last 24 hours. Karnataka reported its third death of a 60-year-old man, along with nine new cases, including a 10-month-old infant from Dakshina Kannada. Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh reported one fatality each. Kerala reported the maximum number of cases at 179 with 39 new cases, while Maharashtra had 153 cases.

Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry Lav Agarwal said India is working on the guidelines prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to isolate, test, track and treat.

“This has been our strategy from day one and it has also been a pre-emptive, preventive and comprehensive approach. Today 1.4 lakh companies have allowed employees to work from home and 22 lakh health workers will benefit from the ₹50 lakh insurance,” he told reporter.

Mr Agarwal said the Ministry has asked a “PSU to make 10,000 ventilators and another 30,000 will come from Bharat Electricals, a PSU under the Defence Ministry. Also our field frontline workers are been educated through online mode to contribute in our effort to contain the virus.’’

“We want to stress that the need of the hours is to continue 100% adherence to social distancing and lock down norms. We can break transmission only by contributing fully to this. Even a single case of non-compliance can set us back,” the official said.

“President Kovind also had video conferencing with Governor, Lt. Governors, NGO heads to ensure that we provide a joint front to contain the virus and that all efforts are made to ensure that the common man stays protected,’’ he added.

63,2020/03/27,SC relaxes BS-IV deadline,"Delhi-NCR dealers denied relief owing to pollution

In a relief to automobile dealers, the Supreme Court on Friday extended the March 31, 2020 deadline for the sale and registration of BS-IV emission norm-compliant vehicles because of the “extraordinary” situation arising out of the 21-day COVID-19 lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta divided the inventory of these vehicles into two categories — vehicles that were sold before March 31 and not registered; and those that remain unsold with the dealers.

The court said the first category of vehicles could be registered after the lockdown was withdrawn. As for the unsold vehicles, dealers could sell 10% of the stock after the lockdown was lifted. However, dealers in Delhi-NCR have been denied the relief owing to the high levels of the pollution in the national capital.

Short sale window

The court has indicated that dealers, other than those in Delhi-NCR, would be given a short window to sell 10% of their unsold vehicles. The Bench would finalise the time frame of the window in its order, which is yet to be published. However, lawyers involved in the case have said it may be 10-14 days after the lifting of the lockdown was lifted. The case was heard through videoconferencing.

Senior advocate K.V. Vishwanathan and Raghenth Basant appeared for the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA). Additional Solicitor-General A.N.S. Nadkarni appeared for the Union government. The FADA had filed the application for an extension of the deadline.

In his oral arguments, Mr. Vishwanathan said the pandemic was an “unforeseen eventuality”. The FADA argued that though March 31 was the deadline, some States had started implementing the bar on the sale and registration of BS-IV vehicles as early as the last week of February. The application said invocation of Section 144 of the Cr.PC. (to prohibit the assembly of four or more people in an area) had caused the footfalls to drop.

The order comes as a relief for buyers because non-registration of their vehicles had seen them run from pillar to post.

Bharat Stage (BS) emission norm is a standard instituted by the government to regulate the discharge of air pollutants from motor vehicles. The BS-IV norm has been in force since April 2017.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-relaxes-bs-iv-deadline/article31186706.ece

Fourteen international airlines operated a total of 34 flights in the past three weeks to evacuate foreign nationals from India as well as to bring back Indians stranded in different parts of the world following travel restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19, according to DGCA data.

Malaysian carrier AirAsia Berhad has so far operated the maximum number of flights, i.e. seven, to evacuate Indians from Kuala Lumpur as well as to evacuate Malaysians from Tiruchi, Vishakhapatnam and Chennai between March 18 and 24.

Japan Airlines will be operating a flight each on Friday and Saturday in addition to three it has already flown into India to evacuate Japanese nationals from New Delhi.

65,2020/03/27,Virus adds to woes of riot victims in Shiv Vihar,"After communal violence, COVID-19 and lockdown have left them reeling

It has been over a month since Mohammed Qutubuddin went to work. He sews to make a living and says he is dependent on his neighbours and relatives for groceries.

First, it was the communal riots and now COVID-19 and the lockdown which hit the residents of the worst-hit Shiv Vihar.

“Aakhri baar kaam par 23 tareek ko gaya tha. Uske baad se kuch nahi kiya. Kamaane ka koi aur zariya bhi nahi hai [The last time I went to work was on February 23. Haven’t been able to work thereafter. There’s no other way of earning],” said Qutubuddin who has a family of five to feed and ₹2,200 rent to pay.

In the narrow lanes, many houses were locked. Those still living there said most of the locked houses were either vandalised or looted. Those living there didn’t return. “One thing that’s good now is that there are fewer people, and this reduces the chances of coronavirus infection,” said Nazar Mohammed, a government school teacher, whose house was burnt during the riots.

On Thursday, people were found holed up in their homes or sitting at their doorsteps. “Television sets in most houses were looted and just one or two houses have been able to buy again. Taking precautions, people mostly stay indoors. We also maintain distance while talking,” said Ikram Hasan, 56.

A few streets ahead lives Nazar Mohammed in a two-storey house. His immediate concern is to be able to fix his electricity board and paint the remaining house. “When BSES workers came, electricity supply was temporarily restored. Only a bulb is working now. I had started renovating the house about 10 days ago and had brought some materials that were required. The painting of half the house is left. Flooring is also left. Because of the lockdown, no labourer is coming. I am living here, while my wife and kids are living in a rented house on the next street,” he said. He has received ₹50,000 in compensation. The rest is yet to arrive.

Talking about the compensation, the residents said they were in dire straits. “There are two grocery stores nearby selling flour, pulses and other essential items. Sometimes, they’re available and sometimes they’re not. Vegetable prices have shot up. The last time we received ration as relief material was on March 20, before the lockdown. We can’t hoard supplies because we can’t afford it. We don’t know how to deal with this situation,” said the wife of autorickshaw driver Aslam, 45, who did not wish to be named. Mr Aslam has been out of work.

The house of Suman, 40, and her husband Satyapal, 47, was looted. Without a television set, they sat at the doorstep to while away their time. The bigger problem is that the water supply has not been restored. Hence, they rented a house at Johripur. “We had a combined connection with five other houses. One of the houses was burnt, and their connection hasn’t been restored. Now, it cannot happen because of the lockdown. Therefore, we spend the day here and go back in the evening,” Ms. Suman said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sqc1k4/article31186390.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG20200327124858,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/virus-add-to-woes-of-riot-victims-in-shiv-vihar/article31186391.ece
66,2020/03/27,Coronavirus | India to join WHO’s COVID-19 trials,"The Solidarity Trial will test four different drugs or combinations

India is all set to join World Health Organisation’s “Solidarity trial” aimed at rapid global search for drugs to treat COVID-19. The country has stayed away so far from this multi-country trial “due to its small sample size and because our contribution would have looked minuscule,” said Head of Epidemiology and Communicable diseases at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) R. Gangakhedkar on Friday.

The Solidarity Trial will test four different drugs or combinations — remdesivir, a combination of two drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir, the two drugs plus interferon beta, and chloroquine — and will compare their effectiveness to what is called standard of care, the regular support hospitals treating COVID-19 patients use now.

Speaking of where India stands in terms of developing a drug or vaccine against COVID-19, Dr. Gangakhedkar said: “We have to prioritise what we need right now to deal with the situation. ICMR is currently looking at re-purposed drug molecules to find treatment for COVID-19. We don’t have the luxury of time right now.”

He added that vaccine development wasn’t a priority for ICMR currently. “There are 30 vaccine groups that are operational worldwide right now looking at COVID-19, with five having gone into animal-toxicity study. India will express its interest to participate in the trial for the Indian population when we feel the time is right,” said Dr. Gangakhedkar.

Speaking about importing probes and rapid testing kits, he said out of the 3.4 million probes ordered from Germany and WHO, five lakh have come in already.

“But this flow doesn’t affect our testing right now. Some delays are happening in getting the probes but there is no situation that there will be less tests,” said Dr. Gangakhedkar.

He added that the country is getting testing kits from across the world including China. “We are trying to get suppliers,” he noted.

Meanwhile the Medical Technology Association of India (MTaI), which represents research-based medical technology companies, in a statement released on Friday, said while the Centre has expeditiously moved to exempt Medical Devices and Equipment manufacturing, warehousing and distribution from the lockdown, the implementation rests with State governments and local level administrators that has been clamping down on manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, of medical devices and equipment.

“Transport trucks carrying these vital preparatory materials are stuck at city and state borders. The manufacturing and warehousing staffs, though armed with copies of the exemptions, are hitting a wall explaining to police and local bodies,” said the Association.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/eq175y/article30478320.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WHO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-to-join-whos-covid-19-trials/article31186345.ece
67,2020/03/27,Chidambaram hails interest rate cut,"RBI said banks could allow a three-month moratorium on EMI repayments of all term loans standing out on March 1.

Former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Friday welcomed the Reserve Bank of India’s decision to infuse liquidity into the markets. But he termed “half-hearted” the three-month moratorium on EMI repayments, recommended by the RBI.

“I welcome the RBI’s decision to cut the repo rate and measures to provide more liquidity,” he wrote on Twitter, soon after RBI Governor Shakti Kanta Das announced the decisions of the Monetary Policy Committee.

Besides the steps to increase liquidity, including by cutting the cash reserve ratio, the RBI said banks could allow a three-month moratorium on EMI repayments of all term loans standing out on March 1.

Mr. Chidambaram called this decision “half- hearted” as the RBI left it to the discretion of the commercial banks to extend this benefit to their customers. “The demand is that all EMI due dates be automatically deferred. I had suggested that all due dates falling before 30 June be deferred to 30 June. Borrowers have been made to depend on the banks concerned, and will be disappointed,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/njdoo8/article31186183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THCHIDAMBARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chidambaram-hails-interest-rate-cut/article31186184.ece

69,2020/03/27,Deepak Talwar's interim bail plea rejected,"The businessman cites medical grounds in view of COVID-19 outbreak

A special court has rejected an application of businessman Deepak Talwar seeking interim bail for two months on medical grounds in view of the COVID-19 outbreak. The proceedings, in a money laundering case, were held via videoconferencing.

Also read: CBI files chargesheet against Deepak Talwar, others

The court observed that Mr. Talwar, on May 21, complained of sore throat and fever and he was provided proper medical treatment in jail and his condition was being reviewed periodically. It directed the jail superintendent to take a medical opinion of the doctor concerned, and if required, he should be tested for COVID-19 and appropriate treatment provided to him.

Mr. Talwar's counsel earlier submitted that he had filed a regular bail application but it could be considered as a plea for interim bail on medical grounds in view of the extraordinary circumstances created due to the spread of COVID-19.

Counsel said Mr. Talwar was above 60 years of age, was a heart patient, diabetic and a patient of hypertension, due to which his immunity system was weak and therefore, he needed special care and attention by his family members and friends.

Also read: Judge recuses from hearing petition of Deepak Talwar

It was submitted that the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court, through separate orders, had recently directed the authorities concerned of the States and Union Territories to make a policy for the release of convicts on parole for a longer period of time and the release of under-trial prisoners on interim bail in the existing special circumstances.

A recent medical report of the accused, sent by the jail superintendent, was cited and it was also submitted that he was granted interim bail in another matter.

ED opposes plea

However, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) opposed the plea, arguing that nothing in the application or defence counsel's submissions showed that the jail authorities were not taking care of the accused; and his ailments had not emerged recently.

The ED said the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court had not passed any general order directing the subordinate courts that under-trial prisoners, who were over 60 and suffering from heart disease, hypertension or diabetes, be released on interim bail.

After hearing both sides, the court said: “Undoubtedly, on humanitarian considerations, bail or interim bail may be granted to the accused on medical grounds even if there are serious and grievous allegations against him. The spreading of Coronavirus all over the world is a special circumstance, which is also considered while hearing the interim application.”

But, the court said, Mr. Talwar's counsel had not alleged that the jail authorities were unable to provide adequate medical facilities to him for his general ailments or take measures to protect him from the virus. The medical report in question did not suggest any such reference. It rather showed that he had been provided adequate treatment and that his medical condition seemed to be stable.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2j60lg/article31185451.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEEPAKTALWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/deepak-talwars-interim-bail-plea-rejected/article31185452.ece

The Computer Emergency Response Team of India (CERT-In) said the phenomenon has been witnessed as many organisations have asked their staff to work from home to help stop the spread of the coronavirus that has claimed thousands of live worldwide and infected millions.

“Switching to remote working because of the COVID-19 can create cyber security problems for employers and employees.

News Analysis | COVID-19 an opportunity for India’s health diplomacy

“There is an increase in the number of cyberattacks on computers, routers and unprotected home networks used by employees who have switched to remote working due to the spread of COVID-19,” it said.

With most employees working from home, the agency said, enterprise VPN servers have now become paramount to a company’s backbone, and their security and availability must be the focus for IT (information technology) teams.

“It is important that the VPN service is patched and up-to-date because there will be way more scrutiny against these services,” it added.

The CERT-In also suggested some countermeasures and best security practices in this context: Change default passwords of your home Wi-Fi router to prevent hackers from accessing your network; use strong and unique passwords on every account and device and use two-factor authentication (2FA).

Some other countermeasures include: Not allowing sharing of work computers and other devices. When employees bring work devices home, those devices should not be shared with or used by anyone else in the home, it said.

“This reduces the risk of unauthorised or inadvertent access to protected company information,” the advisory stated.

It asked users to update VPNs, network infrastructure devices, and devices being used to remote into work environments with the latest software patches and security configurations.

“Only use software your company would typically use to share files and refrain from using your personal email or 3rd party services unless reliably informed otherwise,” it added.

It is recommended that even remote user activity is covered by the organisation’s perimeter security tools, the advisory said.

“Ensure that remote sessions automatically time out after a specified period of inactivity and that they require re-authentication to gain access,” the CERT-In said.

It also urged IT teams of the organisations to remind employees of the types of information that they need to safeguard.

“This often includes information such as confidential business information, trade secrets, protected intellectual property and other personal information,” the advisory said.

“Also, ‘remember password’ functions should always be turned off when employees are logging into company information systems and applications from their personal devices,” it said.

A specific suggestion for IT teams was to “consider Mobile Device Management (MDM) and Mobile Application Management (MAM).”

“These tools can allow organisations to remotely implement a number of security measures, including data encryption, malware scans, and wiping data on stolen devices,” it said.

The South Eastern Railway is converting a few coaches into isolation wards and readying blocks in its hospitals for treatment and quarantine facilities in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, an official said here on Friday.

Some of the passenger coaches, which are lying idle at yards since stoppage of train services from Sunday, are being turned into isolation wards with required amenities for patients, doctors and care givers, said SER spokesman Sanjay Ghosh.

“The coaches will be provided as and when required at places asked for by the concerned State government,” he said.

At all SER hospitals, including the Central Hospital at its headquarters at Garden Reach here, isolation wards for treatment of COVID-19 patients have been set up, he said.

There are 100 beds set aside for isolation facilities at the SER hospitals, which are being considerably increased to cater to any emergency situation, said Mr. Ghosh.

“We are now readying separate blocks at all divisional hospitals, apart from the Central Hospital here, for the purpose of treating and quarantining patients if any such need arises,” the official said.

Isolation blocks are under preparation at Garden Reach Central Hospital and Ranchi, Kharagpur, Adra and Chakradharpur divisional hospitals.

Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba has asked the States to effectively monitor 15 lakh international air passengers who came from January 18 to March 23 as there appeared to be a “gap” between the actual monitoring that “may seriously jeopardise the efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19.”

Mr. Gauba wrote a letter to Chief Secretaries that the list of such passengers as compiled by the Bureau of Immigration had been shared with all the States and Union Territories.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

“As you are aware, we initiated screening of international incoming passengers at the airports with effect from January 18, 2020. I have been informed that up to March 23, 2020, cumulatively, Bureau of Immigration has shared details of more than 15 lakh incoming international passengers with the States/UTs for monitoring for COVID-19. However, there appears to be a gap between the number of international passengers who need to be monitored by the States/UTs and the actual number of passengers being monitored,” Mr. Gauba said in his letter.

“It is important that all international passengers are put under close surveillance to prevent the spread of the epidemic”, the letter stated

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) had repeatedly emphasised the importance of monitoring, Mr. Gauba noted and requested the States and the UTs to take immediate steps in this regard.

“I would, therefore, like to request you to ensure that concerted and sustained action is taken urgently to put such passengers under surveillance immediately as per MoHFW guidelines,” he said, adding that the district authorities should be actively involved in this effort.

The government has claimed that the screening of international incoming passengers at airports was done from January 18 in a phased manner.

Later Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, MoHFW, said, “The Cabinet Secretary wrote to State governments as part of our routine communication to ensure that no passenger is left untraced. He has requested that all international passengers be monitored and cleared for COVID-19 and that they adhere the 14 or 21 day-quarantine to ensure their and the community’s safety. This is vital to break transmission and contain the spread of the virus.”

Advisory to States

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) also sent an advisory to all States to take immediate steps to provide adequate support, including food and shelter to migrant labourers as lakhs marched on foot to reach their homes as the country is on a 21-day lockdown.

The States have also been advised to take steps to ensure that students, working women from other States, etc. are also allowed to continue in their existing accommodation.

The advisory asked the States to explore measures by involving various agencies, including NGOs, to provide food and shelter with basic amenities like clean drinking water, sanitation etc and make these vulnerable groups aware of the measures taken by the government, including provision of free food grains and other essential items through the PDS, and streamline the distribution system. This would help prevent avoidable movement of such people, according to the advisory.

79,2020/03/27,Govt should help stranded Indian pilgrims in Iran: SC,"Petitioner says many of them were ill and had run short of money for basic sustenance

The Supreme Court on Friday said hundreds of Shia pilgrims stranded in Qom city of Iran on account of the COVID-2019 pandemic were in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. The government should intervene immediately to alleviate their suffering.

Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and Surya Kant issued notice to the Centre after hearing senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, for petitioner Mustafa M.H., through videoconferencing.

Mr. Mustafa, whose relatives are among the pilgrims, sought urgent directions to the government to immediately evacuate them. Many of them were ill and had run short of money for basic sustenance, he said.

The court acknowledged that the petition shows “there is an urgent need for humanitarian assistance to be provided to Indian citizens who are stranded in Qom. In order to obviate concern over their well- being, we issue notice to the Union of India, returnable on March 30, 2020”.

‘Place status report’

The court asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to assist the court. Mr. Mehta was asked to place a status report of the steps taken and which the Union of India, through the Ministry of External Affairs, proposes to undertake to alleviate the hardship which has been faced by these persons”.

“We hope and trust that in the meantime all necessary steps that are required to protect the welfare of these citizens will be adopted and a suitable plan of action will be chalked out in consultation with all the concerned authorities, including the Indian Embassy in Iran,” the order said.

The case was listed again on March 30.

The petition claims there are over 800-odd Indian citizens stuck in Qom. However, the order says there are about 500 pilgrims stranded there. Another 250 pilgrims were brought back to India from Qom.

Mr. Hegde said there was a possibility that several of the existing batch of 500 in Qom have tested positive for COVID-19.

“In case, urgent help is not provided to these pilgrims, there are bound to be serious health hazards, which have started to become fatal and has resulted in the death of two pilgrims already,” the petition said.

Till such time requisite arrangements were made for the evacuation of such passengers, the government should be directed to provide adequate health and medical support to the Indian citizens stranded in Iran. The government should ensure that they were quarantined in the manner prescribed by the World Health Organisation.

Mr. Mustafa, a native of Ladakh, said his relatives from Kargil-Drass travelled along with a group of about 1000 pilgrims to Iran in December last for a three-month trip. They were scheduled to return on various dates from February 26, 2020. However, they were stranded due to the virus outbreak.

“The pilgrims [mostly from a poor financial background] who had travelled to Iran were scheduled to return weeks back. However, in view of the situation mentioned above, they are stranded in Qom without any health/medical facilities and food supplies. Besides, they have been accommodated in hotel rooms in groups of four and five”, the petition said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oraqdg/article31181702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-seeks-govt-reply-on-over-800-stranded-pilgrims-in-iran/article31181703.ece

The ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown to check the spread of COVID-19 is likely to — and should — continue, according to a top doctor, who said India was not prepared to handle a pandemic.

“It’s not as if there’s going to be a carnival once the 21-day period ends. From what I gather during the discussions we are having, limited lockdowns will continue even after that because the virus will still be in circulation,” Arindam Kar, general secretary of the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine, told The Hindu.

“There are only about 30,000 ventilators in the whole of India. Even if 10% of population is infected, and of them even if 2% have to be placed under critical care, we will need close to 3 lakh ventilators, which we don’t have,” Dr. Kar said.

Another matter of grave concern, he emphasised, is the possibility of hospitals running out of protective gear for their staff, which is a big likelihood in case the infection spreads. “The morale of the healthcare workers will plunge and that’s when there will be real panic,” he said.

Rahul Jain, internal medicine specialist at Belle Vue Clinic, one of Kolkata’s top hospitals, agreed on this. “Even if one doctor or nurse is down, there will be a spiralling affect on 50 to 100 patients, which we cannot afford,” he said. “Having said that, we need to fight the disease with the resources we have at our disposal — there is no point saying at this moment that we should have had this facility or that facility.”

West Bengal govt lauded

Dr. Jain lauded the efforts of the West Bengal government in taking precautionary measures, which include converting the Calcutta Medical College into a 3,000-bed facility to cope with a major outbreak. He did not rule out such an outbreak; according to him, the relatively less number of cases in India was only the “lull before the storm”, and that a lockdown was the only way to contain the “geometrical increment” in the spread of the virus.

Dr. Kar, who also heads critical care at Calcutta Medical Research Institute, is being optimistic about summer. “The virus needs certain levels of humidity to proliferate, and we are hoping it will [become less effective] in the heat. Also, the virus eventually adapts to the host and its virulence reduces. Moreover, it is constantly mutating and changing its characteristics and can lose its potency. At the moment, we can only be optimistic about these things. All I can say is we are hoping for the best but prepared for the worst,” he said.

Dr. Kar predicts a massive investment in health infrastructure and massive overhaul in the pharmaceutical sector once the storm blows over. “As of now, 80% of raw material for our drugs comes from China. Companies will want to come out of this dependence. Also, remote healthcare will gain popularity — that is, more and more people will receive healthcare digitally with minimum human intervention,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/drhvsx/article31168475.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TESTINGKITS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/top-doctors-say-lockdown-must-be-extended/article31181236.ece

While reiterating that all relevant information should be made available in accessible formats, the advisory also instructed the States and UTs to give sign language interpreters who work in healthcare the same health and safety protection that is being given to other healthcare workers. Emergency response workers should be trained on the rights of PwD and the additional problems faced by those with specific impairments, the advisory said.

“Caregivers of PwD should be allowed to reach the PwD exempting them from restrictions during lockdown or providing passes in a simplified manner on priority,” it said.

Residents’ Welfare Associations should be made aware of the needs of PwD to enable entry of caregivers, maids and other staff into their homes, after following the relevant sanitising procedure, it said.

84,2020/03/27,COVID-19 | DGCA extends pilots’ licences nearing expiry by 90 days,"The regulator has also extended the validity of medical assessment certificates, aircraft rating certificates, skill test certificates, etc, for a period of 90 days.

India’s aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Friday extended the validity of pilots’ licences that were nearing expiry by 90 days, noting that they were facing issues in completing various requirements due to the restrictions imposed to curb the COVID-19 outbreak.

Similarly, the regulator has also extended the validity of medical assessment certificates, aircraft rating certificates, skill test certificates, etc, for a period of 90 days.

“DGCA is aware that operators and individual license holders are facing issues in completing their requirements towards renewal, issuance of various pilot licenses and ratings and to exercise the privileges of their respective licenses and ratings including temporary authorizations (FATA),” the regulator stated in a public notice on Friday.

FATA stands for foreign aircrew temporary authorization, which is issued to foreign pilots that are working for Indian airlines.

“Due to the impact of COVID-19, restrictions have been imposed by the government. Owing to this, several training organisations utilised for the training of flight crew, conduct of checks have been affected and shut down in many places,” the public notice said.

“Training organisations have also been shut down in many other ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) contracting states,” the notice added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vnq8g7/article31134210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WhatsApp-Image-2020-03-22-at-122200-PMjpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-dgca-extends-pilots-licences-nearing-expiry-by-90-days/article31180346.ece
85,2020/03/27,GRP inspector took money to ferry migrant workers to Allahabad by train during lockdown: RPF,"The railways on Friday said a GRP inspector took money from desperate migrants to ferry them to their hometowns in an empty train even as all passenger services of the national transporter remained suspended in view of the nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19.

CCTV footage at the New Delhi railway station showed that the inspector of the Government Railway Police (GRP) facilitated around 45 people to get aboard an empty rake of the Magadh Express on Thursday, the railways said.

“They assembled at the GRP chauki, near metro gate number 1 of the New Delhi railway station. Then they moved to platform number 16 through an opening for construction work. When the RPF personnel saw this, additional force was called and all of them were de-boarded from the train and ousted from the station. The train is still at the station,” Northern Railway Spokesperson Deepak Kumar said.

86,2020/03/27,India has lost a giant in the passing of Satish Gujral,"His works will continue to evoke quietude and dignity

In the passing of artist, architect, designer and sculptor Satish Gujral, India has lost a giant who had vision and energy and always remained relevant to his times.

Long before societies and nations recognised the value of being inclusive to individuals with special needs, Gujral beat all odds of hearing impairment to garner international recognition for his creativity that spanned painting, graphics, murals, sculpture and architecture.

Gujral’s works traversed multiple modes and moorings and, over the decades, he drew inspiration from deities, the edifice of tribal forms, the gravitas of geometrical projections, animals as well as humans, to create a repertoire that entwined multiple references for his paintings as well as his sculptures.

Also Read Satish Gujral passes away at 94

Born in Jhelum in pre-Partition West Punjab in 1923, and trained at the Mayo School of Art and later in 1944-47 at Sir J. J. School of Art in Bombay, Gujral overcame the turbulent early years — an illness that affected his hearing and the trauma of Partition — which left a deep impact on his artistic expression.

Among his finest shows

One of his finest shows was Metamorphosis at the Lalit Kala Akademi in 2008. Other than his dulcet drawings done on a straw-coloured archival paper, his sculptures were an odyssey of their own making. Of particular grace and expressionist zeal were his rams, horses and bull sculptures. The horses and bulls were created with riding gear, meticulously moored. When asked to explain the symbolism, he said: “The animals are a symbol of energy, whereas the riding gear, the way it is created to lie loose, is about energy in motion, something I need to reflect since I have been trapped into stillness.”

A week after his opening at the Lalit Kala Akademi in Delhi, he came one evening to Khushwant Singh’s home and it was a delight to listen to two men of aesthetics discuss Faiz Ahmad Faiz. Singh, then, related the tale of Faiz and Gujral to this critic.

“Gujral knew Faiz because every evening, he came to his brother’s [I.K. Gujral’s] hostel and read out his poetry,” said Singh. “ One day, Gujral’s brother told Faiz that his little brother wanted to read his poetry but could not hear and wondered if he could lend his book of poems for Gujral to read. Faiz did not send his book, he went and sat with Gujral. Faiz, in a way, became Gujral’s teacher as he gave him three unforgettable nights.”

Singh that evening recited Faiz and it was a scene to behold as Gujral’s eyes lit up and his smile widened. The love and respect between these two men was something to behold.

Burnt wooden sculptures

While Gujral’s paintings and sculptures have always been in the news, it is his burnt wooden sculptures that stand apart for their solidity of substance and the echoes of literature and folk accents and spirituality.

Among the best are his two sculptures at the ITC Maurya, New Delhi. Gujral created a modernist mould with Indianesque idioms. There is something hauntingly Indian in this work, although he consciously refuses to exploit traditional Indian styles. The burnt wood and the contours seem both sunburned and gritty, as it revels in its uniform matte texture.

When asked about his burnt wood series that has references to Indian mythology even as it reflects an interplay of contemporary sensibility, Gujral said: “One day, during Lohri, I saw sparks emerging from a burning log. The texture and colour attracted me, and immediately I knew that I wanted to work with burnt wood.”

Gujral was obsessed with the sooty blackness of burnt wood and, from it, created serpents and deities and forms sprinkling a hint of crimson and coral beads and gold like the glowing embers in the fire.

Colour and surface

In his paintings, we could see subtleties of colour begin to play across through the surface like a mirage seen in the reaches of a dry desert. He gained international recognition for the “elusive quality that retreated into profundity as the viewer attempts to grasp it.” One of his best was Mourning En Masse (1952) (casein on cardboard). His brilliance in his paintings lay not just in the textural facets but in the underlying solidity which seemed to melt into sliding planes of colour dispersing into an infinite horizon.

Gujral had deep powers of observation. From bells on the necks of buffaloes to the tools of the cobblers who sat on the streets, his eyes missed nothing.

One of his greatest design ventures was the Belgian Embassy in Delhi. It was picked out by the International Union of Architects as one of the 1,000 best buildings made in the 20th Century.

Gujral was also known for his generosity of spirit. In 2017, he donated a sculpture to Bikaner House because it supported his idea of public art. The idea of public art was experienced by him in its birthplace in Mexico. His tenure in Mexico brought him close to Frida Kahlo and Octavio Paz. Meeting Paz paved the way for his selection for a scholarship to study art in Mexico, and this changed his life.

The Mexican government conferred Gujral with “The Order of the Aztec Eagle”, an honour given to foreigners rendering distinguish services to Mexico and humanity. The Belgian government honoured Gujral with the Order of the Crown for designing the Belgian Embassy in New Delhi in 1983.

Sanskrit poetry

Gujral was a voracious reader and scholar too. He said his rams in drawings, paintings and sculptures belonged to literature as well as poetry. His rams had a lyrical beauty about them, their curled horns harking back to the haunts of history. He often said that Sanskrit poetry was narrated through dialogues with a bird. The “woman’s breast springing like the head of a bird” or “the woman communicating with a ram” represented an “inner lust and sensuality” for Gujral. But women who looked at his rams found them soft and perfectly poised. The lyrical and the pensive penchant for figurative forms defined his entire evolution through more than six decades of work.

His art will stand alone in the sands of time, evoking the essence of quietude and dignity just like the artist who transcended time to write his own pages of art history.

India will set up an electronic platform to help member countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The decision was conveyed to health professionals of the SAARC countries during a video conference on Thursday which was conducted as decided during the March 15 virtual summit of SAARC leaders.

“India proposed a shared electronic platform for all SAARC nations to share and exchange information, knowledge, expertise and best practices for jointly combating the coronavirus epidemic,” a press release from the Ministry of External Affairs announced.

The video conference lasted two hours, in which all the member countries of SAARC participated. “India has taken the regional initiative, and we are helping each other across land and maritime border, from providing medicines to testing protocols and protective gear (PPE),” a source familiar with the video conference said.

Indian participants in the discussion suggested that a Whatsapp or email group could be started to help facilitate exchange of information among the SAARC countries till the platform became fully operational. It was conveyed that the platform was currently under production in India.

The plan for the electronic platform was the first step by India after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced $10 million for the SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund. The fund has so far collected $15 million after Nepal, Maldives, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka also came forward with contributions for the initiative.

91,2020/03/27,Satish Gujral passes away at 94,"“His zest for life despite his handicap was incomparable,” says his nephew

Acclaimed artist, architect, sculptor and writer Satish Gujral passed away on Thursday at the age of 94. Born in Jhelum in pre-partition Punjab, Gujral was the brother of the late Prime Minister I.K. Gujral and was awarded India’s second-highest civilian honour, the Padma Vibhushan, in 1999.

Gujral first studied art, something he picked up after he lost his hearing at the age of nine in an accident, at Mayo College and later at the J. J. School of Art in Mumbai, which he had to leave because of health issues.

His nephew, Rajya Sabha MP Naresh Gujral, said of him: “He led a challenging life but he proved himself equal to it. His zest for life despite his handicap was incomparable.”

“He lost his hearing at the age of nine when he knew only Punjabi and could read a little Urdu.

92,2020/03/27,Indian students and professionals in Latvia seek help from government,"They want to be evacuated or provided financial support, some say they need medical attention

At least 173 Indian students stuck in Latvia in eastern Europe have started an online campaign seeking help from the Indian authorities. The students, along with several stranded Indian nationals, are demanding that they should either be evacuated or the government should provide them immediate financial support as they are stranded in capital Riga because of the cancellation of international air services in view of the coronavirus crisis. Speaking over phone, several students and professionals said that they were prevented from boarding international flights to India before the flights were cancelled.

‘No assurance’

“We are studying in various universities of Latvia and have not yet received any assurance from the Indian authorities. We do not have enough money and cannot survive here for long if the lockdown prevents us from returning home in India,” said Abhishek Sangwan, a student of the ISMA University of Riga. Mr. Sangwan, who hails from Haryana, said that many students were unaware of India’s decision to shutdown air services and were planning to return but found themselves stranded as both countries went into lockdown.

He informed that Latvia, which has reported at least 221 cases of coronavirus infection is unable to provide any help, though none of the Indian community’s members have so far displayed symptoms of infection. The country has declared a state of emergency and shut its borders with neighbouring countries.

Medical attention

There are, however, students who are ailing and require immediate medical attention. Gaurang Divyakant Patel of Ahmedabad, who is also studying in Riga, said that he had a lung surgery in India last year and would like to return home as soon as possible as he is afraid of not getting sufficient medical attention in Latvia at this moment.

“Because of my pre-existing medical condition, it is necessary that I stay near my family at this time,” said Mr. Patel. Latvia does not have an Indian embassy, and the Embassy of India in Sweden is accredited to Latvia. The physical distance between the Swedish capital of Stockholm and Riga is also a hindrance for Indians who have been trying to reach out to the Indian authorities unsuccessfully.

‘Difficult to cope’

Apart from the students, there are at least 24 businessmen and professionals who are also seeking help from the Indian government. Rajeev Malhotra, an entrepreneur said his air ticket was cancelled after air services were suspended on last Sunday. “Business has come to a halt here in Riga. My family, back in India, which includes my young daughter and wife, are finding it extremely difficult to cope with the situation. I need to be back home with my family in these trying times. I also cannot sustain living in Riga indefinitely,” said Mr. Malhotra in an email requesting urgent help from the Indian authorities.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indian-students-and-professionals-in-latvia-seek-help-from-government/article31177520.ece
93,2020/03/27,Air India carries medical supplies,"Government likely to rope in passenger airlines for cargo operations

Air India carried the first bulk consignment of face masks and medical equipment from Mumbai to New Delhi on Thursday as the focus in the aviation sector shifts to transport of essential medical supplies after the ban on passenger flights. Air India operated its Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which landed in Delhi at 4 p.m. on Thursday, with 6.5 tonnes of cargo, according to the airline’s spokesperson. The airline has only passenger aircraft in its fleet and carries cargo in the aircraft’s belly which has limited capacity as compared to freight aircraft.

“We are co-ordinating with freight operators, government agencies, pharmaceutical companies, passenger airlines and airports to ensure seamless movement of medicines and medical equipment across the country,” Keku Gazder, CEO of AAI Cargo Logistics and Allied Services (AAICLAS) told The Hindu. The AAI subsidiary is extending support to the Ministry of Civil Aviation for crucial cargo services.

Cargo capacities

BlueDart has six Boeing 757s, each with a capacity of up to 32 tonnes, and SpiceJet has five 737-800s with a capacity of up to 22 tonnes each. After the ban on passenger airlines came into effect on March 25, substantial cargo carrying capacity in the form of aircraft bellies has become unavailable. Various airlines like IndiGo and GoAir have offered their aircraft and crew for transporting crucial supplies.

BlueDart flew on the Chennai-Bengaluru as well as Mumbai-Kolkata-Delhi routes with vital pharmaceutical and medical equipment on Thursday.

Tulsi N. Mirchandaney, Managing Director, Blue Dart Aviation, said there has been a fall in loads due to various reasons.

“There has been a drop in demand as many businesses have suspended operations and others have found it difficult to bring their loads to airports. The government is working on facilitating countrywide distribution of relief materials, and we are trying to support them with our scheduled and charter operations,” Ms. Mirchandaney told The Hindu.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vjgvnl/article31177486.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NEWS1AIRINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/air-india-carries-medical-supplies/article31177487.ece

96,2020/03/27,News Analysis | COVID-19 an opportunity for India’s health diplomacy,"After the high profile that India has acquired following the Prime Minister’s participation in the G-20 video conference, New Delhi would be under the scanner on whether it was going to lead by example.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has elevated India’s health diplomacy to the next level by participating in a virtual conversation on Thursday among the G-20 leaders to combat the Novel Coronavirus pandemic. This has followed his decision on March 15 to marshal a video conference among SAARC leaders — locking New Delhi’s intent to lead the fight against COVID-19 virus in South Asia. The Prime Minister has also separately reached out to major G-20 leaders. The list includes Russian President Vladimir Putin, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

While India expands its global diplomatic footprint in the post COVID-19 world, the disease is ,in parallel, raising the geopolitical profile of other Eurasian powers — in particular countries like South Korea, Japan, China and Russia — which are exercising leadership in combating the outbreak. In South Korea, active communication and aggressive testing played a big role in combating the pandemic. In Japan, ingrained habits, such as wearing masks helped in containing the virus.

Watch | COVID-19: Dos and don'ts from the Health Ministry

Despite the social media assault on an industrial scale, blaming China’s alleged role in internationally mainstreaming the outbreak, a pragmatic recognition of Beijing's bounce back, and its near pole positioning in staging a global economic recovery, is inescapable. China is stamping its global authority as a major supplier of medical equipment — at a time when Europe —especially Spain and Italy are in dire need of N-95 masks, hazmat coveralls, gloves and ventilators. The death toll in the United States has already topped 1000, with New York becoming the crucible for the spread of the pandemic in North America and beyond.

In an article titled, “From cover-up to global donor: China’s soft power play,” The Financial Times is quoting Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong, as saying that he expected 8 per cent growth in China in the second quarter from the previous three-month period.

Foreign ownership of sovereign renminbi bonds, spurred by a demand rush in March, has already climbed to a hefty $324 billion.

There are also visible signs that China’s soft power riding on its pandemic diplomacy is on the rise, especially in Europe. China filled the breach in Italy, one of the worst effected country on the planet by the outbreak, when the European Union was caught leaden footed in responding to Rome’s appeal for critical medical supplies.

Beijing, instead dispatched masks, ventilators and 300 intensive care doctors to back hospitals, unable to cope with heavy patient load. Russia quickly followed, sending over a dozen Il-76 heavy lift planes packed with equipment and personnel. Spain and Serbia have also featured prominently on Beijing’s radar.

The visible power shifts exposed by the pandemic demand that India renews its engagement with China in developing the Eurasia-led post-COVID 19 world order. But at the same time riding on its “strategic autonomy” doctrine, New Delhi has to hedge its power asymmetry with Beijing by carefully calibrating a relationship, especially with Japan, which has been seeking a more autonomous regional role for itself, despite its post-war alliance with Washington.

Unsurprisingly, as the wheels of health diplomacy began to turn at top speed, foreign secretary Harsh Shingla, on March 20, went into a conference call with representatives of the Indo-Pacific countries. In the conversation initiated by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun, the foreign secretary exchanged notes on countering the COVID-19 pandemic with representatives from Australia, the Republic of Korea, Vietnam, New Zealand, and Japan. According to a statement by the Ministry of External Affairs, the participants are expected to continue the conference call on a weekly basis.

But in an expression of multi-vectored diplomacy, External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar, four days later, was also in conversation with China’s state councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on possible areas of collaboration between the two countries on combating the virus, and for breaking common ground on the G-20 platform.

After the high profile that India has acquired following the Prime Minister’s participation in the G-20 video conference, New Delhi would be under the scanner on whether it was going to lead by example. That would mean not only quickly curtailing COVID-19 infections at home, but by also ramping up surplus capacity of medical equipment and personnel to reinforce its credibility as a reliable and responsible provider of Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) in the region.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/y758lj/article31170069.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSCHINA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/news-analysis-covid-19-an-opportunity-for-indias-health-diplomacy/article31178195.ece

The Indian Air Force (IAF) has created nine quarantine facilities offering several hundred beds at its nodal bases across the country for exclusively handling cases of COVID-19.

Each facility can house 200-300 patients at a time, according to a release by the Ministry of Defence in Bengaluru on Thursday.

“The Indian Air Force continues to take measures to provide all possible assistance to the civil administration across the country in containing the spread of COVID-19,” the release said.

The Command Hospital, Air Force, Bengaluru, has been designated as the first laboratory in the IAF to undertake COVID-19 testing. “It will greatly enhance the region’s ability to carry out quick testing of suspected cases and allow prompt and timely intervention where required.” These measures will support the government’s efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus infections, the IAF said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/iaf-sets-up-nine-quarantine-facilities/article31177279.ece
98,2020/03/27,Congress asks PCCs to distribute food kits to the needy,"Party MPs to spend MPLAD funds to procure personal protective equipment for doctors and hospital staff

The Congress on Thursday instructed all its Pradesh Congress Committees (PCC) to distribute essential food kits to all those who need it and lawmakers to use their funds for health workers.

The party asked its lawmakers to use their MP Local Area Development (MPLAD) funds to procure personal protective equipment (PPE) and other equipment for doctors and hospital staff.

Party leader and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi has demanded the release of ₹2.7 crore from his MPLAD funds to provide for ventilators, testing kits, PPE and other medical equipment for his constituency.

“Hon’ble Congress President desires that Congress party lawmakers including Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha MPs should take serious and sincere initiatives to make contributions from their MPLAD funds in the respective constituencies and States to equip the hospitals as well as health centres to address the current crisis of COVID-19 transmission,” Congress general secretary for organisation, K.C. Venugopal, said in a letter to his party colleagues.

“PCC presidents and in-charges should coordinate with MLAs and MLCs in the respective States to take identical initiatives. Besides this, the PCCs are requested to issue instructions to the DCCs and block committees to ensure the benefits of the welfare schemes from both Central and State governments reach to the people in need,” he added.

On the importance of supply of food items, Mr. Venugopal outlined how Congress workers from block to the State level can distribute food and medicine kits.

“The food kit may include essential food items like rice, wheat, pulses, baby foods and essential medicines. The distribution of food kits should be adhered to the social distance protocols as demanded by health experts. Huge gatherings should be avoided at any cost,” he said.

“A group consisting of party workers and leaders may be formed to coordinate the scheme. Social media and other online platforms can be employed to coordinate the distribution as well as identifying the people in need. Small group of party workers strictly following the required health protocols should be deputed to distribute the food kits among the people,” added the Congress general secretary.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-asks-pccs-to-distribute-food-kits-to-the-needy/article31177550.ece
99,2020/03/27,Indian firm looks at baker’s yeast for virus vaccine,"Biotech unit looking to synthesise proteins mimicking layers of novel coronavirus

Will baker’s yeast yield a vaccine against COVID-19? Premas Biotech, a Gurugram-based biotechnology company is set to find out and has signed a licensing deal with Aker Biosciences, a United States-based biotechnology company, to develop a vaccine.

Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

Given the present pandemic, several companies around the world are hastening to fast track vaccine development and drug development to counter the novel coronavirus that has so far infected at least 4,00,000 persons around the world. To accelerate development, drug regulators around the world — including in India — have announced plans to fast track regulatory process for COVID-19 related vaccine and drug development efforts.

By April

By April, Premas hopes to be ready with a 'proof-of-concept' recombinant vaccine candidate made out of proprietary manufacturing process that involves the use of the yeast species, S cerevisae, a well understood system and used to make vaccines. If the results are promising, the company hopes to present to the United States FDA and simultaneously the Drug Controller General of India and await instructions on the kind of trials they would have to undertake.

In commonly used vaccines, ‘live attenuated’ — a weakened strain — of a live virus, is injected into people to have their immune systems recognise and produce antibodies. In recent decades, biotechnology has moved on to trying to eliminate viruses altogether in vaccines as they may be ineffective, elicit unpleasant side-effects or be unusable in certain groups of patients.

Recombinant vaccines consist of synthetic proteins that mimic the ones that make up the virus’ exterior. Genes that make these proteins are put in bacterial or fungal factories — in this case yeast — and the resulting purified protein is used in the vaccine. The challenges lie in identifying the right proteins, making enough of it quickly and ensuring that the resulting mix of proteins is good quality and enough to stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies.

In the context of Sars-Cov-2, which is responsible for the ongoing pandemic, researchers have so far focussed maximum attention on the ‘spike proteins’.

Coronaviruses are all typified by a spiky outer facade. However subtle changes to the Sars-Cov-2 spikes have made them better able to infiltrate the cells of the airways — and more dangerously the lung cells where they commandeer resources needed by normal cells to survive. The most serious Sars-Cov-2 infection results when a pulmonary infection is caused by this invasion.

Wider spectrum

While some firms — including the Pune-based Serum Institute of India and U.S.-based Codagenix — have announced plans to try a live attenuated vaccine, Premas and Aker hope to be able to make a vaccine that doesn't just look at the ‘spike proteins’. The others, of interest to Premas, are envelope and membrane proteins all of which make up layers of the virus.

Using more of these proteins — or antigens — to make the vaccine improves the odds of the immune system detecting them and producing antibodies and protecting the body from a future viral attack. While several research groups work and biotechnology firms race to solve this problems, Premas says it has already synthesised two of the three proteins — thanks to its platform technology called D-Crypt.

“Through the years we have made over 30 difficult-to-express proteins. We are able to make large quantities of them and can be scaled up to industrial levels for trials. That is where we think we have an edge,” Prabuddha Kundu, Co-founder and Managing Director, Premas, told The Hindu. Experts have said it will be at least a year-and-a-half before a potential vaccine for COVID-19 can make it to the market.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indian-firm-looks-at-bakers-yeast-for-virus-vaccine/article31177265.ece

102,2020/03/27,"COVID-19: Speed at which virus is spreading is shocking, says researcher","According to her, one of the reasons is presence of spike protein in the virus and its affinity to ACE2 receptors in human cells

Chennaiite Pavithra Venkatagopalan, who holds a Ph.D. from Arizona State University (ASU) in the U.S., where her research focused on coronaviruses, was someone who was never active on social media.

“I took my privacy seriously and all my social media accounts have stringent privacy settings,” she says. However, today, her interviews busting misconceptions and highlighting preventive measures about COVID-19 have become popular in Tamil Nadu on messaging and social media platforms.

Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

She says the misinformation that were getting virally circulated forced her to speak out on COVID-19. “People were drinking cow urine. It is one thing to consume whatever one wants to, but it is extremely absurd to claim that it prevents a disease,” she says.

Her first talk was at the meeting of a Rotary Club chapter she is part of. Her father, who saw her presentation, asked her to do the same for his college alumni group. A person, who attended that talk, in turn made her speak at a meeting organised by the Tamil Nadu Science Forum (TNSF).

The video of her talk at TNSF was noticed by few journalists and calls from the media asking her to talk about the pandemic has not stopped ever since.

Watch | COVID-19: Dos and don'ts from the Health Ministry

Ms. Pavithra, a B.Tech graduate in Biotechnology from Alagappa College of Technology, is now the Director of Care Health Diagnostic Center. Admitting that she has always been a nerd, she says that it was her fascination with viruses that led her to pursue a Ph.D from the Biodesign Institute in ASU.

“Everyone studying viruses will have their own favourites and their reasons for the fascination. What attracted me to the family of coronaviruses, of which the present COVID-19-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus is a strain, was its ability to make RNAs without DNAs,” she says.

Explaining that while the synthesising of RNAs happened in most organisms through an enzyme called DNA-directed RNA polymerase, it happened in coronaviruses (similar to few other viruses) through RNA-dependent RNA polymerase since they are single-stranded RNA viruses that lacked DNAs.

Studying E proteins

Her specific research was in studying the E proteins, one of the three proteins along with the spike protein and the membrane protein that created the envelope of the virus. “My doctoral thesis was about tweaking the E proteins and studying its impact on the assembly of the virus and consequently how it reacts with the host cells,” she says. On whether she expected a strain of her favourite family of viruses to wreak havoc with a pandemic of this scale, she says never. “Those studying viruses always know the threat they pose to humanity. However, the speed at which SARS-CoV-2 is spreading, in comparison to the strains that caused SARS and MERS, is shocking,” she adds.

According to her, one of the reasons was the presence of the spike protein in the virus and its affinity to the ACE2 receptors in human cells. “Since there is a strong binding with the ACE2 receptors, the virus is able to infect and multiply even with a small number of them entering the human body,” she says.

Advocating strongly for the personal distancing, personal hygiene and respiratory hygiene measures recommended by the government, she expresses hope that these measures along with the research happening at a breathtaking speed about vaccine and antiviral medicines for COVID-19 will help us overcome this pandemic in the near future.

“In the roughly three months since the human transmission began, we have known far more about this virus than we knew about other viruses in such a short span of time,” she says.

Game changer

She adds that rapid testing kits, being developed by many companies including at least one in India, which can give instant results and thereby allowing the possibility of testing more people, can also be a game changer on how we tackle this disease.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ox25t6/article31177217.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26KRAPAVITHRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-speed-at-which-virus-is-spreading-is-shocking-says-researcher/article31177218.ece
103,2020/03/27,‘Homam’ being performed in Srikalahasti temple to ward off evil effect,"Priests perform the rituals sans devotees

Even as an increasing number of suspect cases are getting declared positive for COVID-19 infection, temples in Tirupati and Srikalahasti started specific rituals to ward off its evil effects.

On Friday, the second of the five-day Maha Mrutyunjaya Homam at Srikalahastheeswara Devasthanam, priests conducted the ceremony with great devotion, though in the absence of common devotees. The ritual involves offering fire into the altar (Mrutyunjaya Homam), chanting relevant hymns (Mrutyunjaya Japam) and giving a celestial bath to the Shivalinga (Mrutyunjaya Abhishekam). The Homam is generally performed to ensure prosperity and well-being at the global level and health and longevity at the individual level, but coming in the wake of COVID-19 threat, the devasthanam has officially dubbed it as aimed at undoing the negative effects of coronavirus.

This temple is already famous across the world for performing ‘Rahu Ketu Puja’ every day to fight the ‘toxic’ effect of Rahu and Ketu, considered ‘rogue serpents’ among the pantheon of Hindu gods. Moreover, this is the only Saivite shrine in the country to remain open during the solar and lunar eclipse periods, as Lord Shiva in the guise of Srikalahastheeswara at this temple ‘tamed’ the two serpents, which, according to Hindu mythology, cause the eclipse.

Local fests

Meanwhile, the Seethalamba temple, a shrine dedicated to the goddess located on the outskirts of Srikalahasti, recently performed a ritual to ward off viral fevers. It is common for villages to observe their folk festivals during the peak summer months, which are known to cause the spread of fevers and seasonal flu.

Several little-known temples have started conducting rituals, though on a smaller scale. As congregation is banned due to the lockdown, the devout are asked to chant mantras and verses at a designated time from their households.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sha1o6/article31187609.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28-VJ-HOMAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/homam-being-performed-in-srikalahasti-temple-to-ward-off-evil-effect/article31187611.ece
104,2020/03/27,Lockdown: police ‘excesses’ draw flak,"Action demanded against personnel resorting to ‘brutal behaviour’

Videos and photographs of police personnel chasing away people on the roads and beating them mercilessly during the lockdown period, that are going viral on various social media and getting reported in the print and electronic media, have come under sharp criticism from people of various sections, who have condemned the police high-handedness during the ongoing crisis.

In Kurnool district, a youth, in a bid to escape from the chasing policemen, fell down and died on Thursday. The incidents of police wielding lathi on the general public, including women at some places, are being widely resented.

It is being alleged that apart from lower-rung personnel, even some officers of the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) were seen thrashing the public openly on the roads, even during the relaxation hours, i.e. between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m., for purchasing essentials.

“Some policemen are behaving brutally with the public. Many public servants, who are on emergency duties, were beaten up badly. Don't they (police) have families and needs like purchasing vegetables, milk, medicines and other essentials to be met during the lockdown period? Not only the police, several government employees are also on emergencies duties. The courts should immediately intervene and restrain the police,” said a government employee, who allegedly faced 'police excesses' while returning from an emergency call.

DRM writes to Collector

A clerk in the Railway Claims Tribunal, Shyam Sudhir, was allegedly roughed up by the police while returning from duty at Arundelpet bridge a couple of days ago resulting in his tooth getting damaged.

The Guntur Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) has written a letter to the Collector and the Superintendent of Police over the 'inhuman behaviour of the police'. The officers, while expressing concern over the incident, had assured him of preventing such incidents in future.

“We are discharging duties in emergency. Shyam Sudhir even flashed his ID card but the policemen ignored it and beat him severely, and he lost his tooth. Railway officials will stop all essential services, including freight trains, if the situation continues,” a leader of railway employees' union warned.

Essential services

A lineman, Madhava Rao, alleged that the Bhavanipuram SI here had attacked him while he was on his way to attend a breakdown work at Gollapudi.

“I clearly told the SI and the constables that I am a Transco employee and attending a complaint. But the SI wielded his lathi. Police should remember that there are many departments which come under the Essential Services Maintenance Act,” said Mr. Madhava Rao, demanding action against the SI.

“The District Collectors, who have high powers under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, gave a list of essential services and permitted movement of vehicles carrying milk, gas, groceries, vegetables etc. Officials were told not to stop doctors, staff working in services like electricity, petrol pumps and media. But leaving the rules aside, police are thrashing the public,” said an auto driver, who was carrying vegetables to the Rythu Market at the Indira Gandhi Municipal Stadium in Vijayawada.

Commissioner responds

Disapproving of the incidents, Vijayawada Police Commissioner Ch. Dwaraka Tirumala Rao said beating public was not correct and justifiable.

“I appeal to the police to observe restraint. They should explain the situation to the public or register cases against the violators. We gave instructions to the police officers not to manhandle the public,” the Commissioner said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ite8r5/article31187503.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28-VJ-LOCKDOWN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/lockdown-police-excesses-draw-flak/article31187504.ece
105,2020/03/27,Police launch app to track foreign returnees in home isolation,"Details of 7,000 persons registered on first day

In order to identify and quarantine foreign returnees, the Andhra Pradesh police have created an application, ‘House Quarantine App’, on Friday. The details of 7,000 persons who returned to the country from different places have been uploaded on the first day, said Director General of Police D. Gautam Sawang.

“We will collect the details of the remaining people who returned to India from different countries, and upload their names in the app. Their movements will be monitored by geo-tagging their details, and this is one of the main sources through which we can prevent spread of the disease,” Mr. Sawang said.

Police would collect the details through district dash boards and track the movements of the foreign returnees. “Under ‘virtual geo-fencing, if they cross 50 metres distance from their homes, police will get an alert and police teams will rush to the spot immediately,” the DGP explained.

The app was created by Anantapur DIG Kranthi Rana Tata and DIG (Law and Order, Coordination) S.V. Raja Shekar.

Instructions have been given to the Superintendents of Police (SPs) to send the particulars of all foreign returnees to the DGP’s Dash Board immediately.

27,000 returnees

Mr. Raja Shekar said the Bureau of Immigration has forwarded the details of about 27,000 people who returned to different districts in the State, to the respective district Collectors.

“The major source of coronavirus is foreign returnees, who are students, employees, tourists and pilgrims. All the foreign returnees should post their details in the ‘House Quarantine App’, and their movements will be tracked,” Mr. Sawang told The Hindu.

“The Grama Volunteers are on the job of tracing all foreign returnees, who are in ‘home isolation’ by making door-to-door surveys. Already, enrolment of returnees in the app has begun and 100% registrations will be completed by Saturday. If they violate the rules, they will be booked under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897,” the DGP warned.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/police-launch-app-to-track-foreign-returnees-in-home-isolation/article31187398.ece
106,2020/03/27,COVID-19: tribals take traditional route to safety,"They use forest produce with medicinal value to make masks

While people in cities and towns are in a panic due to shortage of masks and gloves, tribal people residing in the Agency areas are making masks with medicinal leaves and following traditional ways to prevent the spread of the dreaded coronavirus.

Tribal people are seen wearing masks made with the forest produce on the Andhra Pradesh-Telangana, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh borders.

“If our ‘gudem’ (hamlet) head gives instructions, we will abide by them at any cost. All women, elders, and children are wearing masks made of leaves. Elders of the community arranged fence at the entrance of the village to prevent entry of outsiders. They are giving tips to improve immunity power at this juncture,” says Majeti Ramulu of Doramamidi village in West Godavari district.

Gotti Koya, Konda Dora, Koya, Kondareddy, Gond and other tribes staying on the borders have been strictly following lockdown and taking preventive measures on their own. Tribal people are preparing masks with medicinal leaves and taking herbal medicines available in the forests.

“Nature is our God. We depend on ‘Adavi talli’ and believe on ‘Vana devatalu’ (Forest goddesses), who protect us in crisis. Our ancestors taught us a lot, particularly the traditions. All our tribes will perform annual jataras and pujas and appeal the God to save us from all diseases and disasters,” says S. Chitti,a tribal woman of Prega village, located on Sukuma border, in East Godavari district.

Complete lockdown

A Lambada tribe, Bhukya Bheema of Kanimerla Thanda in Krishna district, says that all the thandas of Khammam and Bhadradri-Kothagudem districts are self-isolated. “We are not going out from our thanda (hamlet) and lockdown is total in all Lambada thandas,” says Bheema.

“We don’t feel scarcity of masks or hand gloves in forests. Almost all the Koya, Kondareddy, Gotti Koya and other girijan families are experts in preparing medicines with ‘Nirgundi’, ‘Modugu’, ‘Guggilam’, ‘Billedu’, ‘Neem’, ‘Tulasi’, ‘Usiri’ and other leaves, wood, fruits, barks and roots for various health disorders,” says J. Peraiah of Jeelugumilli in West Godavari district.

“Our family heads prepare medicines to prevent contagious diseases, fever, muscle and arthritis pains, jaundice, snake and scorpion bites, stones in kidneys, wounds and swellings, skin diseases, urinary infections, indigestion and other health problems. Now, we are taking country-made medicines to improve resistance power,” says another tribal, Somulu of Yetapaka village.

Many tribal families depend on fishing, forest produce and firewood. ""As there is no transportation and communication has been cut-off to the urban areas, there is no work for us,"" say the tribals.

“The forest produce available from plants and trees and water flowing in streams have medicinal value. We prepare medicines with stem barks, gum paste, flowers, fruits and paste of leaves, dry leaves powder, roots, stems and tender leaves. As per the advice of experts, we take some medicines,” says a tribal leader, Madakam Sanju of Kukunur village in West Godavari district.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/y50qum/article31187349.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28VJTRIBALMASKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/covid-19-tribals-take-traditional-route-to-safety/article31187350.ece
107,2020/03/27,Naidu showers praise on Modi for his steps to contain spread of COVID-19,"He lauds the relief package announced to various sections of society

TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi appreciating his efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus and announcement of the “timely package” of ₹1,75,000 crore providing support to the “frontline warriors” (doctors and other health workers), farmers, poor women, senior citizens, self-help groups, and low wage earners, and increase in the wages of MGNREGA workers.

“Efforts to ensure that no Indian goes to bed with an empty stomach is proof that your government is humanity personified. Roughly, two-thirds of population will benefit from the scheme. Distribution of pulses to ensure that everyone gets proper nourishment is visionary in its thought and action,” Mr. Naidu said in the letter on Friday.

MSME sector

Mr. Naidu said that he would like to draw Mr. Modi’s attention to another sector that works as the backbone of the Indian economy – Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME).

“It is pertinent to provide a financial package to stimulate the economy during these turbulent times. Under your able guidance and smart leadership, we are confident that very soon India will not only recover from the threat of COVID-19 but also bounce back to its rightful place in the global economy,” he said.

Lauding the special package announced to various sections of society, the TDP supremo said that the ₹50 lakh insurance cover for the “frontline warriors” (doctors and other health workers) comes at a right time as a tribute to their sacrifice.

Similarly, providing financial package to the farmers, ex gratia to poor women, free gas cylinders to the poor families, support to the low wage earners in the organised sector, and support to the senior citizens were right steps towards protecting them from the ill-effects of the lockdown, he said.

Extends full support

“India, with its huge diversity and large population is on the edge of COVID-19 threat. However, under your able leadership, India will effectively retaliate the threat and set an example to the rest of the world. In this backdrop, let me reiterate our support to you and your team in tackling the deadly COVID-19,” Mr. Naidu added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/naidu-showers-praise-on-modi-for-his-steps-to-contain-spread-of-covid-19/article31187277.ece
108,2020/03/27,Tension at border as fishermen try to enter A.P. from Karnataka,"Heavy police force deployed to prevent any untoward incident

Tension prevailed on the Chittoor-Karnataka border on Friday when the entry of about 1,500 fishermen of Andhra Pradesh, who were working in the coastal belt of Karnataka, was denied.

The fishermen, mostly hailing from north Andhra Pradesh, engaged a fleet of private vehicles to reach the border in the wake of the lockdown announced to contain COVID-19.

The Palamaner sub-division police said that the first batch of fishermen arrived at the border town of Nangili (in Karnataka), 15-km from Palamaner in Chittoor district, in the morning. The police at the border check-post prevented them from entering the Chittoor district. By afternoon, a large number of vehicles reached the check-post. The huge turnout of fishermen prompted the Chittoor police to deploy heavy contingent of forces to block their way into the district.

Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar, along with senior district officials, rushed to the spot to control the mob frenzy. The police made the fishermen stand in a queue maintaining social distancing and cover their faces with masks and handkerchiefs.

A senior police officer said that the SP, along with the district officials, was camping at Nangili. Considering the huge number of fishermen, heavy police force was deployed to cordon them and prevent any untoward incident.

Screening test

He said the A.P. higher officials had initiated talks with their counterparts in Kolar district of Karnataka to arrange temporary shelters and food for the fishermen, apart from arranging their screening for COVID-19.

In view of the development, the Chittoor police intensified surveillance at all the border check-posts with Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The matter was taken to the notice of DGP Gowtham Sawang and Anantapur range police officials as well.

‘Quarantine them’

A.P. Fisherfolk Foundation chief executive A. Dasu from Vishakapatnam told The Hindu that in view of the lockdown, the fishermen who came from Karnataka should be quarantined and allowed to stay at a relief camp in Chittoor.

“A majority of them hail from the North Andhra region. They should be permitted to move from Chittoor to their native places once the situation improves,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/b4r11t/article31187239.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28VJPG4-FISHERMEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tension-at-border-as-fishermen-try-to-enter-ap-from-karnataka/article31187240.ece
109,2020/03/27,Do not compromise on quarantine procedures: Naidu,"‘Lack of tough measures in the initial stages has done much harm’

TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu on Friday appealed to the State and Central governments to enforce quarantine procedures and lockdown without any compromise considering the looming threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic.

Addressing the media on Friday, Mr. Naidu called upon the people to cooperate with the officials, civic staff and frontline warriors. “This is essential as much harm has already been done due to lack of tough measures to quarantine foreign returnees and affected persons in the initial days of the virus attack,” he said.

“As of now, only the spread of virus is controlled and the focus of the governments should be to come up with new ideas for handling the situation after the end of lockdown on April 14,” he added.

“There is a need to enhance the testing capabilities in the State and elsewhere in the country as it plays a crucial role in understanding the extent of threat. South Korea has the capacity to complete one test in just seven minutes.

110,2020/03/27,Two SVIMS doctors kept under isolation on request,"They had met a doctor who later tested positive for coronavirus

Two doctors of the TTD-run Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences (SVIMS) were placed under isolation at the hospital’s infectious diseases ward here on Friday.

Following the instance of a doctor couple in Hyderabad testing positive, the two SVIMS doctors reportedly volunteered to get themselves isolated, as they had met the doctor who tested ‘positive’ for COVID-19 during an official meeting at SVIMS.

The doctor, who was quarantined in Hyderabad, had visited Tirupati on March 17 and returned home the same evening by flight.

Going by the principle of ‘contact tracing,’ the period for catching infection is calculated at 5.2 days from the day of contact, i.e., March 17.

However, to be doubly sure, the doctors volunteered to get themselves isolated in view of the likelihood of getting susceptible for COVID-19.

Though taken aback at the development, SVIMS authorities collected their samples and sent them for medical examination at the venereal diseases research laboratory.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/two-svims-doctors-kept-under-isolation-on-request/article31187157.ece

The State Cabinet chaired by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy gave its nod for an ordinance to clear the budget for first quarter of the 2020-21 financial year.

The State government, initially, had plans to present vote-on-account budget for the first quarter of the fiscal. The scenario changed with Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing the countrywide lockdown till April 14 in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic.

It was reported in these columns two days ago that the government was mulling the ordinance route for the budget.

Announcing the details on Friday, Information and Public Relations (I &PR) Minister Perni Venkataramaiah (Nani) said that the Cabinet had opted for the ordinance route to clear the budget in the wake of the outbreak of COVID-19.

“Now, it is not possible to convene the budget session in wake of the pandemic, hence the government is going for the ordinance route. The details of the ordinance will be disclosed once Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan gives his nod,” he said.

The Chief Minister held extensive discussions on available medical facilities and strengthening the healthcare system. A high-level monitoring system has been put in place.

To gather the state-level feedback, a task force with five Ministers, 10 senior IAS officers and four officials from the CMO will be formed and it will coordinate with the district-level teams of Ministers and officers, he said.

As many as 12 COVID-19 positive cases have been reported from the State till date. About 28,000 NRIs/foreign returnees have been identified. Four hospitals at Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Tirupati and Nellore each are being converted into dedicated super specialty COVID-19 hospitals, while 100-bed isolation centres are in place at constituency level and 200-bed isolation centres at the district level.

Order placed for equipment

Around 400 ventilators are in place and PPEs (Personal Protection Equipment) surgical masks for patient attendants, along with N95 masks are available. Order has been placed for more equipment which will be delivered in a few days, the Minister said.

The helpline ‘104’ with 60 parallel lines will be active round the clock and healthcare staff will attend to all emergencies. “Village volunteers, along with ANMs, Asha workers and health assistants, are doing their best and people must cooperate by ensuring home isolation and social distancing,” he said.

Mr. Perni Nani further said that the people were requested to take the lockdown seriously and help the government fight the “invisible enemy”.

Stranded people

“It is sad to see that students and others from our State are stranded at other places, but the helplessness of the situation prompts us to say that they have to stay where they are or cross the border and be quarantined for 14 days. The situation is grim. Social distancing is being maintaining during the Cabinet meeting,” the Minister said.

Essential commodities will be available and goods vehicles are permitted to move and the Minister for Fisheries Mopidevi Venkataramana will speak to the aqua exporters for transport of their products, he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ibne0h/article31187132.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28VIJCABINET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ap-cabinet-nod-for-ordinance-to-clear-budget/article31187133.ece

121,2020/03/27,Unsung heroes: people now eagerly await the paper boy,"Mostly students, they begin their task early in the morning

They race against time to ensure that you get your daily dose of news early in the morning along with your Cuppa. A majority of the paper-boys, engaged in door delivery of newspapers across the district, are teenagers who are students from Class X to degree.

Ever since the COVID-19 scare began, the boys have only intensified their speed, and are delivering the newspaper at dawn much to the surprise of the readers, before they could get up from their beds.

Thanks to the deserted highways, newspaper agents receive the vehicles carrying the publications earlier than before. The paper-boys are despatched in no time to ensure the newspaper reaches the readers before sunrise.

Guna Sekhar, 18, who delivers 160 newspapers to households in four streets in Kongareddipalle locality in Chittoor, said that before the COVID-19 scare, he used to take three hours for delivering the copies, but now he accomplishes his task in two hours. “Post-Janata Curfew days, we find the roads and streets completely deserted. This has made our job more focussed on the targets. Earlier, we used to find people in many houses asleep even at 7 a.m.. Now, we see lights on at 5 a.m. As and when we drop the paper inside the compounds, the elderly rush out ot collect it,” he said.

“I am delighted at the speed I have been moving since a week. Now, the parcels are coming early and I too find it a new experience to start early. People are looking at us with admiration for the first time. Finishing my job much early, I retire into confinement for studies,” said Jagdeesh, 15, awaiting his class X examination. He delivers 138 copies in Santhapeta locality.

The boys termed as “unfounded” observations that newspapers could transmit the deadly coronavirus. “Right from the start of the scare in January, none of us in the whole nation has reported to have contracted the virus. We are not even wearing masks. Just like police, doctors and journalists, our job is also unique, more recognised now,” said Velu, 18, a degree II year student, at Nagari.

Several elderly persons who regularly prefer to purchase newspapers after a morning walk have now switched to door delivery. “Scanning a newspaper is my habit since five decades. I have been more active in this since March due to the world pandemic. I am totally free from any sneezing or cough. Moreover, I am thrilled with the pleasant odour of sanitised papers,” said Subramanyam, 70, a resident of temple zone at Srikalahasti, who works at a cycle shop,",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/unsung-heroes-people-now-eagerly-await-the-paper-boy/article31184694.ece

Grid and gaps

People are seen waiting patiently in the allocated grids to buy vegetables, milk and essential goods. Vizianagaram administration was worried with mass gathering at PW market and Rythu Bazars for the couple of days after successful implementation of Janata Curfew on March 22. Then, they realised that the shops were in congested places and they needed to be shifted immediately to vacant places.

Furthre, with the closure of all regular textile shops, the vegetable sellers have been allowed to keep their wares in the respective premises. A huge gap is also ensured among the grids. With the constant vigilance from police personnel, no customer dare violate the norm.

128,2020/03/27,Fire in Seshachalam forest sparks tension,"Officials suspect the blaze to be the handiwork of mischievous elements

Fire in the Seshachalam forest area caused palpable tension in Tirupati on Thursday.

The hills to the north-east side of Tirupati were engulfed in flames, which slowly spread to the upper portions, making the suburban areas feel the heat.

The fire only aggravated the situation that had arisen following the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Many residents of Jeevakona and Satyanarayanapuram reached their roof-top and watched the raging fire spread upwards. A few persons captured the same on their mobile phones.

Authorities from the Forest Ddepartment’s Tirupati Wildlife Division rushed 40 personnel to the spot.

‘It’s man-made’

The TTD’s Forest Department deployed 25 personnel from its side to tame the fire.

Though the fire was believed to have been caused by the scorching summer heat, the forest officials believe it to be the handiwork of mischievous elements venturing into the forest area from Jeevakona for fun, or anti-social activities.

“It is not a forest fire, but a manmade fire in forest area,” Divisional Forest Officer (Tirupati Wildlife Division) M. Nagarjuna Reddy said.

The terrain is hard to reach and no vehicle (four-wheelers or fire tenders) can be taken closer to the spot.

“Only fire-beating is possible here,” he pointed out. Fire-beating is a process of hitting the burning trees and shrubs in the jungle with the help of coconut fronds.

As reports last came in, the forest staff zeroed in on most of the raging areas and tried to bring down the fire, though it started spreading upwards.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/7dzurx/article31178690.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27VJPG4-FIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/fire-in-seshachalam-forest-sparks-tension/article31178691.ece

Karnataka recorded the third COVID-19 death on Friday, with a 65-year-old resident of Tumakuru, who did not have any foreign travel history, succumbing to the infection.

The other two were a 70-year-old in Kalaburagi and a 70-year-old woman from Gauribidnur, both with a travel history to Saudi Arabia.

The Tumakuru patient had travelled to Delhi and had stayed there for five days along with 13 others. The Health Department is in the process of contact-tracing to figure out how he was infected. Denying that there is community transmission in the State, Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education) told presspersons on Friday that “although three cases have no foreign travel history, their relatives may be having contact history”.

In all, Friday saw nine new cases, including a 10-month-old baby who had travelled to Kerala along with its parents, being detected in the State, taking the total number to 64. These include three deaths and five persons who were discharged after recovery. A techie and his daughter from Bengaluru, who had tested positive, were discharged on Friday.

Travel history

The 65-year-old who died on Friday had travelled to Delhi from Tumakuru by train on March 5 along with 13 persons. He stayed at Jamia Masjid in Delhi, went to attend a three-day convention organised at the masjid, returned to Bengaluru by train, and travelled in a KSRTC bus to Sira on March 14. He had stayed at home, visited a private hospital, later got admitted to Tumakuru district government hospital on March 23, but got himself discharged against medical advice. He returned to Tumakuru district government hospital on March 23 where he was kept in isolation and tested.

Now, 20 members of his family have been kept under quarantine, besides all the people who came in touch with him, including doctors. A red alert has been declared in Sira. An area within 3 km radius of the patient’s house has been declared as red zone and a 5-km area from his house has been declared a buffer zone.

A total of 56 positive patients are in quarantine facilities in various hospitals in the State. Of these, 39 are from Bengaluru alone. The new cases include three female patients, including two contacts, aged 33 and 35, and a domestic help, who had earlier tested positive.

132,2020/03/27,COVID-19: Lockdown triggers reverse migration in Karnataka,"The 21-day lockdown in place to curb the spread of COVID-19 has resulted in the reverse migration of a large number of daily wage workers and people employed in the unorganised sector.

People in hundreds from Mysuru and Bengaluru cities have returned to their villages ever since the COVID-19 fallout began to unfold early this month. However, it reached a peak a day before the 21-day lockdown was announced.

Also, the four-hour window between Prime Minister Narendra Modi making the announcement — at 8 p.m. on March 24 — and the lockdown being implemented — at midnight — saw many workers leave in private vehicles to their villages.

There is hardly a village in Mysuru district where men had not abandoned agriculture and migrated to urban areas in search of greener pastures. “A majority of them were daily wage workers in the construction sector, and many have now returned home,” said Puttamadhu, of the State Agricultural Workers’ Union. “K.M. Doddi village in Mandya district, where I live, has scores of families with at least one member who has returned in view of the lockdown.”

This is also true for villages in the H.D. Kote-Nanjangud-Chamarajanagar belt, from where a large number of men tend to migrate to Mysuru, Kodagu and the adjoining bordering States of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in search of work in plantations. But the reverse migration started to kick in once the curbs began to be announced. “Many workers took a cue from the ‘Janata Curfew’ and managed to return within the short window they had before the nationwide lockdown came into effect. But workers in hundreds are still stranded, unable to return to their villages owing to the suspension of transportation,” said Atahalli Devaraj, of the Karnataka State Sugarcane Cultivators’ Association.

Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of the association, said that even people who had left their villages about 20 years ago have returned in large numbers and rejoined their families, and this has resulted in a problem of another sort. “There is a glut of labour force in rural areas. The agricultural season is over and there is no farm work. Also, none of those who returned are adept at agriculture-related work, and hence they will be without employment till normality returns,” he said. The only silver lining, he said, is that they are with their families and will not go hungry.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dczqgu/article31186137.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGMIGRATIONNEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-lockdown-triggers-reverse-migration-in-karnataka/article31186138.ece

The child, from Sajipanadu village in Bantwal taluk, was suffering from fever and severe acute respiratory illness, and was admitted to a private hospital in Mangaluru on March 23. The child’s throat swab was sent for COVID-19 testing the next day and the result came back positive, a release from Ramachandra Bayari, District Health and Family Welfare Officer, said on Friday. The child’s condition is said to be stable.

All of Sajipanadu village has been quarantined as a precaution, with no one being allowed to enter or leave the village. The close relatives of the child are also under observation, and the process of contact tracing is on, the release said.

Meanwhile, a State government bulletin on COVID-19 said stated that the child had no history of travel to virus-hit countries. However, as per the preliminary investigation, the child had been taken to Kerala. A detailed investigation is in progress and six primary contacts have been traced and are under home quarantine. The child is now isolated at a designated hospital.

Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education) Jawaid Akhtar dismissed the possibility of this being a case of community transmission and said, “Maybe an infected person or a contact held the baby [in Kerala].

135,2020/03/27,Jail inmates make reusable masks,"Inmates of the Hindalaga Central Prison are making COVD-19 masks for personnel in government departments. And, at ₹ 6 per mask, it is the cheapest personal protection gear in the market.

Under the wage earning scheme, the inmates are making 2,000-2,500 masks per day. They have sold around 10,000 masks to various government departments.

The mask is made out of sanitised cloth that is usually used to make gloves and operation theatre attire. It has two layers, a sky blue outer layer and a white cloth lining inside. The outer layer is folded multiple times to create pleats. Two long strips of cloth that are folded and stitched serve as strings with which the mask is tied to the ears.

“Our masks are as safe as the synthetic ones. Doctors have certified them,” according to Jail Superintendent of Hindalaga Krishna Kumar. The mask can be reused after washing with soap water.

Prison authorities have opened a stall near the entrance of the jail on the outskirts of Belagavi where the masks are sold. “Till now we used our capacity to cater to the demand from government departments. But we are now producing enough to sell them to others,” the Superintendent said.

There are 42 sewing machines in the prison’s employment cell and nearly 100 inmates take turns to work on the machines. Around 1,800-2,000 masks are made in the men’s section and around 300-500 are made in the women’s wing. Each worker is paid a prescribed wage of ₹ 150 per day. “We are providing an incentive of ₹ 1 more for every mask made after the first 100 and ₹ 2 for every mask made after 250,’’ Mr. Kumar said.

Superintendent of Police Lakshman Nimbargi has suggested that organisations engaged in essential goods supply and industries working during the lockdown to purchase masks for their workers from the jail premises.

Hindalga is one of the largest correctional centres in the State and houses around 800 undertrial prisoners and offenders servicing sentences. Undertrials are not covered under the wage earning scheme.

The party has also decided to set up a helpline to provide support to those in need during the lockdown. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee working president Saleem Ahmed is the convener of the task force.

The task force will monitor all the programmes of the State and Union governments and work to see that all those programmes reach the needy. The District Congress Committee and Block Congress Committee presidents will monitor relief works in their jurisdictions, a KPCC release said.

APMC yards

Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah welcomed some of the relief measures undertaken by the Union government and suggested that the State government issue an order on opening APMC yards to enable farmers to sell their produce. Most of the produce of farmers is perishable and, thus, it is necessary to keep APMC yards and markets open, he said.

Addressing the media after the meeting, he said, “Prime Minister Modi spoke to me at 9.30 a.m. and observed that several people were still moving around in Karnataka, in spite of the lockdown. He asked the State government to ensure effective implementation of the lockdown restrictions.”

“We have discussed all the measures to be taken to handle the situation. The district in-charge Ministers have been asked to take complete responsibility in ensuring that all the measures are in place to curb the pandemic,” he said.

145,2020/03/27,Arrest those roaming without valid reason: Yediyurappa,"‘People should buy essential commodities only in their own localities’

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who held a videoconference with all Deputy Commissioners on Thursday, directed district administrations across the State to reserve at least 50 hospital beds in every district for isolation. He ordered a strict lockdown for the remaining 20 days and directed police officials to even arrest those seen roaming around without a valid reason.

“Only those with passes issued by the administration and in case of emergencies are allowed to travel. People are allowed to buy essential supplies from neighbourhood shops in their localities and cannot travel to other localities,” Mr. Yediyurappa said at the meeting. He said this would not only help small traders during these tough times but also restrict movement of people.

‘Keep clinics open’

While movement of essential goods have been exempted from this lockdown, he asked officials to take punitive action against those found inflating prices of essential commodities. He also issued orders that all clinics have to be open all days and action should be initiated against any clinic shut.

Mr. Yediyurappa also asked officials to explore suitable measures to set-off EMI payments of bank loans in the State for a few months. However, no order was issued on this.

148,2020/03/27,Learning in the times of a pandemic,"A look at some educational platforms supporting learning amid the worldwide lockdown to help students carry on learning when forced to stay at home

The coronavirus pandemic has led to a surge in online learning. Typically, it takes months, if not years, to develop an engaging online platform. For many traditional institutions, particularly those that have been slower to embrace online education, the challenge is even more formidable.

For inspiration in creating digital learning plans and communicating them effectively to students and parents, educators can utilise a number of tech tools and digital platforms. Here are some popular platforms that can be useful learning tools during the current situation:

Google for Education is a turnkey web-based tool specifically designed for teachers to use to manage their classes online. Educators can add resources, post tasks and assignments, and interact with students as they progress through lessons, among many other convenient features.

Brainly is the world’s largest online learning platform, uniting over 150 million students, parents, and teachers around the world, and over 20 million across India, in solving their homework problems and test preparation. Students connect to their peers to help strengthen their skills, from math to science, history and beyond. The platform essentially acts as the online equivalent of a real-life study group.

Byju’s is a learning app for students across age groups with programmes in English and Hindi that make learning and understanding concepts easier for school kids. The subject focus of the platform is math and science, and the concepts are explained using 12-20 minute digital animated videos. The platform recently announced its decision to make its app free for all students until the end of April.

Unacademy provides education through video classes, PowerPoint presentations, and other materials to help government job aspirants prepare for competitive exams. Its faculty consists of students who have cleared various exams and mentors who have extensive teaching experience. It has offered 20,000 live classes free for those preparing for the UPSC, banking, railways and other entrance exams.

TeachNext@HomeSolutions provides experiential learning through audiovisual content, helping students to learn from the comfort of their homes. The platform helps students clarify doubts, revise concepts, and reinforce their learning through content that can be accessed on laptops, desktops and tablets.",education,https://www.thehindu.com/education/3o275v/article31180124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/32386,https://www.thehindu.com/education/learning-in-the-times-of-a-pandemic/article31180125.ece
149,2020/03/27,Streamlining digital content,"With COVID-19 wreaking havoc and students having to rely on virtual classrooms for e-Learning, a policy framework for digital training is the need of the hour

The global outbreak of the Coronavirus has caught us completely off guard, so much so that even our day-to-day activities have been disrupted. Governments around the world have been forced to shut down schools, colleges, offices, and all means of people-to-people contact. This pandemic has shown us many loopholes in our education system and has compelled us to re-evaluate the current educational framework.

Many EdTech solution providers have come forward to lend a hand to students by offering unrestricted access to their platforms. While the gesture is noteworthy, these measures may not be enough to deliver regulated and structured continuity in education. There is an urgent need to address these issues through policy-level changes and creating a policy framework that blends online education with traditional teaching methods.

Policy framework

In the last few years, with easy access to high-speed Internet services and increased availability of affordable handsets, digitisation has become an integral part of the operations of many important sectors. Having been a part of numerous initiatives in the educational ecosystem over the years, I can only stress on an all-encompassing knowledge distribution being as essential as the traditional teaching methods and blended learning is the only logical way forward. Fortunately, it has found takers in the education sector too and as a result of this, several EduTech platforms have emerged and are collectively working towards devising smart learning techniques to make education relevant and productive. Thankfully, the government also understands and emphasises on the importance of digital learning and has announced a bunch of commendable initiatives in the Union Budget to encourage digital learning for higher education. For instance, top 100 nationally ranked institutions have been asked to prepare a curriculum for degree level online courses. These measures now need to be extended to K12 education as well to support e-Learning and ensure seamless learning experiences at all stages of a student’s life.

Especially in scenarios like the current one where remote-learning is the only way to keep the students on track with their studies, the amalgamation of e-Learning platforms and mainstream curriculum is the need of the hour. An advisory committee and task force comprising educationists, school management, service providers, academicians, EdTech providers, and government representatives need to be invited to share their expertise to create more effective and extensive education policies. The inclusion of e-Learning right from the primary level to professional courses is the only way to avoid disruption in the system, if faced with a similar crisis in the future.

Public-private partnerships have been proved to be effective in many sectors and the same concept can be applied in education too. The EdTech companies can be invited to share their technical expertise to create the curriculums which are more effective and advanced in terms of applications.

Needless to say, digital intervention needs to be included across all boards to avoid any kind of discrepancies, especially since state-boards are still following the age-old curriculum and teaching technique even today and have been proven inadequate when they go for higher studies. Making digital learning a mandatory part of the mainstream teaching will automatically provide a uniform standard.

And finally, since we are talking about an overall modernisation of the teaching processes, there is a dire need for modernisation of teacher training courses as well. Only the well-informed and well-equipped teachers can ensure the prosperity of our future generation.

150,2020/03/27,These apps will help you get more organised amid the COVID-19 lockdown,"Colleges are shut, schools are closed, and events are postponed. Be it a lockdown or a self-quarantine, everyone is confined to their homes. Many of you might have thought at some point that this will be the time you will be more productive, learn a new skill, catch up on studies or even just relax and spend some quality time with family. However, on most days, you find yourselves curled up in bed, binge watching some television series. Here are two apps that will get you out of your reverie and help you get more organised.

Boosted

This productivity tracker app lets the user organise their activities and tracks how much time they spent on each project. If the activities are too time-taking and overwhelming, they can be broken down into smaller tasks in the app so that they do not appear daunting. The user can get reports on a daily or weekly basis to understand how productive they have been. A chronological timeline of the activities and time they took can also be viewed. This free app ensures all the data is backed up into the user’s Google Drive.

(https://bit.ly/39jbiHu)

Productive

The app comes with a to-do list feature that can be used to make lists for the day, week or month. Tasks can be scheduled for any time of the day and reminders will be set accordingly. Having a colourful scheme might help some people focus more. Productive lets the user customise their name, habit and tasks in any colour they want. The completed habits or tasks can be arranged in a motivating chain so that every time the user is feeling a bit lazy, this can act as an incentive. The tasks can also be broken down into smaller activities and timeframes can be set for them.

151,2020/03/27,In the start-up nation,"It is pleasantly surprising to see how this small Mediterranean country is offering unprecedented opportunities to international students.

When I first arrived at the Weizmann Institute of Science (WIS), Tel Aviv, in May 2013 as a summer trainee, little did I know that I will be spending a good part of my life in Israel. There is some inexplicable aura of scientific aptitude in the beautiful campus nestled just outside the bustling city of Tel Aviv. It was rather an easy decision to return for a Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics at the institute after graduating with an Integrated BS-MS in Biology from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Kolkata.

Unparalleled quality

WIS is a rather unusual destination for graduate school, as compared to other major schools in the U.S. and Europe as it offers only MSc and Ph.D. programmes in natural sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics/CS, Biology). Quite naturally, the student/post-doc body is compact leading to thought-provoking scientific conversations, often leading to interesting scientific collaborations. In addition to roughly 250 professors across 18 departments, there are numerous staff scientists, many of whom serve as an immediate source of guidance and mentorship.

Weizmann supports services for almost all major advanced scientific tools and techniques. This enables the students and other researchers to answer tough questions. For instance, discoveries at the institute have enabled the treatment of diseases such as multiple sclerosis, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and lymphoma. Not only is the quality of science unparalleled, but also, Weizmann Institute is a great place to work. The continual support of the mostly English-speaking administrative staff makes it probably the best place to be for an international student in Israel.

Co-curricular activities

Outside the lab, the institute provides ample opportunities for personal and professional growth. There are multiple student clubs such as Entrepreneurship, Debate and LGBTQ clubs that train students with various hard and soft skills such as innovation, management and persuasive speaking. In fact, I have been involved in establishing the Weizmann Biotech Club, which is a forum for Ph.D. students and post-docs to interact with life-science industry leaders, learn about the industry trends and provide career development support.

Finally, Israel is a great place to begin one’s professional career. It is known to be the “start up nation” and provides a plethora of opportunities to engage with the booming innovation ecosystem of the country for aspiring technology entrepreneurs.

Israel is opening its doors to foreign entrepreneurs with the recent launch of an innovation visa, that comes with generous support from the Israel Innovation Authority.

152,2020/03/27,"Border closed, woman gives birth in ambulance","People of Kasaragod face virtual isolation after Karnataka closes border with Kerala

The Karnataka police, who have imposed heavy restrictions on vehicles from Kerala in the border villages, are proving a nightmare for people from Kasaragod.

In the absence of better infrastructure and hospitals, the people of Kasaragod are forced to travel to Mangaluru for all their needs, including medical treatment. However, with restrictions in place on the border, those requiring even emergency medical care are compelled to return.

On Friday, a pregnant woman gave birth to a child inside an ambulance after the vehicle was stopped by the Karnataka police. She was sent back from Talapady on the Kerala-Karnataka border. Gowri Devi, a native of Patna in Bihar, residing at Kunchathur in Kasaragod, delivered the baby when the ambulance reached Manjeswaram on its way back.

Both the mother and the child were shifted to the Kasaragod General Hospital and are reported to be safe.

Several roads connecting Kasaragod villages to Karnataka have been closed. The situation is no different at Enmakaje, another village near the border.

Aithappa Naika, ward member of Delampady grama panchayat, said there were four roads in the ward connecting villages to Karnataka. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the roads were completely blocked by the Karnataka government.

“Life on this side of the border has become miserable as we have no access to good hospitals and other facilities,” he added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/border-closed-woman-gives-birth-in-ambulance/article31187672.ece
153,2020/03/27,Police step up surveillance with innovative facilities,"No-touch pass verification facility to avoid physical contact with public

The police in association with the Health Department have intensified steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through innovative methods like no-touch pass verification facility and geo-fencing technology in the district.

“We have launched a no-touch pass verification facility at the Kalpetta police station to ensure minimum physical contact with the public,” District Police Chief R. Ilanko told The Hindu. The police can now verify self-declaration forms and other documents using mobile phones. It will not only ensure the safety of police officers but also that of the public, he added. “We are also using geo-fencing technology to monitor the movement of high-risk persons in home quarantine,” he said. According to Mr. Ilanko, as many as 27 teams have been engaged on nine State border check posts, including five on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border and four on the Kerala-Karnataka border under the supervision of three DySPs. Four flying squads have also been constituted in the border areas to keep a tab on the arrival of people from other States through forest paths. Special teams have been constituted under the supervision of two DySPs to check four inter-district borders. Road block picket teams for random checking have also set up at all the 16 police stations in the district, he said.

The Janamaithri police have been directed to sensitise the public, including tribal people, and disbursing soaps, handwash, and masks in remote tribal settlements, Mr. Ilanko said. They will also monitor the movement of people in home quarantine and maintain a record of primary and secondary contacts.

154,2020/03/27,Threat of price rise looms large in State,"Stocks dwindle as freight movement from other States comes to a standstill

The spectre of a steep rise in commodity prices loomed large in Kerala on the third consecutive day of the COVID-19 lockdown on Thursday.

Major importers of pulses, edible oil and foodgrain said they foresaw an imminent shortage of provisions as the lockdown had hit cargo movement, warehouse and port activities severely.

Pottuvelu Subramanian, head of one of the oldest trading houses in the State, said the shortage of labour and lack of transport had hobbled the efforts of wholesale merchants to get supplies trucked in from other States. For instance, urad dal (uzhunnu), was at a premium. There were few workers to process the staple and parcel the graded pulses to Kerala from production centres.

Truckers’ plight

Truckers were reluctant to ferry goods to Kerala for fear of being detained indefinitely at inter-State checkpoints. They were sceptical about the availability of food given the closure of wayside eateries and lodges. Green gram imports from Australia, meant to make up for the dip in local availability in summer, were languishing in ports. So were palmolein shipments from Malaysia.

Traders said transporters would charge a hefty penalty as demurrage on importers for the delay in unloading the shipments. Ultimately, traders would pass on the extra cost to consumers. A rise in the price of essential commodities appeared difficult to fend off.

R.S. Manikantan, a wholesale potato and onion merchant, said the Tamil Nadu Police had closed down markets and warehouses in Dindigul and Madurai. The existing stocks were fast dwindling. Provision stores found it difficult to open for business with the police unwilling to issue passes to staff. Moreover, the police often turned away buyers.

G. Sanal, general secretary, All India LPG Distributors Federation (Kerala Circle), said lack of delivery persons had hit cooking gas delivery in the State. The federation has requested the government to issue protective gear and travel permits to gas agency staff.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the government would operate fleets of trucks on a convoy basis to help wholesalers import essential commodities in other regions and free up provisions and pulses languishing in seaports. He warned traders against hiking the prices of commodities or creating artificial shortage to squeeze profits. He told traders that restrictions on home delivery woule be eased soon.

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran told The Hindu that the government was striving hard to prevent a shortage of supplies. The State was in touch with Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to ensure unimpeded movement of freight lorries.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vsf9tj/article31187498.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27TVBIGBAZAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/threat-of-price-rise-looms-large-in-state/article31187499.ece
155,2020/03/27,CM takes up border closure with Modi,"Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday said he was dismayed that the neighbouring Karnataka had constructed earth embankments across roads to wall off Kerala almost permanently from that State at the time of the COVID-19 crisis that has affected both the regions gravely.

Mr. Vijayan said he had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the development. He said Karnataka had violated the Centre’s directive to keep inter-State borders open for emergency traffic and freight during the nationwide lockdown. Chronically ill persons in Kasaragod, considered a high-risk epidemic locality, depend heavily on medical facilities in neighbouring Mangaluru in Karnataka for a range of treatments, including dialysis and cancer care.

Mr. Vijayan said the Karnataka authorities had piled inter-State border roads high with mud at multiple points on its side, hindering the movement of ambulances and essential freight. Chief Secretary Tom Jose had raised the issue with his counterpart in Karnataka.

In some localities, the earthwork constructed by Karnataka encroach upon Kerala’s territory.

Mr. Vijayan said Mr. Modi had spoken to him over the phone in the morning. “The PM has appreciated the efforts by Kerala to combat the pandemic that has brought great Western powers to their knees. Mr. Modi said Kerala could approach him at any time,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gbpt1k/article31187293.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200327-WA0007,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cm-takes-up-border-closure-with-modi/article31187294.ece
156,2020/03/27,Indians stranded at Dubai airport plead for help,"‘They are left in open space without any protective gear’

Sharan Nair has never felt so helpless in his life.

If the news that his mother was not keeping well in Moscow was not bad enough, things turned even worse when his father got stranded at the Dubai airport where he continues to languish with 22 other fellow Indians for the past five days.

“The airport remains closed and the group of Indians, including my father, are stranded in the common area. They have been desperately trying to reach out to the Indian Consul General in Dubai and the Ministry of External Affairs to help them out. But authorities haven't done anything yet,” said Sharan, who lives at Kadavanthra here. His father, 55-year-old Rajendran Nair, was with him till last week when he had to hurry back to Moscow after being told that his wife was not well. The elderly couple are settled in Moscow, where Mr. Nair has been running a hotel business for the past three decades.

He flew from Kochi to Dubai from where he was to take the flight to Minsk in Belarus via Moscow. He flew out by the Emirates flight EK 531 and reached Dubai on March 22.

‘In no man's land’

“By the time he took the flight to Dubai, Russia had already closed its borders but flights in transit were permitted. So he had planned to fly all the way to Minsk, which was still open, and then drive his way back to Moscow. But Russia banned entry even to flights in transit, thus leaving him stranded at Dubai,” said Sharan.

Now, Mr. Nair and the other Indians are literally left in no man's land. With India in a nationwide lockdown, they cannot fly back to the country while the Russian borders also remain sealed.

“I am communicating with my father at irregular intervals as a continuous contact is not possible. Along with the airport, all the eateries there also remain shut, making access to food tough. None of them are sick yet. But left in an open space without any protective gear like masks, they are highly vulnerable,” Sharan said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/indians-stranded-at-dubai-airport-plead-for-help/article31187072.ece
157,2020/03/27,Lending a patient ear to keep their spirits up,"Psychosocial intervention to address mental health issues of people in quarantine

Every day since February 3, Remya Raj has at least one person shouting at her over the phone. As she calmly tries to reason with the person on the other end, they often hang up on her. But she is not disheartened, as they almost always call back sooner than later requesting help.

Ms. Raj, a psychiatric social worker in Kozhikode, is among 679 counsellors trying to perk up the sagging spirits of COVID-19 suspected people in quarantine and those under treatment in isolation wards across the State.

56,243 sessions

They held 56,243 tele-counselling sessions till evening on Friday.

Psychosocial intervention to address the mental health issues of such people is one of 18 critical areas identified by the State and monitored from the State control room. Its importance gauged well during the Ockhi cyclone and the recent floods, 200 counsellors have been assigned to talk to quarantined people in the initial days of the COVID-19 threat. But the number has grown exponentially since.

“Social isolation and stigma associated with the pandemic troubled many in the initial days, but that has now given way to anxiety, as they get to hear about the situation in Italy, the U.K. and the like,” says P.S. Kiran, State nodal officer (mental health programme).

Counsellors are located across the State and each team comprising a psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, psychiatric social worker and a regular social worker functioning under the District Mental Health Programme starts making calls every morning.

With the number of people in quarantine growing to a staggering 1.1 lakh, more counsellors are being drafted into the mission daily. “We have also added counsellors from the National Health Mission and the Women and Child Development Department,” says Dr. Kiran.

Under stress

“People in quarantine are often sleep-deprived, frustrated and under stress. If that’s left unattended, they just go into depression or a flare-up. So we give them a helpline number too, on which they can seek reach out to us. Each district has a dedicated helpline for this. And, in certain cases, we advise treatment.

159,2020/03/27,Muted kavutheendal at Kodungalloor temple,"Ritual performed on Friday with just one person

There were no frenzied mobs of devotees. Oracles, in trance with their bleeding foreheads smeared with sandal and turmeric, did not dance hysterically brandishing their swords with bells.

For the first time in history, the kavutheendal ceremony of the Meena Bharani festival at Sri Kurumba Bhagavathy Temple, Kodungalloor, was observed on Friday sans the usual volatile celebrations.

In the wake of the lockdown declared by the government to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the kavutheendal ritual, considered the largest congregation of oracles in the world, was observed on Friday with just one person.

Palakka Velan Devidasan, representative of the Velan community, did the kavutheendal (polluting the temple) ritual. It is a ritual based on the notions of purity/impurity inherent in Brahminical Hinduism. According to popular narratives, Sri Kurumba Bhagavathy is identified with Kannagi of Silappathikaram and also with the Kali-Darika story, part of Bhagavathy cult in Kerala.

On Friday, Ragunandanan Raja, representative of the royal family of Kodungalloor, reached the temple by 8 a.m. Considering the special situation, he walked to the temple, avoiding the palanquin, the usual practice of celebration, and gave permission for pujas.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/le819/article31187038.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/photostudio1585315400033,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/muted-kavutheendal-at-temple/article31187039.ece
160,2020/03/27,Community spread in Kasaragod unlikely,"CUK to be converted to hospital

The number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise in Kasaragod district with more samples testing positive for the viral infection.

On Friday, 34 samples tested positive, taking the number of patients under treatment for the disease to 81 in the district.

Amid concerns whether community spread is imminent in the district, District Surveillance Officer A.T. Manoj said of the 34 cases, 22 had returned from Dubai, while 12 were primary contacts of infected patients. He said the infected persons comprised 25 men and nine women.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had on Thursday asserted that community spread had not been established in the district.

Mr. Vijayan said on Friday that though it might seem like COVID-19 transmission was surging in the State, it should be remembered that most positive cases had been reported in people who were already in quarantine. However, it was indeed worrisome that some of these patients seemed to have travelled extensively before they were quarantined.

The Kasaragod district health administration was awaiting test results of 308 samples. While 5,982 were in home quarantine, 103 were in isolation wards in hospitals. Mr. Manoj said there was nothing to panic and the situation was under control. “People have to take extra precautions by remaining inside their houses and obeying the instructions issued by the district administration,” he added.

The Chief Minister said in the State capital that considering the huge number of cases in Kasaragod, efforts were on at a war footing to get the medical college building there functional. Steps were being taken to fill the vacancies in the Health Services as soon as possible

Considering the serious situation prevailing in the district, the government had decided to convert the Central University of Kerala (CUK) in Kasaragod to a COVID-19 treatment centre. “All laboratory facilities are there, but we need permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research for testing there. We are awaiting that,” Mr. Vijayan said.

In the wake of the rise in number of COVID-19 patients in the district, Inspector General of Police Vijay Sakhare reiterated that stringent action would be taken against those jumping home quarantine.

He said such people would be forcibly shifted to isolation wards arranged by the government. He said the number of people venturing out violating the lockdown restrictions had come down in the district.

In Kannur

Meanwhile, two more persons tested positive for COVID-19 in Kannur on Friday. Officials said they had returned from Dubai. They hailed from Shivapuram and Mokeri in the district.

A total of 10,151 people were under observation. Of this 87 were in hospitals, including 43 in Kannur Government Medical College Hospital, 19 at District Government Hospital, and 25 at Thalassery General Hospital.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/niq4dj/article31187717.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28TVKA-CUK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/community-spread-in-kasaragod-unlikely/article31187016.ece
161,2020/03/27,709 foreign tourists still stranded in the State,"List compiled through FRRO and from ‘Form C’

As many as 709 foreign tourists from 83 nations who came for holidaying and Ayurveda treatment in Kerala continue to remain stranded following a ban on international flights as part of the COVID-19 containment measures.

With the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) announcing that international flight operations will resume only after the 21-day nationwide lockdown, their option to return home before April 15 is limited to evacuation by the respective countries by chartered flights. The holidayers include those from the U.S., the U.K., China, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, Egypt, Spain, Canada, Japan, Australia, South Africa, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka.

Kerala Tourism has compiled the list through the office of the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) and from the ‘Form C’ submitted by hotels and guest houses.

Visas extended

The visas that had expired have been extended to enable tourists to stay here till arrangements are made for their safe return, sources in the FRRO said. Kerala Tourism, health authorities, and the police are keeping a tab on them. The highest number of 184 stranded foreigners is in Malappuram district, followed by 123 in Thrissur, and 100 in Thiruvananthapuram.

The operation of a chartered flight from Thiruvananthapuram to Germany to enable the return of 150 German tourists housed in Ayurvedic resorts and yoga centres in 11 districts has been postponed to March 31.

Efforts are on to evacuate 175 stranded Russian tourists by the first week of April. “Most of them are women and youngsters and the majority are at Varkala. We have created a WhatsApp group for them to interact among themselves and with us. The services of a Russian psychologist has been made available for them,” Honorary Consul of Russia Ratheesh C. Nair told The Hindu.

162,2020/03/27,Freight traffic via check-posts picks up in Kerala,"Number of trucks that reached the State goes up from 573 on Wednesday to 948 on Thursday

The arrival of essential goods and commodities through the 19 check-posts on the State borders has picked up following a series of steps taken by the government to ensure that the COVID-19 containment measures do not affect freight movement.

But, the concern is the restrictions being imposed by Karnataka that has put a cap on the movement of only 60 vehicles through a check-post and hurdles such as creating soil embankments on the inter-State roads at Makkoottam. Efforts to remove the earth across the roads did not succeed despite several rounds of parleys.

Though Tamil Nadu has said that there will be no restriction on the movement of goods to Kerala, official sources said it was not percolating to the ground level and hurdles were being faced by trucks transporting goods. The war room set up for COVID-19 is monitoring the situation.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the government will operate fleets of cargo trucks cyclically and on a convoy basis to ensure that essential supplies, including foodgrains, reached the State unimpeded from production centres across the borders. Traders feared an imminent shortage of supplies if the authorities did not help restore essential freight traffic to pre-curfew levels urgently. The government has asked the Centre to release provisions, including pulses and edible oil, to include in grocery kits for COVID-19-affected persons.

Freight movement through the 19 check-posts is picking up over the last few days with the number of trucks going up from 573 on March 25 to 948 on March 26. The truck movement was 2,340 on February 25 and 2,158 on February 26.

Measures by Railways

Southern Railway has taken steps to move commodities. The major goods sheds for handling foodgrains at Palakkad, Edakkad, Karunagapally, Kottayam, and Kazhakuttam are being used.

In order to ensure the smooth operation of the supply chain of essential commodities, Southern Railway is running an average of 25 trains daily against a daily average of 80 under normal situation. On March 26, 57,000 tonnes of foodgrains, petroleum products, lignite, and coal were unloaded.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vv5sqp/article31186985.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tv-Vehicle-movements-REVcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/freight-traffic-via-check-posts-picks-up/article31186986.ece
163,2020/03/27,Sabarimala temple festival deferred,"For the first time in its history, the 10-day annual festival at the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple, scheduled to begin on March 29, has been deferred. The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) has postponed the festival following the nationwide lockdown to contain COVID-19. The history of the festival traces back to the installation of the holy mast on the temple premises in 1965, say Tantris (chief priests) Kandararu Rajeevararu and Kandararu Maheswararu Mohanararu.

The festival was scheduled to begin with the customary flag-hoisting ceremony on March 29 and end with the ceremonial arat in the Pampa river on April 7.

Mr. Rajeevararu told The Hindu on Friday that the temple custodian and the Tantri have the freedom to defer the annual festival and there is nothing wrong in the decision. Earlier, the festival used to be celebrated during the 41-day Mandalam pilgrimage season. However, it was changed by the board chaired by G. Raman Nair 10 years ago, as festival rites such as Utsavabali had been posing problems to the pilgrims for holy darshan.

The TDB decision to conduct the 10-day festival in connection with Painguni Uthram, believed to be the birth star of the deity, in the Malayalam month of Meenom (March-April) was made in consultation with the then Tantri Kandararu Mohanararu and astrologers (devaprasnom), Mr. Rajeevararu said.

164,2020/03/27,"In a single-day surge, 39 more test positive","Kasaragod accounts for 34 cases

COVID-19 cases rose again in the State with the reporting of 39 new positive cases on Friday. The highest in a single-day surge.

Kasaragod district accounted for 34 of these cases while two are from Kannur. One case each was reported from Kollam, Thrissur, and Kozhikode.

Of the 39 cases, 25 are people who returned from Dubai and 13 cases are all contacts of imported cases in Kasaragod. The source details of one case is still being ascertained. Though it might seem like COVID-19 transmission is surging in the State, it should be remembered that all 39 positive cases have been reported in people who are already under quarantine.

However, it is indeed worrisome that some of these patients seemed to have travelled extensively, before they were quarantined.

Current figures

As on Friday, the State has reported 176 cases, of whom 164 are currently under treatment. A total of 1,10,229 persons are under surveillance, of whom 616 are isolated in hospitals.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, briefing media, said that the State should be prepared to face any possible health emergency in the coming days.

He reiterated the importance of physical distancing, reduced social interactions and the universal safety precautions that every individual needed to follow if the State had to avert a possible health crisis.

Mr. Vijayan said that any person who had come into the State recently from abroad or from other States should undergo the mandatory quarantine. Anyone who might have made contact with foreigners recently should also inform Health authorities and remain under surveillance.

The elderly and those with chronic lifestyle diseases should avoid social interaction and stay indoors.

Politician’s case

He said that the extensive travel history of the local politician at Idukki who had tested positive on Thursday had made contact tracing an impossible task. The list of his possible contacts included everyone from senior administrators to MLAs and Ministers. Mr. Vijayan said that all these “contacts” were not put on quarantine as the details of the case had emerged after the incubation period of the disease. However, they had all been asked to watch out for any symptoms.

“This case is a warning for each of us that the coronavirus is not far away and that only individual vigil and precautions can save us,” the Chief Minister said.

He said that the government was pushing the idea of rapid test for COVID-19 with the ICMR. It was exploring all treatment options, including the “wonder drug” used by Cuba (Interferon Alpha-2B Recombinant), for which permission of the Central Drugs Control authorities had to be sought.

Mr. Vijayan said that he would appeal to the Prime Minister to expand the COVID-19 package announced by the Centre to suit each State’s situation and to include the private health sector employees in the health insurance announced under the package.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cfy1sl/article31187354.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28TVPTI-PTI27-03-2020000050B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/in-a-single-day-surge-39-more-test-positive/article31186965.ece

Addressing a meeting convened at the District Collectorate here to discuss the crisis facing the paddy sector in view of the lockdown, Mr. Balan said that arrangements would be made to ensure that the entire paddy was harvested and procured before mid-April.

He said paddy harvesting and procurement would be treated like an essential service. People engaged in the service like operators of harvesting machines, loading staff, transport drivers, and weigh bridge operators would get permission for movement. He said only 20% of the paddy remained to be harvested.

Fifteen mills in the district are currently procuring paddy in the district, apart from 28 mills from other districts. With lockdown in place, vehicles have stopped coming from other districts. Minister for Water Resources K. Krishnankutty said that vehicles would be given permission to come and collect paddy as part of procurement.

172,2020/03/27,Explore ways of retailing liquor: CM,"‘It should be done without breaking the social distancing norms’

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has indicated that the option of restoring the sale of legal alcohol was still on the table.

He said here on Friday that the total ban on liquor retail during the lockdown had impacted society adversely. A youth, apparently addicted to alcohol, had committed suicide.

Kerala has the highest per capita consumption of alcohol in the country. The government feared that people could turn to toxic brews and lethally addictive substances to tide over the temporary squeeze on liquor sales.

Hence, Mr. Vijayan said he had laid the subject on the table of the Excise Department. He expected the department to come up with viable proposals at the earliest.

The government had banned liquor to impose social distancing norms at bars and liquor outlets last Monday. He had said on Thursday that bootleggers, black marketeers, drug peddlers and illicit brewers had stepped into void.

The Excise Department has broadened its “Vimukthi” de-addiction programme. Persons helplessly addicted to alcohol could access Vimukthi centres for treatment and counselling.

Mr. Vijayan obliquely criticised the Thiruvananthapuram city Corporation for having opened a shelter for the homeless at Putharikandam maidan. He said he could not accept such measures and asked LSGIs to commandeer schools to house homeless persons and migrant workers.

He said the Leader of the Opposition of Bihar had called him to discuss the state of nearly one-lakh of migrant workers from that State and neighbouring Jharkhand.

Mr. Vijayan said he told him that Kerala had opened 4,603 camps for migrant workers. The camps house an estimated 1.15 lakh labourers. The government opened community kitchens to serve them food and clean drinking water. The camps, mostly in schools, have adequate sanitation facilities and space. Kerala has also given its “guest” workers masks, soaps and hand sanitisers.

He asked the police to be polite but firm. They should not stop people from going out for essential errands, including procuring food and medicines. Mr. Vijayan asked LSGIs to provide for street dogs, which could attack citizens if they went without nourishment for long. He requested temple managements to feed monkeys in certain localities to prevent man-human conflict.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/explore-ways-of-retailing-liquor-cm/article31185893.ece

He said here on Friday that traders feared an imminent shortage of supplies if the authorities did not help restore essential freight traffic to pre-curfew levels urgently. The government had asked the Centre to release provisions, including pulses and edible oil, to include in grocery kits for COVID-19 affected persons.

He sought contributions to the CMDRF to combat the pandemic. He hoped the private sector would divert its production lines and resources to churn out medical essentials and protective gear for essential service providers.

A firm had offered to supply clothes for newborns free-of-cost to government hospitals. Another major electronic company has agreed to provide air coolers and water purifiers to quarantine centres. The Chief Minister hoped they had set an example for other industrialists.

He requested the RBI to urge banks to waive interest on loans. He asked the Centre to raise the State’s debt limit from the current 3% to 5% of the State GDP.

The government asked companies not to lay off staff or cut wages. It ordered non-banking institutions, chit funds, and money lenders not to auction pawned gold till further notice. The government also barred them from sending agents to collect mortgage payments or recover interest from debtors.

The government extended the last date for paying educational fee indefinitely. Question papers and examination answer sheets in schools and colleges would be shifted to secure rooms. He frowned at reports that certain elements had attempted to ostracise caregivers socially.

On Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke over telephone with Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, about the welfare of the over 20 lakh Indians living in the UAE and contributing to its economy.

The Indian Consulate in Dubai, having jurisdiction in Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm-Al-Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah, has taken steps to accommodate the 19 Indian nationals who were stuck at Dubai airport for past several days.

They had got stranded due to various restrictions to deal with COVID-19 pandemic. Hotel rooms have been given to them inside the airport. Ten Indians who are residents of UAE and have arrived from various parts of the world in Dubai airport have been put in quarantine.

In its efforts to combat the spread of the virus, the UAE government has suspended all passengers flights for two weeks from March 25.

In Qatar, all tourist visas on arrival have been extended automatically up to April 22. However, the main immigration office has to be approached for the purpose of extending family visas.

The Embassy of India in Doha, has also set up a round-the-clock helpline to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It has also made a list of doctors for counselling. Incidentally, Mr. Modi had already held a telephonic conversation with Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad al Thani, the Amir of Qatar.

In Saudi Arabia, the General Directorate of Passports in coordination with the Ministry of Haj and Umrah has facilitated for overstaying pilgrims to submit an exemption request from legal effects and penalties. Besides, the exit-entry visas for expatriates with commercial professions that have not been used and for expatriates with expired residences will be extended for three months free of charge and without the need to visit the General Directorate of Passports.

The Oman Embassy of India in Muscat has set up a 24/7 helpline functional for COVID-19 related queries. These are at the consular - [24695981 (cons.muscat@mea.gov.in)], Community Welfare – [80071234 (Toll free) / 96568908 (cw.muscat@mea.gov.in)] and through WhatsApp (+968 93577979).

176,2020/03/27,COVID-19 effect: Move to decongest jails,"Prisoners to be released on special parole, 105 released on Thursday

The High Power Committee formed to submit recommendations for decongesting the jails in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak may recommend releasing prisoners on special parole or interim bail.

The committee was constituted after the Supreme Court directed the State governments to consider releasing of prisoners who had been convicted for jail terms less than seven years. The apex court had also suggested extending the benefits to undertrial prisoners who were being tried for offences which could attract a maximum imprisonment up to seven years.

The committee in the State is headed by Justice C.K. Abdul Rehim, chairman of the Kerala State Legal Services Authority. It has Vishwas Mehtha, Additional Chief Secretary, and Director General of Prisons and Correctional Services Rrishraj Singh as its members.

The State government released 105 prisoners on parole on Thursday as part of the efforts to decongest the jails after the approval of the Chief Minister. Prisoners who could not return to the jail on the expiry of the parole shall report to the nearest police station, government sources said.

Who are eligible?

The benefit of the scheme will not be extended to persons who have been incarcerated or facing trial for serious offences such as rape and murder. The Indian Penal Code prescribes punishment of less than seven years for offences such as simple hurt, wrongful confinement, dowry cases, cruelty to married woman, forgery, house trespass, and mischief.

There are currently 8,028 prisoners in the Kerala jails and the number of beneficiaries of the scheme will be known shortly.

The Home Department is working on the suggestions forwarded by the judiciary on the selection of prisoners and the mode in which the scheme has to be implemented. The panel will meet through videoconferencing and take a decision, said Dr. Mehta.

Input from authorities

For picking up the beneficiaries, the nature of the offences for which the prisoners were convicted, their behaviour in jail, the number of year they were imprisoned and the response of prisoners when released in parole earlier would be considered. The report of the jail superintend in each case will be crucial in selecting the beneficiaries.

The prisoners who had returned to the jail after completing the parole without committing any offence may get preference. The Jail Department is in the process of preparing the list of beneficiaries by evaluating these factors, department sources said.

The committee may also suggest permitting such persons to execute personal bail bonds since they will not be able to get sureties from outside in the present social stiutation. The release could be considered as the suspension of their jail sentence for a short period, a judicial source said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-effect-move-to-decongest-jails/article31185321.ece
177,2020/03/27,Coronavirus lockdown | Cooking gas shortage a possibility in Kerala,"Closure of wayside hotels deters tanker drivers from attempting 18-hour journey

The fourth day of the COVID-19 lockdown on Friday raised the prospect of a shortage of cooking gas cylinders in the State.

G. Sanal, general secretary, All India LPG Distributors Federation (Kerala circle), says gas agencies in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta and parts of Alappuzha are not able to meet the demand from consumers.

From Mangalapuram

The 80-odd distributors in the region supply cooking gas to over 13 lakh households. The lockdown has hit the movement of LPG tankers from Mangalapuram in Karnataka to the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) bottling plant in Kollam.

The closure of wayside hotels has deterred gas tanker drivers from attempting the nearly 18-hour journey from the LPG terminal to the refilling plant, an estimated 550 km. The number of LPG loads has lessened since last Saturday. Another distributor says the backlog of orders has mounted to 1,200 in the past 48 hours and is climbing.

The curfew has whittled down the number of employees to fewer than five an agency. The lockdown has hit doorstep delivery. Customers say their calls for refills often go unanswered. With gas stoves running low on fuel and timely supply of refills in doubt, many have turned to hotplates and microwave ovens, a move that could send electricity bills spiralling.

IOC response

An IOC official in Kochi told The Hindu that the lockdown has triggered panic buying of cooking gas across the country and Kerala was no exception. “As soon as customers get a refill, they order the next cylinder. The demand for a refill has gone up by 50%. The number of returns of empty cylinders to refilling units has dwindled. In the past four days, the IOC has upped its shipments to distributors by 25% to meet the orders,” he said.

Essential service

The officer says the fears of distributors seem misplaced. The IOC customarily meets temporary shortfall in cylinders in the State from the Kochi refinery plant. It could also import additional loads from its refilling plant in Madurai. At present, there is no lack of availability of LPG in the State, he says.

The government has declared LPG distribution an essential service.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/kwe7cj/article25872809.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lockdown-raises-prospect-of-lpg-shortage/article31185011.ece
178,2020/03/27,Sabarimala temple festival deferred for the first time in 55 years,"The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) has postponed the festival to a later date following the nationwide lockdown declared by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi,

For the first time in its history, the 10-day annual festival at the Sabarimala Ayyappa Temple has been deferred in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The history of the 10-day annual temple festival at Sabarimala traces back to the installation of the holy mast at the Ayyappa Temple premises in 1965, say the Tantris (chef priests), Kandararu Rajeevararu and Kandararu Maheswararu Mohanararu.

The annual temple festival was scheduled to begin with the customary kodiyettu ceremony on March 29 to culminate with the ceremonial Aratt in river Pampa on April 7. However, the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) has postponed the festival to a later date following the nationwide lockdown declared by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in an effort to contain the disease.

Mr. Rajeevararu told The Hindu that there was a dogma giving freedom to the temple custodian and the Tantri for deferring the annual festival and hence there was nothing wrong in the TDB decision postponing the annual fete against the backdrop of the growing COVID-19 crisis.

Earlier, the 10-day annual festival at Sabarimala used to be celebrated amid the 41-day Mandalam pilgrimage season. However, that system was changed 10 years ago by the board chaired by G.Raman Nair, as the festival rites like Utsavabali had been posing much problems for the pilgrims for the holy darshan of the presiding deity during the annual season.

The TDB’s decision to conduct the 10-day festival in connection with the Painguni Uthram, which is believed to be the birth star of the deity, in the Malayalam month of Meenom (March-April) was made in consultation with the then Tantri, Kandararu Mohanararu, and astrologers (devaprasnom), said Mr. Rajeevararu.

TDB president, N.Vasu, told The Hindu that the conduct of this year’s Vishu festival from April 10 too would be difficult as the 21-day lockout ends only on the Vishu day on April 14.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kaw8n1/article31183718.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21tvpt-ayyappatemple1JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sabarimala-temple-festival-deferred-for-the-first-time-in-55-years/article31181680.ece

185,2020/03/27,Centre’s package may elude 90 lakh ration cardholders,"12 lakh pensioners too may miss dole

Nearly 90 lakh ration cardholders and around 12 lakh beneficiaries of social security pension schemes in Tamil Nadu may not be entitled to receive assistance under the Centre’s latest welfare package.

As per the announcement by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday, the poor will receive 5 kg rice or wheat each free for the next three months, in addition to their current entitlement. Besides, one kg pulse will be given. Senior citizens (aged above 60), widows and differently abled will be given an ex gratia of ₹ 1,000 each for three months.

In Tamil Nadu, the State government has been following the concept of universal public distribution system unlike the Centre’s targeted PDS. This is why every beneficiary covered under the PDS is entitled to 5 kg rice or wheat free of cost, regardless of economic status, since the State joined others in November 2016 in implementing the National Food Security Act (NFSA).

There are about 2.01 crore rice-drawing cards in the State, of which only 1.11 crore cards are covered under the NFSA. In other words, of the 6.7 crore beneficiaries, approximately 3.65 crore come under the Act.

Sop to pensioners

Likewise, of 32 lakh beneficiaries under nine social security pension schemes being implemented in the State, 20 lakh beneficiaries are covered under the Central schemes such as the National Old Age Pension Scheme, National Widow Pension Scheme and National Disability Pension Scheme, all named after former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and they alone will get the ex gratia amount from the Centre. The remaining 12 lakh beneficiaries come under the State government’s schemes for destitute widows, the destitute or deserted wives, unmarried/incapacitated poor women of 50 years and above, refugees from Sri Lanka and members of the Farmers’ Protection Scheme.

While the Centre provides a pension of ₹200 to persons in the 60-79 age group [₹ 300 to those covered under the Disability and Widow Pension Schemes] and ₹500 to those who are 80 and above. the State government actually disburses ₹1,000 a month uniformly, mostly through bank accounts.

A top official says the government is to decide on extending the relief measures to those who have been left out. Others in the government feel that given the State government’s approach of providing maximum relief to all people under the present circumstances, it would, in all likelihood, take a favourable decision. Many point out that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, only a few days ago, announced in the Assembly that in April, all ration cardholders would get ₹1,000 each, in addition to getting their entitlements of rice, sugar, pulses and edible oil free of cost. Construction workers and autorickshaw drivers would get ₹1,000 each. Each of their families would receive 15 kg rice, one kg pulses and one kg of edible oil free. Inter-state workers under the construction and unorganised sector, stranded in Tamil Nadu, would get the essential commodities free.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/padm0l/article31187206.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/An-overview-of-TNs-socialcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/centres-package-may-elude-90-lakh-ration-cardholders/article31187207.ece

The 21-year old is the second patient to be discharged, after Case no. 1, a 45-year-old man from Kancheepuram, with travel history to the United Arab Emirates, who tested positive on March 7. He was discharged on March 19, and put on home quarantine.

The second patient, case no. 2, who travelled by a train from Delhi to Chennai, and tested positive on March 19, will be discharged in a day or two. “He has tested negative twice for the infection, and will be sent home soon. He is in the step down unit at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. The usual protocol for discharge is a double negative test, clear lung signs (as evidenced by X-ray report, completely asymptomatic, and good vital signs,” Dr. Vijayabaskar said.

“If all these signs are there, they will be cleared to go home, but we are insisting on a 28-day home quarantine after that, in order to be absolutely safe,” he said.

188,2020/03/27,"Over 2,700 prisoners let out on bail","More than 2,700 prisoners have been released on bail from prisons across the State in an effort to contain COVID-19. They were enlarged on bail by judicial authorities after scrutinising the cases individually.

These releases were necessitated following the orders of judicial magistrates or District Judges who visited the prisons and held special adalats. Most of the inmates who were released are suspects involved in petty offences. The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court has recently ordered all bail orders, anticipatory bail or parole should be extended till April 30.

Director-General of Police and Inspector-General of Prisons Sunil Kumar Singh told The Hindu, “The congestion in prisons is considerably reduced now. At present, we have 52% occupancy of total capacity. The capacity is 23,392 and the occupancy is 12,166 as on date. We may bring this down to 50%.”

Following recent orders of Supreme Court, a high-level committee headed by Justice Vineet Kothari, Judge of High Court, and Executive Chairman of State Legal Service Authority has directed the Principal District Judges of Chennai, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram to visit Central Prison, Puzhal, to assess further for granting bail. This direction is expected to bring down the number of inmates further.

The prison department provided smart phones to prisoners to have video call with their family members and relatives. Mr. Singh said, “We have purchased 58 smart phones and 700 people contacted their families all over the State through video call. They have been provided with video call facility under supervision and guidance of prison authorities.”

Prison authorities have asked the inmates to maintain personal distance. Each inmate is permitted to talk for five minutes — from morning to evening until they are locked up in the cell.

In Central prisons, an established system is in place to keep any new prisoner in quarantine ward for 14 days. On arrival, the prisoner is medically examined by doctors. Whenever a prisoner is admitted, the prison doctors check thoroughly for symptoms such as cough, cold and fever and recommend further check up.

Thermal scanners are used in the prisons and sanitisers, made by prisoners, are distributed to all prisoners across the State. Prisoners make masks and supply to the police force besides their use in prisons.

On Friday, the Health Department established the contacts of six of the nine patients, who had tested positive. However, it continues to trace the source of infection for the three others - all three residents of Chennai.

While one of them is a 25-year-old woman, a resident of Chennai who was working in a shopping mall in Velachery, the department is tracking the movements of two others - 73-year-old woman from Pammal and 39-year-old man from Anna Nagar in Chennai - to identify the source of infection.

The woman is admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, while the man is at Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital.

Official sources said that the woman had attended prayer in a church and has co-morbid condition, while the 39-year-old was a naturopathy student who had travelled in a train from Trichy and also attended a birthday party recently.

Officials said these three patients have non-identifiable sources. Tracking patient movements and their contacts is a challenging task.

The Railway Board has authorised Zonal Railways to decide on relaxing rules on the mandatory usage of breathalyser tests and biometric verification for loco running staff.

A circular has been issued on Friday after loco running staff had expressed apprehension about contracting COVID-19 infections while using same breath analyser (BA) and biometric devices.

The circular said that both BA tests and biometric verifications could be relaxed only for the crew members operating goods trains in those sections where no other passenger trains are run or anticipated at any given point of time in either directions.

The circular is valid till April 14 until when all passenger train services have been suspended under the nation-wide lockdown.

The relaxation is not applicable to members with a known history of alcoholism.

The circular also said that a declaration instead of BA test has to be taken from each crew member at the time of signing on and sending off duty.

General Managers have been instructed to adopt the practice of manual signing instead of biometric attendance system as was done prior to introduction of biometric verification.

The present relaxation was formulated as a very special case considering the critical situation and should not be quoted for any other situation in future.

Various railway unions had been objecting to the crew members being compulsorily subjected to breath analyser tests and biometric verification.

200,2020/03/27,"COVID-19: Need special legislation to deal exclusively with epidemics, say lawyers","Lawyers point out that the archaic Epidemics Diseases Act of 1897 and the Disaster Management Act of 2005, both of which have presently been invoked for the lockdown, are not enough to deal with a situation such as the current pandemic

Multiple challenges posed by COVID-19 and unprecedented steps taken by the Centre and State governments to fight the pandemic have reinforced the need to enact a special legislation to deal exclusively with epidemics, say lawyers.

They point out that the only special law in force at present in the country is the colonial Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897, a 122-year-old legislation which has just four provisions (Sections 1 to 4) that hardly give any power to the Centre on the issue.

Section 2 of the Act originally empowered the erstwhile Governor General to take “special measures and prescribe regulations” to deal with the outbreak of any “dangerous epidemic disease.” In 1937, the term ‘Governor General’ was replaced with State government. It was by invoking this archaic provision that the State government has now ordered the sealing of all district borders to prevent travel. However, when it comes to the Centre, the Act empowered the government only to the limited extent of inspecting a ship or vessel leaving or arriving at any port.

“That’s precisely why the Union Home Ministry had now invoked the Disaster Management Act of 2005, a law passed after the devastation caused by tsunami in December 2004, to order a nationwide lockdown and impose several restrictions on public movement"" pointed out advocate C. Kanagaraj. “This 2005 Act defines disaster to be a catastrophe, mishap, calamity or grave occurrence arising from natural or man-made causes. It does not contain niceties expected of a law that deals with public health issues such as an epidemic,” he explained.

Agreeing with him, advocate M. Velmurugan stated that the need of the hour was a legislation akin to the Public Health (Prevention, Control and Management of Epidemics, Bio-terrorism and Disasters) Bill of 2017 drafted by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. This Bill had clear cut definitions for the terms “epidemic, isolation, quarantine, social distancing, public health emergency, public health emergency of international concern, ground crossing, disinfection, disinfection, deratting, decontamination,” and so on.

In February 2017, the Ministry had called for comments from all stakeholders on the draft Bill. “Then, several concerns were raised over the sweeping powers it envisaged for the State to subject a person to compulsory treatment even without consent. “The Bill also provided for repealing the shallow and outdated Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897. Unfortunately, it was not enacted. Had it become a law by now, this would have been the appropriate legislation to be invoked to fight COVID-19,” he said.

The lawyer went on state: “The Disaster Management Act is basically a legislation aimed at addressing concerns caused due to cyclones and earthquakes. It may not be an appropriate law to dealt with public health issues such as an epidemic or a pandemic.”

He added, “After the threat of COVID-19 abates, our Parliamentarians should pay attention to the need for a new Act to fight epidemics and such a law should be the outcome of mammoth experience gathered by the governments in fighting the microscopic viruses.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-need-special-legislation-to-deal-exclusively-with-epidemics-say-lawyers/article31180298.ece
201,2020/03/27,Monitoring of home quarantined persons stepped up in Dharmapuri,"The district has a total of 375 persons, who were asymptomatic travellers returned from abroad and neighbouring States, placed in home quarantine

The district administration has stepped up the monitoring of the home quarantined persons and have pushed for village quarantines, roping in the local village panchayats.

The administration has formed committees at panchayat-level comprising of staff from health, rural development and revenue departments. It includes local SHGs, teachers, village health nurses, health inspector, panchayat secretary, and Village Administrative Officer.

The district has a total of 375 persons, who were asymptomatic travellers returned from abroad and neighbouring States, placed in home quarantine. According to Deputy Director of Health Gemini, none of the travellers had reported symptoms of severe acute respiratory illness, or COVID-like symptoms.

Only one labourer from Kerala had reported persistent cold before COVID outbreak and his sample was sent for testing to Salem medical college hospital. It returned negative. “We are screening every traveller for respiratory symptoms or other symptoms. The returnees are asymptomatic travellers, but are in quarantine,” the DD said.

Homes with international travellers are indicated with green stickers, while those with travellers from other States including Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka and Gujarat with red stickers, and the homes of their neighbours of those they had come in contact with are pasted with yellow stickers.

Similarly, village quarantines have also been issued. Local panchayats have been asked to seal their village boundaries to prevent movement. “Some villages with 100% migrant workforce are directed to village quarantine, while those villages with residents without any kind of travel history are safe and advised to quarantine to protect their village,” Mr. Gemini said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/monitoring-of-home-quarantined-persons-stepped-up-in-dharmapuri/article31178779.ece
202,2020/03/27,COVID-19: Will it be polite with children?,"With the looming threat of the COVID 19 pandemic, paediatricians have been getting frequent queries from parents on the risk of their children getting this new viral infection which is threatening the entire world.

In the coming days, we can expect large number of children to be brought to clinics and hospitals for trivial and major symptoms alike because the fear of unknown diseases is obviously even higher for children.

In the first largest series of cases reported from China, only one child aged 15 years was treated, indicating that there could be a children-sparing pattern in this infection.

In 2003, during the SARS epidemic in Hongkong, among over 1,700 infected individuals, 6.9% were under 18 years of age with a case fatality rate of 0%. Similarly, when the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) spread in 2012, also caused by corona virus, only 2% of cases occurred in children.

Coming to the hottest topic, worldwide data suggests that the paediatric population, even in this very-high risk area, appears to be at an unexpectedly low risk to develop COVID 19 infection. It is unclear why this may happen.

Reports from China suggest that infection of children is possible, although apparently extremely rare.

One possible reason is that children have fewer outdoor activities and undertake less international travel, making them less likely to contract the virus.

Are children cross-protected by having met other Coronaviruses? Coronaviruses (CoVs) is one of the common viruses that invade the lungs as rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza, which all have an RNA genome and are very frequent in children. Innate immune evasion links to the innate immune responses elicited by respiratory and other (RNA) viruses. One explanation could be that pneumonia results from virus-induced immune response causing destruction of pulmonary tissue. Such mechanisms could be less effective in children.

The good news so far is that children are apparently at a minimal risk to develop this new disease, and at virtually no risk of a fatal course.

Are children going to have different symptoms and signs in this dreaded disease?

Most infected children have mild clinical manifestations. They have no fever or symptoms of pneumonia with a good outcome. Most of them recover within 1–2 weeks after disease onset. Few may progress to lower respiratory infections.

Children with infection can fall into any of the following 4 categories:

Asymptomatic Infection 2. Acute Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 3. Mild Pneumonia 4. Severe Pneumonia

William Osler said “The only way to treat the common cold is with contempt.” Ogden Nash defined Family as a “Unit composed not only of children but also of men, women, an occasional animal and the common cold.” Most children in our country and across the world are going to get this Common Cold due to COVID 19 for sure as the pandemic looks unstoppable.

However, we need to remember a few scientific facts in this scenario. Even the most experienced paediatrician cannot distinguish COVID 19 infection from other viral respiratory infections with confidence. Only virus testing will confirm or exclude the diagnosis. Treatment as of today is mainly supportive and symptomatic in the majority of children. A wide variety of drugs is being tried in desperation in critically ill without hard evidence. Vaccine is not yet a reality.

Children may play a major role in community-based viral transmission since quite a few of those infected may be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. However, we need to remember that children with chronic diseases, malnutrition, immunodeficiencies may suffer from serious consequences of this seemingly benign viral infection in children.

Balanced diet, oral health, adequate exercise, regular rest, avoiding excessive fatigue, and boosting immunity are the powerful measures to preventing infection, as well as maintaining emotional stability and mental health.

It is necessary to stress that there is a need to practise appropriate hand hygiene and cough hygiene practices meticulously than ever before.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/eptmej/article31177087.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Dr-S-Balasubramanian,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-will-it-be-polite-with-children/article31177088.ece

204,2020/03/27,Marvel film star Evangeline Lilly apologises for insensitive comments on coronavirus fear,"‘Ant-Man and the Wasp’ star was severely criticised on social media by many, including Sophie Turner and Maggie Grace

Ant-Man and the Wasp actor Evangeline Lilly has tendered an apology over her “dismissive” and “arrogant” statement about social distancing in the wake of coronavirus pandemic.

The Marvel film star was severely criticised on social by many, including Game of Thrones actor Sophie Turner and Maggie Grace, for saying that she won’t be going into self-quarantine as she values freedom over everything else.

In a new post on Instagram, Lilly regretted her earlier statement and said she is practising social distancing now.

“I want to offer my sincere and heartfelt apology for the insensitivity I showed in my previous post to the very real suffering and fear that has gripped the world through COVID19. Grandparents, parents, children, sisters and brothers are dying, the world is rallying to find a way to stop this very real threat, and my ensuing silence has sent a dismissive, arrogant and cryptic message,” she posted.

“My direct and special apologies to those most affected by this pandemic. I never meant to hurt you. When I wrote that post 10 days ago, I thought I was infusing calm into the hysteria. I can see now that I was projecting my own fears into an already fearful and traumatic situation,” the actor wrote.

Lilly said she is saddened that so many people have lost their lives due to COVID-19.

“I am grieved by the ongoing loss of life, and the impossible decisions medical workers around the world must make as they treat those affected. I am concerned for our communities — small businesses and families living paycheck-to-paycheck — and I am trying to follow responsible recommendations for how to help.”

“Like many of you, I fear for the political aftermath of this pandemic, and I am praying for us all. At the same time, I am heartened by the beauty and humanity I see so many people demonstrating toward one another in this vulnerable time,” she added.

Last Week, Lilly, 40, shared that she dropped her kids off at a gymnastics camp and that “they all washed their hands before going in”.

She accompanied the post with the hashtag “business as usual”, which did not go down well with many social media users.

The actor later wrote in the comments section, “Some people value their lives over freedom, some people value freedom over their lives. We all make our choices. Where we are right now feels a lot too close to Marshall Law for my comfort already, all in the name of a respiratory flu.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/d78fc3/article31183447.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/evangeline,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/marvel-film-star-evangeline-lilly-apologises-for-insensitive-comments-on-coronavirus-fear/article31183448.ece

Bollywood actors Richa Chadha and Ali Fazal were supposed to get married in April. Not only has the date now been pushed to later this year, the two are also self-isolated in their respective homes in Mumbai, and, like many people, have been keeping in touch over video call.

It was one such free-flowing ‘Be my quarantine’ chat that they recorded at their respective ends that caught everybody’s attention. The sweet, personal vaartalaap (conversation), in which they talk about self-isolation, social distancing, not touching your face, washing your hands regularly and maintaining hygiene, became all the rage on Instagram, while effectively communicating the basics of the situation to the lay person. The spontaneous, unrehearsed attempt was also, as Fazal put it, to address the “weird depression that sets in when you are done watching content. All you want is to be close to people, relate to people,” he says.

Another such video by Anil Kapoor has him video-chatting with Anupam Kher, stressing on the need to maintain distance even from neighbours and close friends. Lyricist-writer-stand-up comic Varun Grover has been leveraging his stand-up routines to post “rant” videos to drill sense into misinformed people. That apart, he also treats it as a diary for himself. “It’s the world war of our times. The entire world is shut. It’s the first time the Olympics won’t be held since WW II. The Taj Mahal, Juhu beach and Siddhivinayak are all shut at the same time. It’s unimaginable that the Indian railway network could ever stop. These are very surreal times and I wanted to document them through my art,” he says.

With mobile phone cameras and social media platforms readily at their disposal, and with plenty of time on hand, celebrities and influencers — from Sonam and Suriya to Shah Rukh Khan and Kartik Aryan — are getting more socially conscious and creative to raise awareness of COVID-19.

What makes the messaging drastically different in these critical times is the fact that the haloed stars, for once, are caught in the same situation as the hoi polloi. They are living the nightmare. “It has impacted everyone. Earlier, it wasn’t their story. Now it is personal to everyone,” says Suraja Kishore, CEO of advertising agency BBDO India. For instance, he says, actor Shefali Shah’s messages on Instagram, about quarantining her sons who have returned from universities abroad, are not just responsible but effective because she comes across as a mother more than a celebrity. “Parents and families vibe with it,” he says.

Moral responsibility

So, how exactly does star messaging play out in these critical times? And does it help? “If some positivity comes out of it, why not?” says Fazal. Star YouTuber Bhuvan Bam, whose “Time to be a Hero” video garnered over 480k views in less than 45 minutes of its release and has touched a million views at last count, says he felt it was his “moral responsibility to bust the myths around coronavirus circulating on WhatsApp”. It is necessary “in times like these,” he says.

As Santosh Desai, CEO of Futurebrands, points out, “They [celebrities] have an audience and the ability to communicate in a direct way.”

However, this huge reach, influence and captive audience comes with its pitfalls, especially when coupled with misinformation. Be it Mohanlal, talking about bacteria and viruses vanishing when people clap in unison, or Amitabh Bachchan tweeting superstitious mumbo-jumbo that he had to delete, or Rajinikanth’s misleading ‘Janata curfew’ message that had to be taken down by Twitter, the end result can be dangerous because diehard fans probably believe everything they say.

Grover has a few pointers on how to get it right — stick to facts, don’t alienate people, don’t bring in politics. “It’s about saving as many lives as we can,” he says. According to him it’s “the first global calamity in the time of social media, and of an unimaginable scale,” in which transmission of the correct information is key. “It’s an information war. The right information will save us, the wrong will endanger us.”

Shah Rukh Khan

Irony and sarcasm don’t work well in these confused times. Pointing out superstitions and myths can conversely amplify them. “One has to be wise with words because there’s a massive population out there... You have to say things in as simple a language as you can,” says Bam.

The moral of the story? Keep it simple or keep quiet. “It’s a formidable task,” says Desai. “The stars also have to align their behaviour to what they are saying. You have to live what you are preaching. In that sense, it’s not just advertisement and there’s no leeway to go off script.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/j58g9q/article31183286.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29SMBACHCHAN1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/celebrity-messaging-in-the-time-of-covid-19-some-got-it-right-some-very-wrong/article31183291.ece
206,2020/03/27,"Jr NTR unveils Ram Charan’s character Alluri Seetaramaraju, from Rajamouli’s ‘RRR’","Jr NTR, essaying the part of Komaram Bheem, refers to Ram Charan’s character as his ‘elder brother’ in the video

It took more time than they expected it to. Instead of 10a.m., a sneak peak of Ram Charan’s character from from S S Rajamouli’s next film RRR was unveiled at 4p.m. on Thursday. The magnum opus starring Ram Charan as Alluri Seetaramaraju and NTR as Komaram Bheem is titled Roudram Ranam Rudhiram in Telugu, Ratham Ranam Roudhiram in Tamil, and captioned ‘Rise Roar Revolt’ in English.

True to the motion poster unveiled earlier this week that showed Ram Charan representing element fire and Jr NTR as water, the character introduction, with a voiceover by Jr NTR, gave a glimpse of young Alluri Seetaramaraju and what made him a fiery fighter.

Captioning the video as ‘Bheem for Ramaraju’ and promoting it as #BheemforRamaraju, Jr NTR’s voiceover (in Telugu, Tamil and Hindi) refers to Alluri Seetaramaraju as his elder brother.

Leading up to the video’s release was an interesting banter between Jr NTR, Ram Charan, Chiranjeevi and Rajamouli on Twitter that kept everyone entertained. On Thursday evening, NTR had tweeted that he will be unveiling the video to coincide with Ram Charan’s birthday on March 27, at 10a.m.

Minutes before 10a.m., Chiranjeevi, who had joined Twitter on Ugadi and since then has been interacting with film fraternity in a humorous vein, stated that ‘he’s waiting!’, taking off from his famous line in Khadi No.150.

NTR begged for more time, stating that the video is awaiting approval from Rajamouli, and the director too pleaded for more time.

Meanwhile, cinematographer K K Senthil Kumar revealed that the team was working from home and he was coordinating with digital colourtist Shiva (who had earlier worked on Rajamouli’s films Magadheera, Eega, and Baahubali) and C V Rao, the technical head of Annapurna Studios.

Wishing son Ram Charan on his birthday, Chiranjeevi tweeted that he was overjoyed when Charan was born but it took him years to realise why he was born on March 27, World Theatre Day, referring to the actor’s superhit film Rangasthalam (the stage).",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/s3e7au/article31182943.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RRR-Ram,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jr-ntr-unveils-ram-charans-character-alluri-seetaramaraju-from-rajamoulis-rrr-calls-him-elder-brother/article31182944.ece

Actress and Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle will be narrating the Disneynature documentary Elephant.

The show will debut on April 3 on Disney Plus, the studio announced Thursday.

This will be Meghan’s first project for Markle in show business after she and her husband, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, officially step away from their roles within the British Royal Family on March 31, reports variety.com.

In support of “Elephant,” Disneynature and the Disney Conservation Fund are donating to Elephants Without Borders, an organisation working to protect the elephants living in Botswana.

Earlier this year, news broke that Markle had partnered with Disney on an unspecified project after she and her husband revealed they would be stepping back from their royal duties.

In the announcement, Disneynature’s credits Markle as “Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex”, rather than including her previous royal title of “HRH”. “Elephant” will premiere on Disney Plus the same day as the previously announced Disneynature documentary “Dolphin Reef”, which will be narrated by Natalie Portman. “Penguins,” which opened in theaters in 2019, will also debut on the streaming service that day.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/m0nwnq/article31181802.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAINROYALWEDDING,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/duchess-meghan-markle-back-as-narrator-of-disney-plus-nature-docu-elephant/article31181803.ece

Punyakoti, based on a Kannada folk tale about a cow and a hungry tiger, will be streamed between April 10 and 14. Directed by Ravishankar Venkateshwaran with music by Ilaiyaraaja, Punyakoti is said to be the first Sanskrit animation film.

Although, a start-up, Teriflix, had agreed to screen the film in April, the lock-down has made it difficult to do so.

Celebrities across industries have adopted various methods to cope with the 21-day lockdown period. And team Roudram Ranam Rudhiram aka RRR is no different. In order to stay productive in the time of social-distancing, team RRR — comprising SS Rajamouli, Jr NTR, MM Keeravani and Madhan Karky — has taken the ‘work from home’ option.

Music composer MM Keeravani took to Twitter to share a picture of them on a conference video call. He wrote, “Good Morning ! NTR, SSR, Madhan Karky & Myself. Working from home with obviously much more than 3 ft distance between each of us.”

Filmmaker SS Rajamouli’s RRR is easily one of the most anticipated Indian movies and comes after the monstrous success of the Baahubali series. Starring Jr NTR and Ram Charan in lead roles, the movie has been in production for close to two years now.

While the entire film industry has come to a standstill in the wake of the global coronavirus crisis, nothing could stop the makers from dropping the motion poster of RRR. The first look poster, which showcased the might of Fire and Water in the form of Ram Charan and Jr NTR respectively, gave some comfort to movie buffs in these testing times.

Actor Dr Sethu Raman of Kanna Laddu Thinna Aasaiya fame is no more. He reportedly passed away late Thursday night after a cardiac arrest. He was 36, and was active even a few days ago, giving interviews about the coronavirus.

Sethu, a close friend of comedian Santhanam, was a leading dermatologist and ran the ZI clinic in Alwarpet.

212,2020/03/27,Telugu ‘comfort films’ to watch during the COVID-19 lockdown,"From time-tested classics like ‘Mayabazar’ to the more recent masala hit ‘Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo’, here are a few Telugu films for comfort viewing while you stay safe at home

None of us is used to a lockdown, but we know it needs to be done to break the COVID-19 chain and flatten the curve. While we work from home, we need something to lift our spirits. There are podcasts, e-books and audio books, and of course web series. But there’s something comforting about revisiting much-loved movies. If you’ve missed out on any of the older films, or the newer ones, this is the time to catch up. Here’s a mix of contemporary and older Telugu films to add some cheer:

Note: This is not an all-encompassing list. So don’t take offence and outrage if your favourite star’s movie isn’t listed.

The classics

Like good wine, these films keep getting better with time and merit repeat viewing with the family. The storylines offer a social commentary of an era, and the films have commendable performances and music that’s pleasing on the ears; these films are lessons in filmmaking as well.

Director K V Reddy’s Mayabazar (1957) is an eternal favourite and had an eclectic cast including Savitri, Akkineni Nageswara Rao, NT Rama Rao and S V Ranga Rao. Characters from ‘Sasirekha Parinayam’, the folk tale inspired by ‘Mahabharata’, became mortals that we could relate to.

While on the topic of Mayabazar, it’s imperative to mention director Nag Ashwin’s biopic of Savitri, Mahanati (2018). In this compelling biopic, the team managed to recreate iconic scenes from Mayabazar and a host of other Telugu films that starred Savitri. The casting was spot on, as Keerthy Suresh walked that fine line between mimicking and imbibing Savitri’s body language, and the charming Dulquer Salmaan portrayed Gemini Ganesan.

Many of director K Vishwanath’s films continue to endear generations of viewers. Among them, we would pick Sankarabharanam (1980), Sagara Sangamam (1983) and Swathi Muthyam (1986).

Muthyala Muggu (1975) and Pelli Pustakam (1991) among director Bapu’s films make for repeat viewing, and who can forget director Kamalakara Kameswara Rao’s Gundamma Katha (1962)?

Yes to comedies

A good dose of humour is welcome in times like these. Give those WhatsApp forwards a break and turn to the good old comedies. Jandhyala films such as Aha Naa Pellanta (1987) and Srivariki Premalekha (1984) could be your cup of tea, or if you want something from the later decades, revisit Manmadhudu (2002) for the comic banter between Nagarjuna and Brahmanandam.

There aren’t too many romantic comedies in Telugu cinema. Among the few we have had, director Nandini Reddy’s Ala Modalaindi (2011) and Tharun Bhascker’s Pellichoopulu (2016) guarantee good laughs.

Want more? Maruthi Dasari’s Bhale Bhale Magadivoy (2015) starring Nani and Lavanya Tripathi can add to the light-hearted fun.

Romances and family dramas

In Mani Ratnam’s Geetanjali (1989), the characters played by Nagarjuna and Girija show us how to live with hope, and learn to smile, in times of adversity. Re-watch this film, soaking in all its nuances, and give in to Ilaiyaraaja’s lilting music once again. Ninne Pelladatha (1996) and Nuvvu Naaku Nachav (2001) are repeat worthy too.

In the last decade, it’s tough to think of a more entertainingly packaged romantic musical than Gautham Menon’s Ye Maya Chesave (2010). A R Rahman’s music still rings so fresh and it’s fun to watch the now real life couple Samantha and Naga Chaitanya from 10 years ago, as Jessi and Karthik.

And if you haven’t seen Indraganti Mohanakrishna’s romantic comedy drama Sammohanam (2018), tune in. Vivek Sagar’s music is the icing on the cake.

The masala magic

Telugu cinema has been guilty of producing mainstream films with an extra dash of masala. In the last few years, though we’ve sporadically seen newer filmmakers exploring concept-oriented films and doing away with formula (Venkatesh Maha’s brilliant Care of Kancharapalem is an example), there’s no wishing away the masala-laden entertainers, especially when their release is timed during festive occasions. Some of these films are great fun, so why not?

The latest guilty pleasure for many Telugu film buffs has been Trivikram Srinivas’s Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo (2020). The basic plotline isn’t new but this film knew how to win over the audience with its characters (Allu Arjun as Buntu and Murali Sharma as Valmiki) and innovate within the masala format. For instance, the imaginatively choreographed action sequence, as the Srikakulam folk song ‘Sittarala Sirapadu’ played in the background.

Among the hugely entertaining films of the 90s, there’s Chiranjeevi’s Gang Leader (1991), Chantabbai (1986) and Nagarjuna’s Hello Brother (1994).

The breakaway tribe

A few have broken the formula time and again and come up with new narratives, stunning the audience into watching something unexpected — Ram Gopal Varma’s action drama Shiva (1990), crime caper Kshana Kshanam (1991) and Chandrasekhar Yeleti’s thriller Aithe (2003). Singeetam Srinivasa Rao’s science fiction Aditya 369 (1991) is unlike any Balakrishna film and packs in good fun.

Larger than life

S S Rajamouli tops this category among contemporary directors. The showmanship was always there in his earlier movies but it kept getting bigger and better. Eega (2012) is huge fun, riding on an unbelievable idea of a housefly in revenge mode. The two Baahubali films (2015 and 2017) redefined larger-than-life cinema in the Indian context.

South Central Railway (SCR) officials of Guntakal Division have come up with a unique solution to address daily need of vegetables by people by allowing them to make use of the railway infrastructure.

Divisional Railway Manager Alok Tiwari joined hands with the local municipal administration to set up a temporary market in the huge railway ground for sale of vegetables, fruits and other essentials. The well-spread and safe market place was made ready in a day and commenced sales from Thursday and will continue till the situation eases.

The arrangement at the market in railway grounds includes well laid out, numbered and demarcated spaces for setting up stalls. Ground markings of lines for maintaining social distance by the customers with no possibility of physical contact ensures total safety. Provision of parking arrangements for convenience of customers, is an added incentive.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has said that the State government was in touch with the Reserve Bank of India to arrange ₹ 30,000 to 35,000 crore to its account to procure foodgrains which the farmers will want to sell in a few days.

Expecting a bumper paddy harvest as the crop was cultivated in over 38 lakh acres in the about to conclude rabi season, Mr. Rao told a press conference on Friday that the government had made arrangements to store the stocks at warehouses of agriculture, marketing and warehousing corporation and government schools and junior colleges.

He announced closure of all market yards in the State from Friday as part of steps to deal with coronavirus. Instead, the farmers will have to dispose of their stocks at their respective villages. The staff of Marketing department will visit the villages to procure the material, mainly paddy and maize, at minimum support price from April 1. The payment to farmers will be by way of cheque which the farmers could encash after a month.

Mr. Rao said it was decided to extend the release of water by canals for crop under Kaleshwaram, Sriramsagar, Nagarjunasagar and Jurala projects till April 10. Earlier, the canals were scheduled for closure by March 31. The water would be supplied either on-and-off or uninterrupted with the aim to see that not a single acre dried up.

The total cropped area in rabi was about 54 lakh acres which required final wetting in the coming days. Village wise details of crop was being gathered. The power staff should ensure 24-hour supply for the next 15 days to agriculture.

Appealing to farmers not to get frustrated over strict measures of government to combat coronavirus when the crop was ready for harvest, he asked them not to indulge in panic selling to private traders as the government will purchase their produce to the last grain at MSP.

He asked farmers not to export oranges and sweet lime to other States as people could consume them locally to improve their resistance to coronavirus. He assured that vehicles carrying milk, vegetables, fruits, essential commodities and fodder will not be stopped by the police.

Desperate times call for desperate measures. Yes, the uncertainty of reaching home in these times of lockdown, a group of dozen agriculture labourers from Maharashtra have started on a journey on foot to their home, which is 100 km away from where they were employed.

The workers belong to Kupti-Borwadi in the famous temple town of Mahur in Nanded district of Maharashtra and had worked in fields in Landa Sangvi village in Adilabad rural mandal since the last six months. They had come to work in cotton fields and were now engaged in harvesting turmeric when the total shutdown changed the scenario suddenly.

“The lockdown happened just as we ended harvesting turmeric and wanted to return to Borwadi. We were told that there is no transport to anywhere,” recalled Shravan Rathod, head of one of the four families headed towards the inter State border between Adilabad district’s Talamadugu mandal and Kinwat taluk of Nanded district.

The workers were challenged by vigilant villagers at Ponnari in Tamsi mandal but they were able to convince them that they will cross the border and not enter any village on the route. “All of us are healthy and there is no need to worry,” he asserted.

It is anybody’s guess if the group will make it to its native village as there would be several pickets manned by police, first on this side of the border and apparently along the 70 km of the route that falls in Maharashtra territory. “Saab (Sub Inspector of Police) has given us his phone number to call in case of emergency,” revealed Pandit Rathod who, also said he was unaware of the name of the police officer whose number he was carrying.

The families had left behind some schoolgoing children when they had come to Adilabad last year. “We are worried about them as schools have been closed and the children have nowhere to go,” said a sad Gopichand Rathod giving the reason for the group to take the difficult route out of Adilabad.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/o37jdo/article31186052.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY28ADB-LABOURERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/desperate-times-desperate-measures/article31185728.ece
220,2020/03/27,Paddy harvesting too may be affected,"Chain-type machines, which are in demand, have to come from Karnataka

Coronavirus may have its bearing on paddy cutting in the yasangi. Farmers who transplanted paddy earlier in the season are gripped by fear with the imposition of lockdown restricting the movement of workers and vehicles, which would also apply to harvesters. To cut the crop, a large number of harvesting machines and their drivers and cleaners arrive from different States every season.

Though some local rich farmers purchased harvesting machines, they would not be sufficient to cut the crop transplanted on over 2.40 lakh acres in the district. About 1,500 harvesters run on chains come from Karnataka during kharif and almost half the figure in yasangi. Harvesters run on tyres are available locally and some in Karimnagar.

However, chain-type harvesters are in high demand as there is no wastage of crop with them. Moreover, they are suitable to ayacut lands as they are marshy even after crop comes to harvest. “Only chain vehicles are preferable in Nizamsagar ayacut and along the Godavari and if the government doesn’t allow them to come from Karnataka, farmers will become jittery,” said Parvataneni Charan Gopal, who provide vehicles on contract basis.

Crop is ready for cutting in about a week at Varni, Rudrur, Mosra, Yedapally, Bodhan and Nandipet mandals. All the mandals are under NSP or SRSP ayacut. If the machines are in shortage, demand would be high and machine owners may insist on higher prices for cutting.

“In the last kharif per-acre price for cutting had gone up to ₹2,250 and this season if harvesters are not available, the figure may go up to ₹3,000. The government needs to be alert to the likely situation and take the initiative to ensure availability of adequate number of machines,” said Charan, adding that authorities should focus on harvesters first instead of opening purchase centres as that is a next-stage arrangement.

Sivakumar, a farmer in Mupkal mandal, said an elected representative of a local body who owns two harvesters kept two Punjabi drivers, providing them all facilities with a good salary, in view of the high demand for them. Anticipating the critical situation arising out of COVID-19, he persuaded them to be available for harvesting, he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/paddy-harvesting-too-may-be-affected/article31185723.ece

In a relief to 1,239 employees relieved by the power utilities in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh following the final and supplementary reports of the Justice D.M. Dharmadhikari Committee, the One-Man Committee appointed by the Supreme Court, has issued directions to the utilities in the two States to pay regular monthly salary to the allocated employees from April 1.

In the directions mailed to the managements of four power utilities each in the two Telugu States on Thursday, Justice Dharmadhikari stated from Jabalpur that 655 employees relieved by the power utilities of Telangana following the final report of the committee issued on December 26 last year and 584 employees relieved by the utilities of AP were awaiting joining duties and awaiting postings in the entities allocated by the committee. As they have not been allowed to join duties by any of the power utilities in the two States, they were facing uncertainty and deprived of their salary.

Justice Dharmadhikari stated he was issuing the directions following a large number of representations received from the relieved employees and other officials concerned on email, in WhatsApp and over telephone raising concern over their fate since they were not being allowed to join duties by the allocated utilities. He further clarified that the committee would take up other outstanding issues in respect of allocation and arrears of salary once the restrictions imposed by the Central and State governments over the outbreak of coronavirus were lifted and the normal life was restored.

227,2020/03/27,RFCL commissioning delayed,"With lockdown in force, holiday declared for staff

The spurt in COVID-19 cases and the Union government declaring the lockdown till April 14 cast its impact on the commercial production of fertilizers by the Ramagundam Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited (RFCL) in Peddapalli district.

The Union government had taken up revival of the closed Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI) as RFCL at the existing plant area and incorporated it on February 17, 2015, as a gas-based urea manufacturing plant in Ramagundam. The authorities had planned commissioning of the urea plant before March 31.

However, the outbreak of the virus in the country and the lockdown by the government affected the commissioning of the plant. The authorities stopped all the pre-commissioning activities following the declaration of holiday for employees, including outsourcing staff.

The pre-commissioning works such as target plate flushing for turbine lines, Co2 section commissioning activities, and urea plant water flushing were stalled following the lockdown.

Sources said they would assess the situation after restoration of normalcy in the country. The remobilisation of contractors and manpower for starting the work afresh from the present status would be taken up only after the virus was completely wiped out from the country, they said.

The RFCL is a joint venture with the National Fertilizers Limited (NFL) and Engineers India limited (EIL) holding 26% equity each, the Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited and the Telangana government 11% each, GAIL India Limited 14.3%and the HTAS consortium 11.7%.

The foundation stone for the revival of the plant was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 7, 2016, at an estimated cost of ₹5,500 crore. The State government had also provided all assistance for the project such as laying internal roads in the plant and township areas, electricity supply and water supply from the Sripada Yellampall Project.

The RFCL is taking measures for reducing emission by installing a modern sewage treatment plant and checking air pollution by erecting tall chimneys. The plant would produce 3,850 metric tonnes of urea and 2,200 metric tonnes of ammonia per day. Godowns to store 20,000 metric tonnes of ammonia and 40,000 tonnes of urea are under construction.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/sk5lxz/article31186015.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28HYRFCL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/rfcl-commissioning-delayed/article31185278.ece

230,2020/03/27,They walked with parents for 50 km,"Lack of work forces labour to return home

Anjali, Soundarya, Suma, Indu and Kavay have been waking since 3 a.m. on Friday from Hyderabad. When they set out, they were yet to come out of the sleep totally and joined their parents.

None of them crossed eight years. The pathetic condition was that six-year-old Soundarya did not have even footwear. For some distance, the parents carried them. They walked for about 50 km by 11 a.m. and reached this village in Pulkal mandal.

Knowing about this, Superintendent of Police S. Chandrasekhar Reddy provided a vehicle for them and sent them to their native places. This was for the third day that a considerable number of people had returned from Hyderabad as there was no work for them owing to lockdown.

On Thursday, Vijay, hailing from a tanda near Vatpally, started to walk from Bandham Kommu in Ammenpur, but developed convulsions on the way and swooned on the roadside.

Though a call was made to 104 for ambulance, the first reply was that vehicle was not available. Later, after higher officials were informed, the ambulance reached the place and shifted him to a hospital where he was treated.

The news of a total of 12 persons walking to Vatpally, Pulkal and nearby areas was reported to the police and they provided a vehicle to them.

Superintendent of Police S. Chandrasekhar Reddy gave clear instructions to officials to provide vehicles to drop migrants, who were walking, at their native places.

Meanwhile, Andol MLA Ch. Kranthi Kiran came across some migrants and provided them food and vehicles.

“There are more than 500 people from Narayanakhed and surrounding areas who stay at BHEL and are ready to return to their native places. The government had better intervene and extend support to them,” K. Srinivas, who walked from Lingampally, told The Hindu.

233,2020/03/27,Coronavirus: Migrants’ homecoming seen with suspicion in Odisha,"Workers made to stay outside, undergo tests before allowed to enter villages

Tapan Kumar Nayak, Inspector at the Rajnagar police station under Odisha’s Kendrapara district, has been receiving frantic calls of late. Callers often complain about their neighbours either roaming outside their homes or sneezing and coughing.

The calls, however, do not surprise Mr. Nayak. He looks after the law and order situation in Rajnagar, where the concentration of migrant labourers is perhaps one of the densest in the country.

Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic made headlines, the migrant labourers’ homecomings have been seen with suspicion and the police officer’s primary role has been not to let the skepticism assume the shape of ostracisation. The tiny block has so far received 52 migrant labourers from abroad and 566 from other States.

Pattamundai, the adjacent block which sends plumbers to almost all corners of India and several foreign countries, has been witnessing an identical situation. The administration is now on its toes to make home isolation smoother for migrant workers.

‘Restraint advised’

“Police personnel in four vehicles do regular patrolling to ensure that those who are under home quarantine are not threatened. At the same time, we also advise migrant workers to adopt restraint and not put others lives in danger by coming out of their homes,” said Mr. Nayak.

Hundreds of kilometres away in the western Odisha district of Kalahandi, 12 migrant workers who returned from Kerala had to stay under polythene sheet for several days before being allowed in their village.

In Sinapali block of Nuapada district, the migrant labourers were made to undergo medical tests and only after that they could enter their villages.

As 82,000 migrant workers have already landed in their respective villages and fellow villagers are insisting on their self-quarantine, the situation in remote villages may become chaotic in the coming days.

“Everybody is scared. Villagers are aware of the threat COVID-19 poses. In the absence of proper education about what self-quarantine means, migrant labourers have to bear the brunt and are often subjected to humiliation,” said Umi Daniel, a prominent expert on migration issues.

Mr. Daniel said a unique initiative called telephone-based virtual community volunteers has been initiated to reach out to people in the migration-prone areas.

“We have started enrolling volunteers to clear confusion on the ground. Many educated people are now at home. We will rope them in so that they could pass on the right kind of message to their own community members,” he said.

Purpose defeated

In villagers, many thatched houses are either one-room or two-room without functional individual latrines. The home quarantine insisted by government loses its significance when family members have to be crammed in a small house. To address some practical issues, virtual volunteers are targeting 50 panchayats in Balangir, Bargarh, Kalahandi, Nuapada and Subarnapur districts for spreading awareness on COVID-19 threat and managing their lives.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wzemv9/article31187571.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE27-ODISHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/migrants-homecoming-seen-with-suspicion/article31187572.ece

Mr. Patnaik announced that financial assistance of ₹1,000 each will be provided to 94 lakh beneficiary families under the food security programme. A sum of ₹940 crore will be spent for this purpose. Advance ration for three months is being provided to these families under the food security programme, he said.

The Chief Minister announced that a total of 48 lakh beneficiaries were being paid pension for four months in advance under social security schemes. A sum of ₹932 crore will be spent on this account.

Mr. Patnaik further announced that ₹1,500 each will be paid to a total of 22 lakh construction workers in the State.

A sum of ₹330 crore will be spent for the purpose.

CM’s appeal

In a video message, Mr. Patnaik reiterated his appeal to the people to stay home to protect themselves from COVID-19.

On the other hand, the State government has been making efforts to trace all those who had come in contact with a person in the State who was diagnosed to be a COVID-19 patient on Thursday night.

The family members and driver of the patient, who is under treatment, have been kept in isolation. Since the patient had contacted one of the staff members of the Odisha Assembly, all the staff of the House have also been advised home quarantine. The Assembly building is also being disinfected.

235,2020/03/27,Haryana farmers in a spot over delay in wheat procurement,"‘A big challenge will be to store the crop at home and the additional cost incurred in transporting them’

With Haryana announcing start of procurement of wheat by mid-April, farmers on Friday said the ‘delay’ in government purchase would pose a big challenge to the farming community to store their produce and burden them with additional costs.

The government purchase of wheat — the main rabi (winter) crop — usually starts in the first week of April in Punjab and Haryana. This year, in Haryana, the government has announced that procurement will commence from April 20. Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had advised farmers that “till then they should stock the grain in their homes.”

Several farmers and farmers’ bodies believe that it is easier said than done. “A farmer usually brings a combine harvester machine to the field, harvests the crop and then takes it directly to the mandi (yard) for selling. This practice is adopted for a simple reason because most farmers don't have space to store their produce at their homes. How and where will one store the produce now?,” said Rattan Mann, president of the Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait).

Yamunanagar-based farmer Sanju Gudiyana told The Hindu that after harvesting the crop, storing the produce at home would mean burdening farmers with additional costs.

“I don’t have any space to store the crop in my house. It will be an additional financial burden if grain has to be stored in houses. First, I'll have to take the produce to my house and then later again to the mandi - it involves loading-unloading and transportation costs,” said Mr. Sanju, who has sown wheat in nearly 12 acre at Gudiyana village in Raduar.

The Chief Minister had, however, assured that in case any farmer is having trouble doing the same, the Marketing Board has been directed to look into the matter. “To make up for the loss that the farmers will face due to delay in procurement and the lockdown, a new scheme will be announced by the government soon,” he had stated.

The Assam government’s experiment with temporary relaxation of lockdown restrictions backfired on Friday as hundreds of people thronged the markets across the State to buy essential items.

The government lost no time in issuing a statement banning the operations of most shops after people threw caution to the wind and made a mockery of social distancing sought because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, presently in eastern Assam’s Jorhat, and Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma took note of the huge gatherings aired by news channels.

“I never thought people will behave like this during the relaxation on humanitarian grounds. We had insisted on following the guidelines on social distancing while buying essential items. People violated them. I am really sad,” Mr Sonowal said.

Chief Secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna soon issued the statement.

“All markets will remain closed until further order except grocery and pharmacies. Grocery shops will also provide vegetables, fruits, eggs, ginger, garlic and water. DCs (Deputy Commissioners) will organise distribution of vegetables, etc., through mobile vans in all areas on alternate days. All meat and fish shops will remain closed till March 31. It will be reviewed on April 1. DCs will fix appropriate time for opening of grocery stores as per local convenience,” the statement said.

The government directed people to follow the advisories on social distancing until further orders and warned that violations would attract penal provisions under Section 188 of the IPC..

Pay cut option

Mr. Sarma said the government was weighing the option of deducting a percentage of pay of its employees and reimbursing later with interest. “These are ideas we are discussing in case such a situation arises,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/grqpaw/article31187513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE27-ASSAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/curb-relaxation-nixes-social-distancing/article31187514.ece

The number of COVID-19 positive cases spiked to 38 in Punjab on Friday and of these at least 25 cases are directly or indirectly related to a 70-year-old man, who succumbed to the virus last week.

The deceased, a resident of Pathlawa village in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district, had arrived from Germany via Italy at Delhi airport on March 7 and proceeded to Punjab on the same day along with two fellow travellers. He had a history of diabetes and hypertension and was confirmed positive for COVID-19 on March 18. The trio defied the self-quarantine advisory of the government and went ahead with “socialising”.

‘Victim met many’

The deceased, a Granthi (priest) at a gurdwara in his village Pathlawa, attended Hola Mohalla festival in Anandpur Sahib between March 8 and 10 and returned to his village. Before being tested positive, the deceased and his two travel companions reportedly met scores of people and could have widely transmitted the disease.

“Five fresh cases have been reported today (March 27). Of the total 38 positive COVID-19 cases, 25 people are family members of the deceased or had come in contact with him. We are making all efforts to trace all those who came in contact with the trio from the time they returned to India. Close to 30 villages have been quarantined in those districts we believe that these people had travelled,” Punjab Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu told The Hindu.

State health department medical bulletin said that of the five new cases reported in Punjab on March 27, three patients, who are from Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, were in close contact with a positive patient. The other two patients are from Jalandhar and Ludhiana, it added.

First patient cured

Also, the first reported COVID-19 patient in Punjab has been cured.

240,2020/03/27,Arunachal’s tribes revive indigenous lockdown rituals,"A priest said that it is the first time in four decades that the ceremony was done

A tribal lockdown ritual has staged a comeback in Arunachal Pradesh, the State geographically closest to China’s Hubei province where the COVID-19 outbreak began.

The border State’s West Siang district ceremonially entered the Arr-Rinam phase at the stroke of 5 p.m. on Thursday. Arr-Rinam is the Galo equivalent of lockdown imposed by consensus for 48 hours whenever an epidemic strikes. The Galos, one of the 26 major tribes of Arunachal Pradesh, dominate West Siang distric

“Coronavirus has not yet attacked us, but we cannot be complacent,” said Kirba Sora, the president of Galo Welfare Society, an apex tribal body. “Arr-Rinam, which follows the Ali-Ternam ritual to ward off an epidemic, has been a part of our culture,” he added.

Ali-Ternam — Ali means epidemic and Ternam forestall — and Arr-Rinam were last performed almost four decades ago when a water-borne disease had affected many members of the community.

“We have been performing these rituals periodically for livestock, primarily the semi-wild mithun, that are prone to contagious diseases,” Mr. Sora said in a telephone interview from the district headquarters Aalo. “This is for the first time in 30-40 years that we performed the rituals for the safety of humans,” he added.

An executive engineer in the State’s Public Health Engineering and Water Supply Department, Mr. Sora was one of the two Bos or deputy priests, who performed the Ali-Ternam under the guidance of a Nyibo (shaman) from Wednesday morning.

The ritual ended with the community leaders sealing five major entry points of the district.

“As in the past, all of us locked ourselves in and banned the entry of anyone from outside. We did make a departure from tradition by adhering to the government’s social distancing guidelines, ensuring only a few people participated,” Mr. Sora said.

The Adi community inhabiting East Siang and Lower Dibang Valley districts too performed a similar ritual called Motor that they believe lets shamans with legendary powers to locate wild herbs to combat an epidemic.

In districts such as Papum Pare and East Kameng, the dominant Nyishi community observed Arrue involving self-quarantine. “We have rituals such as Khyasang-Ratar and Merii for preventing the entry of an epidemic to a village,” said Dahey Sangno, a project director of the District Rural Development Agency in East Kameng.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/g4czxn/article31186663.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28th-arunachal,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/arunachals-tribes-revive-indigenous-lockdown-rituals/article31186665.ece

242,2020/03/27,"Stay where you are, don’t walk back to hometown, Adityanath tells migrants","He says U.P. govt. will take care of their needs and will ensure they do not face any problems

As panic-stricken migrant labourers continued to flee from north Indian cities to their native places, many of them by foot, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday asked such people to remain where they where.

The State government would take care of their needs and would ensure they did not face any problems, the Chief Minister said.

“Don’t come out like that. You could also transport a disease,” said Mr. Adityanath.

Lack of supplies

While migrants from cities moved towards their native States, daily wage workers and labourers stationed in cities within Uttar Pradesh were also spotted returning to their native districts due to the uncertain period and lack of supplies.

“I appeal to all citizens of Uttar Pradesh, who are in Uttar Pradesh and those outside it, they should remain wherever they are,” Mr. Adityanath said.

The Chief Minister spoke to his counterparts in Maharashtra, Delhi and Haryana, some of the States from where Uttar Pradesh migrants are fleeing, and assured them that his government would bear the expenses of maintaining its citizens living in these States.

Earlier, Chief Secretary R.K. Tiwari instructed district magistrates to keep people coming to Uttar Pradesh from other States and destitutes in shelter homes and not permit them to go elsewhere under any circumstances. Community kitchens were being set up to feed such people.

Movement of people from one State to another would violate the lockdown declared by the Central government and increase chances of spreading COVID-19.

Despite the government’s assurances, migrants continued to flee to their hometowns, saying they didn’t have enough food supplies or money to sustain them. Many, however, are still stranded.

Stranded in hotel

Swarbhanu Nandi, a West Bengal native who works as an executive for a development NGO, was stranded in Jaunpur district where he arrived on March 16 to set up the local office of his organisation. Due to the lockdown over COVID-19, Mr. Nandi’s plans to hunt for a house were also foiled and he is stranded in a hotel he had checked in. Since he is unable to work under the present circumstances in Jaunpur and will not be allowed to go back to his hometown Jalpaiguri in West Bengal, he is in a dilemma.

“We can’t do anything,” he said, repeating the words of the police when he asked them for help in transporting him home.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/8ryx3t/article31186108.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-YogiAdityanath,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/stay-where-you-are-dont-walk-back-to-hometown-adityanath-tells-migrants/article31186106.ece
243,2020/03/27,"A long walk home for 30,000 tribal workers in M.P.","Many others from Jhabua are stranded in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra

Trudging tens of miles, switching transport four times and halting for nights at three cities, Lakhan Adivasi made it home in Jhabua district of Madhya Pradesh on Thursday morning.

“It was the longest ride back. We didn’t have much to eat, but we had to return to the safety of our home somehow,” says Mr. Lakhan, a construction worker who travelled 450 km from Rajkot in Gujarat, along with his wife and two teenage daughters.

Left without work after the lockdown was imposed nationwide to contain COVID-19, 30,000 tribal labourers from Jhabua have returned from Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra. Another 30,000 from the district are left stranded in these States.

With transport suspended, shops shuttered and food supply halted, some families hired pick-up trucks, while others hailed jeeps. But scores lumbered their way back to western Madhya Pradesh, carrying luggage, water cans and infants.

As he reached the Pitol entry point, health officials screened him and gave him food. They huddled families, including his, into a bus for a journey back to his village. On a microphone, an official advised each of them to stay indoors and maintain distance from one another.

“The spell of labourers returning is going to continue for two-three more days. Until now, labourers thought the movement was restricted,” says Abhay Singh Kharari, Sub Divisional Magistrate.

Another 5,000-7,000 labourers bound for Vidisha and Ujjain, and as far as Morena and Gwalior districts, 630 km away, crossed Jhabua through the Lambela and Kanjawani entry points from Gujarat, he adds.

Handy list

Mr. Kharari says that during the Assembly byelection and Lok Sabha election last year, the administration appealed to migrant labourers to return to vote. “That list is coming in handy now. We have requested the Collectors in Gujarat to make them stay there and provide food and medical aid, yet they are returning.”

Over 5,000 labourers from Rajasthan and Gujarat had returned to the neighbouring Alirajpur district, mostly in hired pick-up trucks, while another 200 had crossed it, says S.C. Verma, Upper Collector, Alirajpur. “Luckily, many had returned in February for Bhagoria haat, a tribal festival. Otherwise, many others would have been left stranded.”

Ruchika Chouhan, Collector of Ratlam district, says that for those travelling to other districts, a barrier-free movement has been ensured. So far, 250 of the labourers from the district have returned. “Panchayat officials inform us whenever a new member enters villages. Accredited Social Health Activists and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives screen them for symptoms,” she explains.

Earlier, they migrated intra-State for agricultural labour, but mechanisation forced them to take up construction work in other States. “Labour from Madhya Pradesh is comparatively cheap. After they return, they may find work locally with the ongoing harvest season. But the little subsistence farming they did is hit by the untimely rain,” she says.

Labourers are returning despite assurances by the local administrations of food and shelter, she says, because there is a sense of security back home. “Neighbours can support with food and finances. And women and children usually stay back, while men and teenagers go out for work. The family being together can help them tide over times like this.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/g09m94/article31186085.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Jhabua-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/a-long-walk-home-for-30000-tribal-workers-in-mp/article31186087.ece
244,2020/03/27,"Coronavirus | Travel and face police action, Gujarat warns migrant workers","The lockdown has left several daily-wagers without jobs.

The Gujarat government on Friday said migrant labourers would be given food and accommodation but won’t be allowed to travel to their villages during the 21-day lockdown in force to combat the novel coronavirus outbreak.

The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, an official said.

The lockdown has left several daily-wagers without jobs and they have been seen moving on foot to their villages, in the absence of public transport, to tide over the resultant cash crunch.

“It has been decided that no migrant labourer will be allowed to leave on foot. District administrations have been asked to make arrangements for their food and accommodation. A special number – 1077 – has been set up for migrant workers to contact for help,” Ashwini Kumar, secretary in the chief minister’s office told reporters reporters here.

Valsad Collector C.R. Kharsan said police cases will be filed against migrant workers and their employers if they are found travelling to their villages.

“Employers or contractors who have employed migrant labourers will have to provide 21 days salary and food to them. If they fail, then migrant workers can contact 1077 helpline. But if anybody tries to travel to their villages, then a police case will be filed against such persons and their employers,” Mr. Kharsan said.

Secretary in CMO Kumar said earlier, considering the humanitarianism aspect, the chief minister had allowed workers to leave by state transport and private buses, but that has been stopped and they would have to stay where they are presently.

“Government had deployed around 150 state transport and 500 private buses to take daily wage workers to Rajasthan and tribal areas of Gujarat in the last two days,” he said.

Mr. Kumar said people stranded due to the lockdown can call 1070 and seek help, adding that the government would make arrangements for their food and accommodation.

247,2020/03/27,Coronavirus | Assam’s neighbours worried by stamping of truckers,"Because of a geographical advantage, essential commodities first reach Assam by train or road before being transshipped to neighbouring States.

Assam’s neighbours are worried by the screening and stamping of truck drivers and handymen assigned transportation of essentials amid a countrywide lockdown.

The hill States in the Northeast surrounding Assam largely depend on supplies from outside the region. Because of a geographical advantage, essential commodities first reach Assam by train or road before being transshipped to the neighbouring States.

The Meghalaya government has taken the lead in pointing out that truckers bringing essential goods were being screened, stamped and sent to quarantine in Assam. Some truck drivers sent from Meghalaya to fetch essentials have met the same fate too.

“This has created a serious problem for Meghalaya,” State’s Chief Secretary M.S. Rao said, adding that he wrote a letter in this regard to his Assam counterpart Kumar Sanjay Krishna on Thursday.

‘Supplies will be hit’

Mr. Rao said stamping and quarantining of truck drivers and handymen from Meghalaya done routinely would lead to delay in ensuring adequate essential commodities in the hill State. He also pointed out that depots and unloading points in Assam were giving preference to trucks destined for the districts of Assam.

“I would gently advise caution and medical certainty on the issue, so that only those exhibiting symptoms are stamped for quarantine,” Mr Rao said in the letter.

Officials in Meghalaya said there would be very few truckers left to transport essentials if they were stamped and quarantined in Assam at the present rate.

Mr. Krishna said he had taken up the issue with the authorities concerned. “[There is] no stamping if the trucker is asymptomatic,” he told The Hindu on Friday.

Most of the mosques and shrines across the valley, including those in the summer capital here, were closed on the appeal of the administration to avoid large gatherings for congregational prayers on Friday, they added.

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the 21-day countrywide lockdown on Tuesday evening, the Union Territory administration here had announced a lockdown across Jammu and Kashmir till March 31 on Sunday as part of its efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

The administration said essential services, including healthcare personnel, were exempted from the restrictions.

It asked people to cooperate and warned of action for violating the prohibitory orders.

The district administrations have put in place a mechanism to ensure uninterrupted supplies and deliveries of essential services to the general public. Essential commodities will be home-delivered to the residents as part of the mechanism.

However, there have been reports of violations by people at several places across the valley, following which the police have taken action by effecting arrests and seizing vehicles.

The markets across the valley were shut and public transport was off the roads with only pharmacies and groceries allowed to open, the officials said.

Educational institutions across Kashmir have been closed, while all public places including gymnasiums, parks, clubs and restaurants were shut down more than a week before the lockdown announced by the prime minister.

Restrictions were first imposed in many parts of the valley on Thursday last week to contain the spread of the virus. The measures were taken after a 67-year-old woman from the Khanyar area of the city, who had returned from Saudi Arabia on March 16 after performing Umrah, tested positive for COVID-19.

The number of coronavirus cases has gone up to 10 in the valley, while the figure for the Union Territory is 13.

251,2020/03/27,"Migrant workers from Odisha stranded in Tamil Nadu, Kerala because of lockdown","Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has urged his counterparts in other States to take care of them

Unable to return home because of the lockdown, a large number of Odia migrant workers, who were working as daily wagers in different unorganised sectors, are now stranded in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

Most of them are from Ganjam district. According to Pratap Chandra Pradhan, convenor Prabasi Odisha Sharamik Sangathan (Migrant Odisha Workers’ Organisation), over 2,000 of them are now stranded in Chennai, while around 600 are in Ernakulam of Kerala. There are also stranded Odia migrant labourers in different parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat.

When contacted over phone, Jatia Mahakud of Jugudi-Balabhadrapur village of Samakhemundi block of Ganjam district described the plight faced by him and labourers in Chennai. According to him, around 2,000 migrant labourers from Ganjam district are now stranded in groups at eight places in Guindy area of Chennai.

The building where Mr. Mahakud stays houses 160 labourers in 13 rooms and two halls. Ten or more persons live in a single room. “Most of us were daily wagers, who got employed at construction sites, goods loading-unloading work at markets and other menial work. The rice stock they had brought from home is about to end and most of us have our last savings of a few hundred rupees in pocket”, said Mr. Mahakud.

On Thursday, the group of stranded labourers living with Mr. Mahakud were provided two bags of rice and spices by the Chennai administration.

Chitrasena Bisoi, another menial labourer from Chadheiapalli village of Digapahandi block stranded in Chennai, said that since the past two weeks they are without work. “By the time most of us decided to return to Odisha, the train services had stopped. Most of us waited to get unpaid small payments from our employers,” he said. In most cases, the payments that these menial labourers waited for was 1,000 rupees or less, he added.

Both Mr. Mahakud and Mr. Bisoi said they only wanted to return to Odisha. Most of these stranded labourers are in the 20 to 40 years age group. They are married and have families to look after at their homes in villages of Ganjam district.

Satyaban Nayak, a migrant menial labourer from Surada area of Ganjam district, now stranded in Ernakulam in Kerala, also described a similar plight away from home. According to him, around 600 Odia migrant labourers like him are now staying in groups at different places of Ernakulam. “Our greatest worry is that we have no money with us. As we are not in a position to pay our house rent, our house owners may ask us to vacate,” he said. These daily wagers were searching for work on a daily basis in different sectors in Kerala. Since March 22, due to lockdown, they are unable to get any work or income.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee wrote to Chief Ministers of 18 States on Thursday urging them to provide food, shelter and medical facilities to all semi-skilled and unskilled workers from the State who have been stranded due to the lockdown.

“Due to complete lockdown in the country due to COVID-19 pandemic, many Bengal workers could not travel back and are struck at different places,” the letter said. These migrant workers, it said, are in groups of 50 to 100 and can easily be identified by the administration.

“I take the opportunity to request you to kindly ask your administration to provide them with basic shelter, food and medical support during this period of crisis,” the letter said. The State administration was getting SOS calls from these group of workers. Ms. Banerjee said said West Bengal Chief Secretary would pass on details to the chief secretaries of the States concerned to hasten the process of humanitarian support.

The letter was addressed to Chief Ministers of Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, Punjab and eight other States.

253,2020/03/27,"Northeast eyes retired doctors, medical students to tackle COVID-19","States prepare stadiums and school buildings to be used as quarantine centres for suspected cases

Doctors are being called out of retirement and medical students roped in as the northeastern States prepare stadiums and school buildings to be used as quarantine centres for suspected COVID-19 cases.

The Mizoram government has recalled retired doctors and paramedics in view of the shortage of manpower in combating the pandemic.

“We are collecting details of the retired doctors but will use their services only when a major crisis arises,” State’s Principal Director of Health, F. Lallianhlira, said.

Final year students

In Assam, the government has decided to use the services of MBBS and nursing students in their final year of study for meeting emergency needs.

“There are 700 final year MBBS students in Assam’s medical colleges and about 2,000 final year nursing students who have three-four months of course left. They are more or less doctors and nurses. We have prepared a training module for them from tomorrow [Friday] or day after [Saturday],” Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.

Besides, private hospitals have offered the services of young doctors who have returned after medical studies from outside Assam, he added.

Mr. Sarma said the government had been readying two multi-purpose stadiums in Guwahati to be used as quarantine centres for suspected coronavirus cases. Among those to be shifted to these centres are about 700 people who are stranded on the Assam-West Bengal border, and not allowed to enter until a proper arrangement was made for them.

Of the 210 suspected cases in Assam so far, none has tested positive, officials said.

Move to use schools

In Manipur, the government’s move to use some schools as quarantine centres has come in for criticism. The opposition Congress has advised using some vacant hotels instead.

“In schools, people quarantined will end up sharing the same hall, classroom or toilet. Hotel rooms with attached toilet is a safer and much more hygienic option,” Congress spokesperson Ningombam Bupenda Meitei said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/northeast-eyes-retired-doctors-medical-students-to-tackle-covid-19/article31177164.ece

Urging police personnel to exercise maximum restraint in the difficult situation, the Chief Minister asked them to find more compassionate ways of handling curfew violations, especially in cases of individuals found moving out for essentials.

“Use of corporal means to punish violators could not be allowed,” Captain Amarinder said, directing Director General of Police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta to take all possible steps to sensitise police personnel and warn them against taking the law into their hands in dealing with cases of curfew violation.

Captain Amarinder also took note of reports of a recorded telephonic message purported to have been released by Gurpatwant Singh Pannu of Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), and said any attempt by him or anyone else to provoke the youth of Punjab to violate the curfew would not be tolerated.

Meanwhile, DGP Gupta said that while by and large, police personnel were seen to be caring and gentle, there had been a few cases of some of them using force against those found violating the restrictions. Mr. Gupta said he had made it clear that there should be zero tolerance to physical beatings etc.

255,2020/03/27,Death toll in Maharashtra reaches five,"All deceased are senior citizens; Sindhudurg reports first case

Two 65-year-old-women died on Thursday taking the death toll due to the novel coronavirus in Maharashtra to five. While one was a resident of Govandi, who died at a Navi Mumbai hospital, the other patient from Elphinstone, near Parel, succumbed at Kasturba Hospital.

The overall count of COVID-19 positive patients in the State has gone up to 130 with three people from Sangli, who are contacts of the first patient detected in Islampur, one from Kolhapur and one from Pune testing postive. One case each was also reported from Sindhudurg (its first), Nagpur and Mumbai.

According to civic health officials, the woman from Elphinstone reportedly ran a dabba service from her residence and many employees working at the nearby corporate offices also came to eat meals at her home. While she did not have any international or domestic travel history, officials have now traced nearly 10 contacts who came to her house to eat food or collect meal boxes. “She developed fever and cough and visited a local doctor but the medicines did not work. When she went to the doctor again, he referred her to Kasturba Hospital,” said one civic official. The woman had diabetes and hypertension and was admitted to Kasturba on March 23 where she tested positive for COVID-19.

All five deaths in the State have been reported from Mumbai and all victims are senior citizens.

On Thursday, Sindhudurg recorded a COVID-19 case. A 54-year-old Dombivali resident, who had travelled to Kankavli by Mangalore Express on March 19, tested positive. The Sindhudurg authorities were alerted by the Railways after they were informed that one passenger tested positive. “We have admitted all the nine travellers who alighted at Kankavli to the Civil Hospital in Oras,” said nodal officer Dr. S.H. Patil adding that the patient’s mother, a senior citizen, has tested negative.

257,2020/03/27,"Poor in dire straits as lockdown triggers joblessness, limits access to food","Ragpicker Appa Rao has eight packets of biscuits to survive on in Odisha’s capital Bhubaneswar

Hundred hours have passed since ‘janata curfew’, dubbed as a dry run of the prolonged lock-down imposed in the country for COVID-19, Ohi Appa Rao (60), a ragpicker, has had just eight packets of biscuits to survive on.

Appa Rao considers himself lucky for having access to biscuits as some benevolent passers-by stumbled upon him while he was sleeping empty stomach under Rajmahal Flyover, a busy junction before the lockdown in Bhubaneswar.

“My friends who go to pick discarded plastic and bottles along with me must be having a terrible time. I don’t know where they are. I get about ₹50 a day by selling plastic. It’s enough for me to survive for a day. Now, even if I start collecting discarded polythene and bottles where would I dispose them and get money to buy ration?,” asked the rag-picker, who had made Bhubaneswar his home after migrating from Andhra Pradesh eight years ago.

On a normal day, he would go to any Aahaar Centre that sells subsidized food at ₹5 per meal and sometime get leftover food in residential colonies. Appa Rao does not figure in any list of the poor under public distribution system.

The population of distressed poor both in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack runs into lakhs.

The lockdown announced by the government to prevent spread of COVID-19 could sound the death knell for them before the virus actually knocks them down.

Kanta Pradhan, a maid, appears to be on a better footing. She has been paid one month’s advance salary of ₹2500. But this is not enough for the family of four as her husband in Salia Sahi, the biggest slum of the State, has become jobless following the lockdown restrictions. “If any emergency like health issue comes up, we will surely starve,” she said.

In order to avoid crowding at Aahaar Kendras (centre for subsidized food for the urban poor), the State government has closed down 102 such centres.

Only 36 are functioning near hospitals.

When asked if the State government has any plan to reopen Aahaar Centres for poor who have found themselves in a difficult situation, G. Mathi Vathanan, State Housing and Urban Development Secretary, said, “at present there is no such plan before the government to reopen Aahaar Centres. We would soon come up with a plan to provide them food.”

Shutting down of roadside eateries has made the matter worse.

Virus fear

Following Prime Minister’s call for encouraging service providers, some volunteers have started serving food to on-duty police personnel. However, the charitable organisations are clueless on distribution of cooked or dry food to the urban distressed people. They fear for COVID-19 as well as high handedness of police.

In rural pockets, community often helps poor villagers at the time of crisis. But this time, people are reluctant to come out in fear of contracting the virus.

‘Home delivery’

“The denial of access to food in the districts and towns under lockdown need to be addressed through home delivery mechanism adhering to social distancing. The government must resume emergency feeding programmes that had been discontinued for years in several parts of Odisha,” said Sameet Panda, a lead campaigner of Right To Food campaign.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gf6ygw/article31177077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE26-APPA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/poor-in-dire-straits-as-lockdown-triggers-joblessness-limits-access-to-food/article31177078.ece
258,2020/03/27,Walking through Nalini Malani’s works on Instagram,"The artist will explore the idea of identity, oppression, dominance and freedom in a virtual walkthrough today

Behind doors that can now be witnessed virtually; the resounding voices on the streets, from the (now disbanded, owing to the COVID-19 outbreak) sit-in protest by women at Mumbai Bagh, Morland Road at Bhau Daji Lad Musuem, finds resonance in The Witness by artist, Nalini c, that can be accessed on the museum’s Instagram handle.

The show explores concerns that have preoccupied Malani’s art for decades, through immersive installations, ephemeral wall drawings, animation chambers, and her signature video/shadow plays. In a digital tour of the show via Instagram, we can see Malani navigate through the politics of identity, oppression, dominance, freedom, and community. Like many artists, Malani is ‘a witness’ of the death of the progressive socialist state.

Promise of hope

The artist was forced to accept the metamorphosis of home, and identity after Partition in 1947. “My mother was Sikh, my father was an agnostic, and my grandparents were Theosophists. Eventually, it was the diversity of the Indian nation that made settling down easier,” shares Malani. Twenty-two years later, the artist created a stop-motion animated film, Dream Houses (1969), that reflects the idealism and hope that modernism brought in the Nehruvian era, post-Independence.

In 1969, a 23-year-old Malani was inspired by architect, Charles Correa’s utopian vision for Navi Mumbai. It drove her to produce the two-minute animation at Akbar Padamsee’s Vision Exchange Workshop. ‘Variation I’ (The second variation exists both as an independent film, and as part of Malani’s double film projection installation ‘Utopia, 1969–76’) flashes on a screen, reminiscent of a psychedelic game of tetris. When observed closely, you see faces in the shifting shapes, scrambling to find space in a cramped city.

Memory and emotion

Malani’s Instagram page, has an array of colourful animations that appear, and disappear across posts. These are a part of her five-channel installation, Can You Hear Me? (2018/2019) which was developed in collaboration with the Goethe Institut / Max Mueller Bhavan, Mumbai for their Golden Jubilee in 2019. The installation is a combination of 56 iPad animations, that first found life in the artist’s notebooks. Popping-up in the form of thought bubbles, the bright sketches, and quirky tunes are a glimpse into the artist’s collective stream of consciousness.

Malani describes the whimsical drawings as “memory emotion,” which are reflective of the viewer’s own frenzied mind. Powerful quotes about oppression, democracy, rape, and the dispossessed by Hannah Arendt, George Orwell, Veena Das, and Martin Luther King Jr. mingle with images from the artist’s own imagination, Goya, Japanese prints, and Kalighat paintings.

“What is it in the human mind that doesn’t think of the other?” questions the concerned 73-year-old artist. In her drawings titled City of Desires (Variation III), 1992/2020 People Come and Go, Malani tackles the inequality faced by economically, and financially troubled citizens, who might not have the required documentation to prove their citizenship. “How is it, that in their own land, they are suddenly declared as uncitizen?” she asks.

The charcoal and ink drawings depict a 19th century map of Mumbai that nudges a catatonic young man, possibly from rural India, to join the work force for survival. An enlarged thumbprint is sketched into the corner of the white wall, standing as an allegory of identity.

Politics of identity

Perhaps the most evocative thought of the show lies in the words of an illiterate cotton farmer, Bahinabai, who became a noted Marathi poet, posthumously. The Marathi version of her poem, Dharitrichya Kushimadhi, is written on the same wall that discusses the thumbprint and the politics of identity. The poetic verse speaks of the nurturing seed within a mortal, who is driven by creation, and not religion. “What is it in the human being that wants to annihilate?” asks Malani rhetorically.

With multiple works in her show – ‘In Search of Vanished Blood’; ‘(Variation IV)’, 2012/2020; ‘The Witness’ (2019), and ‘Listening to the Shades’ (2008/2013), Malani navigates the complications of human behaviour through the eyes of Cassandra, the mythological princess of Troy. The artist believes that every man and woman is made-up of equal parts masculinity, and femininity, and it’s imperative to acknowledge that balance. “If we divorce gender from the psyche, we will better understand the crux of humanity,” she says.

In the eponymous artwork of the show, the artist uses a reverse painted triptych on acrylic to convey thoughts about manmade borders, divide, and conflict. As Cassandra hovers across the margins of the canvas, the viewer’s eyes follow words by Polish poet, Wislawa Szymborska, “ I like maps, because they lie. Because they give no access to the vicious truth…” The significance elides with the reality of the world, where maps are devoid of graveyards, battlegrounds, or destruction which are all clear demarcations of our power hungry race. “We’re in the midst of an alpha patriarchal time, that is drenched in cannibalistic capitalism,” says Malani. By highlighting the stark state of affairs, the artist hopes to “bring back the love.”

A conversation with Nalini Malani, along with videos, and posts, from the exhibition will be uploaded on Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum’s Instagram handle @bdlmuseum on Saturday, March 28, 11.30 a.m.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/bc0bdj/article31187144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28bmNalini-Malani-Barcelona-2019,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/walking-through-nalini-malinis-works-on-instagram/article31187145.ece
259,2020/03/27,Coronavirus and art in a petri dish,"Meet three American artists who create art inspired from virus structures and cellular reactions to allay fear and increase awareness about microbial science

A deadly virus is making its way around the world, spreading sickness and death. But not everyone is fearful; some artists are looking at Covid-19 and other viruses (and bacteria) with childlike curiosity. “Fear is never a great place to start a conversation,” says Brooklyn-based Laura Splan, whose works include a series of lace doilies depicting the structures of deadly viruses, including those responsible for past global epidemics such as SARS (2003) and MERS (2012). “I hope my work compels people to unpack their complex relationships with the biological world,” she adds.

San Francisco artist Klari Reis’ paintings on petri dishes are inspired by the imagery of how cells react to drugs, while California artist-scientist David Goodsell’s watercolours of molecular structures are a result of hours of research in his lab. His recent rendering of the coronavirus — released on Twitter for his 7,000+ followers — is both wall decor and study material. Though it looks like a spring flower, it includes in great detail the proteins, membrane and mucus in the respiratory tract that the virus interacts with, showing that it is “just little collections of molecules that can be understood and… fought”.

David Goodsell

Putting a face on foes

“My goal with this painting, and with previous portraits of life-threatening viruses, is to demystify and put a face on these submicroscopic foes,” says Goodsell. His illustrations are so aesthetically pleasing that, despite depicting deadly viruses, they are used in fabric designs and are part of private collections and exhibitions. Recently, a colouring book version of his coronavirus painting was made available for free to download, on RCSB PDB (a member of World Wide Protein Data Bank) website.

A scientist who does research on structural molecular biology, Goodsell’s inclination towards applying artwork to science began when he was in graduate school in the 80s, developing computer graphics methods to display and analyse the results of his experiments. He began the paintings because the cellular scenes were “too complex to be done with computer graphics [back then]”.

He has illustrated structures of HIV, Ebola and E.Coli among other viruses. Each painting, done on a 300 lb watercolour paper, takes 10 to 20 hours to complete. “I spend a comparable amount of time researching the subject so that it is as scientifically accurate as possible,” says Goodsell, who is also a professor of Computational Biology at Scripps Research Institute, California.

For painting the coronavirus, he used the available structural data of SARS virus from scientific publications. The Covid 19 virus belongs to the family of coronaviruses that include SARS and MERS, and is structurally similar to them.

Klari Reis

Action and reaction

Reis was in her 20s, when she was diagnosed with Crohn’s, an inflammatory bowel disease. She had just moved to the UK to study art, after ending her career as an architect in San Francisco. When she realised that one of the medicines that she was allergic to in the US was being sold under a different name in the UK, she decided to pause and study how her cells reacted to pharmaceuticals.

“Under the microscope, looking at my own cells, I remember being blown away by the colours,” she says. She recalls seeing the cell structures highlighted by Hoechst stains (blue fluorescent dyes) against a black background. Inspired by the cellular movements and reactions, she began depicting them in her paintings.

She mixes coloured powder and dyes with epoxy resin, usually used for flooring, to create a gooey paint that she applies on petri dishes. “It takes me a couple of weeks to complete a painting, I work on about a dozen at a time,” says Reis, whose works are housed in Microsoft Research Ltd in London, Royal Caribbean Cruise lines, Morgan Stanley building in NYC, among others. Klari has been posting one petri dish painting a day on her blog The Daily Dish, since 2013.

Laura Splan

Turning fear to wonder

In 2004, soon after the SARS epidemic, Splan brought out a series of works called Doilies. Traditionally used to protect surfaces of furniture or flatware, their designs are inspired from nature. Splan’s doilies were inspired from the structure of viruses such as SARS, HIV, Influenza, Herpes and Hepadna.

The situation back then was similar to what it is now; though the number of people infected by Covid 19 today has far surpassed that by SARS. Photos of people wearing protective masks and microbial imagery consumed the media, bringing with them a sense of fear, she recalls. “Conflating the traditional radial doily form with a deadly virus was an attempt to create a situation in which the viewer could transpose a state of wonder on to the very structure of the virus which they feared,” she says.

At present, Splan, who has a Bachelors in Studio Art, is working on a project that involves dyeing the wool of laboratory llamas (which are used to produce antibodies for human drugs) with genetically manipulated E. coli bacteria. “I am experimenting with getting the bacteria to express green, blue and purple pigment,” she says.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/gcedtf/article31182969.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/150-hypochondria,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/coronavirus-and-art-in-a-petri-dish/article31182970.ece

Rohit, who has been out of action for last two months due to calf muscle injury was due for a comeback in the Indian Premier League, which has been postponed till April 15 but stands a good chance of getting cancelled if the prevailing situation continues.

“We should first think about the country. The situation needs to get better first then we can talk about the IPL. Let life get back to normal first,” Rohit said.

The opener was responding to questions during an Instagram chat with teammate Yuzvendra Chahal.

261,2020/03/27,"M.S. Dhoni will get one last chance, says Keshav Ranjan Banerjee","Childhood coach says the icon is using the facilities at home to stay fit.

M.S. Dhoni’s much-anticipated comeback with the IPL may not happen any time soon, but his childhood coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee remains hopeful that the wicketkeeper-batsman will find a place in India’s T20 World Cup squad.

“In the current scenario, the IPL looks unlikely and we will have to wait for BCCI’s call. His (Dhoni’s) position will become tough obviously. But my sixth sense says he will get a chance in the T20 World Cup, which will be his last,” Banerjee told PTI from Ranchi.

The Chennai Super Kings captain trained in Ranchi in the lead up to IPL 2020 and also led the camp in Chennai.

“I spoke to him last after he returned from Chennai and I’m in constant touch with his parents. He’s doing his fitness training and is fully fit.

Experience counts

“True that he has not played a tournament (since July 2019) but for someone with 538 International matches, I don’t think it would take much time to adjust.”

Also Read ICC Board to discuss contingency plans

“He trained in Chennai for a week or so. Now he’s making use of the facilities at home. He has a gym, a badminton court, and a running corridor.”

“Let’s wait for the BCCI’s decision. There are no tournament. ICC tournaments are off till June. So we will have to wait and see.”

262,2020/03/27,How Azharuddin opened up a new chapter for Tendulkar,"Former India skipper recalls the tour which saw the ‘Little Master’ don a new role

Mohammad Azharuddin and Sachin Tendulkar shared a special bond when it came to scripting some of the most memorable moments in Indian cricket history.

On March 27, 1994, at Auckland in New Zealand, skipper Azhar, in consultation with manager Ajit Wadekar, promoted Tendulkar to open the innings for the first time. And the rest is history.

The gifted cricketer responded with a stunning onslaught on the Kiwi bowling, scoring a 49-ball 82 (15x4, 2x6).

How exactly did that materialise? “I had been noticing that nothing big was happening with Sachin even though he was batting well at No. 5 and 6. We (Wadekar sir and I) talked about this and decided to let Sachin open after regular opener Sidhu (Navjot Singh) was unwell,” recalled Azhar in an exclusive chat with The Hindu on Friday.

Sachin’s desire

“And, importantly, Sachin also wanted to open and we are glad that he went on to become one of the greatest batsmen of all-time,” he added.

“I won’t say I was surprised by his response, I knew Sachin had the talent. He just needed that opportunity to showcase his abundance of talent,” the 57-year-old said.

Mohammad Azharuddin.

But, what was it about Sachin’s batting that made you take the call? “He is an attacking batsman and with the field restrictions on, we thought once he gets going half the job is done for the team,” said the former India skipper.

Even Sachin acknowledged it in his autobiography Playing It My Way. “I went up to Azhar and our manager Ajit Wadekar, a former India captain and a leading batsman of his time, and pleaded with them to give me an opportunity at the top of the order,” he wrote.

“I can’t take pride for his achievements. In fact, nobody can. He had the talent to go places,” Azhar said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/sz1oos/article31186560.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28SACHIN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/how-azharuddin-opened-up-a-new-chapter-for-tendulkar/article31186561.ece

Batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar on Friday donated ₹50 lakh to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, which has so far claimed 17 Indian lives and wreaked havoc globally.

Tendulkar’s donation is so far the biggest contribution among India’s leading sportspersons, some of whom have pledged their salaries while a few others have donated medical equipment to fight the dreaded outbreak, which has caused more than 24,000 deaths globally.

“Sachin Tendulkar decided to contribute ₹25 lakh each to Prime Minister’s Relief Fund and Chief Minister’s Relief Fund in his bid to join the fight against COVID-19. It was his decision that he wanted to contribute to both funds,” a source privy to the development, told PTI on conditions of anonymity.

Tendulkar has been associated with a lot of charity work and there has been umpteen times, he has taken up social causes, helped people, which has never been brought to public notice.

264,2020/03/27,"Lockdown a welcome break, says TN Ranji player Jagadeesan","Says he is spending some quality time with his parents

Tamil Nadu Ranji cricketer N. Jagadeesan has taken the 21-day lockdown in a positive way.

“Given the current situation, it’s better to stay safe and secure at home. To be honest, the lockdown has come as a welcome break for me. It has been a long season and I am making the best use of the break to spend some quality time with my parents,” he said.

Given their packed schedules, most players hardly get time with their families.

“That’s why my mother is so excited. She keeps cooking different dishes. I also chat a lot with my father about cricket,” said Jagadeesan.

With so much time to kill, what else does he do? “I keep myself busy with PlayStation games (FIFA and NBA), and also watch some good movies,” he said.

About keeping fit during this period, the 24-year-old said: “Sportspersons need to be active and fit. They cannot be tied down for many days. It’s difficult to remain this way, but there’s no other option. I keep myself fit by doing a lot of work in the gym. I play some tennis ball cricket, too, with my dad.”

The wicketkeeper-batsman, who made heads turn with a sensational innings of 183 in the Ranji game against Saurashtra at Rajkot, said he was following the schedule given by trainer Arun.

“I simply can’t afford to skip it [training] as I need to be back on the field whenever things improve.”

With the Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL) coming to his hometown — Coimbatore — this seaon, Jagadeesan is thrilled. “It will be a dream come true to play in front of my people. I hope and pray it will be on (in June).”

Around a dozen players from Coimbatore are expected to figure in the TNPL. “They are all waiting, and it is here that the mental preparation comes into play,” said Jagadeesan.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/1swe3l/article31176292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27JAGADEESAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/lockdown-a-welcome-break-says-tn-ranji-player-jagadeesan/article31176293.ece

An official from Salem Division of Southern Railway told The Hindu the doctor was transferred from Erode Railway Hospital to Podanur Railway Hospital earlier in March as part of the routine transfer. After being relieved on March 20, she arrived in Podanur on March 23, where she felt feverish. “She did not treat anyone at Podanur Railway Hospital,” the official said, adding she went on leave immediately after feeling unwell. As a precautionary measure, both the railway hospitals in Erode and Podanur were sealed on Friday, the official noted.

Official sources at the district adminstration said that the doctor was admitted in the isolation ward at ESI Hospital on the night of March 25 after she showed COVID-19 symptoms. Five of her contacts had also been quarantined at ESI Hospital. The results of their swab samples were awaited, sources said.

268,2020/03/27,Doubts raised over drinking water supplied in cans,"Shyam Sundar, who runs a water can delivery business is in a fix. Three days into the lockdown, he wonders if he should risk the safety of his delivery boys by sending them to homes to deliver water cans.

“As I read more, I’m worried. These are young boys and I do not know which house is safe and which house isn’t.” But that is only part of his concern.

The safety of the treated water and the canning of them in the water treatment plants is something Mr. Sundar witnesses everyday. Today like never before, he is a concerned man. “I have asked my wife to boil the water and not to take any chance,” says Mr. Sundar, who services about 300 houses in Krishnagiri.

Barring a few homes that could afford self-owned water treatment facilities, drinking water for a majority of the households come from the water treatment plants.

The question of safety of drinking water delivered in cans from RO units is being raised by both consumers and water can suppliers.

ISI norms

According to Mr. Sundar, the RO units are largely immune to scrutiny when it comes to safety protocols. There are ISI norms for RO units, that the handling of cans should be done wearing head caps, and gloves. Even during normal times, these norms were never followed and the units were never vetted for these sanitation related protocols, he says.

Since the RO units are allowed unhindered operation with drinking water qualifying as essential commodity, the units should be vetted and the persons handling the water cans should be screened, he says. “Perhaps, for each unit, they should mandate only two persons handle the canning of water, and ensure the plastic can surfaces are safe and sanitised. Perhaps the two persons designated should also be screened,” says Mr. Sundar.

For now, he has decided to leave water cans at the entrance of the homes, making exceptions only for households with elderly and women only.

When contacted, Collector S. Prabhakar said, immediate attention will be given to RO units, “There are 38 units functioning in the district, and we will send teams to ensure they adhere to the safety protocols.”",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ursn60/article30975757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA04WATERCAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/doubts-raised-over-drinking-water-supplied-in-cans/article31186707.ece
269,2020/03/27,District administration re-opens Uzhavar Sandhais,"The wholesale vegetable markets in the city will also function, partly out of three bus stands, says Collector

In front of the Uzhavar Sandhai at RS Puram, boxes were drawn, each a couple of feet apart, on either side of the entry gate and the public stood moved in a queue, from one box to another. As they entered the market in two lines, the police at the gate advised the customers to decide before they got in on the vegetables they wanted to buy.

Inside, there were nearly 60 farmers selling vegetables and customers waited in a line, a few feet apart from each other, and shopped without crowding at any place. The police said that at any point of time only about 50 people were inside.

The State government ordered re-opening of Uzhavar Sandhais so that the public do not face any problems in buying vegetables. But they had to follow the precautionary measures against COVID-19. Several customers and some of the sellers too wore masks.

Collector K. Rajamani said that in the coming days, more number of farmers were expected to bring their produce to the markets and there were arrangements to accommodate them outside the market premises too, if there was a need.

The wholesale vegetable markets in the city would also function, partly out of three bus stands in the city. “Our concern is we should avoid crowding,” he said.

One of the customers at the Uzhavar Sandhai suggested that the stalls could be allotted based on the vegetables that the sellers had. With this, customers could buy onions at one row of stalls and tomatoes from another.

At the Uzhavar Sandhai at Vadavalli, a customer alleged that some of the farmers were keeping the vegetables for wholesalers and did not sell to consumers on Friday.

In Singanallur, the Uzhavar Sandhai had just a couple of farmers. There were nearly 60 who had spread the vegetables outside the market and customers crowded the stalls.

Ponmani, a seller, said she usually took greens (keerai) to the Ukkadam market. Since there was no bus service, she brought the greens to Singanallur market for sales. Ramesh from Ukkadam said that for the last four days he had been selling lemons outside the market. The farmers usually sold from 4.30 a.m. to 8.30 a.m.. From Saturday, they would occupy the stalls inside the market.

A police personnel said the market was to open at 5 a.m. on Friday. But the farmers had spread the vegetables outside even by 4 a.m. and started sales.

Mr. Rajamani, who visited the Uzhavar Sandhai, told the sellers that they could have stalls outside the market too, but there should not be any crowding. He later inspected works at the bus stand on Mettupalayam road for the vegetable whole salers to put up stalls there and asked the traders at MGR market to take turns in putting up stalls at the market.

M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran market vegetable traders association, said about 100 shops from the Ukkadam market would function out of the Ukkadam bus stand from Saturday. Nearly 120 shops from TK market would move to Gandhipuram bus stand, and 50 shops from Anna market to the bus stand on Mettupalayam road.

An official at the shandy said that the number of farmers had dropped from 71 on Wednesday to 62 on Thursday and 51 on Friday. While many transport in two-wheelers, many women farmers prefer to stay at home over fear of the spread of virus.

Podanur Railway Hospital was sealed on Friday following the admission of a 29-year-old doctor with COVID-19 symptoms at ESI Hospital.

An official from Salem Division of Southern Railway told The Hindu that the doctor was transferred from Erode Railway Hospital to Podanur Railway Hospital earlier in March, as part of a routine transfer. After being relieved on March 20 from Erode, she arrived in Podanur on March 23, where she felt feverish. “She did not treat anyone at Podanur Railway Hospital,” the official said, adding that she went on leave immediately after feeling unwell. As a precautionary measure, both the railway hospitals in Erode and Podanur were sealed on Friday, the official noted.

Official sources at the Coimbatore District Adminstration said that the doctor was admitted in the isolation ward at ESI Hospital on the night of March 25 after she showed COVID-19 symptoms. Five of her contacts have also been quarantined at ESI Hospital. The results of their swab samples are awaited, sources said.

The doctor reportedly treated the Thailand nationals in Erode who tested positive for COVID-19.

281,2020/03/27,Many splendoured One,"The deity Murugan has many names, each of them for a reason, said R. Narayanan in a discourse. One of them is Baahuleyan, a name that is His because He has strong shoulders. He is the One who destroyed Soorapadman, who could not be destroyed by anyone else. He is known as Deva Senapati, for He is the commander of the army of the celestials. He is Shanmukha, because He has six faces. He is Velayudhan, because His weapon of choice is the spear (vel).

When Murugan had to wage war against Soorapadman, Goddess Parvati gave Him a vel in a place known as Sikkal. Using this vel, Murugan killed Soorapadman, who had been tormenting the devas. In Sikkal, He is known as Singaravelan — the beautiful One with a spear. Skanda Sashti is one of the most important festivals in Sikkal. During this festival, Singaravelan receives the spear from His mother. This handing over of the spear takes place the day before Soorasamhara (killing of Soorapadman) is observed.

The story of Soorapadman says that when he was killed by Murugan, he reappeared as a mango tree. Murugan split this tree into two. One part became a rooster, and this rooster became Murugan’s flag. Hence Murugan is also called kukkutadhvaja — the One who has a rooster (kukkuta) as His flag (dhvaja). The other half of the mango tree became a peacock, and this became Murugan’s vahana. Hence, He is called Sikhivahana (sikhi - peacock). He is Gangeya, because He was of river Ganga. He is Saravana, because He was in a thicket of reeds (Sara). He is Kartikeya, because He was looked after by the Kartika maidens. His star is also Krittika. He is Kumara, the eternally youthful One. He is Skanda, the war God. He is Guha, because He resides in the hearts of His devotees. This is the cave (guha) where He dwells joyfully.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/many-splendoured-one/article31186794.ece

He was joined by top leaders of several megacities from around the world, such as Mayors of Los Angeles (Eric Garcetti), Seoul (Won-soon Park), Paris (Anne Hidalgo), Milan (Guiseppa Sala), Istanbul (Ekrem Imamoglu) and Rome (Virginia Raggi), Johannesburg (Geoff Makhubo), London (Sadiq Khan) and Madrid (José Luis Martínez-Almeida).

Mr. Kejriwal said that Delhi was aggressively identifying contacts and isolating them. As a result, Delhi has less than 40 COVID-19 positive cases to date, after 25 days of detecting the first case.

“We wish to limit any further local transmission and would like to avoid entering stage three of community transmission. Therefore, we have implemented a complete lockdown from March 23. The economic fallout of the lockdown has disproportionately impacted the city’s poor, especially migrant workers who live in Delhi,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

“Our approach has been that we cannot afford to lose a single life to COVID-19 or starvation. This is a crisis of unprecedented scale and we are committed to learn and collaborate with leaders across the world. Together, we will win,” he told the leaders.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kejriwal-addresses-c40-meeting-discusses-strategies-to-combat-covid-19-outbreak/article31187407.ece
283,2020/03/27,HC tells AIIMS to start free treatment of girl suffering from rare disease,"HC Bench issues notice to Centre to appraise it on the current policy of government on rare diseases

The Delhi High Court has asked the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to start free treatment of an 18-month-old girl suffering from a rare disease ‘Gaucer’, on the plea of her father that he is unable to afford it. Justice Prathiba M. Singh also issued notice to the Central government to appraise the court on the current policy of the government on rare diseases. The High Court has posted the case for further hearing on April 17.

The Centre had come out with a National Policy for Treatment of Rare Diseases in 2018, but due to objections by certain State governments, the same was scrapped and a draft policy document for rare diseases was released on January 13, 2020.

The High Court noted that the same has not yet come into effect. “Owing to this, there appears to be no policy in place at this point for dealing with persons with rare diseases and how treatment is to be provided to them,” it added

The counsel, appearing for the father, submitted that the monthly cost of treatment is approx. ₹3.5 lakh. Since the expense for this treatment is quite steep, the father is unable to afford it.

“Considering the age of the child and given that the policy for rare diseases is yet to be finalised by the government, it is deemed appropriate to direct respondent no.3 – AIIMS – to start the treatment of the petitioner’s daughter without charging anything from him,” the High Court order said.

It also clarified that further directions in respect of the expenses towards the treatment would be passed after the Centre enters appearance in the matter.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hc-tells-aiims-to-start-free-treatment-of-girl-suffering-from-rare-disease/article31187291.ece

Delhi Police, with the help of volunteers, is reaching out to senior citizens living alone in the city, said a police officer on Friday.

The police said that they are getting numerous calls from senior citizens who had registered themselves with the Senior Citizen Cell of Delhi Police. More than 10,000 people have registered with the cell so far.

As per the rule, a beat constable of the police station concerned has to visit the homes of registered senior citizens once a week and also keep in touch with them over phone.. However, it is the duty of neighbours and Residents’ Welfare Associations to contribute to the safety and security of the elderly, said a police officer.

“In the last four days, we have received over 4,000 calls on the helpline number, where people have made request for groceries and medicines,” said a police officer.

Formed WhatsApp group

Due to the high volume of calls, the police have roped in local Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) and neighbours and have formed a WhatsApp group to help them with all daily needs.

“We had a meeting with several RWAs and asked them to exempt ban on house helps for senior citizens. The RWAs had agreed to the request,” the officer added.

A beat constable said that children or relatives of senior citizens are calling him from foreign countries and requesting him to take care of their aged parents. “We are assisting them as much us we can. People visiting senior citizens’ house need to be more careful as they are more prone to fall sick if they get in contact with any COVID-19 infected persons. I provided masks to around 20 senior citizens registered,” said the policeman.

Another policeman said that they are providing passes to senior citizens who need to visit hospitals frequently. “We have issued more than 3,000 passes to such people,” he added..

Senior citizens who are not registered with Delhi Police can also approach them for help.

The Delhi government on Friday appealed to migrant workers scrambling to leave the city in the wake of COVID-19 restrictions to return as arrangements related to their sustenance, especially food, were being made.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal asked the workers, from U.P., Bihar, Jharkhand, and Bengal to return from the Delhi border even as he announced that a panel of senior doctors tasked with creating an SOP in this regard had put plans in place to handle a daily surge of 100 to 1,000 new COVID-19 patients.

He added that a pension of ₹5,000 each had been transferred to the bank accounts of eight lakh beneficiaries and ₹5,000 would further be transferred in the first week of April.

We have discussed various issues, we first saw whether the systems to ensure the supply of essential services to the people are working at the ground level or not, and how to solve the problems and obstacles, if any,” Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal said at a joint digital press conference which he addressed with Mr. Kejriwal.

“We have also discussed going forward on dealing with the surge in the virus and protecting the people... on whatever is needed to improve and upgrade the healthcare services,” Mr. Baijal said.

Things were, Mr. Kejriwal said, “functioning smoothly” as of now. There were currently 40 COVID-19 positive cases in Delhi of which 29 had a travel history and 10 were via local transmission.

The situation was under control since there was no community transmission, but, he said the government had to be prepared and learn from other nations for the possibility of the epidemic reaching Stage 3.

“We have to think about whether we are ready to handle the outbreak in Delhi...I had formed a team of five doctors under Dr. Sareen, the head of ILBS hospital. The team submitted its report yesterday [Thursday] including a comprehensive plan of action on the preparations done in the wake of the surge in COVID-19 cases in Delhi,” he said.

“We have everything prepared if we get 100, 500 or 1,000 new cases every day...

In a tweet, Congress leader Ahmed Patel expressed over migrant workers walking on empty highways and demanded that the Centre issue a directive to enable one-time train/bus service so these people can reach home. “If we can evacuate Indians stranded in foreign soil, why not assist those stranded on domestic soil?” he said.

Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill also tweeted about the difference in the way the Centre treated NRIs and migrant labourers. “If @airindiain planes can be deployed, rightly, to evacuate Indians stranded abroad, why can't the govt. deploy special buses to rescue daily-wagers who are travelling on foot to reach their home?” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/assist-those-in-transit-demands-sonia/article31187192.ece

290,2020/03/27,Over 270 mohalla clinics shut in city,"Staff unable to reach facilities; will be issued special passes

Despite Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s assurances, over 270 of about 480 Aam Aadmi Mohalla Clinics (AAMCs) in the city were shut on Friday, mainly because employees were unable to reach the government-run facilities where treatment is provided for free, according to officials.

“There is a rumour that every mohalla clinic will be closed. This is wrong as we will ensure every clinic is fully functional during this tough time,” the Chief Minister had said on Thursday.

Lakhs of people, mainly from lower-middle income groups, rely on the clinics for medical care.

The government had earlier this week directed heads of hospitals and institutions under the health department to hire private vehicles for officials to reach their workplace as many were “unable to do so due to the lockdown”. But this facility is not available to staff of AAMCs as they are “empanelled” and not permanent staff, according to officials.

“They are essential services, so they should get passes and come for work,” a senior government official said.

“We have started issuing special ID cards to the staff so that they can reach the clinics,” a health department official told The Hindu.

“The staff gets paid according to the number of patients that visit the clinic and are not government employees. They do not have any government ID cards. Because of this, police are not allowing many of them to commute to the clinics,” the official added.

“About 230 of the 480 clinics were open on Wednesday, but it fell to 200 on Thursday.

292,2020/03/27,"Shiv Vihar hit twice, first by riots and then by COVID-19 curbs","Renovation work at damaged houses stuck due to unavailability of labourers

It has been over a month since Mohammed Qutubuddin went to work. He sews for a living and said that he has been dependent on his neighbours and relatives for basic groceries. First, it was communal riots and now it is COVID-19 outbreak which hit the residents of Shiv Vihar, both monetarily and mentally.

“Aakhri baar kaam par 23 tareek ko gaya tha. Uske baad se kuch nahi kiya. Kamaane ka koi aur zariya bhi nahi hai (The last time I went to work was February 23. Haven’t been able to work after that. There’s no other way of earning also),” said Qutubuddin, who has a family of five to feed and ₹ 2,200 rent to pay.

In the narrow lanes of Shiv Vihar, many houses were found locked. Those still residing said that most of the locked houses were on rent and were either vandalised, looted or burnt. Those living there didn’t return and went on rent at other places.

“One thing that is good now is that there are less people which reduces the chances of Coronavirus,” said Nazar Mohammed, a government school teacher whose house was burnt during the riots.

On Thursday, people were found holed up in their houses or at most, sitting on their doorsteps and that’s how they spend their days.

“Television sets in most houses were looted and hardly one or two houses have been able to buy again. Taking precautions, people mostly stay indoors or come just till the doorstep or sometimes the street. We also maintain distance while talking,” said Ikram Hasan (56) wearing a mask.

Work hit

A few streets ahead resides Mr. Mohammed in a double storey house. His immediate concern is to fix his electricity board and paint the remaining house.

“When BSES workers came, the electricity was temporarily fixed. Only a bulb is working as of now. I had started renovating the house about 10 days ago and brought some material that was required. Painting of half the house is left. Flooring is also left. Because of the curbs, labourers are not coming. I am living here while my wife and kids are living in a rented accommodation on the next street,” he said, adding that so far, he has received ₹50,000 as relief compensation while the rest is yet to arrive.

Mr. Mohammed said that earlier, people with burnt houses in the area didn’t renovate the houses believing that they won’t get compensation if they do so. Now, when these rumours have dispelled, they can’t because of unavailability of resources, he added.

Talking about relief compensation and material, the residents said that they are in dire straits.

“There are two grocery stores nearby for basic necessities. Sometimes, goods are available at the shops. Vegetable prices have gone up to unimaginable levels. The last time we received ration as relief material was on March 20 before the curbs. We can’t hoard supplies because we can’t afford that. We don’t know how to deal with this situation,” said wife of an autorickshaw driver Aslam (45), who did not wish to be named. Aslam has been out of work since riots.

Suman (40) and her husband Satyapal (47) also shared their bit of problems. Their house was also looted during the riots and in the absence of TV, they sat at their doorstep and while away time. Bigger problem for the couple and their family is that their water connection hadn’t been restored because of which they had to move on rent in Johripur.

“We had a combined connection with five other houses. One of those houses was burnt and their connection hasn’t been restored because of which ours also wasn’t. Now it cannot happen because of the curbs. Therefore, we spend the day here and go back late evening,” said Suman.

Fear of attack

CRPF men were seen guarding the streets and when asked about it, Mr. Mohammed said, “Hindus and Muslims are scared of each other and talk only when required”. Explaining further, he said “Hindus think that we’ll harm them because we have been attacked in the riots and Muslims think that Hindus can attack us again”. However, Afsar Khan (56) is of a different opinion and said that he is sure his Hindu neighbour will help him if and when required.

At the far end of the street sat Munni Devi (70) observing Navratri fast. Her double storey house was burnt during the riots too. Her husband Naresh Chand who used to run a vegetable shop has been out of work since riots and the son and daughter-in-law haven’t returned home because “they don’t feel safe”. Living in a house with no gate because they haven’t been able to get it fixed owing to the curbs, Devi said, “I am fasting and praying to God that this ends and everyone stays safe and everything becomes normal again”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/20wiok/article31187123.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL28-CORONAANDRIOT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/shiv-vihar-hit-twice-first-by-riots-and-then-by-covid-19-curbs/article31187125.ece

With a family of four to support, Ajit (28), staying at Harijan Colony in Sector 43 here, is worried over the sudden spurt in prices of groceries, milk and vegetables in the wake of a nationwide shutdown of non-essential services to contain the spread of COVID-19, and his fast-exhausting savings.

Hundreds of families, mostly domestic workers, housekeeping staff and security guards, in the colony echoed the same concerns.

“Five kg wheat flour that cost ₹180 earlier is priced at ₹250 now. The price of mustard oil used for cooking has gone up from ₹100 to ₹150. Even a milk packet, that cost ₹10 earlier, now costs ₹15. The prices of vegetables, such as potatoes, have also increased substantially. At this rate, our monthly bill would be double,” said Ajit, who worked at a salon in DLF Phase-IV before it was shut due to the shutdown.

Aakash, 21, who worked with food delivery app Zomato, said he even called up the helpline number to inform about the rise in prices and though they assured him to pass on the information to the authority concerned, they “did nothing much”.

Shahbuddin, who worked as an office boy, was worried about the payment of the rent for his single-room accommodation, ₹3,500.

“I am not sure whether the company will pay me the entire salary or only for the number of days I worked before the shutdown was announced. I have two children and my wife. I cannot survive for more than a week with my current savings. Only if I could go back to my home in West Bengal, I could manage. But that too is not possible now,” said Shahbuddin dejectedly.

Gautam Hazra, who worked as a housekeeping staff, has similar concerns. He said his landlord was unlikely to waive-off the rent or accept a delayed payment.

Arun, another resident, said most of the families had savings to survive for 7-10 days.

Sukhdev, a vegetable vendor, said the wholesale prices of vegetables had gone up in the mandi. “The 50 kg packing of potatoes now costs ₹1,400, an increase of around ₹600. Similarly, the prices of green chillies and other vegetables have also jumped,” said Sukhdev.

Many shopkeepers complained that the police did not allow them to open shops all day long.

Even after the Capital reporting 40 COVID-19 cases and one death so far, children to adults, who work as ragpickers were not wearing proper gloves, boots, masks, or using sanitisers, a spot check by The Hindu in central, south, and east Delhi has revealed.

Also, many garbage collectors and sanitation workers working for different civic bodies here said there were not enough masks and gloves and they were not given hand sanitisers. Experts said this is “dangerous” for the workers and could lead to infections. They said the government should provide them gears.

At Mayur Vihar extension in east Delhi, 12-year-old Vikas was digging into a waste dump, with bare hands. He did not have a mask or footwear on. “My father also works as a ragpicker and I earn about ₹50-100 a day,” the 12-year-old, who hails from Bihar, said. “I had bought a mask, but it’s torn now,” he added.

The boy said he knew about the disease, but shook his head when asked if he knew how it spread. He said there was no aid from the government.

“When there is an outbreak of such a highly contagious disease, ragpickers should be given PPE [personal protective equipment], but they have not been not provided any equipment,” said Delhi-based waste management expert, Swati Singh Sambyal. “These people live in densely populated areas and if even one of them gets infected from some waste from a quarantined house, image the blast of infections that will follow,” she said.

She said that even safai karmacharis working for government agencies, mainly under contractors, have not been provided enough equipment.

“The government is doing nothing for the ragpickers. They are not even spreading awareness,” said Chitra Mukherjee of Chintan, an NGO which works for ragpickers.

Multiple other workers who work for the SDMC and the East Delhi Municipal Corporation, under contractors, said they were not given enough protective equipment or sanitisers. In New Delhi Municipal Council limits, people working for the government were, however, largely found using masks and rubber gloves.

Phool Chand (35), was sporting a single-use mask at BK Dutt Colony in central Delhi. “You have to change gloves every two to four days. How can I afford it? The government should provide us gloves,” he said.

The ragpickers The Hindu spoke to had little idea about COVID-19, but said they need to keep on working to make ends meet.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/79dy69/article31187087.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE28GARBAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ragpickers-lack-protective-gear-awareness/article31187088.ece

296,2020/03/27,Workers in Masoodpur survive without food,"They hail from neighbouring States

Hundreds of people, who have been providing various services to south Delhi’s gated colonies, have been living without food and water as non-essential services have been restricted in the national capital to contain the COVID-19 epidemic. The affected community comprises workers from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jharkhand.

“We are a group of around 200 men aged 40 to 45 and we worked as daily-wage workers, plumbers and carpenters in Vasant Kunj, Masudpur and other nearby areas. But for the last several days we have not earned any money and are surviving without food at present,” said Shailender Ram who belongs to Bhagalpur in Bihar.

Mr. Ram said that the men from Bhagalpur form one group in the locality and are eager to return home as their previous employers have stopped calling them for work, adding: “We want to go home and expect the governments of Bihar and Delhi to help us with food and transportation.”

Earlier, Rashtriya Janata Dal, in a social media message, had urged AAP leader Atishi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to help the stranded group of workers.

The men are, however, only a part of a large working-class population, which had a steady demand in nearby middle-class neighbourhoods.

“The group from Bhagalpur has families back home and does not have any women among them. But the groups from M.P., Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have several women and children who are also suffering as we have not been able to work,” said Prakash Shah who used to work as a plumber in Vasant Kunj and hails from Bihar.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/workers-in-masoodpur-survive-without-food/article31187001.ece
297,2020/03/27,Migrant workers continue march home,"Imminent danger to their livelihood overshadows COVID-19 scare; authorities arrange buses, food

As soon as it stopped raining, Ramautar started his march to his village in Sambhal with his wife and 12-year-old son from the Link Road in Ghaziabad. A daily labourer in Delhi’s Burari, they started at 4 in the morning.

“Before I lose my meagre savings and my father, who is ill, I should reach my village,” said Ramautar. He is not alone, even two days after the lockdown, hundreds of migrant workers could be seen walking through Ghaziabad to reach home.

On the U.P. government promising help for people like him, Ramautar said: “Sarkarki madad aane main time lagta hai (government help takes time to reach).”

On a day when two more COVID-19 positive cases were found in Ghaziabad, there were many like him on the road for whom the imminent danger to their livelihood overshadowed the virus scare. They had no clue of helpline numbers being published in local newspapers. They only see the police, with whom they maintain a distance.

A few hundred metres ahead Hashim, a fruit juice seller in Loni, and his three colleagues were keen to reach Kaushambi Bus depot to take a bus to Lucknow.

“We have been told one U.P. Roadways bus will go today [Friday] but when one of my friends reached there, he was turned back by the police.”

When The Hindu asked the policemen posted at the bus depot, they did not give a clear answer on the bus schedule. “It could be answered by the assistant regional manager (ARM),” said Station House Officer, Link Road. However, the labourers alleged that they were not allowed to enter the bus depot.

R.K. Tripathi, ARM, Kaushambi bus depot said: “Even I don’t know the schedule. It comes straight from the district administration. On Thursday night, we sent some buses from Kaushambi and Lal Kuan.”

With no Civil Defence around, many labourers were scared to approach the police. “There is no point, we have been told that a vegetable truck would go from Mohan Nagar in an hour. It will take us closer to Budaun. Then we will see,” said Girish Chandra, who works as a mason in Delhi’s Tughlaqabad, dressed in a safari suit. Asked about his sartorial sense in the face of a calamity, he said: “When we go to our native village, we have to go well-dressed. They don’t know what we do in Delhi.”

There were some like Mukesh who was anxious to reach home to contribute to the impending wheat harvest. “I work in a factory in Shahdara. With no work here, I better earn some money by working in the fields in my village near Dibai in Bulandshahr district.”

Then there were some who were simply homesick. “I know [Delhi Chief Minister] Arvind Kejriwal is offering food to people like us, but we want to go home,” said Asif, who makes bags in a factory in Paharganj. “When there is a problem, people want to be home with the family. Why is it so difficult to understand?” he wondered.

Later, Shailendra Kumar Singh, Additional District Magistrate (City), said most of the labourers were from other States.

“The idea of a lockdown is to ensure that people do not move. But now that they have come out because of various reasons, we are making sure that they reach their destinations,” he said, adding: “On Thursday evening, 50 UP Roadways buses plied from Lal Kuan and Kaushambi.”

“Today [Friday], we have decided to put 250 on the road. We have asked the conductors to screen the passengers for symptoms of COVID-19, particularly temperature. Those who are found symptomatic will not be allowed to board. The addresses of the rest would be passed on to the district administration of the destination,” said the senior official, adding that the policemen were being directed to pass on the information to workers.

299,2020/03/27,Coronavirus | Muslim clerics urge people to offer prayers from home,"Three gates of Jama Masjid were closed four-five days ago and restrictions were put in place to prevent mass gatherings, Shahi Imam Syed Ahmed Bukhari said.

The Muslim clerics have appealed to people to pray at home and practice social distancing in view of the coronavirus pandemic.

Shahi Imams of the two biggest mosques in Delhi — Jama Masjid and Fatehpuri Masjid — said the people are gradually coming to grips with the alarming situation.

Three gates of Jama Masjid were closed four-five days ago and restrictions were put in place to prevent mass gatherings, Shahi Imam Syed Ahmed Bukhari said.

“I have appealed to people to stay at home and offer namaz there instead of going to mosques. There is no other way. People who are making inquiries over phone are also being advised to offer prayers at home,” he said.

Bukhari said only a handful of people were now offering daily prayers at the mosque as people were gradually realising the gravity of the situation.

He said although Ramzan is not far, decisions will be taken keeping in mind the restrictions imposed in the national capital.

The All India Muslim Law Board has also advised people to offer ‘Zuhr’ (afternoon prayers) at home instead of going to the mosques.

“Due to #NovelCoronavirus pandemic, Muslims are recommended to offer Zuhr at home instead of praying Jumah at mosques. DON’T come out for congregational prayers and #StayAtHomeSaveLives. It is mandatory upon all to avoid causing harm to their fellow citizens. #NoJumahInMasjid,” the board tweeted.

Mufti Mukarram Ahmed, the Shahi Imam of Fatehpuri Masjid at Chandni Chowk, said video messages were being prepared to create awareness about the prevention of the deadly disease.

“We have appealed to the people to offer namaz at their homes and follow the advisories of the governments and doctors because the sooner coronavirus is checked, the earlier restrictions will be lifted,” he said.

Only the staff of the Fatehpuri Masjid is currently offering prayers at the mosque and outsiders are being asked to pray at home.

“This has been prescribed in our religion, so people can offer prayers at home. There is no other option,” he said.

Ahmed said a special prayer for early recovery from the deadly disease was conducted at Fatehpuri mosque on Friday.

The duration of ‘Juma Namaz’ has also been reduced to 12-15 minutes now, he said.

An official of the Delhi Waqf Board, which supervises the functioning of around 200 mosques in the city, said the imams and mutwallis have been told to prevent mass gatherings.

He said a proper advisory was supposed be issued by the board, but it could not be done as its chairman Amanatullah Khan was removed from the post earlier this week.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/8qvjba/article31183017.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSMOSQUES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/coronavirus-muslim-clerics-urge-people-to-offer-prayers-from-home/article31183018.ece

The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the Centre to explain steps taken by it to evacuate around 580 Indian medical students who are stranded in Bangladesh due to the coronavirus pandemic.

A Bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Talwant Singh, in a hearing conducted through video conferencing, issued notices to the ministries of external affairs and home affairs, and sought their responses to a plea seeking safe return of Indians stuck in Bangladesh.

The court listed the matter for further hearing on March 30.

The ministries were represented through the central government’s standing counsel Jasmeet Singh.

Petitioner advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal sought direction to the authorities to forthwith take steps for safe and secure return of Indian citizens who are stuck in Bangladesh.

He said most of the students are residents of Jammu and Kashmir.

The plea has also sought direction to the authorities to appoint nodal officers in the Indian embassies and make contact number and email of these nodal officers public so that the Indians who are stranded abroad can contact them and seek help in the time of the global health emergency.

The plea further said that the MEA be directed to formulate guidelines for a time-bound action by the nodal officers so that Indians can feel safe during this time.

The lawyer said he has been receiving numerous calls from the Indian students who are studying in Bangladesh and stuck in their hostels and do not have masks and sanitisers.

The students told the lawyers that their mess is closed and they are left with a few snacks which may last only for a week and there are no facilities by which they can prevent them from getting infected.

“As there is complete lockdown now so we would not even get any supplies. You have also closed doors for us. Please help us to reach back home.

301,2020/03/27,Central Vista project should be put on hold indefinitely: Jairam Ramesh,"“It is not just insensitive, but obscene to be thinking of the New Central Vista project now,"" the senior Congress leader tweeted

Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Friday called for indefinitely putting on hold the government’s ambitious Central Vista project, saying the thousands of crores of rupees that will be spent on it could be used for more pressing issues.

He said it is “obscene” that the government is going ahead with the project even now, referring to the country’s efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus.

Ramesh’s comments come in the backdrop of the Centre approving the land use change for execution of the Central Vista redevelopment project in Lutyens’ Delhi last week.

“It is not just insensitive, but obscene to be thinking of the New Central Vista project now. It should be put on hold indefinitely. There are more pressing uses for the thousands of crores that will be spent to satisfy one man’s ego,” the Congress leader said in a tweet.

He also shared a news report claiming that the project is likely to be delayed by a few weeks due to a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19.

The Delhi government was preparing to feed ten times the number of people who have lost their livelihoods due to the ongoing lockdown to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced here on Friday.

This, he said, even as a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) had been formed to deal with an increasing number of daily patients infected with the coronavirus if the need arose.

“At the moment, the Delhi government is feeding 20,000 people at 224 night shelters. We have increased the number of such facilities; food will now also be provided at 325 schools which are currently shut,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

“We will be able to provide food to 2 lakh people from today and plan to double this to 4 lakh by tomorrow... Let me assure the leaders and chief ministers of other states, do not worry about your citizens; they are Delhi’s citizens, they are our people too,” he also said.

A team of doctors tasked with creating a plan to tackle an increase in coronavirus cases has submitted its report, he said. This plan had been divided in three stages depending on the number of daily cases.

The plan details preparations in terms of ICU, testing facilities and other necessary services for 100, 500 and 1,000 daily cases, respectively.

“We are currently at stage one of this but we also have to be prepared for the future. Our SOP is ready in this respect,” he said.

304,2020/03/27,Work-from-home is the new normal for IT companies,"Only a handful of staff allowed at office for mission-critical functions

The Information Technology and IT enabled Services (ITeS) companies have apparently accustomed themselves to the work-from-home system, in view of COVID-19 outbreak.

The industry has ensured that most of their employees are allowed to work from home even as a small group continues to function from office.

The development follows an advisory issued by the IT and ITeS apex body, Nasscom, urging its members to prepare for a complete lockdown and shift computers and else to the houses of staffers to enable them to work from home.

Only a handful of staff would be allowed to come to office to support the mission-critical functions and operate data centres, Nasscom said in its advisory.

It is, however, not easy for call centres and IT firms that function as the back office of several leading international establishments, struggling to put in place work-from-home systems and other business continuity plans.

Former president of the Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association (HYSEA) V. Rajanna told The Hindu that it took a few days to enable the system, as there was a need to make technical changes on devices and take customer approvals.

However, the IT industry was very proactive in initiating measures much before by not conducting any internal events and group gatherings, closing cafeterias, doing thermal screening of all employees on entry and following quarantine measures, to check the spread of the virus.

The government, on its part, had extended full support with effective coordination between the police and industry.

IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao met industry representatives last week and asked them to follow preventive measures, Mr. Rajanna, who is also the former chairman of CII-Telangana, said.

306,2020/03/27,UoH takes baby steps against COVID-19,"Designs potential vaccine candidates, T cell epitopes, against all proteins of coronavirus

University of Hyderabad (UoH)’s School of Life Sciences has announced the design of potential vaccine candidates called “T cell epitopes”, against all the structural and non-structural proteins of novel coronavirus-2 (COVID-19) for experimental testing.

These vaccine candidates are small coronaviral peptides — molecules, which are used by cells to trigger an immune response to destroy cells harbouring these viral peptides.

Using powerful immunoinformatics approaches with computational softwares, Seema Mishra of the department of biochemistry has designed these potential epitopes in a way that can be used to vaccinate an entire population.

Usually, a vaccine discovery takes 15 years but the powerful computational tools helped in quickly enlisting these vaccine candidates in about 10 days. A ranked list of potential candidate vaccines, based on how much effectively they will be used by human cells to stop the virus, has been generated.

With no matches present in human protein pool, these coronaviral epitopes pose no cross-reactivity to human cells and hence, the immune response will be against viral proteins and not human proteins. However, these results have to be investigated experimentally in order to provide conclusive evidence. These results have been disseminated to the scientific community using ChemRxiv preprint platform for urgent experimental assays, said an official press release.

These are the first such studies on nCoV vaccine design from India exploring whole coronaviral proteome across structural and non-structural proteins that make up the virus. Right now, best defense to prevent further nCoV infections is social distancing. Vaccination will take some time due to the need for further work on these candidate epitopes.

“We are hopeful that our computational findings will provide a cost- and time-effective framework for rapid experimental trials towards an effective nCoV vaccine,” she said.

307,2020/03/27,Indian students of US in the soup over getting temporary jobs,"They are worried they will not get jobs and that will jeopardise their visa status

Indian students, who are about to complete their Masters in the United States are facing a huge crisis fearing their future over the Optional Practical Training Programme (OPT) that allows international students to temporarily work in the United States once they graduate.

Students completing their course in May and June need to apply for OPT a few days before the completion of the course and once approved they would get 90 days to get into a job or else would lose their visa status. Big concern among these students is whether they would be able to search for a job in the next four to five months in this crisis when jobs will be hard to find as hiring will be little.

“With lakhs of jobs at stake due to the impending economic slowdown with the epidemic where will we find new jobs,” said a student from Michigan State University (MSU).

A consultant from Telugu states, who generally place such students, too is worried.

“When lay offs are expected how can we get them jobs. Even we will be suffering out of this,” he said.

A ray of hope, however for them is the educators in the USA urging the US government not to consider the unemployment period in the COVID-19 emergency period under the OPT limits.

The Association of International Educators wrote a letter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) asking the authorities to give this concession to the foreign students on US campuses.

It also requested the DHS and the Government too publish a notice pf “Special Student Relief” in the Federal Register as was done earlier to help the Nepali students affected by a massive earthquake in Nepal in 2015.

Similar concession was given to students from Libya and Syria affected by civil unrest in their countries in 2011.

Indian and Chinese students form the biggest ethnic groups on US campuses and Indian students, particularly aim at the IT jobs that are plenty in number and manage to get a job on OPT.

Educators in India look at a bigger picture than just the OPT and advise the students not to worry over it much as of now. The US government is likely to give several concessions to OPT students once it overcomes the epidemic and there will be several legal protections as well.

Narsi Gayam, an educator with keen interest in US education says the world will change drastically and the thinking dramatically in a few months when it successfully overcomes the present challenge thrown up by coronavirus.

“The geo, political, economical and technological thinking will go through a huge churn and no one can predict on what lines the world will function,” he says adding that OPT is a small issue in a new world. “So students need not break their heads over it now.”",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/3o0myp/article31186820.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-US-FILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/indian-students-of-us-in-the-soup-over-getting-temporary-jobs/article31186803.ece
308,2020/03/27,Mosques remain shut for Friday prayers,"Mecca Masjid wore a deserted look

A vast majority of mosques in the city remained closed for the public on Friday.

The move came in the wake of religious leaders, public representatives and the Telangana State Waqf Board directing mosque managing committees not to allow congregations as a measure to prevent the spreading of the novel coronavirus.

Hyderabad parliamentarian Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday morning released a video message in which he appealed to people not to congregate in masjids, but pray from home.

“It is my earnest appeal to you that you pray Zuhr (afternoon prayers) at home. Do not be reckless. If this virus spreads, then remember,” he said, and added that as compared to the developed countries, India does not have adequate medical infrastructure and asked people not to take chances. “It is in accordance with the sharia that we protect lives as it is a responsibility. If you go in public and congregate, this virus can spread,” he said.

Soon after muezzins gave the call to prayer from neighbourhood mosques, they announced on the public address systems that locals pray from home.

The historic Mecca Masjid, which sees thousands of congregants on Fridays, wore a deserted look with only staff praying.

Several mosques locked their gates, while others displayed a copy of the notice of the TSWB dissuading congregational prayers. The Spanish Mosque in Begumpet posted a notice which read, “Admission for Imam, Muezzin and committee. All others please pray at your home (do not come even for juma) until further orders. Please cooperate and do not disturb.”",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/w9l4q9/article31186587.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY28COVID-19CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/mosques-remain-shut-for-friday-prayers/article31186588.ece

310,2020/03/27,Epidemic was a seasonal terror in Hyderabad,"City has a long history of cholera deaths

In February 1993, doctors in a county in Los Angeles in the US treated a woman who had recently returned from India with diarrhoea and back pain. The doctors treated her with medicines and she recovered. But when they discovered the cause of the illness, they were surprised. It was new strain of organism that causes cholera. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention isolated and labelled the toxigenic organism as Vibrio Cholerae O139. The woman had just returned from Hyderabad, where she remembered having half-a-glass of unbottled water a day prior to the onset of symptoms.

Hyderabad and its surrounding areas have a long history of epidemics that seasonally killed thousands and sometimes lakhs of people. According to a study, between 1904 and 1948, the annual mortality rate due to cholera varied from a low of 0.1 per 10,000 in 1926 to a high of 146.9 in 1945 in the Hyderabad region. In the period of 44 years, the mortality rates were in three digits for three years and in double digits for 29 years.

The study linked the periodic spread of the disease in the areas of Nalgonda, Mahabubnagar, Raichur, Gulbarga, Khammam and Medak with the twin festivals of Maha Shivaratri in Srisailam and the Pandharpur Jatara.

Hyderabad has a long history of cholera killing people. One of the eminent statesman of Hyderabad Sir Salar Jung died of cholera 1883. Three years later, W.M. Haffkine tested an immunising agent in India with limited success. The killings continued into the next century and the Nizam’s government tried various measures including setting up a quarantine facility for patients showing symptoms of cholera.

As the deaths due to these diseases raged, the Nizam’s government used the new fangled tool of cinema cars to spread the message of hygiene. In some areas, gramophone records were played to convey the message among the rural masses. While over 100 shows were held in rural areas, there were 51 shows in Hyderabad to create awareness about hygiene and the link with diseases.

“The cinema car is expensive but is the most useful and the most popular form of propaganda,” notes a government document of 1935. A year when 68.6 persons out of 10,000 died due to cholera. One additional measure to fight the disease used by the government was to add potassium permanganate too in the wells of this landlocked state.

About this time, the City Improvement Board had a generous budget and a remit to transform the city into a sanitary liveable urban environment. “The first city improvement board was created in Glasgow in the UK to fight diseases and unsanitary conditions that was threatening the port’s viability. India, Hyderabad followed Calcutta and Bombay in creating city improvement mechanisms,” says Anant Maringanti of Hyderabad Urban Labs. “The goal was to improve the living conditions it also led to improved sanitary conditions,” says Mr. Maringanti.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/epidemic-was-a-seasonal-terror-in-hyderabad/article31185071.ece
311,2020/03/27,Lockdown and social distancing changes life for residents in gated communities,"Residents Associations devise ways to avoid chaos, maintain order, and keep things running

The lock down and social distancing situation has forced residents of large apartment complexes and gated communities adapt to a new routine and devise norms to ensure everyone sticks to the government guidelines to check the spread of COVID-19.

Big apartment and gated communities like Lanco Hills, L&T Serene County, My Home, Aparna Sarovar and Grande with over 1,000 families each with an average of four persons are like townships with considerable population.

Resident volunteers

With few grocery and fruit and vegetable stores in the community, crowding of residents at these places will defeat the very purpose of social distancing. To beat this, the Managing Committee (MC) of Lanco Hills Owners Welfare Association with resident volunteers’ help has devised a way to implement social distancing.

“We asked the residents to register their names with their phone numbers early in the morning and a list is prepared by volunteers. Once the provisions and vegetable shops open around 7 am or 8 am, volunteers call the registered members one by one over phone to buy their essential supplies,” said Pradeep, a MC member.

Managing themselves

On an average about 20 to 25 members buy the commodities in an hour. The shops are shut by 5.30 pm and those who miss their turn during the day will be upgraded in the next day’s list, he added. The volunteers, both men and women - professionals working from home or home makers - take turns to monitor the register.

With house keeping and maintenance staff unable to come to work, or only few making it, the MC has roped in volunteers to manage residential tower emergencies. They are given training to operate critical equipment connections like water, electricity, Diesel Generator and elevators during emergencies. Doctors in the community have been enlisted to attend to medical emergencies as many senior citizens live in the community.

Home quarantine stamps

The Residents Association also identified apartments with persons with international travel history or overseas guests to ensure they observed home quarantine. “GHMC officials who got intimation about people with recent overseas travel history from immigration authorities and from the Association started sticking home quarantine stamps at the entrance of such flats to alert neighbours,” said a resident.

According to Jagan, a resident of L&T Serene County, Gachibowli, they have closed swimming pools, gyms, and children’s parks. Security guards strictly prohibit gathering of persons in the open areas and a distance of three feet is ensured even when persons go for walk within the gated community.

Vegetable and grocery orders are taken online or on phone and a delivered at designated spot. Then individuals are called one by one to collect their orders.

All non-essential personnel - domestic help, drivers, even newspaper delivery boys are barred from entry. “We are reading newspapers online,” Mr. Jagan said.

Have stocks but none to pack

“Of the 24 sales persons, we are managing with just about four including the billing person. There is enough stock in my godown but no workers to pack for the retail sale,” rued Ravindra, the lone vegetable and grocery stores manager in a gated community.

Sudhakar, who resides in Aparna Grande, Nallagandla, says each apartment is given a time slot to buy their vegetables and grocery items with a ₹1,000 limit to prevent excessive buying and create shortage for others.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/life-changes-for-residents-of-gated-communities/article31180543.ece
312,2020/03/27,Hyderabad police draw flak for inter-State border mess,"Miscommunication led to talks between TS and AP CMs, says an officer

It appears as if the Telangana police are unable to streamline the implementation of the lockdown orders in the State, even as baton-wielding policemen went into overdrive since Monday night. This was evident right from Monday's violent incidents till Wednesday's issue of dealing with inmates of hostels and PGs.

The quirky decisions made by the police department ended up leaving thousands of people stranded, as was evident from the kilometre-long queues outside the police stations in the State capital on Wednesday. This unprecedented situation, without any planning or warning, left thousands of students and young employees working here without any way out, as State borders were sealed and vehicles seized.

Confusion and chaos reigned as borders across the State witnessed humongous traffic jams, and hundreds flocked police stations to get the much-needed one-time ‘special pass’ forms. Of course, there was no social distancing seen at borders or outside police stations, and videos soon emerged showing crowds wrestling with each other over the few copies of forms, that unsurprisingly were not enough for all.

“When the entire country is under lockdown, the very idea of giving special passes by Hyderabad and Cyberabad police itself is against the law,” a senior police officer said.

The whole purpose of people staying away from each other was hence defeated on the first few days of the lockdown itself. While police have taken cognizance of PG and hostel owners forcibly vacating their premises and leaving residents in the lurch, the solution does not seem to be anywhere close at hand, as students and young employees are stranded anyway.

According to a hostelier in SR Nagar, two policemen visited their hostel after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 21-day lockdown address to the nation on Tuesday. The police personnel convinced the inmates to vacate and go back to their native places.

“They assured us of giving special transit passes after which we won’t be facing any hassle on the road,” said the 21-year-old engineering graduate who was waiting outside SR Nagar police station with an application to get the ‘assured’ pass.

The huge gathering outside the police stations in Hyderabad and Cyberabad commisisonerates led to the dangerous congregation of people. This goof-up was directly attributed to lack of communications between DGP office and Hyderabad police, a police source said.

“This miscommunication led to the high-level discussion between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Chief Ministers,” the officer said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/qkyzit/article31180078.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY27POLICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hyderabad-police-draw-flak-for-inter-state-border-mess/article31180079.ece
313,2020/03/27,Government plan to supply protective gear to garbage collectors,"Thousands of industrial quality gloves are lying unsold in the wholesale markets of Hyderabad and Secunderabad owing to the lockdown, and the government may consider procuring and supplying them to garbage collectors, suggests Vasudha Nagaraj, High Court advocate and member of Women and Transgenders’ JAC.

On her part, she purchased and distributed 400 gloves at a slum in Mudfort area in Secunderabad, where 150 families of garbage collectors stay. Montfort Social Institute, Ramantapur, is in the process of procuring 700 more for distribution.

“We could only do what was in our capacity. The government should do it on a large scale,” Ms.Nagaraj says.

The JAC has written to the high-level committee on COVID-19, requesting them to ensure healthcare kit to each trash collector family, comprising five soaps, shampoo, detergent powder, hand gloves, hand kerchiefs and towels.

A bell or horn should be provided for the vehicles, as the whistles they are using presently are highly contagious. Appointment of a team of doctors and paramedics is also demanded to conduct health camps at each of the colonies housing garbage collectors. Awareness should be created among them about wearing protective gear.

These apart, advisory should be issued to people in home quarantine about safe disposal of waste, the JAC said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/sk6vil/article31178594.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-EMPTY-ROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/plan-to-supply-protective-gear-to-garbage-collectors/article31178595.ece
314,2020/03/27,How digital and oral archiving are adding a personal touch to history,"It’s yesterday once more: Digital and oral archiving are bringing families together and adding a personal touch to history

Last year, Devina Albert published a book of photographs, articles and correspondence from the family’s archives, titled Memories, as a centennial tribute to her father, James Jeyachandran Paul, a civil engineer who worked in public projects in Madras, Tiruchi, Karaikudi and Neyveli and later ran a successful architectural firm in Thanjavur.

With just 200 copies meant for private circulation, Memories has touched a chord with whoever has gone through it, says Tiruchi resident Devina. A multi-talented person who did his Masters in Architecture in the United States in the 1950s, JJ Paul influenced many people around him in a positive way. “So instead of one person writing about my father, I invited family members and friends (spread across the globe) to send in their reminiscences of him. Through the book, all of us, especially his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, gained a new perspective on him – his love for cars, his sense of humour and eloquent letters,” she says.

The urge to create a bond with her family members led Ayesha*, a homemaker in her seventies living in Tiruchi, to start a podcast during Ramzan last year. Filling in the free hours after iftar and prayers, she recorded her experiences as a child growing up in Madurai in the 1940s and ‘50s, on her daughter’s smartphone, and shared them with the clan through WhatsApp.

“These memories have always stayed with me, but once I put them out on podcast, I realised that my siblings (she was born into a family of 13 children) and their families were surprised that so much had remained unknown because of the generation gap,” says Ayesha, who is planning to revive the podcast during the holy month of fasting due to start in April this year.

The lockdown has given a new meaning to ‘self-isolation’, and people suddenly seem to have a lot of time on their hands once their everyday tasks are done. Archiving family documents, photographs and correspondence is one way of creatively engaging the tools that Internet-compatible gadgets have put at our disposal.

But as many budding archivists would agree, you don’t really need a lockdown to get started. Putting together narratives from family members, and showcasing them in a scrapbook or website can be a fun way for inter-generational bonding. Family trees tell children about their ancestors, while piquing their interest in finding out more about them. The stories shared by grandparents about their experiences start to assume greater importance when they are accompanied by letters and photographs.

People first

Crowd-funded online platforms are proving to be a vital digital repository of information about a people, rather than merely public figures. “We need archiving today, because it gives us an idea of what has gone on in history. It’s a great time-stopper,” says Anusha Yadav, founder of The Indian Memory Project (TIMP), a Mumbai-based online archive that chronicles the subcontinent down the ages through photographs from personal albums.

TIMP has more than 200 photographs contributed from people in Canada, USA, Ireland, Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and UK, under tags like Partition, Saris, Headgear, Marriages, Migration, and even ‘Moustache’.

The website has a wide range of photos from formal portraits in studios shot by professional photographers to candid pictures taken with handheld cameras. “Photography has always been about vanity,” says Anusha. “Cheaper cameras made the studio redundant by the 1990s, but photographs usually have a sub-text of one’s social status,

possessions or events that is interesting in itself. Perhaps only matrimonial photographs have managed to survive. Even here, while earlier bridal pictures would showcase things like jewellery, now they talk about body shape, fairness or attractiveness.”

The 10-year-old platform accepts submissions for free, though there are criteria on what will be published. Short captions of the earlier years have been slowly replaced by longer narratives. “I have started researching the background of the submissions, asking questions, and getting more involved in the stories. I like to call myself a detective of history, as I am learning along the way,” says Anusha.

Getting in touch

There have been lessons for self-taught archivists like Devina as well, who had brought out commemorative volumes on her mother Dulcie Paul in 2006 and father-in-law J Isaac Albert in 2012.

For the book on her father, she found the black-and-white photographs striking, even though many of them had to be digitally restored because of their age. “Only after scanning my parents’ wedding photograph did I realise how pretty my mother looked that day. She was a 15-year-old, while my father was 23. The nuptials were held in All Saints’ Church in Tiruchi, followed by a reception at the Guru Medical Hall (now Maduram Hall) in Puthur. We all remember seeing that pale blue silk sari in her cupboard, now I wish we could have preserved it better,” she says.

Ayesha was surprised to see young family members share photographs of the events after she described them in her podcasts. “My father was a great organiser of social functions, and in our large joint family, there was always something going on through the year. I thought none of the pictures of these galas had survived, but as it happened, they had all got distributed among different branches of the family down the years. Seeing the snaps brought it all back more clearly to me,” she says.

New perspectives

The documenting of personal lives adds a new dimension to historiography, by reflecting the social aspects and voices of the unheard. “Oral or folk history is an alternative to that given by state-oriented sources,” says N Rajendran, Vice-Chancellor, Alagappa University, Karaikudi, and a distinguished scholar in the subject.

However, Rajendran says oral history is not easy to document, because the researcher has to look hard for credible sources and interview them skillfully in order to elicit information. “If done right, you can find insights from oral history that may be missing from official documents,” he says.

The trend among youngsters to record the minutiae of their lives – from the food they eat to the places they visit – for the consumption of social media followers could be re-channelled into making classroom history lessons more interesting, says the academic.

“When you teach children only dates and names, they get bored, but these youngsters can be creative about these events and make term papers more lively. These days, all colleges and schools have got smart boards that can be used to project the short films on history made by students with narration. It would be a smart use of social media,” says Rajendran. (*Name changed on request)

316,2020/03/27,‘Jwalamukhi’ and me: How singer Poorvi Koutish landed AR Rahman’s ‘99 Songs’,"The Mumbai-based singer opens up on learning opera and working on film projects

Poorvi Koutish does not have a quarantine playlist. ""Silence..that's what I'm listening to,"" she says, almost philosophically, from Mumbai.

The singer might not have one, but many others are seeking comfort in their earphones, listening to her rendition of 'Jwalamukhi' and the other numbers in AR Rahman's 99 Songs. Poorvi has sung a couple of songs in the Hindi version, and will be featured in the Tamil and Telugu versions as well, and is currently basking in the praise that is coming her way.

""Even when the composition was played to me, I had goosebumps. With certain things in life, you get a feeling that you are in sync with them. 'Jwalamukhi' was love at first sight....I mean, listen,"" says the singer.

At that point of time, though, she was not even aware that she was going to be its lead vocalist. She was called to utter just one word - 'Jwalamukhi' - while the rest of the lyrics were being written. ""I thought that it was just another demo.""

But it wasn't. Sometime later, she recorded for it, but even then, Poorvi did not know if it would make it to the final selection. Much later, when she was interning at Rahman's studio, Poorvi was checking out something on the computer, when Rahman happened to walk by. ""He said, 'Hey, do you want to watch the movie? That's when I heard my voice.'""

Poorvi grew up in Chandigarh, where her mother Veenu Koutish taught Hindustani music. Her parents are huge fans of Indian music, and often ""dragged her along"" to ghazal concerts. ""I hated it,"" she recalls. When her mother realised that Poorvi wasn't too interested, she gifted her the music of Britney Spears and Stevie Wonder. ""I slowly started liking it, and developed an interest in international pop.""

That was Poorvi's gateway into a musical world, one that would expand thanks to the Internet. She was soon listening to numbers from across the globe, all of which honed her musical skills. ""I used to come back from school and plonk myself for seven hours at a stretch...just listening to music and singing.""

The hours have stretched, but she is doing pretty much that to this day. After a course in Western Classical music from KM Music Conservatory (""learning opera there was like learning from scratch"") and an internship in music production, Poorvi has her sights set on making heads turn in the music industry.

She has already sung for Anirudh in Ajith's Vivegam in the past. Coming up, she has two songs in another AR Rahman project (Dil Bechara), and has also recorded with composer Girishh G for Nayanthara's Netrikann, which has been produced by Vignesh Shivan and directed by Milind Rau. Poorvi believes that her all-round experience in 99 Songs will hold her in good stead. ""This project...it was not just about the music. It was a wholesome experience in which I got to work in several departments. It was a perfect case of being at the right place, at the right time for me,"" beams the singer, who is also a fan of Vishal Bharadwaj and Amit Trivedi.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/8dpdsl/article31184335.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30MPSaurabhMuley1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/how-singer-poorvi-koutish-landed-jwalamukhi-from-ar-rahmans-99-songs/article31184336.ece
317,2020/03/27,COVID-19: How Kerala musicians are playing it by ear,"As concerts and music events fall silent for now due to the coronavirus outbreak, singers and musicians in Kerala face uncertainty

Sobha Sivani from the city moved to Kochi two years ago “in search of better opportunities.” However, things have not really gone according to plan. “The same year came the floods. My husband, Sunil Kumar, is a sound engineer and his work equipment were damaged in the disaster. Now, this,” says the A-grade Doordarshan artiste, referring to the Coronavirus pandemic.

Sobha, who has sung in a couple of Mollywood films such as Kanne Madanguka and the Prithviraj Sukumaran-starrer Avan Chandiyude Makan, is among the singers and musicians in Kerala who face uncertainty due to across-the-board cancellation of programmes such as concerts, musical gatherings, wedding receptions and so on, to ‘break the chain’. With the lockdown putting artistes “out of work”, several of them hope that things will start looking up sooner. “My primary source of income are stage shows. The cancellations have come at a time when the temple festival season was on. I also had a recording with outdoor shoot slated to be telecast for Vishu on Doordarshan that has been called off,” says Sobha.

Perhaps, the hardest hit are musicians whose careers are solely dependant on stage shows during temple festivals as this season has in effect become null and void. “The season is from January till around May and usually winds up before the onset of the monsoon,” points out playback singer and composer Kallara Gopan. “I still do stage shows but not frequently as I have been focussing more on concerts organised as part of public events,” says Gopan, a resident of Vattiyoorkkavu who has sung in about 12 films. “However, there’s no point in worrying as what is required is complete cooperation from all sections of the society since health is more important,” he adds.

Some musicians who are also instructors rely on technology to continue lessons, however to mixed results. Like guitarist Jose Thomas who has been using WhatsApp video calls and Skype for his classes. “But it is not always conducive due to connectivity issues. Learning and imparting musical skills need a fine human-to-human interaction. Also the audio quality matters, which can be distorted while communicating through online platforms,” says Jose, who runs Talent School of Music in Thirumala, which is closed temporarily. He points out that a spectrum of people, including musicians, artistes, lights men, make-up men, impresarios and event managers, have been hit.

For musicians like Sebastian Simon, better known in music circles as Joy, the very idea of “music falling silent” is hard to digest. “I badly miss Sunday choir and the monthly programmes by private music clubs that are a lot of fun,” says Joy, a keyboard instructor at Christ Nagar School, Kowdiar. He now spends a lot of his time “practising.”

With television channels packing up shoot of serials, those working in the TV music industry are also at a loss. As production of subsequent episodes are stalled, some of the TV channels have resorted to re-telecasting past episodes or even older serials to fill the slot. Premila L, singer and lyricist for television serials, says her recording schedules have gone for a toss. “My episode-based work includes providing background vocals for situational songs and humming. These used keep me engaged but now there are no recordings,” she says. Only recently Premila had sung for the title track of a upcoming serial, the premiere of which has been indefinitely pushed back.

Sreenath Sivasankaran | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

For Sreenath Sivasankaran, Mollywood composer and singer from Palakkad who burst onto the music scene through reality shows, says he wants to see the current lull as “a break.” He last worked on the musical game show Start Music — Aaradhyam Paadum before starting his cinema projects. “There were a couple of TV programmes too lined up in between, but they are on pause,” he says, adding that he was expecting a “peak period” for his stage shows when schedules turned topsy-turvy.

Despite the bleak prospects, some prefer to keep their chin up and look on the bright side. Vocalist Saritha Rajeev is putting her “free time to constructive use” with “experimentations” to improve her talent. “My husband, Rajeev S A, a keyboardist, has a music studio and we listen to a lot of songs together. I record my own versions and play them back. This way, I can hone my skills,” says the Edapazhanji resident. She adds that a major source of the couple’s income comes from concerts for Malayalis in West Asia, which are now up in the air.

The music fraternity hopes that there will be some kind of relief from the government, at least for the economically most distressed, to tide over the rough patch. “The Trivandrum Music Fraternity, which has about 1,000 artistes as members and headed by Kavalam Sreekumar, is planning to submit a memorandum to the Chief Minister regarding this soon,” says M Radhakrishnan, vocalist and founder of the troupe Trivandrum Sound of Music.

Sharing a brief note about the song, the singer stated that it is based on his memories of innocent, adolescent love: “I travelled back in time to relive my school memories for this track. I used to have a big crush on a girl and was clueless about what to do about it. What inspired me to write this song was to create that feeling of love into an expression that would break the barriers of language.”

He then added, “I feel anyone who prefers listening to soothing music will like ‘Kya Karoon’? I feel everyone goes through something like this while in school or college, which makes these lyrics very relatable.”

Zaeden has represented India at some of the biggest music festivals like Tomorrowland and Marenostrum. He also performed with Justin Bieber during the India leg of his Purpose Tour in 2017.

Zaeden’s new song ‘Kya Karoon?’ is available on JioSaavn’s Artist Originals.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/la869v/article31180922.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Zaeden,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/zaeden-unveils-his-new-song-kya-karoon/article31180923.ece
319,2020/03/27,How growing up in various cultures impacted the music of Dubai-born Indian hip-hop artiste PAV4N,"A rapper from many homes

The video of PAV4N’s (aka Pavan Mukhi) first solo, ‘KARMA’, begins with a serene image. A foggy, wide shot of a boat setting sail on still water. Following the visuals of a woman and a South Indian temple, we get a glimpse of PAV4N. Just the lower half of his face. But it is intriguing. For, the face is… blue. A few seconds later, we see him clad in a silk dhoti and gold jewellery; again fully blue, resembling, according to him, the Hindu gods. But the appearance transcends religion.

“The colour blue is associated with all-inclusiveness, the vastness of the sky, ocean, power, time and space and is in my eyes symbolic of our oneness with the universe,” he explains.

This is the new identity of the front-man of the now disbanded UK-based hip-hop group Foreign Beggars.

Not really an outsider

It is understandable if you have deduced from the description so far that Pav4n’s one of the many Caucasians who is overly fascinated with the Indian culture and spirituality.

PAV4N, as it turns out, is an Indian. His identity, however, is complex, fluid. He considers Dubai home but himself an Indian. He is a third-culture kid, born in Dubai to a Lebanese father and an Indian mother. In fact, displacement is a running theme in his family. His father moved from Beirut to Wales to Dubai and mother from Chennai to San Francisco to Dubai. PAV4N himself moved from Dubai to London and to India.

Of the alphanumeric name he has given himself, he says, “It is just that there are a lot of Pavans in India. So, instead of the ‘A’, I thought it will be easier to Google my name if there is a number in it. Also, 4N sounds like foreign… and that is a throwback to my former band, Foreign Beggars. So, it all fits.”

This name and the blue appearance, he says, is now his new artistic identity. “It is going to be a permanent appearance. I have decided to go blue for everything because the colour is an interesting juxtaposition of mythology, my values and hip-hop music.”

“As PAV4N, the fact that I can explore my history and heritage through artistic expression — beyond just the music — has given so much more dimension to how I can express my message and opened so many new doors to collaboration, whether through visuals, fashion or art. Every single detail — from a photograph to a lyric to a location choice — has context and gives me pride to align and celebrate my ancestry.”

‘KARMA’, hence, is not just a celebration of India; it is an expression of PAV4N’s understanding of his motherland.

“I am not just talking about an individual’s karma here, but also the karma of a nation, of its politicians and capitalism, the oppression and exploitation of people who are less fortunate.”

A product of many cultures

Hip-hop music is usually associated with rebellion and anti-establishment. But PAV4N’s ‘KARMA’ is not brazenly provocative. Of this, he says, “I have been rapping for a while, putting out records for 18 years now. So, I am not like a young artiste, coming out and trying to be a bad boy. It is not about proving myself now or making money. At this point, it is important to me to communicate my message and perspective on things.”

Another reason for the absence of an in-your-face attitude is the places he grew up. “Growing up in a place like Dubai, it is very much about how you present yourself, not letting the family down and public conformity. Subversive or anti-establishment culture is definitely not accepted there. And, when I was in England, I didn’t have an English passport and had limitations on how I operate and what I can say.” So, he had to be more metaphorical whilst writing his songs.

Pavan’s reincarnation as PAV4N, he says, has also coincided with many young Indian artistes starting to own their identity. “Over the last 10 years I see young Indian artistes doing things in a way that is world class but completely Indian. They do not have the insecurity that people from the generation before me had. I remember there was a time when people used to fake English and American accents just to feel accepted. It was probably the result of a colonial hangover. That has gone now and it is beautiful to see young Indian artistes just coming out, breaking ground and being unapologetically Indian at the same time.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/kxrppa/article31180011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25bgm-PAV4N1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/dubai-born-indian-hip-hop-artiste-pav4n-talks-about-his-new-single-karma/article31180019.ece
320,2020/03/27,Armaan Malik featured on Times Square billboard for his English single,"The 'Butta Bomma' singer-songwriter’s debut English single is titled ‘Control’

Well known film playback singer Armaan Malik, 24, had released his first English single titled ‘Control’ on March 20. According to a statement, he has now become the first Indian singer-songwriter to be featured on the Times Square Billboard in New York City for his latest English debut, ‘Control’, promoted by Spotify.

‘Control’ also rose up to the #1 track on iTunes in India. The singer states that the track is an attempt to describe the push and pull feeling of being trapped in a controlling relationship and the confusion it can lead to. The song is inspired by relationships the singer-songwriter has seen around him. ‘Control’ was recorded in Los Angeles with music producer Wayne Wilkins, who has worked with Beyoncé and Natasha Bedingfield.

Overwhelmed by the response to his first single, Armaan says, “It’s a huge honour for an Indian artist to be on a Times Square billboard. I’ve always wanted to take India to the world with my music and this is like a dream come true. This wouldn’t have been possible without my amazing team, family, and my fans who encourage me with their endless love and support.”

In the last seven years, Armaan has sung more than 150 songs in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil and a number of Indian languages. Recently, Armaan decided to focus on independent music, alongside film music. For the single, he collaborated with Arista Records (Sony Music Global).",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/peafoo/article31179750.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Armaan-Malik,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/armaan-malik-on-times-square-billboard-for-his-english-single-control/article31179751.ece
321,2020/03/27,Man found dead at home,"A 44-year-old man was found hanging at his home near Ambalamedu on Friday around 7 p.m.

He was staying alone, and his brother who was checking on him found him dead. Since he was in the habit of drinking, the death triggered rumours that he took his life probably because of not having alcohol as Bevco outlets and bars remain closed in the wake of the national lockdown.

The Ambalmedu police, however, said there was no evidence to attribute the death to non-availability alcohol nor was any note found to that effect. There were unconfirmed reports that he had created a ruckus in front of a closed bar and Bevco outlet for drinks and even tried to secure ‘arishtam’ from a medical shop in his desperation.(Suicide prevention helpline: 0484-2540530)",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/man-found-dead-at-home/article31187575.ece
322,2020/03/27,Enforcement ramped up to check fleecing by traders,"Legal Metrology Department to act against dealers charging rates above MRP

The Legal Metrology Department (LMD) has stepped up enforcement measures to prevent fleecing by traders following shortage of commodities in the market due to restrictions in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.

This follows complaints that a section of traders who stopped issuing computerised receipts, are charging rates above the MRP. “Many items have run out of stock at several shops in the city, following which people queue up in front of shops selling them. It is a matter of concern that some traders have stopped issuing computerised receipts. There is every probability that unscrupulous traders will overcharge gullible customers,” said Suresh Kumar Prabhakaran, a retired government employee.

LMD Joint Controller R. Ram Mohan exhorted the public to inform the department if traders were found charging rates in excess of prices specified for various goods. “The price of mask, sanitisers, and bottled drinking water are regulated since they have been brought under the ambit of essential goods.

The department can act in case packaged goods are sold sans the mandatory declarations as it is a violation of consumer rights. These rules are binding on street vendors too.

Our teams are active on the ground, and a total of 160 inspections were conducted on Friday in Ernakulam and other districts,” he said. The phone numbers of officials are Ernakulam - 82816-98067; Idukki - ending 57; Thrissur 84, and Palakkad 92.

A city-based supplier of masks and sanitisers said the wholesale price of a surgical mask was less than ₹2 till January, when people began purchasing them as a preventive measure against COVID-19. “Its retail rate was between ₹4 and ₹5 till January. The rate escalated to over ₹30 a piece until the government intervened and brought in price regulations,” he added.

On traders not issuing computerised receipts, an income tax official said the GST Department must clamp down on the practice. “Many registered brands sell goods under different names, but in a look-alike packing, to avoid GST. On their part, the traders are citing curbs by the police on transportation of goods as a reason for shortage of commodities,” he added.

The shortage of essential commodities has been worsened by street vendors, who used to sell vegetables and fruits, shutting down shops at most places. “The COVID-19 crisis has resulted in over 5,000 vendors in Ernakulam halting business,” said K.A. Usman, district secretary of Street Vendors Association and State convenor of the coordination committee of vendors.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/enforcement-ramped-up-to-check-fleecing-by-traders/article31187567.ece

A total of 96 people were removed from the list after they completed the home quarantine period. There are now 3,884 people in home quarantine in the district.

Seven people were discharged from the Medical College Hospital (MCH) on Friday. They included a 3-year-old boy from Kannur and his parents, and two people in the U.K. tourist group from Munnar. At present, there are 15 people under treatment for COVID-19. Of them, five are from the U.K. group, seven are Ernakulam residents, two are from Kannur and one from Malappuram.

324,2020/03/27,Navy readies two Corona Care Centres,"They will be administered by a dedicated group of personnel

The Southern Naval Command has readied a Corona Care Centre (CCC) for 200 people at one of its training units at the Naval Base in Kochi. A separate facility for 200 service personnel and families has also been created to meet any eventuality.

The two facilities were prepared with dedicated and isolated food, toilets, medical waste management and recreational arrangements for 14 days.

The onus of ensuring adequate number of beds is with the health department. Local body department officials must certify personal details of people admitted here; their food and daily needs should also be taken care of by the department.

328,2020/03/27,Kudumbashree to scale up community kitchens in a big way,"Its network of around 250 hotels, canteens, and catering units to be utilised for the purpose; food packets to be sold at ₹20 each

The District Kudumbashree Mission (DKM) is gearing up to convert its entire network of 250-odd hotels, canteens, and catering units run by their members into community kitchens in the comings days. It is in keeping with the State government motto that none should go hungry during the prolonged national lockdown.

Kudumbashree runs 42 canteens, 86 hotels, and 107 catering units in the district, and they have expressed willingness to be part of the proposed community kitchen programme.

DKM is in the process of drawing up a detailed action plan on running community kitchens without compromising on the safety of its members.

₹23 crore allocated

The State government has allocated ₹23 crore for setting up community kitchens, which will be divided among districts with each unit to be given a revolving fund not exceeding ₹50,000. DKM is looking at taking over marriage auditoriums, closed hotels, and such other facilities for running community kitchens, which are looking at serving food to up to 1,000 people a day. A day after Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan evolved the concept of community kitchens, DKM on Thursday opened five such kitchens on a small scale for distributing food packets in Chengamanad, Kottuvally and Vengola panchayats while diverting resources to a canteen in Paravur block and an already functional Kudumbashree people’s eatery in Thripunithura.

“We will scale up the number of community kitchens and volume of food being served through them in association with local bodies in the coming days. An understanding has been reached to make rice available for such kitchens through ration shops and other provisions from Supplyco at wholesale prices,” said T.P. Geevarghese, district mission coordinator.

Kudumbashree plans to sell food packets at the rate of ₹20 each out of which ₹10 will be reimbursed by the State government as subsidy. The larger the volume of food packets being sold the better will be the margin for the units.

Free meals

Besides, free meals will be given to migrant workers, quarantined people, and the jobless, the expenses of which will be reimbursed by the local bodies concerned.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kudumbashree-to-scale-up-community-kitchens-in-a-big-way/article31177276.ece
329,2020/03/27,Cooperative banks come to the aid of members,"They offer interest-free loans and moratorium of two months on repayment

Local cooperative banks are coming to the rescue of its members who are facing economic hardship following the national lockdown.

Besides offering interest-free loans and moratorium of two months on repayment, some institutions are also extending financial support to their members for purchasing essential items during the crisis period. At the same time, COVID-19 scare has forced an institution to put on hold its plan to launch a scheme for its members.

The Mulavukad Cooperative Bank had to postpone its scheme of offering a soft loan of ₹5,000 each to its members on Thursday following reports of a COVID-19 case from a nearby panchayat.

The scheme envisaged granting interest-free loans for 12 months with a moratorium of two months on repayment. Beneficiaries could repay loans in the remaining 10 months. The bank had earmarked ₹25 lakh for the purpose. The bank will launch the scheme shortly, according to its president M.A. Leo Paul.

A majority of the 10,500 members of the bank are daily wagers, and the national lockdown has rendered them jobless, said Mr. Paul.

The Vennala Service Cooperative Bank did not wait for government funds to arrive to disburse social security pension to its members.

On Thursday, the bank started distributing ₹2,400 each, the first instalment, at the doorstep of beneficiaries.

It will take a few more days for money to be credited to the bank’s account. Still, the bank decided to start disbursal of pension straightaway mobilising its own funds, said A.N. Santhosh, president.

A ₹12,000 interest-free loan will also be offered next month as part of the welfare scheme, he added.

Meanwhile, The Thammanam Service Cooperative Bank has announced a scheme for its members to purchase provision and consumer goods worth ₹5,000 from a fair-price shop run by it at Thammanam.

“This is some sort of an overdraft scheme. Members of the bank can purchase provision for up to ₹5,000 from the Neethi outlet managed by the bank,” said M. Mayadevi, secretary of the bank. The bank has around 20,000 members, she added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/cooperative-banks-come-to-the-aid-of-members/article31177274.ece
330,2020/03/27,Supplies affected as truck movement faces hurdles,"Curbs on inter-State borders lead to decline in stocks

Grocery stores and vegetable outlets here have started feeling the heat of decline in stocks owing to curbs on inter-State borders as part of the country-wide lockdown.

Traders on Thursday said there had been considerable dip in the availability of sugar and pulses. Several retail outlets are restricting the sale of sugar to one or two kilograms due to absence of adequate stock at wholesale markets.

“The curbs in Maharashtra had led to shortage in supply of sugar. With wholesale markets at Mettupalayam and Oddanchatram remaining shut, the supply of vegetables has been hit. A few wholesalers at the Ernakulam market could not clear stock thanks to poor demand for vegetables from hotels and catering groups,” said G. Karthikeyan, president, Kerala Merchants’ Chamber of Commerce.

“The arrival of vegetable loads at the Ernakulam market was less on Thursday compared to the previous two days. It will be reflected in other markets in the outskirts. Supplies to stores in the outskirts were affected as the police had restricted the entry of pick-up vans and autorickshwaws from those areas to the Ernakulam market,” he added.

Lorry owners said drivers were reluctant to undertake trips as they were facing difficulties at inter-State borders. “They remain held up at the borders for hours, and it has delayed the movement of lorries and trucks. The closure of hotels owing to the lockdown has also come as a blow to drivers,” they added.

Asked why people were not complaining about shortage of supply, traders said most of them had stocked various essential items and even vegetables for at least a week just before the lockdown was announced. “Many have overstocked rice, cereals, and oil anticipating a long shutdown. This is the reason why there was no panic buying on Wednesday and Thursday,” they said.

Meanwhile, the merchant community has requested the authorities to ease hurdles facing lorry drivers. Otherwise, the situation may turn worse in the next two days. The government can also explore movement of essential items by wagons, they added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ry504a/article31177261.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27-KI-TRUCK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/supplies-affected-as-truck-movement-faces-hurdles/article31177262.ece
331,2020/03/27,Medicine distribution network down in Kochi,"Shortage of medicines looms large on residents

With the medicine distribution network getting disrupted, the probability of shortage of medicines is looming large on city residents.

The curbs imposed by the State on movement of private vehicles and the suspension of public transport as part of the social distancing campaign to contain COVID-19 outbreak have worsened the situation. Medical sales and marketing professionals, say distributors, are finding it difficult to reach offices and medical shops as they are often stopped midway and turned back by the police.

“Most of my staffers are not turning up for duty as they are being prevented by the police on the road,” said Baburaj Krishnan, owner of Sankar Pharma at Palarivattom.

“I mostly deal with drugs used for treatment of asthma, cardiac diseases, and diabetes. In the absence of sufficient number of staffers, distribution of medicines has gone haywire,” he added.

Of the 20 staffers employed by Mr. Krishnan, 16 come from Cherthala. Since most of them could not reach office, Mr. Krishnan is doubling up as cashier and salesman and trying to meet supply orders from medical shops.

Four of the staffers who live in the city go to the shop to assist their employer in sorting and packing medicines. If the situation continues, there will be shortage of medicines in the city, warned Mr. Krishnan.

“Though orders for a few medicines were placed with a few distributors,” said P.K. Indukala who runs a medical shop in the city, “they wanted the medicines to be collected from their shop as there were no delivery personnel.”

The commonly used medicines for fever and acidity are fast running out of stock. No one is willing to take the risk of supplying medicines to shops though it has been notified as an essential service, she added.

Sone James, who runs a medical shop at Vyttila, is not able to supply medicines to some of his long-standing clients who buy medicines required for six months at a go.

“It was after much persuasion that some distributors agreed to take my order. In the absence of staffers who are familiar with medicines and their stock, pharma company owners are struggling to meet the demand. The medicine supply chain has been broken, which, if not restored immediately, could lead to a crisis, said Mr. James.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/medicine-distribution-network-down-in-kochi/article31177246.ece
332,2020/03/27,Social distancing has brought us closer : Chandradasan,"Kochi-based theatre practitioner Chandradasan says the Covid-19 lock-down is a time for introspection, relaxation, and revaluation this World Theatre Day

Theatre practitioner and writer Chandradasan, founder and artistic director of Lokadharmi Centre for Theater, was to travel to Mysuru for a three-day theatre programme, March 27 – 29, at Rangayana, this World Theatre Day – “it was to celebrate the space, the artists and meeting each other. But that didn’t happen because of the Covid-19 calamity.” The disappointment of the event not happening may or may not happen, but Chandradasan sees this as an opportunity to reconnect with each other. “This is a shut down, but all of us are in touch online and connected,” he says over the phone.

Social distancing has brought his community of theatre practitioners, like others, too. “We have been speaking to each other and keeping morale up. Isolation is not easy, I get messages saying as much, but we are not alone. Each of us is getting in touch with friends we have not been in contact with for years. Picking up the phone and asking, ‘where are you? Are you ok?’ Strangely the isolation has brought us closer.” Although he is optimistic about the current situation passing, he is worried about what is to follow.

The economic after effect which would without doubt impact theatre practice as well. “Corona will pass. We don’t yet know the extent of the tragedy yet, especially on the economy. We need to relax – plan, rethink and re-evaluate. We can longer think of productions that cost a lot – instead think small and local. Activities that would inspire confidence and help get them back on their feet.”

This is a time for theatre too, from a distance. He is to be part of United States-based This Is Not A Theatre Company’s (TINATC) project – an online collage of performances (videos) by artistes across the world. “It can be of any kind – a poem recited, a song sung, theatre performance.” He is planning a 15-minute rendering of a character from Malayalam literature. “Which or who, I have not decided. I have to record it and send it over the next couple of days.”",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/9dt2yt/article31183536.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27KIMPCHANDRADASAN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/theatre-practitioner-chandradasan-says-this-lockdown-is-a-time-for-introspection-relaxation-and-revaluation/article31183537.ece
333,2020/03/27,"After ossification test, court grants minor bail","He was arrested during Feb. riots in Delhi

Over a month after a boy was charged with rioting and arrested by police during the communal violence in north-east Delhi and subsequently sent to Mandoli jail, a Delhi court granted him bail on Friday following results of the bone ossification test confirming he is a minor.

Age contested

The minor’s age was contested at the time of arrest, with his family, residents of Chand Bagh, claiming he was 13 years old. The police, which picked him up on February 25 even as riots convulsed the area, had claimed that the boy said he was 22. Police asked for an ossification test in the court.

The family said the boy, a Class 5 dropout, had gone to look for his 10-year-old brother who they thought was out on the streets when riots broke out. The police charged him with rioting, unlawful assembly, assault on public servant, mischief by fire and damage to public property, among others.

Advocate Abdul Gaffar, appearing for the boy, said that the report stated that he was 15 years old.

Metropolitan Magistrate Rakesh Kumar Rampuri granted bail to the juvenile. “In view of the tender age of the accused and suspension of work of regular courts and in view of the epidemic situation of coronavirus, accused is granted bail on furnishing a bail bond of ₹10,000 with one surety of like amount,” the court said.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/after-ossification-test-court-grants-minor-bail/article31187100.ece

The efforts of the Kolkata Muncipal Corporation (KMC) to use sprinkler machines to spray disinfectants in different parts of the city has earned the praise of actor Amitabh Bachchan. Not only did he laud this initiative but also asked the officials in Mumbai if they could do the same.

wow .. this is fantastic .. Mumbai , hello .. can the authorities please do this for us too .. https://t.co/726UzW76Zv — Amitabh Bachchan (@SrBachchan) March 25, 2020

“wow...this is fantastic...Mumbai, hello ... can the authorities please do this for us too,” he tweeted on Thursday in response to a tweet, where the video of the sprinklers used in a south Kolkata neighborhood was tagged.

Debasish Kumar, Member Mayor in Council, Parks and Squares of the KMC, said the applause by the actor comes as a “huge encouragement for the KMC as well as the workers who are engaging in sanitising activities in such distressing times”.

“We have about 20 such vehicles, which are usually used for reducing roadside pollution. But since Monday, we are using chemicals like chlorine, sodium- hydrochloride to sanitise the areas where crowds are assembling,” he told The Hindu on Friday.

These sprinkler machines were usually used in markets, near police stations and health establishments and the process would continue till the lockdown ended, he added.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/2sem26/article31181395.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/amitabh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/amitabh-praises-kolkata-sanitisation-drive/article31181396.ece
335,2020/03/27,How beggars’ children are running households during lockdown,"With no cash coming by, families are depending on free rations that are given to school-going children

Five-year-old Priyanka is the last hope for a family of three, residing in one of umpteen shanties on Strand Road in the city’s central area. The family – Priyanka, her two-year-old sister and mother Pratima Majhi – will run out of their stock of grains, lentils and potato soon. The next meal is uncertain as access to food is difficult owing to lack of money, which has stopped flowing into the family of mother and daughters.

“The vehicles have stopped plying on road. Our income has stopped,” said Pratima Majhi, after a long pause. The Majhis are one of nearly 40,000 homeless families of Kolkata as per a 2009 government survey. The family begs to survive.

“We will go foodless and cashless from Thursday night,” said an unusually thin mother. But there is hope.

“Early morning on Monday, we have been told to come at nearby Saraswati Vidyapith where she [Priyanka] studies and they will give us ‘du kilo chal, one kilo aloo’ [two kg rice and one kg of potato],” she said. The “real” problem will, however, start from Friday morning and continue till Sunday night, when the kids and the malnourished mother will go without food.

She crossed the road while chatting and entered another shanty, relatively bigger in size. Here lives Ruma Majhi, a distant relative of Pratima, and her family of four. Ms Majhi sells vegetables under the flyover that drops at Howrah station but she too was apprehensive about supporting a family of three.

“We are in deep trouble too with illness and I am not sure if we can support them after Thursday,” said Ms Majhi. None of the women and men in the two families had a proper mask or sanitiser. But they are using bars of washing soaps to clean hands, she said.

The condition of Naskars, residing on the pavement, next to the elite Calcutta Rowing Club in southern lake, is far worse. They have a nine-month-old son and a 12-year-old family member, Swastika, in the family of five. Swastika, who studies in Standard V in Rajendra Nath Vidya Bhavan in nearby Lake Avenue, is now the bread-winner of the five-member homeless family, which begs to survive.

Swastika has a clear sense of the crisis and knows her job perfectly.

“Last Monday, a few kilos of rice, potato, onion, oil were distributed, which will run us the week. We will have to plan for next week,” says Swastika. The beggars who are settled in one place and send kids to government-run primary schools are largely dependent on the school-going kids of the family as they are receiving the free ration as the part of the project to feed school-going kids, experts said.

But what if the child is gone?

“We will die…” said a sobbing Devi Naskar. Ms Naskar’s daughter-in-law’s sister is Swastika. She stays with her parents elsewhere; the day she leaves, the Naskars will be in trouble. “Our ration will stop, as we do not have a school-going child in the family, my son is nine months old and we will starve to death,” said Babulal Naskar, her son. But, non-government officials, who work closely with the State government, told The Hindu that it is difficult to dispatch the homeless to shelters.

“There are 36 shelters for the homeless and the State government launched a drive to admit homeless people to those centres and made some basic arrangements to provide food and hygiene. But as soon as the women and men see the officials, they are running away or hiding in the bylanes,” said a senior official of a top NGO, on condition of anonymity. The reason, he said, are multiple.

“Firstly, the homeless person is deeply scared that she or he or the family will lose the place where they are residing for many years. Secondly, the shelters are not conveniently located,” said the official, who has authored reports on homeless.

Moreover, space is also not adequate in the night shelters. With a little more than 40,000 homeless people in the city, there are 36 shelters, each with capacity of about 50. So, shelters can house about 2,000 persons, while there are about 40,000 people on the streets of Kolkata with a makeshift residence. Twenty-five percent of them are children. But one approach of the State government is commendable, the officials said.

“Very quickly, the administration has managed to put in place a basic food supply line, mainly in schools. It is not adequate but will stave off starvation deaths for now. This could be possible as the majority of Kolkata’s homeless were documented and pushed to send their kids to schools where they could study with kids of lower income group families. “It was indeed wise to send the kids to school,” the official said.

And, nobody knows it better than the members of the Majhi or Naskar families.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/cf55lj/article31178760.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Beggars-children-running-households-during-lock-down-in-Kolkata1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/how-beggars-children-are-running-households-during-lockdown/article31178761.ece

Community kitchens opened by local self-government bodies benefited hundreds of migrant labourers and daily wage workers in Kozhikode on the first day on Friday.

Within the city corporation limits, food was supplied to over 500 persons from the kitchen set up at Government Vocational Higher Secondary School for Girls, Nadakkavu, on Friday.

Deputy Mayor Meera Dashak said two more such kitchens would be opened at Beypore and Cheruvannur respectively on Saturday.

According to A. Pradeep Kumar, MLA, facilities at the Nadakkavu community kitchen will be enough to supply food for 5,000 persons a day.

He also proposed to open a similar kitchen at Karaparamba Government Higher Secondary School.

Doorstep delivery

In Koduvally, municipal authorities and volunteers have walked an extra mile to start doorstep delivery of food for migrant labourers. Besides starting four community kitchens, the municipality will open 10 distribution outlets named ‘Pothichor’ on Saturday to supply food packets for the needy.

“We have got the support of charitable organisations and volunteers to proceed with the initiative. Even after the lockdown period, food distribution counters will function with the support of charitable organisations,” says municipal vice chairman A.P. Majeed.

Following the directive of the district administration, all grama panchayats and municipalities have identified convenient spaces to set up community kitchens and operate them with the support of Kudumbashree workers.

Olavanna and Kadalundi grama panchayats have started the distribution of food from their kitchens.

As migrant workers are likely to be one of the main beneficiaries of the project, the district administration has formed a Migrant Labourers’ Welfare Coordination team for the sflawless operation of the project.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/k0vmeq/article31186193.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28-KI-KITCHENjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/community-kitchen-a-big-relief-for-migrants-daily-wage-workers/article31186194.ece

With the support of nine special squads, the Excise Department has increased the number of its flash inspections in the rural areas of Kozhikode district to prevent the secret operation of hooch dens and the distribution of illegally procured Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL).

People who were earlier arrested or convicted in illicit liquor brewing or sales cases have been brought under the scanner of patrol squads.

Deputy Excise Commissioner V.R. Anil Kumar says there is no concern over the smuggling of liquor or other narcotic substance from other States or districts following the national lockdown. “Our squads can make use of their full strength to crackdown on local brewers and distributors during this period,” he adds.

On Friday, checking squads managed to seize and destroy about 600 litres of fermented wash from a hooch den in Vadakara. About four litres of illegally procured IMFL too were seized during search operations.

The department has come up with special services for the needy at its district-level de-addiction centre ( Contact number - 9495002270) in the city. According to Mr. Anil Kumar, excise squads have been asked to use their vehicles for dropping such needy persons at the de-addiction centre.

343,2020/03/27,Conservancy workers demand more bus services,"There is one service connecting Sakkimangalam and Melavassal

MADURAI

There was a need for bus services to facilitate movement of conservancy workers of Madurai Corporation across the city during the 21-day nationwide lockdown, said the workers.

According to a senior Corporation official, a Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) bus has been hired to pick up and drop conservancy workers at Sakkimangalam and Melavassal. “A majority of the workers are from these areas,” said the official.

However, this measure was inadequate, said K.P. Thangavel, a conservancy worker from Melavasal. “Due to lack of bus services, workers who have two-wheelers reach their workplaces on their own. But, a majority of the workers from across the city are forced to walk long distances to their workplaces,” he said.

He also insisted that the bus which was currently plying came late to pick them up. “The bus picks up workers from Sakkimangalam and reaches Melavasal only by 6.30 a.m. But, all of us need to be present for attendance by 6.30 a.m. Hence, many of the workers tend to walk to their workplaces,” he said.

The women workers were the worst affected, said R. Subramanian, a worker from Meenakshipuram. “A considerable number of women from our locality work as domestic breeding checkers of the Corporation. It is highly unsafe for them to walk in the dark,” he said.

Mr. Thangavel said that the introduction of two more buses would address the issue. “One bus can pick up workers from Rajakoor and surrounding areas. The other can be used to pick up and drop workers from Tirupparankundram and surrounding areas,” he said.

The Corporation official said that they would examine the situation and take action accordingly.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/conservancy-workers-demand-more-bus-services-madurai/article31186077.ece

The Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamaath’s Masjid-Ur-Rahman, which would attract a minimum of over 3,000 persons for the Friday prayers, wore a deserted look on Friday as the TNTJ office-bearers asked the Melapalayam locals to offer prayers in their homes itself to avoid huge gathering at the mosque.

The inmates of Sri Lankan refugees’ camp at Subramaniapuram near Gopalasamudram have banned the entry of outsiders into their colony fearing community transmission of the dreaded virus.

Meanwhile, the Government Siddha Medical College in Palayamkottai sent ‘nilavembu kudineer’ herbs to the house quarantined persons in the district on their return from foreign countries or other States. “The ‘nilavembu kudineer’ herbs that gave a lot of relief to the patients suffering from chikungunya and dengue, are being sent to these persons to strengthen their immunity,” the Government Siddha Medical College doctors said.

Since the consumers in large number throng the ‘Uzhavar Santhai’ at Maharaja Nagar, Kandigaiperi and Melapalayam and also the vegetable markets at Palayamkottai and Tirunelveli Town, the Corporation, created spaces for vegetable shops at Tiruchendur Road police quarters, VOC Grounds, Nehru Open Auditorium, Palayamkottai bus-stand and a few more areas. However, the vegetable traders put-up their shops only at Tiruchendur Road police quarters area, where vegetables were sold at inflated price.

Though personal distancing is being advocated to prevent community transmission of the virus and it was stressed by the officials through public address system, the consumers ignored this instruction and stood in the long queues to buy the vegetables.

350,2020/03/27,SHGs produce 2000 face masks daily: Sivaganga Collector,"The district administration had taken a number of steps to ensure that essential commodities such as vegetables and grocery items were available at the designated locations and stores.

For the benefit of doctors and those working in essential areas fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, self-help-groups (SHG) manufactured around 2000 face masks and soap oil for hand wash and the same were available in sufficient quantity, said Collector J. Jayakanthan here on Friday.

Speaking to reporters after inspecting the SHG facility producing face masks at Vaniyangudi near here, he said that there was no need for panic among the residents. Only those who were engaged in movement in public space and hospitals were told to wear the mask as a mandatory precaution. Others, it is enough they maintained cleanliness within their dwellings and stayed indoors.

The district administration had taken a number of steps to ensure that essential commodities such as vegetables and grocery items were available at the designated locations and stores. He appealed to the people not to rush to markets and indulge in panic buying and unwanted crowding. The government has been urging the people to practice personal distancing and not to get in close contact with any strangers.

The Mahalir Thittam Project Director Arunmani said that the products would be made available in select stores across the district for public consumption. District Rural Development Agency Project Director Vadivel and DD (Health) Yasodamani were present during the inspection.

The Collector also said that they had sufficient stock of hand wash liquid, which were produced by the self-help groups under the Mahalir Thittam. The officials guided the womenfolk in getting the materials produced at an affordable cost. There was no compromise on the quality and the public were welcome to buy them, Mr. Jayakanthan said and added that soap oils were being produced in Tirupathur, Solapuram, S Pudur Kannangudi and other locations.

Special teams were monitoring the foreign returnees to the district since March 1 and he urged the occupants not to venture out in public interest for another fortnight, which would amount to criminal offence. The Collector warned those who violated the curfew, now in force, and said that action would be initiated against them under the Disaster Management Act and under the IPC Sections.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/sq7d6w/article31185347.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA28SIVAGANGA-COLLECTOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/shgs-produce-2000-face-masks-daily-sivaganga-collector/article31184425.ece

For R. Raja, an anti-mosquito scheme worker of Madurai Corporation, work starts as early as 5.30 a.m. After toiling at work the entire day, he reaches home around 10 p.m. For him and around 100 of his co-workers, the past few days have been challenging than ever before.

Wearing a dark blue uniform with a face mask and hand gloves, these men have been fumigating and spraying disinfectants at major public spots across the city as a precautionary measure to curb the spread of COVID-19. Amidst the nation-wide lockdown, these men are in the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus epidemic.

P. Murugan, who has been carrying out anti-mosquito operations for the last 18 years, says that their team was in the forefront and have successfully combated dengue, malaria, chikungunya and swine flu. “Every time there is an outbreak of any disease, there is usually anxiety and fear gripping the residents. Nevertheless, we have carried out our duty by fogging and disinfecting the city to help the authorities to tackle the crisis,” he says.

But, the current crisis against COVID-19 was unique and even more taxing, says B. Alagumalai. “Since, it is an emergency situation, all of us have been working for around 14 hours each day. We have been provided all necessary safety equipment with advanced machines to carry out our work. But, we are also anxious to some extent as we are working outdoors throughout the day and worried regarding the safety of our family members,” he says.

“But, such thoughts get suspended as we realise the importance of our job. By performing our duty, we understand that we can contribute our share in the fight against COVID-19 and help protect all residents including our own families,” adds Mr. Alagumalai.

Concurring with this viewpoint, G. Rajapandi, another worker, says: “Through the ages, our uniforms and work equipment have changed, but our attitude towards work has remained the same. Earlier we used to wear khaki uniforms to work and carry a heavy brass can to spray disinfectants. Today, it has been upgraded to dark blue uniforms and motorised sprayers. However, we work on war footing during any crisis and stay positive to endure through the task.”

“If residents cooperate and stay indoors, we can definitely mitigate the situation,” Mr. Rajapandi exuded confidence.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/tgda2n/article31183011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MADURAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/these-men-are-in-forefront-of-the-fight-against-covid-19/article31183012.ece

Madurai City Police have set up a control room to cater to urgent needs of the city residents during the lockdown period.

People can call 0452- 253 1044 or 253 1045 for any type of help, Commissioner of Police, S. Davidson Devasirvatham said that the objective of the control room is to keep under check crowding at marketplaces and grocery shop.

People can call the control room and place their orders for the grocery needs.

Policemen and representatives of select shops would be available to take down the orders and make home deliveries of the grocery items.

Elderly people who are facing certain inconvenience can also call the control room for any help.

Commissioner said that people could also contact the control room in case of medical emergencies.

“We could even send police vehicles to take them to the hospitals,” the Commissioner said.

Madurai City Police and Madurai Corporation are planning to to make available vegetables at various locations in the city to avoid crowding of shopkeepers, their workers and customers in few markets at Mattuthavani, Thayir Market and South Gate.

Stating that all grocery and vegetable shops were open in various streets in the city, the Commissioner appeal to the people to make use of the shops in the neighbourhood.

“Unfortunately, people have the habit of going to to select markets and eventually lead to crowding.”

He emphasised that the best solution to prevent spreading of COVID19 is to stay indoors.

“Even if they need to come out to buy essential items, only one member and not the entire family members should come out,” he said.

The city police is planning to deploy 5 drones to monitor unnecessary crowding. 33 cases have been booked for violating the prohibitory order besides a total of 33 two vehicles have been seized for roaming around the city.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/3e0tcm/article31189474.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28MACITY-CONTROLROOM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/madurai-city-police-sets-up-control-room-to-help-residents-during-lockdown/article31182410.ece
353,2020/03/27,COVID-19 | Chithirai festival work put on hold,"District Collector T. G. Vinay said that the decision regarding the conduct of the festival, which sees lakhs of people gathering, has been put on hold for the moment.

Work for the annual Chithirai festival, which is to begin on April 25, has been put on hold by Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple and Alagarkoil’s Sundararaja Perumal temple authorities.

A senior official from the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments department (HR and CE) said that the Panguni festival that precedes the Chithirai festival will not have any public gathering.

Every year, the Chithirai festival sees lakhs of people travelling from different parts of the State to view the celestial wedding at Meenakshi temple and the entry of Lord Kallazhagar into the Vaigai river. This year, the flag hoisting of the festival will take place on April 25, celestial wedding on May 4 and Lord Kallazhagar’s entry on May 7.

“Because of COVID-19, the celestial wedding as part of the Panguni festival at Alagarkoil will take place on April 6 without any members of the public. Only the priests will perform the necessary puja with minimum strength. Decisions regarding the Chithirai festival and its preparation need to be made by April 15 as many villagers around the temple will end up tying kaapu and begin fasting ahead of the festival,” said Deputy Commissioner (in-charge) T. Anitha.

One month before the start of the festival, workers usually begin sprucing up the temple, cleaning up the temple car and providing orders for the creation of pandals and offerings including turmeric, kungumam and thaali threads. Without any labourers and the lack of the public, these works have been put on hold.

Joint commissioner of the Meenakshi temple N. Natarajan said that the temple is being thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. “We are also taking care of the temple cows and the elephant. Regular pujas are being held with minimum staff. Since workers for the Chithirai festival are unavailable and in their own villages, we are not going ahead with any pending work. We are following State government orders,” he said.

Those most affected by the looming uncertainty of the conduct of the Chithirai festival are the traders at Pudu Mandapam located opposite the Eastern wing of the Meenakshi temple.

President of the Pudu Mandapam Traders and Tailors Association, G. Muthupandi said that they haven’t been to their shops since March 19 and are unable to prepare costumes or packages containing thaali threads, turmeric and kungumam. “The mandapam is central to the trade of the Chithirai. Around this time every year, our tailors pick an auspicious day and sew the first costume of the season. It is unfortunate that we have no idea about what is likely to happen as the COVID-19 situation seems to be a global issue,” he said.

District Collector T. G. Vinay said that the decision regarding the conduct of the festival has been put on hold for the moment. “Since it is a large congregation of the public, we need to consult with all the stakeholders and come up with a decision,” he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hy0cib/article31182163.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27MARTH--PUDUMANDAPAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/covid-19-chithirai-festival-work-put-on-hold/article31182164.ece
354,2020/03/27,India coronavirus lockdown | Finance Ministry pulls up banks on shut branches,"Bank unions cite problems the staff faced in reaching branches.

The Union Finance Ministry has asked banks to explain why several branches are closed.

“In view of the novel coronavirus lockdown, the government is monitoring the functioning of bank branches across the country. Accordingly, the daily data on the number of bank branches (of all scheduled commercial banks in the country), which are open and functioning is being collected by Indian Banks Association (IBA), and monitored by Department of Financial Services,” the Ministry said in the communication to banks.

Coronavirus | Banks to provide only essential services

The Ministry cited the data and asked public sector banks to submit reasons on “why large number of branches are not functioning across the country”. On private banks, it has asked the IBA to compile reasons.

The bank unions, however, cited the problems the staff faced in reaching the branches.

According data submitted by banks to the Ministry, 1775 of the State Bank of India’s 22,029 branches are closed, 666 of Bank of Baroda’s 9,479 branches are shuttered as are 989 of Punjab National Bank’s 6,618 branches, 289 of Canara Bank’s 6,325 branches and 424 of 5,024 Bank of India branches.

In a communication to the banks earlier this week after the lockdown was announced, the IBA had said they could selectively keep their branches open after consultation with local State governments. Bank branches are now offering only essential services including deposits and withdrawals, and their working hours have also been shortened.

The communication from the Finance Ministry has, however, not gone down well with bank unions as they cited the problems employees face in reaching to branches due to the lockdown and obstruction by police.

“Yesterday’s announcement of disbursement of subsidies through Jan Dhan accounts is also likely to result in a huge rush at the counters when maintaining required distance amongst customers & employees as against customers is not possible which will result in frustrating the very purpose of the lockdown.

355,2020/03/27,Liquidity floodgates opened,"Central bank to infuse ₹3.74 lakh cr. into banking system

In a move to infuse sufficient liquidity into the banking system, the Reserve Bank of India has reduced the cash reserve ratio (CRR) requirement by 100 bps, increased the cap for liquidity available under the marginal standing facility, and will auction long-term repo of ₹1 lakh crore. These three measures will infuse ₹3.74 lakh crore into the banking system.

The cash reserve ratio — the proportion of liabilities which a bank has to set aside as cash — has been reduced from 4% to 3%. The 100 bps reduction in CRR will free up ₹1.37 lakh crore liquidity for the banks. For State Bank of India, lowering of CRR will release ₹31,000 crore.

The minimum daily requirement of maintaining CRR balance has also been reduced to 80% from 90%, effective from the first day of the reporting fortnight beginning March 28, 2020. “This is a one-time dispensation available up to June 26, 2020,” the RBI said.

Banks do not earn any interest for maintaining CRR balance. With this reduction, they can deploy the liquidity in interest-earning assets.

RBI also increased liquidity available to banks under the marginal standing facility from 2% of the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) to 3% with immediate effect. This measure will be applicable up to June 30, 2020.

“This measure should provide comfort to the banking system by allowing it to avail [itself of] an additional ₹1,37,000 crore of liquidity under the LAF window in times of stress at the reduced MSF rate announced in the MPC’s resolution,” the RBI said.

The monetary policy committee reduced the repo rate by 75 bps to 4.4% and consequently the MSF rate was reduced to 4.65%.

Observing that large sell-offs in the domestic equity, bond and forex markets had intensified redemption pressures, the central bank decided to infuse ₹1 lakh crore through targeted long-term repo operations (TLTRO).

The RBI will conduct auctions of targeted term repos of up to three years’ tenor for a total of up to ₹1 lakh crore at a floating rate, linked to the policy repo rate. “Liquidity availed under the scheme by banks has to be deployed in investment grade corporate bonds, commercial paper and non-convertible debentures over and above the outstanding level of their investments in these bonds as on March 25, 2020,” the RBI said.

RBI also said investments by banks under this facility would be classified as held-to-maturity (HTM) even in excess of 25% of the total investment permitted to be included in the HTM portfolio.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/lnhdf7/article31186596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THBURBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/liquidity-floodgates-opened/article31186597.ece
356,2020/03/27,Moody’s cuts India's GDP growth forecast to 2.5%,"Global economy likely to contract by 0.5%

Moody's Investor Service has slashed its GDP growth forecast for India to 2.5% in 2020 - a sharp drop from an earlier projection of 5.3%, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown.

Also read: Moody’s downgrades Indiabulls

The ratings agency expects the country's economy to recover in 2021, estimating a growth rate of 5.8%, but warned that uncertainty regarding the virus’s spread and containment makes it difficult to fully assess the economic toll of the crisis. India grew at 5% in 2019.

Globally, the world economy was facing an “unprecedented shock” and the G20 countries were likely to see an overall contraction of GDP by 0.5%, said Moody's Global Macro Outlook 2020-21, released on Friday. It projected that the G-20 GDP growth rate, which was 2.6% in 2019, is likely to recover to 3.2% in 2021.

At the low growth rate of 2.5% in 2020, India may see a sharp fall in incomes, further weighing on domestic demand and the pace of recovery in 2021. “In India, credit flow to the economy already remains severely hampered because of severe liquidity constraints in the bank and non-bank financial sectors,” said the report.

While advanced economies may see sharp contractions in their economies in 2020, it was emerging market countries such as India which may struggle with the recovery once the crisis was over, said the report.

Also read: Moody's lowers India's outlook to 'negative' from 'stable', Govt rebuts

“A general lack of social safety nets, weak ability to provide adequate support to businesses and households, and inherent weaknesses in many major emerging market countries will amplify the effects of the coronavirus-induced shock. Additionally, emerging market countries with relatively open capital markets remain vulnerable to risk-off financial market sentiment as the growth outlook deteriorates,” it said. “As a result, recoveries in many of the emerging market economies will likely be relatively more muted than those in advanced economies and China.”

Business activity hit

The ongoing 21-day lockdown in India has brought business activity in most sectors of the economy to a halt and resulted in thousands of job losses. The Centre has announced a welfare package to provide support to the most vulnerable communities at this time.

However, Moody’s warned that, “Even in countries where governments are in a position to provide support through large and targeted measures, some small businesses and vulnerable individuals in less-stable jobs will likely experience severe financial distress.”

Globally, the ratings agency estimated that the U.S. economy would contract by 2% in 2020, while the Euro area would see a 2.2% contraction. China's economic growth rate was expected to slow to to 3.3%, although it was expected to recover to 6% in 2021.

However, a resurgence in new cases in areas which have seen some flattening of the curve was especially worrisome. “There are significant unknowns, such as how long the virus will take to be fully contained and, by extension, how long economic activity will remain disrupted,” said the report. “In particular, a sustained pullback in consumption and prolonged closures of businesses would hurt earnings, drive layoffs and weigh on sentiment. The longer these conditions persist, the more they would potentially feed self-sustaining recessionary dynamics, and expose existing vulnerabilities in the real economy and in financial sectors,” it added.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/xpo767/article31183722.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-MOODYS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/moodys-cuts-indias-gdp-growth-forecast-to-25/article31183734.ece

The Central government has raised ₹11,500 crore through strategic sale of its stake in two State-owned power companies, THDC India Ltd. and NEEPCO, to NTPC Limited.

With this, the total disinvestment proceeds in the current financial year stand at over ₹46,500 crore.

The Revised Estimates had substantially lowered estimates of disinvestment receipts for the current financial year to ₹65,000 crore, from ₹1.05 lakh crore projected in the Budget.

The government has sold 74.49% stake in THDC for ₹7,500 crore and 100% in NEEPCO for ₹4,000 crore.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had in November 2019 given its in-principle approval for the sale of its stake in North Eastern Electric Power Corp (NEEPCO) and THDC India along with transfer of management control to NTPC.

Following this, the board of NTPC approved the said acquisition in January and competition watchdog Competition Commission of India (CCI) also cleared it in February.

“DIPAM completed two more strategic disinvestment transactions. GOI’s 74.49% stake in THDC at a consideration of ₹7,500 cr and 100% stake in NEEPCO at ₹4,000 cr has been disinvested in favour of NTPC,” secretary, DIPAM said in a tweet.

The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) manages the government share sale programme in CPSE.

Besides the 74.5% stake in THDC India which is held by the Government of India, the rest 25.5% stake is held by the Uttar Pradesh government.

Shares of NTPC closed at ₹83.05, up 3.17% on the BSE on Friday.

The government in the next financial year has set disinvestment target at ₹2.10 lakh crore, including ₹1.20 lakh crore from stake sale in central public sector enterprises (CPSEs).

The process for big-ticket strategic sale of Air India and BPCL has already set in motion and the sale is likely to be concluded in the next financial year beginning April.

In March last year, State-owned PFC had acquired the government’s 52.63% stake in REC for ₹14,500 crore.

358,2020/03/27,Reactions to RBI policy announcement,"The central bank advanced its monetary policy committee meeting and voted for sizable reduction for policy rate.

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Reserve Bank of India has reduced the repo rate by 75 bps to 4.4% on Friday.

The central bank advanced its monetary policy committee meeting and voted for sizable reduction for policy rate, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said in a press conference in Mumbai. “Four out of six members voted for 75 bps cut,” he added

Some of the reactions

“The RBI policy announcements are bold, decisive, compelling and with a humane touch in attenuating to the needs of the economy to fight through the pandemic. The large rate cut, the adjustment in capital conservation buffer, the moratorium on repayments and the bazooka of conventional CRR cut and unconventional liquidity measure of incentivising banks to support CP market all will help financial markets stabilise, lead to immediate rate transmission and address the credit needs of the real economy. The decision of allowing Indian Banks to participate in NDF market is a positive step in broadening the market participants and better rate discovery. Given that we are in exceptional times, RBI has played the role of championing the cause for the economy and financial system!” — Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, SBI

“The Monetary Policy Committee today announced a set of comprehensive measures to address liquidity, easing financial pressures on businesses and providing enough support to help the financial system battle the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Liquidity measures announced were to the tune of ₹3.74 lakh crore across three measures comprising Long Term Repo Operation (LTRO), CRR cut of 100 bps and the increase in marginal standing facility (MSF) to 3% of the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR). That is a large amount of liquidity injection into the financial system that should help financial institutions and flow of funds to the real economy.” — Shanti Ekambaram, Group President — Consumer Banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank

“Given that the current lockdown is expected to have a negative impact on the cash flows of companies, the moratorium on repayments of term loans for a period of 3 months will help companies tide over this period. However, CII would urge that this period be extended further in case the impact of the virus outbreak lasts longer than expected. The RBI governor did well to provide the assurance that all instruments are on the table to protect the economy and the financial system from either an excessive downturn or volatility.” — Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, CII

“Expectations from RBI were riding very high on rate cut, moratorium and liquidity measures. RBI has delivered on every count. This will provide significant support to the market and economy. The small finance banks will see significant liquidity free u, which is critical to tide through the current challenges. While the measures were much needed but the markets will move now on how the Covid curve behaves in India. Longer shut downs will be detrimental to economy and the markets. Earlier recovery from lock down will mean a V shaped market recovery.” — Naveen Kulkarni, Chief Investment Officer, Axis Securities Limited

“RBI has announced all best possible praiseworthy measures to support banks and all sectors of economy to overcome ongoing adverse impact of COVID 19. Huge liquidity infusion of 3.74 Cr, 100 bps CRR cut, long term Repo auction, 3 months moratorium on loan repayment and deep Repo cut of 75 bps. Huge interest reduction to all Retail and home loans linked with Repo. Coordinated efforts of Government and RBI will help Indian Economy to come out of these challenging times”. — Deo Shankar Tripathi, MD and CEO of Aadhar Housing Finance

“RBI has effectively thrown a lifeline with its 3-month EMI moratorium and working capital interest forbearance. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all systems globally, and broken MSME supply chains across most sectors in India. RBI Governor Shaktikantha Das has made the right move by addressing the nation right away given the unprecedented economic reality that we are experiencing today. As the COVID-19 situation unfolds, our hope is they will continue to ease the economic burden on MSMEs who are the backbone of the Indian economy.”— Hardika Shah, Founder & CEO, Kinara Capital

“Allowing all banks and NBFCs to offer a 3-month moratorium on repayments of all term loans to their borrowers is a positive step. However, this being an optional move, its implementation has been left to the lending institutions. The fact that no borrower’s credit history will get affected because of this provides relief to all categories of borrowers. This will also provide the companies some breathing space to re-draw their strategies and re-invent themselves.” — Hemant Kanoria, Chairman, Srei Infrastructure Finance Limited",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/swtmua/article31181996.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/reactions-to-rbi-policy-announcement/article31181997.ece

Allaying depositors’ concerns, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday asserted there Indian banking system is safe, and termed linking banks’ share prices to safety of deposits as “fallacious” thinking.

The comments, which came after a massive correction in banking stocks following the Yes Bank crisis and coronavirus outbreak, also urged depositors not to resort to panic withdrawals.

“Let me reiterate that the Indian banking system is safe and sound.”

“In the recent past, COVID-19 related volatility in the stock market has impacted share prices of banks as well, resulting in some panic withdrawal of deposits from a few private sector banks. It would be fallacious to link share prices to safety of deposits,” Mr. Das said.

Depositors of commercial banks including private sector banks need not worry on the safety of their funds, he added.

“I would, therefore, urge members of public as well as the public authorities, who have deposits in private sector banks, not to resort to any panic withdrawal of their funds,” Mr. Das said.

It can be noted that a few states like Maharashtra had urged all the departments to pull out money from private sector banks despite previous communication from the RBI not to do so.

Yes Bank witnessed massive withdrawals ahead of being put under a moratorium by the RBI, but has been reporting normal activity since the restrictions removed on March 18.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/vdivsh/article31180846.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RBIGUV,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rbi-governor-urges-people-not-resort-to-panic-buying-says-indian-banking-system-is-safe/article31180847.ece
360,2020/03/27,"RBI recommendation for moratorium on EMI repayments half-hearted, says Chidambaram","He, however, welcomes central bank’s move to infuse liquidity into the markets

Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Friday welcomed the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) move to infuse liquidity into the markets but claimed that its recommendation for a three-month moratorium on EMI repayments was ‘half-hearted’.

“I welcome the RBI’s decision to cut the repo rate and measures to provide more liquidity,” Mr. Chidambaram said on Twitter soon after RBI governor Shakti Kanta Das announced the decisions taken by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the central bank.

Apart from increasing liquidity with steps such as reducing the cash reserve ratio, the RBI announced that banks are permitted to allow a three-month moratorium on payment of EMIs on all term loans that were outstanding on March 1.

Mr. Chidambaram, however, called this move ‘half-hearted’ as the central bank left it to the discretion of the commercial banks to extend this benefit.

“However, the RBI’s direction on deferment of EMI dates is ambiguous and half-hearted,” he said.

“The demand is that all EMI due dates must be automatically deferred. I had suggested that all due dates falling before June 30 may be deferred to June 30.

361,2020/03/27,Chennai Port acquires majority stake in Kamarajar Port,"ChPT procures 67% stake worth ₹2,383 crore

Chennai Port Trust (ChPT) on Friday acquired 67% stake of its subsidiary Kamarajar Port Ltd. (KPL) for ₹2,383 crore.

“This agreement comes into force with immediate effect,” said P. Raveendran, chairman, ChPT. “Our immediate focus is to utilise the existing capacity in ChPT to the maximum and carry out expansion in KPL. Our next target is to achieve cargo handling of 100 million tonnes in the coming years.”

Soon after remitting the amount, he said that both the ports would operate as different entities for the betterment of exim trade. KPL as corporate firm and ChPT as trust.

Both the ports would be in a better position to tackle competition from private players such as Adani’s Kattupalli Port and Krishnapatnam Port.

ChPT will continue to handle clean cargo such as containers, cars, liquid cargo, cruise and passenger traffic, while KPL will create additional capacity for all other types of bulk, dry and liquid cargo.

“Our combined effort will be to maximise cargo throughput. For the past few years, ChPT has been handling over 50 million tonnes of cargo, while KPL about 35 million. It will take at least two to three years to reach 100 million tonnes of cargo, due to COVID-19,” he said.

""In ChPT, we can't go in for expansion due to thick population, traffic bottleneck and Madras High Court ban on handling dusty cargoes such as coal and iron ore. KPL is already handling coal. Efforts would be made to speed up Chennai Port-Maduravoyal elevated corridor project. Rail connectivity is there for both the ports. Rail lines are being doubled at KPL,"" he said.

Initially, KPL was conceived as a satellite port of ChPT to handle coal for Tamil Nadu Electricity Board. It is the only major corporate port in the country and rest of 11 ports are run as trust.

It is a mini-ratna company situated about 24 kms from Chennai city. It was commissioned during 2001. The Centre had about 66.677% stake and 33.33% was with ChPT. The acquisition was done partly through internal accruals and borrowings.

Asserting that both the ports were owned by Central government, he said that KPL would continue to function as a corporate firm and ChPT as Trust. There would not be any changing in quick decision making pattern of KPL or in fixing tariffs.

""Kamarajar Port employs about 100 people and ChPT about 3,900. The utmost aim of the port is to safeguard employees interest. We will not transfer people from one port to another. KPL has outsourced some of its services. We will utilise them to tackle competition from private players,"" he said.

ChPT has capacity to handle 100 million tonnes of cargo, while KPL about 67 million tonnes. The latter has eight operational berths and a few are getting ready. Both the ports have deep draft of 18 metres.

Asked about the car exports, he said that they were the only ports to handle car exports from South. During 2019, KPL and ChPT handled over 3.50 lakh units and this was bound to increase with the commencement of exports by Kia Motors.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/chennai-port-acquires-majority-stake-in-kamarajar-port/article31186863.ece
362,2020/03/27,Tata Motors to turn passenger vehicles unit into a subsidiary,"Assets to be transferred; central functions to remain at TML

The board of Tata Motors Ltd. (TML) has given in-principle approval to turn the company’s Passenger Vehicle (PV) business (including electric vehicles) into a subsidiary by transferring relevant assets, intellectual property rights and employees directly related to the PV business, for it to be fully functional on a standalone basis through a slump sale.

However, certain shared services and central functions will be retained at TML to deliver cost efficiencies for the entire group.

The proposed transfer shall be implemented through a scheme of arrangement, which will be tabled for approval to the TML Board over the next few weeks.

One-year timeline

Implementation of the scheme will be subject to regulatory and statutory approvals as applicable, including approval of shareholders and creditors. “We expect the transfer process to be completed in the next one year,” TML said in a statement.

“The PV business landscape is seeing rapid transformation in the form of tightening emission norms, push towards electrification, enhanced disruptions from autonomous and connected technologies,” it said.

“Additionally, India continues to remain an attractive market for global OEMs, while the aspiration levels of the Indian consumer continue to rise requiring stepped up investments in contemporary products in a competitive market,” it added.

Over the last few years, the PV business has implemented a turnaround and launched a slew of products like Tiago, Tigor, Nexon, Hexa, Harrier, Altroz and Nexon EV.

The company said the move towards subsidiarisation of the PV business is the first step in securing mutually beneficial strategic alliances that provide access to products, architectures, powertrains, new-age technologies and capital.

Along with this move, TML has announced the appointment of Shailesh Chandra, president, EV and Corporate Strategy, as president, PV business, including EVs, with effect from April 1, 2020.

He will be assuming responsibility for the PV business from Mayank Pareek who will be superannuating from Tata Motors at the end of February 2021.

“Mr. Chandra’s appointment at the start of the new financial year gives him the opportunity to shape the organisation as we ready to operate as a subsidiary once the necessary approvals are in place,” the statement added.

363,2020/03/27,COVID-19: Cognizant announces additional 25% base pay to employees in India,"The move will apply to more than two-thirds of the workforce in India.

In light of the COVID-19 situation, IT firm Cognizant has announced an additional payment of 25% of the base pay for April, for employees up to the associate level, in India and the Philippines, its Chief Executive Officer Brian Humphries said in a note to employees.

This applies to more than two-thirds of the India workforce. Cognizant will review the approach monthly. The company has nearly 2,00,000 employees in India.

Cognizant has enabled work from home (WFH) for the majority of its offshore teams to ensure employee health and safety, and to maintain continuity of service for its clients, while safeguarding their data and protecting access to their systems, Mr. Humphries said.

The WFH measures include provisioning new laptops and encrypting desktops and moving them to associate homes, enabling the use of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), providing additional bandwidth connectivity and air cards — all with the appropriate client permissions and security protocols, he added.

364,2020/03/27,How can India contain the economic impact of COVID-19?,"The government must focus on health and livelihood issues at the same time

The COVID-19 pandemic has effectively brought normal life to a halt in India. The importance of social distancing and a lockdown in curbing the spread of the virus cannot be stressed enough, but these measures also have huge repercussions on livelihoods and the economy at large, which has already been seeing a slowdown over the past year. In a conversation moderated by Vikas Dhoot, Naushad Forbes and M. Govinda Rao talk of ways in which India can tackle this humanitarian and economic crisis. Edited excerpts:

Do you see a parallel in recent history to the situation we face globally due to the novel coronavirus?

Govinda Rao: This is the mother of all challenges in recent memory. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says that the 2008 financial crisis comes close, but I think this is much bigger than that. Possibly, one has to go to the times of the Great Depression. Even qualitatively, it’s a very different challenge, because first you have to save lives, then you have to save livelihoods, then you have to meet with other costs like loss of jobs and production, and supply chain disruptions. It’s not just confined to one sector or country; it encompasses the entire economy and the world. So, I think there is no immediate policy instrument that you can put in place because you don’t even know how long the problem will last. The depth of the problem that you are going to face is dependent on the length of the period for which you are going to close down and the extent to which the virus spreads.

Naushad Forbes: Every country is either already deeply affected or is at the start of being more affected. This is unprecedented in terms of its immediate impact on the lives of individuals from all walks of life. We have a few additional factors in India: an economy which relies very heavily on informal employment, so our reliance for people’s well-being on the broader economy performing and the markets performing is high, whatever role the state may try to play. And anything that you change in the functioning of the economy has unintended effects.

We sometimes have, I think, a tendency to act and then plan. I worry about that. For example, on Saturday, all manufacturing companies in Pune were told to shut down. On Sunday, all trains were stopped. And on Monday, all companies were told, ‘Look, you must keep supporting your staff and contract workers.’ Now, the sequence should have been the reverse: first, you work out which companies will ensure support for everyone across the board and how. Then you stop the trains so that you contain populations [moving]. And then you close the actual sources of employment. If you do it in the opposite sequence, you end up with what we saw on Saturday and Sunday, which is thousands of people crowding into train and bus stations, heading out of town, potentially spreading the virus across the country. This is obviously an unintended consequence. We sometimes act first without going into what we actually want to achieve. The way to achieve ‘social distancing’ is not to announce something which then brings suddenly crowds of people together in a panic [but] to do something for their own security, well-being and longer-term success. A little bit of thought before we act would really help.

Over the last few days, both the formal and informal sector have come to to a virtual halt. Lakhs of truckers are held up across States and most manufacturing firms have shut down. How will this impact our output and incomes?

Naushad Forbes: Everything’s come to a halt. The lockdown is the right thing to do for the country. From everything one reads, [we get the idea that] a lockdown is the way to ensure social distancing and contain the virus.

How do you then limit the economic impact and who do you need to buffer the impact for? Without question, it is the people who are most vulnerable, those who live from day to day and have no savings to fall back on. Then you look at medium to small companies with very limited staying power. The only way they can actually survive is by not paying people. You don’t want that to happen, otherwise you’d spread that distress in the economy. You need to address their concerns, either through moratoriums on principal and interest payments or direct salary support, as we’ve seen happen in the U.K., Switzerland and France, to ensure some employment is sustained. Then you need to extend it to larger labour-intensive companies if they employ 20,000 people and if they don’t have enough money to pay salaries next month we’re going to see something rather critical happen within a week.

Govinda Rao: One of the biggest problems in the system is the capacity of the state to deal with the problem. The reaction that we have is a knee-jerk reaction. Today, you cannot worry about issues such as fiscal deficit. You have to save people’s lives. There is a 21-day lockdown and redistribution is a major issue. Thankfully, you have a much better targeting device [Jan-Dhan accounts and Aadhaar] than before. Augmenting the state’s capacity... I don’t know how you’re going to do it.

At 8 p.m., the Prime Minister says we are closing down for 21 days, and everyone runs to the shops and panics. Couldn’t this have been done in a smoother way? One could have said essential supplies will be available — simply saying there’s a lakshman rekha outside your house, that really scares people.

The immediate issue is to focus on health, which we have never done, and see how you can establish the public health system. And the second is livelihood issues.

Regulatory compliance deadlines have been extended, but non-performing asset recognition norms remain 90 days (of defaults). Would you say this regulatory forbearance is sufficient?

Naushad Forbes: It’s a classic case of ‘necessary but not sufficient’. These are all the right things to do. You can have regulatory forbearance and extend regulatory forbearance for returns that have to be filed, but if there is some question on whether you will survive long enough to file your returns, then you need to address that.

If we start by recognising that we have very limited state capacity, then we can think about how to get the desired outcome with an assumption of limited state capacity. For example, I would like to see a massive publicity campaign on what social distancing means and why it’s important to do. Regardless of what announcement comes, people should know not to crowd outside a shop together.

And if my action in announcing something is going to prompt just this, let me first send out all the reassurances that grocery stores will be open. The government has said that, but if you read the actual notification, it doesn’t say how groceries will get to homes. There are some vague references to it being delivered. That sounds to me like a horrendous task to take on if state capacity is limited... delivering groceries to 1.3 billion people. Instead, rely on people going and doing the right thing. So, you say, ‘grocery stores are going to be open and here are the rules under which people can go and buy groceries. Grocery stores can decide for themselves if they wish to be open 24 hours. We will allow a maximum of so many people per square foot. We are counting on the grocery stores themselves to maintain this for their own health. We will encourage everyone not to go in a group.’ You can specify all of this ahead of time and reassure people that there’s going to be no issue.

There has been a lot of clamour for shutting down the stock markets.

Govinda Rao: A lot of things can now be done at home with online trading. To the extent that crowds can be avoided, it is important. But that doesn’t mean that you should shut down the stock market. It is a barometer... in the immediate context, it may not tell you what your economy’s doing if something is happening the world over. But you don’t kill the messenger, it gives you a message.

Three weeks from now, what would be the best-case scenario for us to be in?

Naushad Forbes: We should, by the way, do some scenario planning for what’s the best- and worst-case scenario and what’s in between. For those scenarios, we must have action plans in place that are transparent so people can prepare accordingly. The best-case scenario to me is that the three-week lockdown delivers. We shouldn’t expect the rising trend of cases to change for a minimum of 10 days before a successful lockdown can have an effect (because of the gestation of the virus). The best-case scenario is that 10 days from now, we start seeing a flattening of the growth rate. A few more days later, we see the curve starting to turn down. Then we can say the lockdown is working, now how do we start working towards recovery. We should put those plans in place now.

We will not go back to normal from day one, where everyone can do whatever they wished. Can all manufacturing start again? Does everyone show up at work all at once? If you have the curve pointing down sharply, maybe 50% can come back and we’ll see for another two or three weeks how that sustains. Shops can open again, but with limited operations and all the social distancing in place. You probably should not allow anything which involves mass gatherings of people even in the best-case scenario. So, you’re not going to have large conferences, movie theatres, sports stadiums. Those will come last. I really think there’s a lot of value in this plan being as transparent as possible.

Govinda Rao: The first thing that the government will have to do immediately is massively ramp up testing. We have not done enough testing as yet and do not know the magnitude of the problem. Even if you take the best-case scenario after three weeks, this will be different in different places. You may have to look at differential relaxations in a calibrated and transparent manner and say that areas with these trends can allow some of these activities. My own feeling is that after 21 days, there will be some areas where you can have economic activities without much movement, and restrictions will have to continue elsewhere. But we should be prepared for the long haul. Life is not going to be easy.

My big concern is about children not going to school. Some from well-off families may learn on the computer, but what about those children who cannot go to school, can’t play, or do anything. About 40% of the population is in the age group of zero to 14. We really have a crisis brewing there.

365,2020/03/27,Trump’s inadequate response,"After underplaying the COVID-19 threat for a while, the U.S. President then changed the narrative

On January 20, both South Korea and the U.S. reported their first case of the novel coronavirus. Two months later, while South Korea has largely contained the spread, the U.S. is grappling with an exponential increase in the number of cases. On March 26, with 69,197 cases, U.S surpassed Spain (49,515) to have the second highest case load outside mainland China. Now it is inching closer to Italy’s case load of 74,386. On the other hand, South Korea has reported 9,241 cases, six times fewer than the U.S.

A tale of two countries

The difference in availability of reliable testing kits in large numbers is mainly why there is such a striking difference in case load in these two countries. While South Korea approved the first coronavirus test on February 7, when there were just a few cases, the U.S. floundered. In early February, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed about 1,60,000 testing kits to labs across the country. However, only about 200 of them were used. In February, testing was stalled due to various problems. The narrow criteria for testing suspect cases also made it extremely difficult to identify the silent spread of the virus in the community. It was only on February 27 that CDC expanded the criteria allowing doctors to test hospitalised patients with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 as well as other vulnerable populations.

Watch | Your COVID-19 queries answered

When tests weren’t available and the testing criteria remained narrow, U.S. President Donald Trump did nothing to get the tests from the World Health Organization or allow companies to produce them. Instead, he lulled people into believing that the virus spread was under check. Unfortunately, the top priority for Mr. Trump does not seem to be public health but the stock market and his re-election prospects.

On January 22, when the WHO was meeting to decide if the SARS-CoV-19 outbreak was a ‘public health emergency of international concern’, Mr. Trump said in an interview, “We have it totally under control”. He reiterated this on several occasions. On March 9, when the number of cases in the U.S. crossed 500 and the number of deaths rose to 22, Mr. Trump tweeted that the SARS-CoV-2 “risk is low to the average American”. To make matters worse, he appointed Vice President Mike Pence to lead the U.S. response to the pandemic. This was despite Mr. Pence being responsible, as the Governor of Indiana, for the largest HIV outbreak in the state’s history. Worse, government health officials and scientists are required to seek Mr. Pence’s approval before speaking about the virus.

War on science

Mr. Trump has often waged a war on science. In the past, he has made false claims on evolution, called global warming a “total, and very expensive, hoax”, and stated that vaccines cause autism. However, he seems to have taken a U-turn now, urging pharma companies to come up with a vaccine quickly. “Do me a favour, speed it up, speed it up,” he said. In response, a strongly worded editorial in Science said: “Do us a favour, Mr. President. If you want something, start treating science and its principles with respect.”

Watch | What is contact tracing?

As the number of cases started climbing, Mr. Trump changed the narrative. First, he lashed out at the Democrats, calling the virus their “new hoax”. Then he blamed China and referred to SARS-CoV-2 as a “Chinese virus”. When the term angered Chinese officials and others, he defended it saying, “It’s not racist at all. It comes from China, that’s why.” Later he said he wished China “would have told us earlier”. But according to The Washington Post, U.S. intelligence agencies had raised concerns about the virus in January-February, but the President continued to downplay the risk and failed to act.

Mr. Trump is known for undermining scientists, institutions and the media. He shut down the White House National Security Council’s entire global health security unit in 2018, an error that is perhaps going to cost him dearly now. He can only sincerely hope that “one day, it’s like a miracle, it will disappear”.

366,2020/03/27,Of Chinese statistics and the Keqiang Index,"Is there reason to believe China is covering up new infections?

Evaluating the accuracy of official data is a challenge for journalists in every country. When that country is China, the problem is especially acute. Over my nine years reporting from there, figuring out how to use official numbers was a constant dilemma. Every three months, journalists would shuffle in to the State Council Information Office in Beijing for the quarter’s GDP numbers. The news wires would compete madly to be the first to file the figures. Having done so, reporters would later shrug that the numbers were probably massaged, but that was all we had to go by.

What may come as a surprise is that this view is widely shared by both the Chinese establishment and public. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang was quoted as saying in a WikiLeaks cable that GDP figures were “man-made”. He made these candid remarks in 2007 when he was a provincial leader. Rather than GDP numbers, Mr. Li turned to three more reliable indicators: electricity consumption, railway cargo volume and bank lending, now famously called the ‘Keqiang Index’. As the cable put it, “By looking at these three figures, Li said he can measure with relative accuracy the speed of economic growth. All other figures, especially GDP statistics, are ‘for reference only,’ he said smiling”.

Also read | COVID-19 and the great Chinese puzzle

Leaving aside sceptics who would insist even this approach is pointless because all Chinese data are “made up” (that’s neither entirely accurate nor an argument one can engage with), a more helpful question to ask is, how do you mitigate for the fudging?

Most of the fudging happens at the local level by politicians with an eye on furthering their careers. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in Beijing has been finding ways to use technology to bypass them.

Economists find it useful to assess indicators that officials have either less incentives or ability to fudge, which include freight volume and energy data. The general consensus is official data are actually getting more reliable in suggesting trends, even if actual figures are massaged. Consider, for instance, that on March 16 the NBS itself said industrial production shrank a record 13.5% in the first two months of the year with the COVID-19 shutdown, an estimate worse than most economists’ forecasts. This would have been unthinkable a decade or two ago.

I thought of the ‘Keqiang Index’ amid the questions surrounding China’s most recent COVID-19 numbers, with authorities saying for several days now the country had zero local infections — a claim that made headlines around the world, even if greeted by scepticism by many both outside and inside China.

Coronavirus | China to lift travel curbs on 50 million people in Hubei

Is there reason to believe China is covering up thousands of new infections every day? Let’s apply the Keqiang Index test, for instance, by looking at the number of medical workers still working in Wuhan, or the number of makeshift hospitals still functioning. On March 10, Wuhan closed the last of its 16 makeshift hospitals (which the authorities wouldn’t have done without good reason considering the stakes), while on March 18, 49 medical teams comprising 3,787 medical workers were sent home. More than 42,600 personnel had been parachuted into Wuhan during the peak of the crisis. Both indicators strongly suggest a trend of declining infections, even if the official numbers might be, to borrow a phrase, “for reference only”.",comment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/weefey/article31177518.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Huanggang,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/of-chinese-statistics-and-the-keqiang-index/article31175766.ece
367,2020/03/27,Safeguarding the vulnerable among us,"The effectiveness of our response will be judged by what we do to protect the weakest sections of our society

The human dimensions of the COVID-19 pandemic reach far beyond the critical health response. All aspects of our future will be affected — economic, social and developmental. Our response must be urgent, coordinated and on a global scale, and should immediately deliver help to those most in need.

From workplaces, to enterprises, to national and global economies, getting this right is predicated on social dialogue between government and those on the front line — the employers and workers, so that the 2020s don’t become a re-run of the 1930s.

Coronavirus | Lockdown forces migrant workers to walk to U.P. from Manesar

The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that as many as 25 million people could become unemployed, with a loss of workers’ income of as much as $3.4 trillion. However, it is already becoming clear that these numbers may underestimate the magnitude of the impact.

This pandemic has mercilessly exposed the deep fault lines in our labour markets. Enterprises of all sizes have already stopped operations, cut working hours and laid off staff. Many are teetering on the brink of collapse as shops and restaurants close, flights and hotel bookings are cancelled, and businesses shift to remote working. Often the first to lose their jobs are those whose employment was already precarious — sales clerks, waiters, kitchen staff, baggage handlers and cleaners.

Weak safety nets

In a world where only one in five people are eligible for unemployment benefits, lay-offs spell catastrophe for millions of families. Because paid sick leave is not available to many carers and delivery workers — those we all now rely on — they are often under pressure to continue working even if they are ill. In the developing world, piece-rate workers, day labourers and informal traders may be similarly pressured by the need to put food on the table. We will all suffer because of this. It will not only increase the spread of the virus but, in the longer-term, dramatically amplify cycles of poverty and inequality.

We have a chance to save millions of jobs and enterprises, if governments act decisively to ensure business continuity, prevent lay-offs and protect vulnerable workers. We should have no doubt that the decisions they take today will determine the health of our societies and economies for years to come.

Coronavirus | Lockdown hits NREGA workers hard

Unprecedented, expansionary fiscal and monetary policies are essential to prevent the current headlong downturn from becoming a prolonged recession. We must make sure that people have enough money in their pockets to make it to the end of the week — and the next. This means ensuring that enterprises — the source of income for millions of workers — can remain afloat during the sharp downturn and so are positioned to restart as soon as conditions allow. In particular, tailored measures will be needed for the most vulnerable workers, including the self-employed, part-time workers and those in temporary employment, who may not qualify for unemployment or health insurance and who are harder to reach.

Flattening the curve

As governments try to flatten the upward curve of infection, we need special measures to protect the millions of health and care workers (most of them women) who risk their own health for us every day. Truckers and seafarers, who deliver medical equipment and other essentials, must be adequately protected. Teleworking offers new opportunities for workers to keep working, and employers to continue their businesses through the crisis. However, workers must be able to negotiate these arrangements so that they retain balance with other responsibilities, such as caring for children, the sick or the elderly, and of course, themselves.

Coronavirus | Why 21-day lockdown period?

Many countries have already introduced unprecedented stimulus packages to protect their societies and economies and keep cash flowing to workers and businesses. To maximise the effectiveness of those measures, it is essential for governments to work with employers’ organisations and trade unions to come up with practical solutions, which keep people safe and to protect jobs.

These measures include income support, wage subsidies and temporary lay-off grants for those in more formal jobs, tax credits for the self-employed, and financial support for businesses.

But as well as strong domestic measures, decisive multilateral action must be a keystone of a global response to a global enemy.

Coronavirus | What is contact tracing?

In these most difficult of times, I recall a principle set out in the ILO’s Constitution: “Poverty anywhere remains a threat to prosperity everywhere.” It reminds us that, in years to come, the effectiveness of our response to this existential threat may be judged not just by the scale and speed of the cash injections, or whether the recovery curve is flat or steep, but by what we did for the most vulnerable among us.

The ₹1,70,000-crore relief package announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on March 26 — Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) — is a good first step towards alleviating the distress caused to vulnerable sections of the population by the 21-day lockdown imposed to combat the spread of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). What is noteworthy about the package is not the amount but the innovative ways in which the government is seeking to offer relief. It covers various sections of the vulnerable, ranging from farmers and women Jan Dhan account holders, to organised sector workers, to the most important of all — healthcare workers, who will now get a sizeable insurance cover of ₹50 lakh. The doubling of foodgrain allocation offered free is a good idea that privileges the hungry poor over rodents and pests devouring the stocks in Food Corporation of India godowns. So is the move to provide free cooking gas refills to the underprivileged who are part of the PM Ujjwala scheme. The offer to pay both employer and employee contributions to the Provident Fund for very small business enterprises is welcome and will offer relief to those businesses that have been forced to shut down operations, and also to employees earning small salaries for whom the PF deduction may hurt at this point in time. The salary limit could have been set higher at ₹25,000 per month — there’s no cash outgo for the government anyway because this is just a book entry transaction.

The effort appears to be to keep the funding within the budget as much as possible and retain control over the deficit. For instance, the PM Kisan transfer has been already budgeted for and the increase in MGNREGA wages can also be accommodated within the budget. Ditto with the Jan Dhan account transfer of ₹500 per month for the next three months which will cost the government ₹30,450 crore. It is possible to argue here that the transfer could have been a little more generous — at least ₹1,000 a month. The government may have wanted to stay within the budget for now. It could also be to preserve firepower, as there is no saying how long this uncertainty will last. But, at some point soon, the government will have to break the fiscal deficit shackles. Also, it needs the financial bandwidth to support businesses in trouble. In fact, ideally the government ought to have announced a relief package for the corporate sector and the middle class along with the PMGKY. It should now turn its focus towards businesses that are running out of cash and may soon default on even salaries and statutory commitments if relief is not given. There are enough ideas to borrow from others such as the U.S. which is in the process of finalising a $2 trillion package. Part II of the economic relief package should not be delayed beyond the next couple of days.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/standing-with-the-needy-the-hindu-editorial-on-indias-coronavirus-lockdown-package/article31176211.ece
369,2020/03/27,Terror unlimited: On Kabul gurdwara attack,"The IS attack is another reminder that there is no end to the Afghan violence in sight

The attack on a gurdwara in Kabul on March 25 that killed at least 25 people, mostly members of Afghanistan’s persecuted Sikh minority, is a barefaced attempt by the Islamic State (IS) to revive its fortunes in the country at a time when it is politically divided and the peace process is hamstrung by the Taliban’s continuing violence. The IS, which is concentrated in the eastern parts of Afghanistan, carried out several attacks in the past targeting the country’s minorities. But, in recent months, the jihadist group suffered setbacks in the wake of sustained military operations by both Afghan and U.S. troops. In some parts, the Taliban had also attacked the IS, as the insurgents, who are tribal Islamist nationalists, see the latter as a threat. But the war-torn country’s security situation is as fluid as ever. It now has two governments, one led by Ashraf Ghani, who was declared winner of the September presidential election, and the other by Abdullah Abdullah, who has disputed the results and formed a rival administration. The peace agreement reached between the Taliban and the U.S. failed to bring any halt to violence, with the insurgents and the government not being able to reach an understanding even on a prisoner swap. Besides, the country has also seen a jump in the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with the Herat Province, which shares a border with Iran, emerging as the epicentre. The attack couldn’t have come at a worse time.

Afghanistan is notorious for violence against its minority communities. The Hazara Shias were brutalised during the Taliban regime in 1996-2001. Most Hindus and Sikhs, once spread across the country in hundreds of thousands, have fled the country. With the resurgence of the Taliban and the fear of the insurgents taking over Kabul and undermining the Constitution, which at least in theory guarantees rights to all communities, the remaining minority groups are already in an abandoned state. By attacking the gurdwara and an adjacent housing complex, the IS has not just terrified the country’s minorities further, but sent a message to the Afghan authorities that it remains a potent security threat. Afghanistan has too many problems, ranging from terrorism to the breakdown of the administration, which demands absolute resolve from the government. But, unfortunately, the country’s political leadership appears to be concerned less about resolving any of them than about keeping power. The leadership should realise the magnitude of this crisis, and take a united approach to tackle it. It should kick-start the peace process with the Taliban, fight the IS cells more aggressively and work towards at least ensuring the minimum rights of its citizens guaranteed by the Constitution.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/terror-unlimited-the-hindu-editorial-on-kabul-gurdwara-attack/article31176289.ece
370,2020/03/27,No lathis to enforce lockdown: Police commissioner,"Follows severe criticism of police allegedly caning citizens on the streets

Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao, on Friday, directed the police to not carry lathis while enforcing the lockdown in the city. The direction came in the light of severe criticism by citizen groups and human rights activists of police allegedly caning citizens on the streets in an attempt to enforce the lockdown. The incident in Sanjay Nagar where the police were assaulted and a youth was shot at is also alleged to have emanated from caning by police.

“I have asked my men not to carry lathis. We will try to convince people not to come out. No force will be used. But people should also cooperate with the police and not come out on to the streets. We are trying this on a trial basis. I will take feedback in a day on its effectiveness. If it becomes an impediment in enforcing lockdown, which is our priority right now, we will be forced to review the situation,” Mr. Rao told The Hindu.

The Karnataka State Reserve Police and City Armed Reserve will be exempt from this, and they will carry lathis to enforce lockdown, but they will be deployed only under special circumstances.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/no-lathis-to-enforce-lockdown-police-commissioner/article31186291.ece
371,2020/03/27,No lockdown for them: Pharmacists at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19,"But without sanitisers and masks, and a low stock of common medicines, customers are being turned away

The neighbourhood pharmacy has become a lifeline for residents but more often than not they are being forced to turn away customers who are hoping to purchase face masks and hand sanitisers. Many pharmacists said that they are running low on even over-the-counter and common medicines and new supplies are not forthcoming yet due to supply-chain distortions.

“Contrary to popular perception, the industry has been severely hit - lack of supplies, loss of business, paucity of human resources, and the pandemic scare,” said one pharmacist, echoing the views of several others in the city. Another drug store owner said they were running out of medicines for diabetes and blood pressure.

Pharmacies are holding fort with whatever they have. Trying to remain safe from an unseen enemy - the COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 - is a major challenge. “It is an occupational hazard. It’s possible that customers who come to us may have a cold, fever or a cough, but we don’t know. Those working at the store are very vulnerable to getting infected. All of us are wearing masks but we fear it’s not enough,” said Bharat N., who runs a medical store in Rajajinagar.

Many pharmacists themselves have run out of sanitisers. “We use gloves and wash our hands regularly,” said Hussain Pasha, who works at a pharmacy in Vidyaranyapura.

Some of the pharmacy retail chains have opted to operate with minimal staff. A senior executive at a leading chain said they have asked half their staff to stay at home. “We are a workforce of over 200, but only a 100 employees are reporting to work. The rest have been given paid holiday.”

Lack of awareness remains a problem. Some reputed pharmacists have also been advising their staff not to sell medicines for cold, cough, fever, and diarrhoea without a doctor’s prescription. They argue that these are the symptoms of COVID-19 and taking over-the-counter medicines will suppress a fever. “What happens if a person takes a paracetamol and then leaves the house. The thermal body scanners may not catch the fever,” said one drug store owner.

One irate customer said: “I have been reading about staying at home, taking paracetamol, waiting for a couple of days, and then alerting the authorities. But these people aren’t selling me any.” A senior executive of a retail chain in the city admitted that there’s lack of awareness among citizens and pharmacists.

Meanwhile, there is a new crisis at hand - lunch and dinner that was earlier mostly taken care of by eateries in the locality. “Ever since the lockdown, we are cooking food at our home for all of us at the store,” said M.J. Ravindra Kumar, secretary, Bangalore City Chemists and Druggists Association. Most store owners are following suit.

Though all pharmacies are open for almost 18 hours a day, business has been severely hit. “At best, we get 30% of the usual business we do and in some cases even worse. Recently, a store that usually did business of around ₹20,000 a day did only ₹41 one particular day,” said Mr. Kumar.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/5pq7kg/article31185869.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGPHARMA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/no-lockdown-for-them-pharmacists-at-the-forefront-of-the-fight-against-covid-19/article31185870.ece
372,2020/03/27,‘Schools insisting on payment of fees will be issued show-cause notice’,"Officials respond after parents complain that they are being asked to pay fees by mid-April

A few private schools in Bengaluru are in the dock for allegedly asking parents to pay the fees by mid-April despite the Department of Primary and Secondary Education asking all schools to put off the admission process for the time being.

Several parents have written to the department complaining about a school affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education in Banashankari, which has given the deadline of April 15 to pay the fee of ₹2.5 lakh for 2020-21 academic year.

One of the complainants, in a letter to Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar, said: “We have observed in the media that the fee for the academic year 2020-21 should not be collected in the current situation. But we received a message/e-mail from the school asking us to pay the fee before April 15. Kindly look into the issue.”

Department of Public Instruction officials said they will issue show-cause notices to schools that are pressurising parents to pay the fees. “At this juncture, school managements cannot harass any parent,” said an official.

A father whose child has got admission in a school in Indiranagar said that they were asked to pay the fee by April 10. “The management has told us to pay ₹1.5 lakh in two instalments. They have stated that as the school is practising social distancing, parents can pay the fee online. But these are trying times, and we would like to save the money to manage our needs for the next month. We are hoping that the school management understands this and relaxes the order,” he said.

A parent of a class six child stated, “The lockdown has affected my business. Even though my business has stopped, I will have to pay my staff. I will not be able to pay the fees,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/schools-insisting-on-payment-of-fees-will-be-issued-show-cause-notice/article31185787.ece
373,2020/03/27,Fighting a virus with dedicated health cadre,"Never have we seen an epidemic on the scale of what the world witnessed in February 2020 beginning with China, and then, moving across the world. India has been witnessing epidemics and pandemics which are well-documented in past two centuries. But, are we prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic? With a dedicated public health cadre and infrastructure, Tamil Nadu is well-armed and prepared for the past 100 years. But, is this enough for what the future is about to bring?

Epidemics in Tamil Nadu

The history of Tamil Nadu public health practitioners handling epidemics and pandemics dates back to the era of small pox which killed millions in early 1900s, Plague in 1938 and 1995, Vibrio Cholerae in 1987 and 1992, Flu H1N1 in 1918, Leptospirosis in 1996 etc,. More than half of these outbreaks happened before antibiotics were discovered and millions of people were killed. This became better after the development of newer antibiotics, advanced diagnostics and infection prevention and control measures.

From what the experts have observed, very rarely does a disease turn out to be a pandemic in a short period of time — 3-4 weeks. It causes great human suffering in the form of morbidity, mortality and has a huge impact on nations with low resources — which may be poor data systems, inadequate healthcare professionals and low access to medicines and diagnostics.

China was able to stabilize and bring the epidemic to a halt by adapting the best methods of prevention and control — ‘cordoning’ and fast action in terms of adopting IPC strategies.

Swine flu epidemic, 2009

Roughly 10 years ago, in 2009, as a City Health Officer of Chennai, my team admitted nearly about 3,500 passengers from Chennai international airport, railway stations and inter-state bus terminals who were suffering from fever, cold and cough following the declaration of pandemic of H1N1by WHO. We identified and quarantined people with fever, cold and cough and who had travelled from the affected areas.

Subsequently, we did a contact tracing exercise to identify people and followed up with them for symptoms.

We observed them for 10 days. All our sanitary inspectors were instructed to do epidemiological investigations on all these patients with contact tracing and the contacts were brought to the hospital for symptoms and if required, investigations were done following treatment at Communicable Diseases Hospital (CDH).

Admitted suspects were given throat wash for use 5 times daily with warm saltwater followed by nutritious diet which included vegetable soup with pepper, ginger, garlic and coriander which was prepared in large quantities every day. They were put on mild antibiotics, antihistamines and mucolytic agents, followed by Tamiflu (branded drug), if they were positive along with Vitamin A therapeutic dosage. None of the quarantined patients went in for complications and there were nil deaths.

The same procedure was followed in 1992 and 1993 during outbreak of new cholera NON O139, that we named as MADRAS STRAIN, which became a pandemic affecting many countries. The Chennai city epidemic task force was developed under IAS officer R. Poornalingam with experts (physicians, public health personnel, microbiologists, environmental/water engineers) and a similar state task force was developed under the State Health Secretary.

Similarly, this unusual epidemic, which has spread around 186 countries, could be prevented and controlled in India through implementing and practising ‘personal distancing’ to prevent the spread of the strain. China and Germany, the countries seem to be successfully containing this disease with quarantining, testing a large number of symptomatics and vulnerable people, apart from physical distancing.

There is a need to move ahead swiftly, here:

India with second highest population needs to have one testing centre per district including all medical colleges (732 districts) and quarantine/treatment centres well established in all the 536 medical college hospitals and all private hospitals with more than 100 beds to test and treat for free as it is a pandemic preparedness strategy.

The vulnerable population, especially elders, diabetics, those with cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, people on chemotherapy, retro-viral drugs for HIV etc., have to be supported by our health system with an uninterrupted supply of drugs.

A large number of people in the informal sector will have to be protected by social security measures.

The Hospitals should be regulated with the stringent measures of practising Universal Work Precautions, control of nosocomial infections, strengthening barrier nursing procedures, establishing sufficient negative pressure rooms in all the hospitals and sufficient number of ventilators and required gadgets for critical care.

Tamil Nadu could set an example like China and Germany because we have a wonderful public health system in place, along with our past experiences in handling epidemics and with the support of the government determined to stop this epidemic from spreading.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/i8jen9/article31188236.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ExpertSpeakJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fighting-a-virus-with-dedicated-health-cadre/article31187437.ece

375,2020/03/27,Special prayers held in temples,"Some temples face an issue with availability of flowers

Major temples across the State have begun prayers, homams and chanting for the safety of people amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

At the Sri Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam, priests performed the Dhanvanthari homam along with parayanam and abhishekam at the Sri Dhanvanthari Sannidhi. They also performed navagraha shanthi.

“The prayers and homams are decisions of the individual temples. The priests decide and let the executive officer know, who then arranges for flowers and other requirements. Some temples are facing an issue with availability of flowers even for regular puja since they are not freely available in the market,” said an official in the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department.

Priests at the Meenakshi Amman temple in Madurai have been performing panchakaviya abhishekam to the idol of Sri Sundareswarar from Sunday.

The temple has been performing Mrithyunjaya japam and Indrakashi Siva kavasam parayanam every day during the uchikala abhishekam.

At Kapaleeswarar temple in Mylapore, the priests performed Mrithyunjaya homam and sarva samshobana shanthi homam with Kapaleeswarar moola manthram. The Odhuvamurthis chanted Neelakanta padhigam and Kolarupadhigam. The priests are performing Rudra parayanam daily.

“We will continue to ask the Odhuvamurthis to chant select padhigams for the welfare of all,” said an official at the Kapaleeswarar temple.

376,2020/03/27,HC holds special sitting despite lock down to hear cases related to COVID-19,"Despite a three-week lockdown, the Madras High Court on Friday held a special sitting to hear a batch of cases related to COVID-19. A Bench of Justices R. Subbiah and R. Pongiappan directed Additional Advocate General P.H. Arvindh Pandian to get instructions from the government officials concerned and adjourned all the cases by two weeks.

One of those cases had been filed by advocate S. Jimraj Milton who insisted upon constituting district-level and taluk-level disaster management committees, comprising local healthcare workers and social activists, for effective implementation of steps taken by the Centre and the State government to control the spread of the pandemic.

The litigant had also sought for a direction to use school and college hostels as well as marriage halls as isolation wards for quarantine and to provide sufficient number of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits to the doctors and paramedical staff involved in treating patients. He also insisted on distributing protective gear to the sanitary staff and policemen.

One of them had filed a public interest litigation petition seeking for a direction to the Centre and State to consider alternative medicines such as Siddha for curing COVID-19. Activist ‘Traffic’ K.R. Ramaswamy had also filed a PIL petition with a plea to lift the prohibitory orders promulgated under Section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

Claiming that the Prime Minister had no authority to order a nationwide lockdown, the activist contended that only the President ought to have declared a national emergency on the basis of advice tendered to him by council of ministers. However, the judges refused to entertain this case and said that it could be heard after the court begins to function regularly.

In the last two days, the number of persons under home quarantine has seen a massive increase.

From the 3,000 people who were home quarantined before the lockdown, the Chennai Corporation has now put nearly 24,000 in home quarantine, in the first two days itself.

“We have increased the number of people in home quarantine. The number has increased from 3,000 to 24,000. Doctors have been posted to monitor such persons in home quarantine,” said a senior official.

“We have also warned people that those who violate home quarantine norms would be taken to Corporation facilities. The police have also been directed to register FIRs against people who have violated home quarantine norms,” the official added.

The Corporation will also start distributing temporary passes for private suppliers of essential commodities and private personnel carrying out essential services in the city. The decision to issue passes for the personnel was taken after the police refused permission for several e-commerce workers to be on the move for delivery of essential services.

Officials of major e-commerce companies such as Amazon met senior officials on Friday to get passes for their workers who play a key role in the delivery of essential services.

“All 15 zonal offices in the city will start distributing passes for workers of e-comerce companies like Amazon. However, the number of passes will be restricted to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” said an official.

Many residents in various parts of the city have started relying on such personnel for the delivery of essential services, such as medicine, food and household items, after the civic body started taking stringent measures to contain COVID-19.

The Corporation has started disinfecting the city, spraying chemical solutions using vehicles and drones. According to estimates, over 25% of the city has been disinfected.

The Corporation is expected to complete disinfection operations in 18 lakh residential properties and six lakh commercial properties, in various parts of the city, in a few days.

The civic body will supply personal protective equipment for 900 more workers, in wards such as Royapuram, Tondiarpet, Thiru-Vi-Ka Nagar, Anna Nagar, Teynampet, Kodambakkam, Alandur and Valasaravakkam.

381,2020/03/27,COVID-19: Stay at home and reach out to the helpless,"Solve Ninja has created an online platform for citizens to feed in data that could be crucial in solving the problems certain people may be facing during the shutdown

While practising social distancing, one may have to be on the guard against getting distant from certain people’s struggles to have their essential needs met.

Solve Ninja, a platform by social enterprise Reap Benefit, has started an initiative that marries social caring to social distancing.

Through this programme, people can sit in the safety of their homes, and reach out to others by feeding in data that can be useful to them, even make a huge difference in their lives.

On http://nd.solveninja.org, citizens across India can feed in information about people who may have certain critical needs that they struggle to meet during the shutdown, and also those who are likely to volunteer to meet those needs. Citizens can key in information about hospitals, testing centres and essential services providers, and this information will be there for everyone to view and use. On this platform, citizens can mention stores selling essential items that practise social distancing, and also call out those that don’t.

Launched on March 26, the initiative already has citizens from Bengaluru, Chennai and Delhi feeding in data.

“We did a test run in Shanti Nagar in Bengaluru where we pointed out shops that were not practising social distancing; the local residents’ welfare association’s attention was drawn to this, and we asked them to talk to the store managers about this issue,” says Kuldeep Dantewadia, co-founder, Reap Benefit. “We are trying to rely on the power of local people and their relationship with neighbourhood stores to make sure social distancing happens everywhere,” says Dantewadia.

The same principle applies to mapping details of people who may need support in terms of food and other essentials. “When a resident or a member of an RWA feeds in details of a person in need that they know, the process of offering help becomes quicker,” he says.

Dantewadia believes such efforts by citizens can hugely supplement the government’s work to help the needy. He then adds, “ Citizens can be a small workforce on behalf of the government.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/iz7s36/article31183495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27dcstore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-stay-at-home-and-reach-out-to-the-helpless/article31183496.ece

A major fire broke out in an open ground belonging to a private company inside Gummidipoondi SIPCOT where furnace oil cans were stored on Friday afternoon. No one was injured.

According to Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services personnel, the open ground, spanning three acres, is located inside the SIPCOT complex. It belongs to a private company that supplies furnace oil to other industries.

“A large number of furnace oil cans are stored in this open area which has a compound wall around it. Around 12.20 p.m. we got a call and we reached the site in 10 minutes,” said S. Selvaraj, a fire officer.

A total of five fire tenders from Tiruvallur district were pressed into service and they started cooling the area. A foam-spraying vehicle also arrived from Ambattur and efforts are on to douse the flames.

383,2020/03/27,COVID-19: Chennai Corporation’s shelter residents pitch in to make masks for the homeless,"Over the last few days, residents of five women’s shelters have stitched 3,000 masks to be distributed to homeless persons in the city

To provide support to the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) in fighting COVID-19, residents of five women’s shelters run by the civic body, have started stitching cloth masks to be distributed amongst homeless persons.

There are a total of 51 night shelters run by the GCC in the city, and out of these, 8 are shelters for women. Among these, a few residents of five shelters, who were provided with training in tailoring, started stitching these masks few days ago.

In the last few days alone, a total of 3,000 masks were provided to the GCC. These will be distributed to close to 4,000 homeless persons and stranded persons who have been housed in the shelters and community halls in the city.

One of the shelters where masks are made is in Kamdar Nagar in Kodambakkam. Residents Shanti Agatha (38) and R. Manimekalai (28), both persons with disabilities, have been stitching the masks.

“We make 250 masks per day,” says Ms. Shanti, whose 16-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son also live with her. Ms. Manimekalai, who has finished her diploma in elementary education, is now staying in the shelter and is preparing for the Teachers Eligibility Test.

“I recently learned stitching and I am trying my best to help Ms. Shanti in making the masks. Though the numbers may be small, we are happy that we doing our bit in helping the society,” she said.

Asha Parek Nandini, city-level coordinator, Shelter for Urban Homeless, said that the idea to make residents of women’s shelters stitch masks was that of Madhusudhan Reddy, deputy commissioner, health, GCC. “If we get more sewing machines, we can make more masks,” she said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/8ifjjt/article31181899.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27MARTH--RESIDENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-chennai-corporations-shelter-residents-pitch-in-to-make-masks/article31181901.ece
384,2020/03/27,COVID-19: Chitlapakkam Rising volunteers help seniors get groceries and medicine,"Local police personnel laud efforts taken by the Group, and also ask them to stay safe

The true hallmark of civilisation is that you don’t make a dash for safety the moment storm clouds gather, but look around for others —the helpless, the ailing and the aged – that you may carry along with you to safety.

Chitlapakkam Rising, a residents group from Chitlapakkam that is sustained by the spirit of volunteering, is now watching out for such people in the locality who may do with some help.

With the novel Coronavirus causing so much disruption to routine life, volunteers of Chitlapakkam Rising are trying to ensure senior citizens are able to lead their lives without much disruption.

So, what does this work entail?

The Group has constituted a team of dedicated volunteers who are tasked with the job of helping the senior-citizens in the locality get their provisions, grocery items and medicine from the shops in the locality without any delay and difficulty. The Group says that while helping the seniors by shopping for these essentials on their behalf, the volunteers strictly follow the rules of social distancing and safety.

Sunil Jayaraman, founder-member, Chitlapakkam Rising, says, “We have given the numbers of volunteers to the members of residential welfare associations in the region, and they have circulated these numbers on the WhatsApp groups of their associations. We have also displayed these volunteer’s numbers on the Facebook page of Chitlapakkam Rising. Besides, we have collected the numbers of medical, provision, and fruits and vegetables shops, and asked the owners and the staff to home-deliver the groceries and the medicines when the need arises. Volunteers will coordinate this effort and make these calls to these entities, whenever the need arises.”

Jayaraman points out that taking note of the social work being carried out by Chitlapakkam Rising in the current situation, the police personnel of S12 Chitlapakkam Police Station have appreciated the the Group and the volunteers. Jayaraman adds that the police have said that though the volunteers are doing this commendable work for the welfare of the senior citizens in the community, they have to stay indoors as much as possible, and the police have also promised to help the group in this social work.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/szxbk0/article31181572.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27dcold1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-chitlapakkam-rising-volunteers-help-seniors-get-groceries-and-medicine/article31181573.ece
385,2020/03/27,Fire Rescue Service comes to the rescue of stray cattle and dogs,"Personnel of the Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services have begun feeding stray animals near their stations, with many bringing in food from home

True to its name, the Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services (TNFRS) has come to the rescue of stray dogs and cattle across the State. Director General of Police Sylendra Babu has requested personnel at all fire stations to feed stray animals that are struggling without food.

“By nature we are a rescue department, and in the last one year we have rescued close to 25,000 dogs and cattle. Hence I have asked all my personnel to provide food to the animals in their jurisdiction and this is a purely voluntary act. I have not compelled anyone,” said C. Sylendra Babu, DGP, TNFRS.

There are 349 TNFRS stations across the State and 42 in Chennai city alone. There are close to 8,000 personnel across the State and close to 1,000 in Chennai. “We will be placing water pots in all the stations and providing biscuits or some cooked food for the dogs,” he said.

Priya Ravichandran, joint director, Northern Region, TNFRS, said that usually personnel feed the dogs and cattle near their stations. “Now the compassion has increased as the animals cannot get food anywhere else. In many stations, personnel are cooking food and avoiding purchases from outside. So they give a portion to the animals,” she explained.

A TNFRS officer from Teynampet said that some of them have started bringing food specially for the dogs. “More than cows, there are many dogs that roam around the station. Many TNFRS personnel are also feeding homeless persons in their limits,” he said.

Ms. Priya added that apart from this the TNFRS is co-ordinating with the Greater Chennai Corporation to disinfect the city. “On Thursday, 30 of our vehicles were used,” she said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/9hnr66/article31181091.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27MARTH--Strayjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fire-rescue-service-comes-to-the-rescue-of-stray-cattle-and-dogs/article31181092.ece
386,2020/03/27,"Chennai’s hospitals make arrangements to transport staff, some face trouble","Some hospital authorities said the police did not allow some of their staff members to travel

Doctors, nurses and paramedics are essential service providers. Many government hospitals have arranged transportation to ensure their staff reach the hospitals during the lockdown, but there have been instances in which hospital workers were stopped by police across the city, as a result of which they were not able to get to work.

At one of the city hospitals, at least 50% of the staff that included laboratory technicians, conservancy workers and other hospital workers could not turn up for duty. “They were stopped by the police in several places. Though they displayed their ID cards, the police told some of them that there is no point in a lockdown if they move around like this. Our doctors and nurses were able to reach the hospital in the morning,” a senior doctor said. In the absence of many conservancy workers, the hospital had to make arrangements locally for cleaning measures, he added.

Another government hospital made arrangements to send its own vehicles to bring staff including conservancy workers. “The vehicles made two to three trips to bring them to the hospital as we had to follow physical distancing inside the vehicle too. We asked our doctors to carpool,” an authority said.

The Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital arranged for several to ply on four different routes to bring in their healthcare personnel. They had obtained special permission to transport their staff during the lockdown, officials said.

Another hospital authority said on the first day of the lockdown, the hospital’s office had issued letters mentioning that the staff were involved in management of coronavirus disease. “But the letters were not accepted by the police on the second day. So, we have issued letters for 15 days. We have also issued vehicle passes for all our staff including contract workers,” the authority added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/c7uvxb/article31188259.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THDISINFECTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennais-hospitals-make-arrangements-to-transport-staff-some-face-trouble/article31179852.ece
387,2020/03/27,"Tailors at government hospitals in T.N. come to the aid of healthcare workers, stitch cloth masks","Hospital authorities said disposable masks were available, but cloth ones could be used as an alternative

Many government hospitals have tailors to sew torn bedsheets or other hospital linen. In the wake of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), some of these hospitals have given the tailors another task -- to stitch cloth masks for hospital personnel, both as a stop-gap measure and as an alternative to disposable masks.

Though a senior doctor said cloth masks did not provide protection and have to be washed frequently, a cross-section of doctors in some of the hospitals, including those not directly involved in COVID-19 management, said the cloth masks came as an alternative as the disposable ones could be used when needed the most.

“The hospital tailor, who usually stitches torn linen or patients’ gowns, is now stitching cloth masks for all of us. We have asked our staff to wear the masks, wash and reuse them. Almost all government hospitals have tailors, and we are utilising their services at this time. The number of masks made each day depends as per the demands, and are being used by many including doctors and nurses,” a senior doctor of a hospital said.

He added that disposable masks were available, and these cloth masks were an alternative for all at the hospital.

At another hospital, authorities said they had asked the hospital’s tailor to stitch cloth masks 15 days ago. “Usually, the tailor mends torn curtains and pillow covers. We have adequate stock of disposable masks and are using them judiciously. While we have provided the required masks and personal protective equipment for those directly involved in COVID-19 management, and medical and paramedical staff in outpatient departments, IMCU and TAEI wards, those working in other places of the hospital such as offices are using the cloth masks,” an authority said.

Tailors were roped in to supply the required cloth masks at another hospital too. “We started to get the cloth required and stitch masks after realising the gravity of the situation. All our personnel wear these cloth masks. So far, we have got around 500 masks, and get about 60 to 100 per day,” a senior doctor said.

Another senior doctor of a city hospital said cloth masks were not protective and need to be frequently washed. “Wearing masks gives a wrong sense of security. We have asked all our staff to wash their hands with soap and water once in two or three hours, avoid touching their faces and maintain physical distancing,” she said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tailors-at-government-hospitals-come-to-the-aid-healthcare-workers-stitch-cloth-masks/article31179581.ece
388,2020/03/27,COVID-19: Is your trip to the in-house grocery store paved with safety measures?,"Gated communities have customised solutions for promoting social distancing and minimising points of contact while residents go shopping for essentials

Even where whole populations are holed up in their burrows, following lockdown rules to a T, people may still have to surface now and then for “life-sustainers” – in plain terms, those beans and beets and a caboodle of other things generically called “food items”.

As much of humanity would agree, the trip to the grocer’s, which happened without nary a thought only a couple of weeks ago, is now fraught with nerve-racking anxiety.

So, if the grocer’s is located inside one’s gates, that is one worry less to deal with. Fortunately, many gated communities do come fitted with a grocery store. However, this advantage would amount to just a hill of shrivelled-up beans if precautions are not taken for people to be safe from each other while shopping at the in-house grocery store.

And gated communities seem to be coming up with varying plans, primarily factoring in the size of the store, and the space available right outside. Some of them are putting a number and a dab of paint to social distancing.

Marked spaces

Here is one example of what is beginning to be followed by a good number of gated communities. At the 297-unit Arihant Frangipani, a gated community at Pudupakkam in the Old Mahabalipuram Road region, there is no room for speculation about how much space is a good space to maintain.

With walking and waiting points marked in paint, people are shown their place, as they head to the grocer’s.

“It is a small-sized grocery store, roughly measuring 300 sq.ft. So, only one shopper is allowed inside at any given time. Others have to wait outside, keeping their distance from each other. We have clearly marked the distances to be maintained while heading into and out of the store, as well as waiting outside. The pathways leading and leading out of the store are clearly delineated. This way, we can ensure that following this process becomes second nature to them. Only one person per household can show up at the grocery store,” says Vivek, committee member, Arihant Frangipani Residents Welfare Association.

(On a tangent, it is heartening that a few grocery stores in neighbouhoods also mark designated points where people should stand while waiting for their turn to make their purchases. Even the Koyambedu market has such markers – but how many visitors there follow this safety stricture is a moot point)

Waiting comfort

At House of Hiranandani Upscale, a humongous 10-tower community in Egattur, the store is much bigger than the one at Arihant Frangipani, and the community brings its own customisation plan to grocery-shopping.

“We ask residents, only one person per household, to arrive at the store in their cars. They would be in their cars while waiting for their turn to enter the store. The store is quite big, and there are six rows of racks. Inspite of the space we allow only four people to shop inside the store. The checkout counters have been reduced from four to two, and so, the staff manning the counters now have a distance of more-than-one-metre between them. This idea of waiting outside in the car has worked well, as people don’t get edgy if the wait is longer, as they usually listen to some music on their car music system,” says Raghavan Murti, president, Union of Tower Association at House of Hiranandani Upscale.

Kochar Panchsheel, a 430-unit gated community in Ambattur, has minimised the grocery-shopping time at the in-house store.

Ordering in advance

“The arrangement is such residents have to place orders a day ahead and next day they can come and collect the grocery from the shops. The list of requirements along with the door number is conveyed through an online platform to the shop. Shoppers are let in by turns, and at any given time, only three shoppers can be inside the shop. The maximum number of people that can wait outside the shop is 10, and they have to keep their distance,” says Santosh Abraham, secretary, Kochar Panchsheel Apartments Owners Association.

Reducing points of contact

Shankar Saravanan, the shopkeeper at Kochar Panchsheel, says there is a plan to place the items ordered by every household in a separate tray and place it in front of the store, so that they can leave the area at the shortest time possible.

“As there is fear about handling currency, as it changes hands, we are planning to make the mode of payment largely online,” adds Shankar.

“At the store in our community, 99 percent of the shoppers use their cards to effect transactions. They handle the cards themselves and don’t hand it over to the staff at the checkout counters,” explains Raghavan.

389,2020/03/27,COVID-19 | Will it be polite with children?,"With the looming threat of the COVID 19 pandemic, paediatricians have been getting frequent queries from parents on the risk of their children getting this new viral infection which is threatening the entire world.

In the coming days, we can expect large number of children to be brought to clinics and hospitals for trivial and major symptoms alike because the fear of unknown diseases is obviously even higher for children.

In the first largest series of cases reported from China, only one child aged 15 years was treated, indicating that there could be a children-sparing pattern in this infection.

In 2003, during the SARS epidemic in Hongkong, among over 1,700 infected individuals, 6.9% were under 18 years of age with a case fatality rate of 0%. Similarly, when the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) spread in 2012, also caused by corona virus, only 2% of cases occurred in children.

Coming to the hottest topic, worldwide data suggests that the paediatric population, even in this very-high risk area, appears to be at an unexpectedly low risk to develop COVID 19 infection. It is unclear why this may happen.

Reports from China suggest that infection of children is possible, although apparently extremely rare.

One possible reason is that children have fewer outdoor activities and undertake less international travel, making them less likely to contract the virus.

Are children cross-protected by having met other Coronaviruses? Coronaviruses (CoVs) is one of the common viruses that invade the lungs as rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza, which all have an RNA genome and are very frequent in children. Innate immune evasion links to the innate immune responses elicited by respiratory and other (RNA) viruses. One explanation could be that pneumonia results from virus-induced immune response causing destruction of pulmonary tissue. Such mechanisms could be less effective in children.

The good news so far is that children are apparently at a minimal risk to develop this new disease, and at virtually no risk of a fatal course.

Are children going to have different symptoms and signs in this dreaded disease?

Most infected children have mild clinical manifestations. They have no fever or symptoms of pneumonia with a good outcome. Most of them recover within 1–2 weeks after disease onset. Few may progress to lower respiratory infections.

Children with infection can fall into any of the following 4 categories:

1.Asymptomatic Infection 2. Acute Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 3. Mild Pneumonia 4. Severe Pneumonia

William Osler said “The only way to treat the common cold is with contempt.” Ogden Nash defined Family as a “Unit composed not only of children but also of men, women, an occasional animal and the common cold.” Most children in our country and across the world are going to get this Common Cold due to COVID 19 for sure as the pandemic looks unstoppable.

However, we need to remember a few scientific facts in this scenario. Even the most experienced paediatrician cannot distinguish COVID 19 infection from other viral respiratory infections with confidence. Only virus testing will confirm or exclude the diagnosis. Treatment as of today is mainly supportive and symptomatic in the majority of children. A wide variety of drugs is being tried in desperation in critically ill without hard evidence. Vaccine is not yet a reality.

Children may play a major role in community-based viral transmission since quite a few of those infected may be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. However, we need to remember that children with chronic diseases, malnutrition, immunodeficiencies may suffer from serious consequences of this seemingly benign viral infection in children.

Balanced diet, oral health, adequate exercise, regular rest, avoiding excessive fatigue, and boosting immunity are the powerful measures to preventing infection, as well as maintaining emotional stability and mental health.

It is necessary to stress that there is a need to practise appropriate hand hygiene and cough hygiene practices meticulously than ever before.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/xi9miz/article31177170.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Balasubramanianjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-will-it-be-polite-with-children/article31177130.ece
390,2020/03/27,Devising a people-centric response to COVID-19,"We urgently need an economic stimulus to protect livelihoods in the period of lockdown

India is at an extremely critical stage in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. A lockdown was inevitable. About 21 States, including Kerala, had already announced lockdowns of various durations before the Prime Minister’s announcement. It is important that we stand united in facing this grave crisis.

As we make our way through the lockdown, the State has major responsibilities. It must take a leadership role in enforcing the lockdown while upholding the rights and dignity of people, it must educate the citizens on the dos and don’ts of rules to follow, and it must take all sections of society with it.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed cases in India

The health machinery has to work round the clock. At the same time, it is imperative that citizens shoulder their responsibilities and follow the rules of the lockdown strictly and diligently. Each life is precious, and any drop in our guard can quickly raise the number of the infected, thereby undermining the gains achieved.

The lockdown period should be used by the Centre to not just break the infection chain, but to isolate the infected from the general population and treat those who require it with varying degrees of hospitalisation, including intensive care. I welcome the announcement of the Prime Minister to set aside ₹15,000 crore for emergencies. However, we need clarity on how this money will be spent and on how States will be helped by the Centre in the expansion of health infrastructure.

Working together on Health

The Union Government has made some important announcements on March 26. While I welcome the relief package, I also urge that it be expanded in the coming days.

While we must build up national-level preparedness, we must also remember that health is a State subject, and that State governments are an integral part of the governance of the nation. Fiscal federalism, decentralised governance and flexibility to the States to meet their particular needs and requirements should be a part of the fight against the virus, including coping with the lockdown and the economic recovery to follow. The Central government should create consultative bodies consisting of Union and State Ministers to identify bottlenecks and assess progress. My colleagues in different States are taking different initiatives. We may all have something to learn from each other.

Coronavirus | Lockdown forces migrant workers to walk from Manesar to home in Uttar Pradesh

In Kerala, we are making the utmost efforts to ensure that the supply of essential commodities, particularly food and medicines, is maintained and that the vulnerable sections of society are specifically protected. As soon as the Kerala government closed pre-schools and schools on March 10, our Women and Child Development Department made available, without missing a day’s allotment, the mandated quantities of rice, pulses, broken wheat/semolina, peanuts, jaggery, oil to all pre-school children in each anganwadi centre. It also took steps to distribute ‘Take Home Ration’ for pregnant/lactating mothers and children aged six months to three years. We undertook this intervention for 33,115 centres, and we were able to protect the nutritional needs of close to 8.3 lakh children. In some anganwadis, vegetables and eggs were also distributed. We are happy to note that the Supreme Court of India expressed appreciation for our efforts in this regard.

The Kerala approach

Kerala will ensure availability of essential goods and services, and our government will not permit a single person to starve during the lockdown. We have energised our Public Distribution System (PDS) to ensure that all households that do not figure in the priority list get 15 kg of free food supplies for a month. This is in addition to the allocation of 35 kg per household for those in the priority category. We also plan to distribute food kits, with basic grocery items and vegetables. To the deserving people now in quarantine, the government is already distributing such kits. Home delivery is being arranged to avoid crowding of people in PDS outlets and grocery shops. We plan to engage our local bodies to lead this effort at the ground level. Further, nutritious meal plates at ₹20 per plate are being served through 1,000 canteens of the State government.

Our Industries Department directed its public sector enterprises (PSEs) to raise the production and supply of hand sanitiser bottles; they immediately responded by producing an additional one lakh bottles per day. The Kerala State Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a PSE, has been provided with ₹25 crore to ensure adequate supply of medicines required for COVID-19 treatment. Inmates of our prisons, self-help groups under the government’s Kudumbashree Mission, and enterprises operating from our rubber parks were mobilised to increase the production of N95, triple layer and double layer face masks as well as surgical gloves. Our Khadi PSEs have been asked to supply adequate number of bed sheets and towels for disposable use in the hospitals. We have asked Internet Service Providers in the State to increase their network capacity by 30% to 40% to ensure that people can work from home.

While we enforce the lockdown in all its seriousness, we should not lose sight of the other major challenge in front of us. India has a high share of poor in its population, most of whom suffer from multiple economic and social deprivations. They earn their livelihoods from the informal and unorganised sectors, where there is neither job security nor continuity of income flows. Their livelihoods have to be protected through the lockdown period.

Economic package

This is where the Kerala government has taken an initiative and come forward to announce a ₹20,000 crore economic revival package. We have a borrowing capacity of about ₹25,000 crore during the financial year 2020-21. We have requested the Central government to allow us to borrow half of this debt (about ₹12,500 crore) in April 2020 itself. This will be a major source of the ₹20,000 crore package the government has announced. This frontloading should not mean less expenditure later in the year. So, we are also requesting the Central government to provide us with flexibility under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act. We are hoping that the Centre will permit this.

Our economic package of ₹20,000 crore will be spent roughly as follows. Two months of welfare pensions will be paid in advance to the pension beneficiaries. For those not eligible for welfare pensions, ₹1,320 crore has been set aside for providing an assistance of ₹1,000 per family from the BPL and Antyodaya sections. Another ₹100 crore has been set aside for providing free food grains to families in need, while ₹50 crore has been set aside for the provision of subsidised meals at ₹20 per meal. Around ₹500 crore has been set aside for a comprehensive health package, where focus will be on improving public health infrastructure and equipping the State to face such epidemics. Loans worth ₹2,000 crore will be distributed through the Kudumbashree Mission. ₹2,000 crore has been set aside for the expansion of the employment guarantee programme. Further, around ₹14,000 crore has been set aside to clear all the arrears of the State government till April 2020.

Passenger vehicles have also been given tax relief. Autos and taxis have been given relaxation on payment of fitness charges. There is relaxation in the deadlines of water and electricity bill payment for affected firms. Entertainment taxes for cinema halls have been reduced.

Let this be the period in which we end fiscal conservatism. Extraordinary times require extraordinary action. The strict rules of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act should be set aside. We urgently need an economic stimulus to protect the people and livelihoods in the period of lockdown.

Today the world must stand together in the battle for the safety and well being of humanity. We must draw strength and lessons from global and national experiences even as we redouble our efforts in building a people-centric response to the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic.

While the Centre deserves praise for unveiling a slew of measures to prevent the COVID-19 outbreak in India from escalating to alarming levels, there are some critical gaps in healthcare infrastructure which need to be plugged (Editorial, “A long road,” March 26). If the overwhelming response to the ‘janata curfew’ was any indication, the citizens can easily surmount the present health crisis. However, while making people stay home-bound, there should be no disruption in supply of essential commodities. More importantly, the police should not go overboard while enforcing the rules but act with great restraint in dealing with delivery workers and health volunteers while they are on their routine move.

Mental health concerns

At a time when people have been advised to stay at home and practise social distancing as part of measures to combat the spread of the virus, concerns about the toll such an unprecedented lockdown would take on mental health of people at large are real and cannot be taken in a lighter vein. There is proven scientific evidence pointing to the inextricable link between prolonged periods of social isolation and high levels of depression. While practising social distancing, we also need to cultivate a sense of togetherness. The mental and emotional toll caused by the virus is as much a threat to public health as the virus itself.

Uncertainty and danger

No dramatic event in recent history has affected us as profoundly and pervasively as the COVID-19 pandemic has done. It has turned the entire world topsy-turvy, thrown daily routines out of gear, wreaked havoc on plans, and left a serious concern on financial markets and the economy the world over. The pandemic has affected our psyche in multiple ways and influenced how we think. The combination of uncertainty and danger is a recipe for severe angst.

R. Sivakumar,

Chennai

The pandemic’s destructive potential will shake the foundations of India’s social and economic edifices. It required a Marshall Plan to reconstruct the shattered economies of the Second World War-hit European countries. The government will have to unveil a similar project. The redundancy of self-imposed spending limits is palpable. The crisis has exposed the perils of underfunding the public health infrastructure. One hopes the health emergency’s bitter lessons translate into responsible policymaking. A strong economy with a weak social capital cannot build an equitable society.

The visual stories to be shared for the next 21 days will revolve around three major themes.

The first will be what heritage rice actually is — What have you tried? Is it healthy? Is it easy to cook? Is it tasty? Why should one opt for heritage rice, over the polished hybrid variant?

The second will be mindful living — Where does your food come from? Have you been to a farm? Do you know a farmer? What are the native varieties of crops? Is organic really helpful for the soil?

The third will be immunity building foods — What are the colours on my plate? Is more colour healthier? Can rice build immunity? How much rice should I have for each meal? What can I make with the rice water?

“The recipe has to be something simple, nothing too fancy. We believe these stories will encourage conversation in so many homes,” Jayathi says, adding “Change may not come right away, but these conversations will certainly strike a chord. Once people are aware of what they are buying, where they buy, what they eat and how they live — they will evolve from mere consumers to contributors to society.”

As many families are spending meal time together, there is surge of interest in cooking healthy meals. At this time, Jayanthi says they hope to introduce people to native varieties of rice, which are not just healthier, but also better for the planet. “At our 50-acre agricultural land in Manjakudi, near Tanjore, we cultivate close to 40 differnt varieties of heritage rice, and are constantly striving to revive more varieties,” she says.

Wide range

When it comes to heritage rice, each variety has a unique taste, aroma and property. Fragrant ones include gobindobhog, ajara ghansal, katarni, sukhdas and also iluppaipoo champa. From the farming perspective, rice varieties can be classified into kuruvai (short duration crop, 60 to 90 days) and champa (long duration crop, 120 to 130 days).

“We have certain rice varieties that are best suited for making idli and dosa — garudan champa, poongar, kullakar, iluppaipoo champa, thooyamalli and navara. For preparing traditional snacks like murukku and thattai, we recommend thooyamalli, perungar or ramakali rice. This is the best season to make vathal and vadams, and for that thengapoo champa is best suited,” Jayathi says.

She adds, “This activity is for people to understand that simple changes in lifestyle can bring about much bigger changes too. We think this is the time when people are going to think about life and reflect on their choices, and hopefully make better decisions at the end of the 21 days.”

393,2020/03/27,Ordering in from South Delhi’s Irfan Bhai,"Irfan Bhai is a cloud kitchen that delivers Lucknavi food in South Delhi, through Zomato. It has robust flavours for non-vegetarians and vegetarians too, but the shami kababs are the best ever

The time has come to reclaim the word Bhai. I remember those days when it was such a term of affection. But Bollywood — and those underworld gangsters — went and spoiled it all. For me, though, Bhai continues to a much-used and much-loved word.

And that explains why I was elated when I got a call from an outlet called Irfan Bhai. This is a place that does home delivery – which is something that we are in great need of in these days of a complete lockdown. It is run by Cross Border Kitchen, which describes itself as a “multi-brand, multi-kitchen, multi-format, internet-driven food and beverage company”. I was happy to have met Irfan Bhai. The food is Lucknavi, and the dishes are mostly cooked with whole spices. The menu includes all kinds of qormas, biryanis and kababs (though there are some good vegetable dishes, too). For my dinner the other day, I had Badshahi Qorma (₹ 475), Khichda (₹ 365), Shami Kabab (₹ 325), Bhindi ka Salan (₹ 225), Malai Kofta (₹ 365), and Taftan Roti (₹S 70) I love khichda — a delicious mix of grains and meat. Actually, I am very fond of the combination of these two ingredients. Haleem, for instance, is one of my favourite dishes, and I love dalcha, a mix of pulses and meat. This khichda was superb — thick and tasty. The grains had soaked in the flavours of the meat. It had been slow cooked with whole spices and then garnished with fried onions and mint. The Badshahi qorma was nice, as it wasn’t as spicy as the Delhi Qorma, and the gravy was not very thick.

The two vegetarian dishes, surprisingly, were excellent. The okra in the Bhindi ka Salan was in a tangy onion-tomato sauce. The cottage cheese dumplings in the Malai Kofta were soft, and the gravy had been cooked with tomatoes, green chillies, coriander and ginger, and tempered with turmeric and fenugreek. I had it with the taftan roti — traditionally prepared with flour, milk, yoghurt, a pinch of sugar, and eggs.

The shami kabab, however, was not the best I have had. The meat didn’t have the right balance of spices and was a bit too dry.

What I liked about the dishes was that the flavours were well rounded and nothing was overdone. Qormas can really be in your face, and this wasn’t the case with Irfan Bhai’s fare.

The menu includes dishes such as Handi Kofta (meat dumplings in a yoghurt-based gravy), Murgh Stew (chicken slow cooked with peppercorn and onions) and rogan josh. The vegetarian section includes Aloo Salan (with baby potatoes), Moong Mughlai (dal cooked with dill leaves, ginger, and green chillies, tempered with white cumin seeds), and Sabz Bukhari – biryani cooked on dum and served with fried baby potatoes.

Irfan Bhai’s base kitchen is near Vasant Kunj (Ph: 9873333058). It is open on weekdays from 11 am to 12midnight, and on weekends from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. To check what’s on offer, log on to Irfanbhai.com, and order over Zomato.

“Umda laga?” the website asks. Jee, huzoor. Or should that be Haan, Bhaijaan?

394,2020/03/27,"Beijing Bites in Bengaluru provides free boxes of rice, dal and vegetables for those in need","The initiative began at the Richmond Town branch on March 23

Beijing Bites, the restaurant chain known for Chinese and Thai cuisine, is now providing single-person servings of cooked rice, dal and vegetables for those in need during the mandatory lock-down to combat COVID-19. The initiative began at the Richmond Town branch on March 23, before the 21-day nationwide-lock-down came into effect.

Apart from handing out boxes of food, the eight branches are also delivering to those in need (with no cap on the number of boxes one can order), across the city.

Says Mohammed Ibrahim Akram, one of the directors of Beijing Bites, “There are people who can cook in their houses but don’t have ration and there are also those who don’t have anything. Daily wage workers are out of jobs right now. We started by distributing single-person servings of cooked food. I am in Richmond Road and have people calling me from BTM Layout, Nelamangala and so on.

“As for delivery, I am not looking at only specific areas nor can I differentiate as to who should get the food and who shouldn’t. I cannot even count the number of calls I have got for food; it has to be at least 1,000 in a day. In fact, after the nationwide lock-down came into effect, we delivered about 1,500 boxes on one day (with around 900 boxes delivered from the Richmond Road branch).”

Stating that the police is supporting the initiative, he says: “My staff is working more; most of them are here. Some friends provided us with gloves, masks and sanitisers. We are willing to accommodate more people if they can help us. Of course, not in large numbers. We are all human and we are getting tired. Now, my staff is also worried about coronavirus so I am looking for a doctor to talk to them.”

Adding that they are trying to keep the initiative going till March 31 (they have calculated that their stocks will last till then), Mohammed says, “It is inhuman to see so many go hungry. We are selfish; we want to do this for our good sleep.”

Message the following numbers with your name and address if you want to order a food box. Pick-up is also available. Richmond Town (9844014431); Frazer Town (7411602761); BEL Road/Malleswaram (9886277646); RT Nagar (9686529653) and Kaggadaspura (9972246871).",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/xe70lv/article31180143.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27bgmbejingbites,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/beijing-bites-on-a-mission-to-provide-free-boxes-of-rice-dal-and-vegetables/article31180144.ece
395,2020/03/27,Celebrating the kitchen garden during the COVID-19 lockdown,"As the country rations their ingredient inventory during the Coronavirus pandemic, we observe a renewed appreciation for kitchen gardens

The day drags on as Arundati Rao ponders what to do to fill the dull time of lockdown. The homebaker in Kondapur, Hyderabad, decides to bake foccacia. As she powers through the recipe, kneading the dough and chopping garlic, she realises she needs some basil. Rather than risking a grocery run, she simply reaches over to her kitchen garden and grabs a few tender leaves.

Many of us know full well that a final sprinkle of green garnishes can make a dish complete. Many people across the country find themselves hunting for such herbs during the ongoing Coronavirus lockdown. Caused by panic-buying and stockpiling, there is a scarcity in the greens which are so crucial to Indian cuisines, despite diligent efforts of supermarkets to keep their shelves stocked. Plus, e-commerce platforms such as BigBasket or Amazon Pantry are facing restrictions with their movements for deliveries.

That said, the kitchen garden has never been more valuable. Often separate from the ornamental garden, a kitchen garden comprises fruit, vegetables, greens and microgreens, and in India, we often see them on balconies, window sills, terraces or even inside a room. In the case of the lockdown, it boosts your household’s access to fresh food while keeping you at home. Before you run outside to procure seeds and gardening inventory, we share advice and important information from experts in the industry as well as people who have long nurtured their kitchen gardens.

Arundati is no stranger to kitchen gardens. Having had her kitchen garden off and on for about 10 years, she currently has two kinds of beans, sweet potato, lots of herbs, green onion, garlic shoots, three kinds of tomatoes, ridge gourd, bottle gourd, chillies and brinjal. She uses these in her day-to-day cooking and, during the lockdown, she finds herself able to plan her quotidian meals as before.

In Sainikpuri, Hyderabad, Ravi Krishnamachary is two years into his kitchen garden. He was inspired by Hyderabad’s All India Horticulture expo advocating terrace gardens and, having retired recently, he was in search of a productive hobby. Now he grows colocasia, curry leaves and tomatoes among other things. “We are too affected by the lockdown, food wise, because we eat what we grow. Our routine in that regard has not changed. It really does well for the long run to have a kitchen garden. You become prepared for anything.”

Carrots from Sujatha Ravi’s terrace garden in Besant Nagar, Chennai

Sixty-year-old Sujatha Ravi in Besant Nagar, Chennai, says she is not rushing to the vegetable market for fresh produce; she just has to source it all from her terrace garden which is filled with various keerai, lady’s fingers, pomegranates, papayas, strawberries and more. “I’ve had my kitchen garden for four and half years. After the lockdown is over, I want to start growing microgreens. I completely cook in one-pot-one-shot, a method which doesn’t kill the vegetable. It retains the colour and nutrition, and motivates you to grow more. At the markets, they segregate it with their feet so you have to wash them well. So that is another reason to maintain your own kitchen garden.”

Alladi Mahadevan, the founder of TheOrganicFarm.in, says one does not need to look beyond their home for a gardening kit. For 25 years, Alladi's organisation has advocated urban farming across Tamil Nadu and, he says he is available for remote assistance during lockdown. “The average Indian household has about 83 food items and about 20 of those can be used to procure seeds. Make sure you can access good soil and patience. Plan your calendar and use as much as possible.” Alladi recommends growing greens as a priority, as well as pulses and legumes, as they are packed with nutrients. Also, to speed up germination, one can soak methi seeds overnight and crush coriander seeds before sowing.

At the moment, Instagram, YouTube and Facebook are brimming with kitchen gardening tips and tricks. A set of them, posted to Instagram on March 26, comes from Hyderabad startup HomeCrop which helps people engineer their own kitchen gardens. Co-founder Manvitha Reddy agrees that this is the time for home farming to shine, adding, “In the 1990s, when Cuba was in a lockdown, they had to resort to community farming. They eventually became quite self-sufficient. Similarly here, the skill for such farming methods must be appreciated, even if on a hobby level.”

A case for microgreens

Of course, while the lockdown has restricted their services to some extent, Manvitha says they are offering virtual and remote assistance to customers. “In the lockdown, I think we can focus on microgreens which boost immunity, have high nutritional value and are easy and quick to grow.” Essentially seedlings of edible vegetables and herbs, microgreens are harvested just after the cotyledon leaves have developed. They are deemed as both a superfood and a functional food. Powerhouse microgreens include pea shoots, wheatgrass, radish sprouts and sunflower shoots.

Arundati adds that, if these are available at home, one should start with fresh well-aerated soil and then mix in coco peat and Vermicompost. “Remember not to over water your pots. A lot of times we kill our plants by over-watering that leads to root rot.” Ravi is also an advocate for coco peat for its water retention properties.

Both Manvitha and Arundati say that one need not even leave their home to get seeds. “Seeds such as those of coriander, mustard and methi are already in your kitchen. You can also repurpose cartons from past deliveries or plastic water bottles in which to grow these,” says Manvitha.

Arundati comments that the versatility and sustainability of these greens are impressive and worth the effort. “Mustard greens can be cooked or eaten in salads, the flavour is similar to Arugula lettuce. Methi is so easy to grow and the small leaves can be harvested in about 7 to 10 days... Crush whole coriander before sowing for fresh coriander leaves from your window sill. Sprouted onions and garlic bulbs can be planted for fresh greens to be cooked or eaten raw or added to omelette or curries. Store-bought mint can be replanted as it loves the hot weather.”

On a happy note

There is a notable feel-good factor in this way of life, says Manvita. “People tend to eat more happily when they know what goes into the process. It’s also really therapeutic given these difficult times, it doesn’t just distract but it adds productivity to your day when you tend to feel a little low, being at home.”

Arundati affirms, “It’s therapeutic to snip lemon grass stalks for tea or just a few leaves of basil for your pasta instead of buying a whole packet and not knowing what to do and invariably wasting everything.”

Sujatha says when she digs into the soil and sees the full ecosystem created, she sees plenty of hope for the planet. The idea of gardening is close to the idea of ‘renewal’, she concludes, and about leading out into the light of the new, adding “Do not be intimidated by a kitchen garden, it is more rewarding and brings happiness to the home, especially in this difficult time.”

Many people feel intimidated by the thought of starting a kitchen garden owing to the responsibility and patience required. But Ravi says the satisfaction of knowing the precious produce harvested trumps any hesitation. Arundati adds that it is not that hard, “But there are no promises. It's trial and error and like everything else you learn and become better with practice.” Manvitha concludes that once lockdown is lifted, people will be more proactive about kitchen gardens; in fact, she’s gotten quite a few calls about it in the past couple of weeks.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/3l6ne5/article31180029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/plant-14748071920,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/celebrating-kitchen-gardens-during-the-coronavirus-lockdown-in-india/article31180030.ece

397,2020/03/27,"Volvo India issues recall for 1,891 cars","Volvo India has issued a recall for 1,891 cars in relation to a suspected problem with the vehicle’s Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system. The recall is part of a much larger global recall of over 7 lakh Volvo cars with affected models in India including the MY2019 and MY2020 V90 Cross Country estate, S90 sedan, XC40, XC60 and XC90 SUVs.

The AEB system uses an array of sensors to identify obstacles on the road ahead, like pedestrians, cyclists and stationary vehicles. The system then automatically applies the brakes when getting too close to the obstacle, and thus helps prevent accidents.

The issue with the system seems to be that in high-temperature situations, while the obstacles are detected, the system doesn’t automatically apply the brakes.

The fix for this issue is a simple software upgrade, and the malfunction does not impede the drivability of the cars in any other way.

Though considering the current situation of the COVID-19 threat and with the government-issued lockdown in place across the country, it may take longer to get the cars sent across to workshops for the software update. Also, as a measure to prevent the spread of the virus, Volvo Car India announced a 'work from home' strategy on March 17, 2020.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/ra8sa5/article31183435.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VolvoIndia,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/volvo-india-issues-recall-for-1891-cars/article31183436.ece
398,2020/03/27,"With the coronavirus lockdown, 3 pm is the new cocktail hour","Self-isolation can be hectic, what with Insta-live parties, Zoom soirées and the daily tipple

Now that most of the world is on lockdown, people are finding ways to cope. While a Delhi colony plays Bingo across balconies, Europeans sing and put on live music performances across theirs. My period of self-isolation is turning out to be hectic. Mumbai’s social hysteria may have died down, but people are putting their online game faces on. I’ve already attended multiple soirées, via the Zoom and Houseparty apps. And let me tell you, women are worried, very worried — about their hair. Without a regular visit to the salon, life is falling apart. “I’d kill for a blow dry,” moaned one fashionista friend of mine. Some, so afraid of their greys showing, have taken to applying mascara to their roots. With the 21-day lockdown, things are looking even more bleak. Haven’t you noticed how precipitously Instagram selfies have plummeted?

Like most people, my phone is on overdrive, inundated with WhatsApp messages, emails and text, besides the various video calls that keep popping up. First there’s the daily check-in to my boomer parents in Delhi, then the messages to read and respond to, from friends in India and around the world, and yes, the constant sifting and reading of various articles on coronavirus shared on myriad group chats. That’s aside from the work commitments, which I juggle while simultaneously trouble-shooting digital issues during my 10-year old’s home school periods. “Mum,” is a battle cry that is heard every 15 minutes around the house. Then there’s overseeing household chores and the constant worry of ensuring a fresh food supply. And what about dealing with a spouse whose capitalist side is worried about the impending global recession? Unused to being at home so much, he is driving me crazy!

In these days of crisis, I’ve tossed aside Arianna Huffington’s missives on digital detox, which basically means I check my phone as soon as I wake up and right before I sleep. The other day, as I scrolled through WhatsApp at 6.30 am, I found an invite from a pal in New York for an online Instagram-live party hosted by DJ D-Nice. About 4,000 people ‘showed’ up to the party, called Homeschool, including celebrities like Jennifer Lopez, Oprah, (former US vice president) Joe Biden, and Rihanna.

For my friend Bhavna Vaidya’s birthday last Monday, we all dialled into a Zoom meeting. With 12 windows open at the same time, it was a tad chaotic, but at least we were able to spend some time looking at each other. Unfortunately, I took the ‘let’s dress up’ instructions seriously, which meant I was the most overdressed person at the virtual meet. Luckily, since only the upper half of your body could be seen, it didn’t seem as egregious a fault as the real-life situation would pose. There are indeed some tangible benefits to living in the cloud.

People have fallen into something of a routine. I don’t yet know of anyone who has run a marathon within the confines of their home, but it seems like most people are exercising, doing yoga, meditating, reading and definitely over-eating. As for booze, unless you’re a teetotaller, pregnant, or underage, the daily tipple is a source of succour. Some, after working out in the early evening, have an aperitif at 7 pm, followed by dinner. Others have advanced their cocktail hour to anything post three o’clock. And there are still others who revel in lunch time drinking, followed by an afternoon siesta. Like the Buddhists, I’ve adopted a middle path — enjoying a few glasses every alternate day or so. This method cuts down on the calories and bloating, although it doesn’t assuage frayed nerves as regularly as I would like.

The upside to all this is that the family is spending so much time together. Rather than pay to do that on an expensive holiday, we are doing it within the comfort of our own home. The 14-year-old and I have enrolled for a college-level humanities course on world literature. I am up to date on all the lessons my 5th grader is doing at school. I got around to finishing two non-fiction hardback books that were languishing on a side table. And I am no longer sleep deprived. Anxiety and stress may not recede, but they can be met with equanimity. So what if every day is a bad hair day!

399,2020/03/27,COVID-19 lockdown | The right way to generate good energy in the time of a crisis,"There is no point clapping your hands for doctors if you won’t let them into your apartment complex

“Man is at bottom a dreadful wild animal,” wrote German philosopher of pessimism Arthur Schopenhauer in the 1800s. And some Indians seem to be in a terrible rush to prove him right.

These last few years have seen an escalating graph of community violence — from Dalits being beaten to death to anyone seen with cattle being lynched to Kashmiris being locked down like criminals to horrific police action against students and protestors.

And now, all of it seems to have seamlessly segued into a certain kind of mindless violence, both physical and mental, against anyone suspected of being a carrier of the dreaded coronavirus. We have seen a rash of examples of prejudice, narrow-mindedness and selfishness these last few days, which proves one thing — we might imagine that India is the fount of spirituality and yogic virtues but in real life many of us behave like wild creatures.

This week, the president of the doctors’ association at AIIMS in New Delhi had to write to the Home Minister complaining that several homeowners were insisting that doctors and nurses involved in Covid care vacate their homes; some had even forcibly evicted them. Even as you read this, Resident Welfare Associations or RWAs across the country are harassing doctors, nurses, pilots, air stewards, and neighbours who’ve returned from journeys — heckling, shouting, threatening and demanding they leave their homes.

This is a medical crisis of mammoth proportions, but it need not become an ethical crisis too. There is no point standing on balconies and banging pots and pans to “thank” the medical fraternity if you will not let them enter their homes when they return after 18-hour shifts spent saving the lives of their ungrateful compatriots. And you cannot beg the aviation ministry to bring back loved ones from foreign places, yet refuse to let airline staff sleep in the flat next to yours.

I am certain many of these landlords have circumambulated fires and temples reciting these lines from the Upanishads, ‘Yastu sarvani bhutani atmanyeva anupashyati / sarva bhuteshu cha atmanam tato na vijugupsate.’ (See all in yourself. See yourself in all. All aversion will come to an end.) But are people really interested in ending aversion? In fact, some people are using the “social distancing” norms of Covid-19 as an opportunity to evangelise caste-based purity norms as being the ‘Indian’ way of avoiding disease — Untouchability Redux for the 21st century.

“Our civilised world is nothing but a great masquerade,” wrote Schopenhauer. See how easily the domino masks slip off as soon as personal well-being comes under threat. ‘Threat’ — that’s the crux. The will to live, to survive is a primeval instinct, and when that is jeopardised, man returns to his self-centred, primitive self. In times of crisis, this is exposed, no longer hidden under a veneer of civilisation.

Yet, isn’t it during crisis that homo sapiens, that superior species, must display a superior morality? Maybe we can create a ‘crisis code of ethics’, whose tenets will be empathy, patience, responsibility.

The coronavirus provides a unique chance to create and practise such a code because it shows that there can be no individual safety without community safety. If one were to cast this as a joke, one could say (like the popular meme) that even if you buy up all the sanitiser in the world for yourself, you can still get infected because your neighbour’s hands might carry the virus.

Both of you need the sanitiser because both need to be virus-free if this is to work. One sees moneyed people stockpiling mountains of food and soap, sanitiser and toilet paper. Yet, what good will it do them if the doctor and the attender, the local milkman and mechanic are also not alive and well? There is no individual life without a community propping it up.

Tat tvam asi, says the Chandogya Upanishad: ‘This art thou.’ We live by, in, and of each other. And knowing this is really all that an ethical life demands. It seems apt to end with that fable Schopenhauer cites, of the young servant girl bitten in the yard by a mad dog. Despite knowing full well the bite might be fatal, the girl first locked the dog in the kennel so it might not bite anyone else.

This too humans are capable of. And we see it over and over again in the actions of the doctors and nurses, sanitation workers and delivery boys, the vaccine volunteers and neighbourhood good Samaritans. And it is the good energy from their selflessness that will save us more surely than any sonic energy from clanging plates and thumping chests.

400,2020/03/27,Kerala Tourism posts a list of five books on its Instagram handle to ‘trip at home’,"‘The God of Small Things’ on Kerala Tourism’s list of books to read during the lock-down and journey to the shores of Kerala

Kerala Tourism has suggested, on its Instagram handle, five books to ‘journey to the shores of Kerala’— as part of what it calls ‘trip at home’— during the Covid-19 lock down — ‘The God of Small Things’ (Arundhati Roy), ‘Small Town Sea’ (Anees Salim), ‘Where the Rain is Born’ (ed. Anita Nair), ‘Ivory Throne: Chronicles of The House of Travancore’ (Manu Pillai) and the ‘Litanies of Dutch Battery’ (NS Madhavan).

Three of the books on the list - ‘The God of Small Things’, ‘Small Town Sea’ and ‘Litanies of Dutch Battery’ – take the reader to the heart of Kerala, exploring the personal and the political, gender and caste dynamics while providing a lush description of each place. Each is indeed a ‘trip at home’ for the reader. ‘Where the Rain is Born’ and ‘The Ivory Throne: Chronicles of The House of Travancore’ are for those who prefer non-fiction.

Boat moving along a canal at sunset in the Kerala backwaters

‘The God of Small Things’ (1997)

Arundhati Roy’s Booker winning debut novel, based in Ayemenem, is the story of twins Estha and Rahel. It brings alive the politics – gender, caste, economics, social – of late 1960s Kerala. Though published 23 years ago, it is a perennial favourite.

‘The Small Town Sea’ (2017)

401,2020/03/27,Travelling in fear: an emergency trip amid the Coronavirus chaos,"When you need to make an emergency trip, in the midst of a pandemic, how do you go about it? This writer found out.

I had to travel from Hyderabad, just before the lockdown, because of a family emergency in Guwahati, Assam. So I armed myself with hand sanitizer, a box of sanitising wipes, a mask and breakfast.

For the first time in my life, visiting my hometown of Guwahati made me nervous. I was nervous about getting my mother discharged from a hospital there, and I was nervous about flying her back to Hyderabad. For the first time I witnessed an almost empty airport in Hyderabad: the entire process of airport security and collecting a boarding pass was done in 10 minutes.

First, I looked for a gate of a cancelled flight to find a safe, uncrowded space to sit. Then, after wiping the chair and handles with my disinfectant wipes I also wiped down my carry on bags. After this, I sanitized my hands. When it was time to board, I chose to stand in the corridor instead of sitting or queueing up.

Observing hygiene

Though I was carrying the required N95 mask, I had not put it on, unlike most of my co-passengers. I also noticed people took the importance of wearing masks very seriously, but in their haste did not really take care to see or find a mask that even fits. There were masks of all shapes, sizes and make. Some masks barely covered the nose, some squished the nose and even cut into the skin of the person. In fact, only about 10% were seen wearing the recommended masks.

I also noticed people wearing surgical gloves, ski gloves, winter gloves and even the disposable plastic gloves that come with henna dye kits. They rubbed their faces, scratched their noses and even ate with the gloves on.

On our way back, I was more nervous. My mother is a senior citizen who was discharged from hospital in Guwahati just the previous day because I had insisted on bringing her with me to Hyderabad for treatment. Her immunity, owing to her age and condition, is low.

The only saving grace was that Assam had so far reported no COVID-19 cases, but I had still wiped the wheelchair down before she was made to sit. Once inside the airport, I repeated the entire sanitizing process. We then waited at another empty gate to self-isolate. Until I reached home, I did not feel at peace, not one bit. Having said that, after reaching home, I wiped each bag with wipes, kept our clothes out, and mopped the house floor with Dettol. I even washed our footwear with soap and Dettol and, by the time I was partially satisfied, I had gotten a bad backache.

402,2020/03/27,‘A big relief for real estate’,"The steps taken by the RBI to protect the financial sector in the wake of the COVID-19 impact have been welcomed by financial experts and lenders.

Shishir Baijal, Chairman & Managing Director, Knight Frank India said: “We are delighted with the RBI announcements which have far exceeded industry expectations. The apex bank has checked all the required boxes of rate cut, liquidity infusion and moratorium. These steps will help the economy to stay stable despite the lockdown and economic disruption.

The moratorium of 3 months for all term loans and deferment of interest on working capital by 3 months will be very helpful at this point when most businesses are unable to have a steady cash flow.

We see this as a big relief for the real estate sector which would have been one of the worst effected owing to its linkages with the overall economy”.

Ramesh Nair, CEO & Country Head, JLL India: “ This is a very significant move with substantial monetary policy intervention at a time when COVID-19 has impacted the economy at large. This is in conjunction with the economic package announced by the Finance Minister for the poor. The package is expected to benefit 3.5 crore registered construction workers.”

403,2020/03/27,Some lessons for the construction industry,"With COVID-19 impacting the market economy and bringing in frugality, builders may no longer splurge on fancy facades and mindless energy consumption. By Sathya Prakash Varanashi

This essay is not a text in parody, spoof or satire, but a serious way to relook at what COVID-19 is doing to our construction industry – an industry which causes one-third of greenhouse gases, encourages building more than we need and leaves behind large built areas unused or underused while millions go homeless in an unjust and unequal world.

Every material ultimately comes from natural resources which we are simply wasting with disregard to the needs of hungry millions and the bleak predictions of extinction. Unfortunately, nearly everyone in the construction industry - administration, architects, engineers, institutions, builders - are all following this mindless approach to wasteful construction, all against nature. Today it is a virus affecting health, tomorrow it can be a virus affecting construction.

The above references to buildings could be factual, but any connection to the killer virus? One interesting parallel could be that COVID-19 is a killer of humans while construction is a killer of nature – both are killers.

Anyway, keeping the pun apart, the spread of the virus should not have happened to our civilisation. Whatever be the cause, it is a curse to the ever enterprising free spirit of our society, always striving towards a growth economy. Irrespective of its varied impacts, the major implication of loss of human lives is a civilisational tragedy, which should never repeat in future.

Having said that, let’s look at what the virus has caused to us and made us do. While the actual construction at sites might not have stopped yet, it has reduced the manufacture of products, and sales of goods.

Flights, star hotels, national seminars, fine-dine restaurants, holiday resorts, car drives across regions, air conditioned spaces and such others which are among the major consumers of earth energy are going lean. Images of the nearly empty shopping malls from abroad are simply unbelievable. At this rate, the need for more built floors will also reduce.

Social distancing has reduced public events, while closure of offices and institutions has minimised both local and global travel. Large number of people would see a dip in their monthly incomes, a worrisome fact. However, economists well know how reducing incomes also mean reduced expenses and reduced choices. Majority of the pricey, branded, personal goods are not need based, but are aimed at the rich to spend their surplus income. After the initial jolt, the market economy ensures that expenses will adjust to meet the income level, creating the necessary equilibrium, possibly encouraging a simpler lifestyle rooted in lower-cost products and services.

Less use of energy

If global transport gets affected, local manufacturing gets a boost, lowering the embodied energy – a major criteria in sustainable buildings. A few rich nations such as Japan may be living in crammed office and house spaces, but most rich owners in cities build too much with thousands of building materials, especially to showcase the wealth in the facades and the interiors. Hopefully, frugality may step in.

Those who are tracking the global warming are recording a small decrease in temperatures, while the carbon emission during the virus days has already been less. The internet is already reporting the reduced pollution, cleaner air and reduced solid waste generation across the cities with virus breakout. We can wait for validation, yet by intuition we now know that the climate change created by humans is being challenged by the virus!

COVID-19 appears to be achieving what the decade-long climate campaigns have not yet achieved, for the given short period. However deadly it is, we need to be grateful to the lessons it is teaching us. Our ever growing, GDP-based, market-led, manufactured luxury lifestyle with no concern for cost, climate and culture cannot continue for ever.

Of course, shortly we would learn to control the virus and we may return to our bad old ways. Or, we may remember the lessons it has taught us, and thankfully, may not return to the wasteful buying and throwing.

It is time we change our lifestyle forever, with eco-friendly architecture and lower carbon footprint living.

404,2020/03/27,Rate cut amidst uncertainty,"RBI decision intended to help industries; borrowers too can breathe easy. By Balaji Rao

In a surprise move the Reserve Bank of India announced its monetary policy ahead of its April first week announcement. The repo rate was slashed by 75 basis points or 0.75% and stands now at 4.40%, down from the prevailing 5.15%. Repo rate is the rate at which banks borrow money from RBI to meet their short-term funding requirements. It is the benchmark for deposit and loan rates that prevail in the banking system.

While the world is going through its worst crisis in over a century, this rate cut is aimed at making borrowing cheaper for industries and help speed up production and create employment.

The GDP growth has been slashed to 3.5% for the coming financial year and the rate cut could be an antidote.

The RBI is also infusing liquidity by way of using various liquidity tools such as open market operations and repo auctions. The Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) too has been reduced by 100 basis points or 1%; it is now at 3%, down from the earlier 4%. CRR is a risk management tool used by RBI wherein the banks have to compulsorily transfer a portion of the deposits into the central bank’s account at no interest. With this new reduction banks would have more funds at their disposal to lend freely to various productive sectors.

Most borrowers have been given moratorium on repayment of loans which is quite good considering the cash flow issues that would persist for a while due to stagnation of economic activity and contraction in money supply. Real estate segment too would benefit from this move.

For the home loan borrowers the next few months would be tough and trying; there could be salary issues and business income issues across the board.

Payment of EMIs could be an issue to handle. The government has taken measures for easing such pressures across all types of individual borrowers by requesting the lenders to go soft on the EMI repayments; hopefully the lenders would heed the request.

Common individuals should refrain from mindless spending and hold on to any major expenses in the coming months.

The post-COVID era would be quite different and would require a steely resolve to emerge unscathed.",homes and gardens,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/rate-cut-amidst-uncertainty/article31183693.ece
405,2020/03/27,A digital ‘quarantine colouring’ book for children,"Brought out by Kochi-based Sanid Asif Ali and Nithin Mathew, the book has contributors from across India and abroad

Forty-six artists from across India and abroad have collaborated on a free digital colouring book for children, who have been forced to spend their holidays at home.

The ‘Q Colouring Book’ was conceived by Kochi-based techie-turned cartoonist Sanid Asif Ali and illustrator Nithin Mathew, who put the word out through social media. “We started getting eager responses. Everyone is affected by the pandemic in one way or the other, but they all wanted to contribute to create something meaningful for children,” says Sanid.

The book contains 55 panels that can be coloured in. Those who have printers at home can take printouts and colour them manually. “Older children can colour them digitally,” says Sanid.

A majority of the art is related to corona virus prevention and facts. One of the works, by artist Pranav Holla, shows a man and a woman wearing masks and spraying sanitisers in superhero style. A Foundation Student at the National Institute of Design, Pranav says his work would benefit both the maker and the person who sees it. “In times of uncertainty such as this, it can be a great escape from boredom and even help people take their minds off the negativity and the anxiety.”

Art is a great way to deal with stressful times, says Pete Morey from the UK. “It’s a really fun way to bring people together with our shared creativity as we all live under the same strained conditions -- both for us artists and for the kids (and adults too!). All indoors,” he says. Pete’s work shows a mountain, a hideout, an aeroplane, clouds, grass land, a winding river, cat and dog, and a man in a space suit all in a single panel, which would make for interesting colouring.

Other panels in the book depict healthy eating habits, hygiene and spending time with elders. Thirteen-year-old Yohannan Jacob from Kochi is the youngest contributor. He says: “This book can be used by children and adults alike to indulge in a bit of creativity.”

“The quarantine colouring book shows we are united in isolation,” Sanid signs off.

406,2020/03/27,Living with Pharoahs,"Egypt, the cradle of civilisation, is fascinating. With its rich history, fertile lands, wide valleys and the Nile Delta, is a study of contrasts.

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip, Palestine and Israel, the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east, Sudan to the south and Libya to the west. The country spans the north-east corner of Africa and the south west corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula.

Egypt boasts of one of the oldest civilisations. It saw the earliest developments of writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government. Its iconic ruins, such as the Great Sphinx, Memphis reflect this legacy. The ancient rulers were known as Pharaohs. The name originated from the term “per-aa” which means “the Great House”.

In the Western Desert is the Farafra depression. A main geographic attraction of Farafra is its White Desert, so named because of its massive chalk rock formations that are textbook examples of ventifact. East of the Nile, is the semi-arid Arabian Desert extending to the edges of the Red Sea. The Black Desert is a dark rocky area which owes its appearance to ancient volcanic action and the presence of abundant iron ore. In the south west, the land rises into the Gilf Kebir Plateau. Sandstone plateaus front the Nile and the Red Sea, with cliffs as high as 2,637m. The country is dissected by the Nile, as it flows north to the Mediterranean Sea from its source in central Africa. The surrounding Nile Valley, eight to 16km wide, is the country’s only fertile land and home to 98% of the population. The Red Sea extends into the Mediterranean by the man-made Suez Canal. The Sinai Peninsula lies east of the canal, and this limestone plateau rises to Mt Catherine in the south, the highest point of the country 2,637 m. Lake Nassar, the largest lake, is man-made, and created when the Aswan dam was constructed. The lowest point of Egypt is the Qattara Depression at -133 m. In the south east, the Red Sea Mountains, an extension of the Ethiopian Highlands, continue on into Sudan.

People

The people followed a polytheistic religion in which a vast number of gods and goddesses were venerated. Before the Arab invasion in AD 639, Coptic, the language descended from ancient Egyptian, was the language of both religious and everyday life. By the 12th century, it was replaced by Arabic. Today, Islam is practised by the majority of Egyptians and governs their personal, political, economic and legal lives.

Culture

Egyptian cuisine uses a lot of legumes, vegetables and fruit from the rich Nile Valley and Delta. Examples of Egyptian dishes include ful medames, mashed fava beans; kushari, lentils and pasta; and molokhiya, bush okra stew. Pita bread, known locally as eish baladi

Music is an integral part of their culture. They created many instruments that were easy play like bells, drums, rattles, chimes and tambourines. In ancient Egypt people loved to dance. There were dances for different occasions, and also folk dances.

History

Traditionally, their history been divided into 31 dynasties. Dynasties one and two date back around 5,000 years and are often called the “early dynastic” while dynasties 25-31 (712–332 B.C.) are collectively known as the “late period”. At different points of time, the country has been occupied by the Persians, Nubians, Greeks and Romans.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/living-with-pharoahs/article31181039.ece
407,2020/03/27,Off to Storyland,"In the long, cold winter evenings, they huddled together in the living room listening to stories.

The story so far: As Choto-ma took the girls to Ranchi, they geared up to adapt to the new lifestyle.

Choto-ma got them books, slates and exercise books.

“Sarojini, since you already know how to read I’ll start you on The Royal Reader,” she said. “I have some Bengali books for you as well. And you can practise handwriting in the exercise book, with pencil at first, until you get used to it. Anu and Radhu, you can use the slate until your letters are legible. I have books for you too.”

Grandma and her sisters-in-law settled down to their new routine. Anu and Radhu did not enjoy studying quite as much as grandma did but they became adept at sewing and cooking. Grandma lost herself in the imaginary world of stories and often forgot to add salt or sugar! But her embroidery and crochet grew prettier with practice.

Books to the rescue

They had been in Ranchi for over a year now. Everything was nice here — the spacious house, the garden, the hilly roads with tall green trees. Grandma especially liked the living room with its rows of book-shelves, most of them bound in leather and magazines stacked on a side table.

But the winter was staggering. The girls had never come across such dry, intense cold before. Grandma, Radhu and Anu sat huddled up in the living room despite the woollen socks they had knitted for themselves.

When it was time for Kakamoni to return, Puran, the domestic help, placed a charcoal stove in the room with an easy-chair near it. Kakamoni sat there and read the newspaper after he freshened up.

“Get your knitting, girls,” said Choto-ma.

“If only someone would tell us a story!” sighed grandma.

“Kakamoni, please tell us a story,” said Anu, “you read so many books!”

“Very well,” said Kakamoni.

That was the beginning of exciting times. Kakamoni started the story of David Copperfield and every one listened entranced. They listened to a story of a different land and a different kind of life and could have gone on listening forever. This became their usual evening treat, unless an unexpected guest dropped in.

Kakamoni told them stories of Oliver Twist, Great Expectations, A Christmas Carol and other stories from Dickens. He went on to stories of The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, Les Miserables and Toilers of the Sea. Choto-ma told them stories from Grimm’s Fairy Tales and Alice In Wonderland in the afternoons.

This love for books was to stay with grandma for the rest of her life. A love that nothing could affect or shake despite sorrow, problems, worries, and sickness. Books gave her the strength to look problems in the face and build an inner world of her own where she could always be happy.

408,2020/03/27,Conquering boredom,"Having an early vacation and staying at home isn’t all that I thought it would be. Luckily, I have a few things to keep me occupied.

Hello! I’m writing this at the start of the worst summer vacation in the history of the universe! Thanks, but no thanks, Covid-19. At first, I was super happy school shut down early and I thought I’d say ‘See ya Grade 6!’ without writing my final exams. But then school made us take our exams online, and I had to spend the first three weeks of my early summer break studying. Ugh. As if that wasn’t bad enough, everything has closed down or been cancelled. The swimming pool, theatres, gaming arcades, cricket coaching. What is a kid supposed to do? Even worse, both my parents are practising ‘social distancing’ and working from home, and they keep complaining about how we’re sucking up all the broadband watching The Flash and DC Legends of Tomorrow. So, screen time is being rationed.

In such difficult times, there’s only one thing to do. Read! So, I’m sharing my Covid-19 reading list. This is 100% free from adult intervention, because let’s face it, when grown-ups make reading lists, they can be super boring.

New Kid by Jerry Craft

This is a graphic novel about a kid called Jordan Banks who loves drawing and wants to study art, but his parents send him to a fancy private school that’s all about academics (Typical parents!). Jordan isn’t as rich as most of the other kids in school and he is one of the few African-American kids in school too. I really liked the illustrations in the book, and it made me wonder how I would feel if I was one of the few Indian kids in my school.

Guts by Raina Telgemeier

Okay, I’ll be honest. At first, I liked this book because of how many farts there are in it! But then, the more I got in to it, the less it was about farts, poop and vomit (though, they were still funny). Guts is kind of an autobiography, where the author talks about this time in her life when she kept feeling sick in her stomach, and it just wasn’t because she ate artichokes. All these other things she was worried about were making her feel sick too. It made me realise that how we feel in our heads can affect how we feel in our body too.

Wings of Fire: The Dragonet Prophecy by Tui T Sutherland

If you love How to Train Your Dragon and play Dragon Mania Legends, then you’ll like Wings of Fire. It’s about seven dragon tribes who have been fighting each other for centuries over a secret, lost treasure. And how five baby dragons (dragonets) have been raised in secret to bring the war to an end. I’ve only read book 1 and can’t wait to get to the next book.

Nimmi’s Spectabulous Schooldays by Shabnam Minwalla

Okay, I don’t know about you, but sometimes I like to read books that I can relate to, you know? Where some of the characters have the same names that my friends have, where people eat the food I eat, and where the teachers are as annoying as mine! Plus, I totally know what it’s like to have a jerk like Sumit sit behind you on the bus. UGH!

Thesaurus? Is that a cousin of Allosaurus? Far from it. The thesaurus is a book that gives us synonyms. These are words that have similar meanings. We had discussed synonyms in the previous issue.

A thesaurus is something like a dictionary. But, a dictionary gives you the meanings of words, and a thesaurus gives you words that have a similar meaning.

For example, if you want to know words that are similar in meaning to ‘great’, you refer to the thesaurus and you would find words like ‘expert’, ‘good’, ‘skilful’, ‘veteran’, ‘majestic’, ‘magnanimous’ and so on.

A thesaurus also gives you words that have an opposite or somewhat opposite meaning. These are called ‘antonyms’. For example, antonyms for ‘great’ are ‘unskilled’, ‘amateur,’ ‘insignificant,’ ‘unseasoned’ and so on.

A thesaurus comes in handy when you are composing a letter, a story, an essay, a poem or any other kind of literary work. When you are struggling for a word that you want to reflect exactly what you want to say, the thesaurus could be a life-saver.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/all-in-a-book/article31180428.ece
410,2020/03/27,Granny’s flowery surprise,"When grandma starts to make the garden pretty, everyone is curious about what she is celebrating.

“I will buy a heap of flowers today,” said granny smiling happily.

“Is there a special pooja today? Or is there a party?” asked Murli curiously as he gulped down the milk.

Granny smiled, “You tell me what the occasion is,” teased granny.

Rama grabbed granny’s hand, “Come on granny, don’t create so much suspense. Our school bus will arrive now.”

Murli said, “Obviously, we will be thinking about this the whole day and then you will scold me for scoring low marks in math.”

Rama laughed, “Now, bhaiya has found another excuse for his poor marks.”

Mom walked into the room and said, “There’s your school bus. Run.”

Granny finished her breakfast and went into her room. Dad walked into granny’s room. “Oh wow! So many flowers, mom!” he exclaimed.

He looked around the room. A whole variety of flowers decorated every corner of the room. Granny continued with the floral decorations.

“Any special occasion?”

“Can you guess?”

Dad said, “I am getting late for work.”

Mom came up behind him and whispered, “Have we forgotten a special day?”

“Why don’t you ask her?” said Dad.

The four of them puzzled over this the whole day.

Dolled up

When Rama and Murli returned from school, they found granny in the garden. She was instructing the gardener as to where to plant the saplings of rose, marigold, and dahlia.

The entire house was decorated with colourful flowers. There were flowers on the table, in the crystal bowl on the dining table, strings of marigold on the windows — there was an absolute riot of colours and fragrances.

“Granny, you have worked magic on the entire house. It looks like fairy land,” said Rama as she hugged granny.

“And you are my darling fairy,” said granny. She gave her a white gajra (garland), “and there’s one for your mom too.”

After lunch, the kids helped their granny in the garden. Later, they helped her make more garlands.

On the way back from work, dad picked up a bouquet and a box of sweets.

He thought this was the best way to be prepared for whatever lay ahead. He still could not remember what the occasion was.

When he got home, the decorations made him feel more guilty. At the dinner table, everyone was quiet, except granny who was excited and happy.

Plans revealed

Finally Dad said, “Mom, we are really sorry. We cannot remember what day this is.”

Mom said, “Now please tell us.”

“I have given so many hints yet nobody wished me Fools’ Day,” said granny annoyed.

“Fools’ Day?” asked Rama in surprise.

“Yes. Yesterday, Bunty told me that today was Fools’ Day,” said granny. Everyone burst out laughing as they realised what granny meant.

Murli said, “Granny you made fools out of all us on April Fools’ Day.”

Dad told granny about April Fool’s Day and what people do on that day. “So, you see it has nothing to do with phool, the Hindi word for flowers, as you thought,” he said, wiping the tears from his eyes.

Now, it was granny’s turn to laugh. “From now on I will celebrate April 1 as Flowers Day.”

Rama hugged granny, “We also enjoyed this Fools’ Day.”",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/zh7j2j/article31180386.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27YTFLOWERS4jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/grannys-flowery-surprise/article31180387.ece

415,2020/03/27,President urges Governors to collaborate with Governments on COVID-19 response,"Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi took part in a video conference on Friday in which President Ram Nath Kovind urged Governors and administrators to collaborate with governments to quell the threat of COVID-19.

The meeting was convened by the President, along with Vice President M. Venkaiah Naidu with Governors and administrators of States/UTs to discuss the response to COVID-19.

The President urged everyone to take stock of the situation with the State government and make contributions in a way that the battle against the Coronavirus could be taken to a logical end.

The discussions were related to the status of COVID-19 in the States, the role of the Red Cross with focus on vulnerable sections, and the role of civil society/voluntary organisations in complementing the efforts of the Union and State governments to contain the spread of COVID-19, especially with the lockdown and other challenges emerging from the evolving situation.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/president-urges-governors-to-collaborate-with-governments-on-covid-19-response/article31186911.ece
416,2020/03/27,COVID-19: Daily wage workers in Puducherry hit due to lockdown,"With construction work having come to a halt and no form of public transport available, daily wage workers are finding it hard to make ends meet

Daily wage workers and members of the unorganised sector are the worst hit by the current lockdown in force in Puducherry. With all establishments remaining closed since Sunday, sources of their livelihood have dried up.

Though the government’s move in relaxing the norms for opening essential services including vegetable markets have helped a few, the bulk of those employed in the construction industry and other unorganised sectors have been going without wages due to the current lockdown in force across the Union Territory.

Construction activities have completely come to a standstill due to the current situation. The situation is worse in the rural areas where workers engaged under the Mahatma Gandhi National RuraL Employment Guarantee Scheme have been without work due to the lockdown.

According to M. Shanmugam, a load man at the Goubert Market, “The arrival of vegetables from neighbouring States has trickled down. As against 30 truck loads of vegetables, only five vehicles are arriving at the market here. Though we are ready to work, loadmen attached to our team from rural areas have not been able to reach the market due to the lack of transport and strict restrictions imposed by the police.” The workers earn anywhere between ₹300 to ₹500 per day on an average, he said.

“We don’t have much work to do during the lockdown and the wages have also come down. Five of us who reported for work have shared the wages to ensure that our families don’t starve. We don’t know how long we can sustain” said D. Govindan, another load man.

S. Rabelle, a cycle rickshaw driver in the Boulevard has been doing household chores to support his family of four. He delivers essentials including medicines to his customers and is paid ₹50 based on the distance.

Sathish Kumar, an autorickshaw driver has been idling away his time on his phone at the autorickshaw stand near Latha Steels on the East Coast Road. “There has been no business for the past four days due to the lockdown. I have two payments due in the first week of next month and have been finding it difficult to make both ends meet,” he said The Unorganised Labourers Welfare Board has also failed to safeguard the interests of the daily wage workers during the lockdown, he added.

K. Sethu Selvam, General secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) has urged the Puducherry Government to provide suitable relief to migrants and daily wage workers who have been affected due to the lockdown. The government should also provide free rice along with LPG cylinders to both BPL and APL cardholders till the lockdown ends, he said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/qfgllw/article31180447.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27MARTH--DAILY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/covid-19-daily-wage-workers-in-puducherry-hit-due-to-lockdown/article31180448.ece
417,2020/03/27,Stickers on houses of the quarantined in Thiruvananthapuram,"Geo-fencing too possible, says Minister

The district administration has commenced pasting stickers on the houses of those quarantined in a bid to rein in the violation of the guidelines enforced by the government to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.

The move comes in the wake of widespread complaints of people violating quarantine and frequenting public places despite being told to remain indoors. The stickers launched for the purpose were formally released by Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran on Friday. The Minister said the possibilities of adopting geo-fencing techniques would also be explored to ensure that those quarantined did not wander beyond a particular perimeter.

He said the district authorities had identified 7,290 hospital beds in government-run hospitals, 4,200 beds in private hospitals, 725 intensive care units, and 300 ventilators for treatment of those infected.

He said the wellbeing of around 600 migrant labourers involved in the construction of a shopping mall in Akkulam had been ascertained by the Labour Department. The Collector directed commercial establishments to enforce social distancing on their premises. Customers should submit lists of the commodities and collect them outside the shops, so as to avoid crowding inside shops.

Three shops closed

The district administration cautioned traders against hoarding and other malpractices. Three shops in the district were ordered to close down on Thursday.

The City police registered 82 cases and arrested 85 people for violating the lockdown on the day. Sixty-eight vehicles were confiscated.

Police officers said many continued to go outdoors, particularly owing to private companies not providing employees the option to work from home. The reluctance shown by the coastal community to adhere to the cubrs has been problematic. The authorities have been unable to trace three persons who had jumped quarantine from General Hospital in the past two days.

No new cases

No new COVID-19 positive cases were reported in the district on Friday. As many as 3,062 people were newly put under observation in the district. A total of 11,024 people are under isolation in their houses. Twenty-seven people are under treatment at the General Hospital, and 43 at the Medical College Hospital. Three persons have completed their 28-day quarantine period without symptoms.

Out of the 1,222 samples sent for COVID-19 tests, results of 943 have been received. All the 65 results received on Friday were negative. Forty-three samples were sent for testing on Friday.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/f582lc/article31187056.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tvstickerjpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/stickers-on-housesof-the-quarantined/article31187057.ece
418,2020/03/27,IISER produces sanitisers,"Facility supplies over 400 litres in 100-ml bottles

When you are fighting a pandemic, every little bit helps. With classes suspended on account of COVID-19, the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) here is using its labs to produce hand sanitisers.

Since last week, the institute has been supplying sanitisers to the Police, Fire and Rescue, and Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) units in its immediate neighbourhood as well as the General Hospital and Government Medical College in the city.

A vital component of the ‘Break the Chain’ campaign, hand sanitisers have been in short supply in the State ever since the outbreak. At the IISER, its production is being handled by faculty members and a few students who have been allowed to stay back on campus.

“We have already supplied over 400 litres in 100- ml bottles and in bulk quantity since last week,” said Anil Shaji, Associate Dean. “We are getting additional requests from hospitals. We want to help people in whatever capacity we can,” J.N. Moorthy, Director, IISER-Thiruvananthapuram, said.

Classes suspended

The institute, situated in the outskirts of Thiruvananthapuram city in Vithura, had initially suspended classes till March 31, given the COVID-19 scenario. Through a March 13 order, students were directed to return to their homes. Following the 21-day lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the closure has been extended to April 15.

Other agencies and government institutions, including ISRO unit Vikram Sarabhai Space Centr, also had begun producing sanitisers.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/iiser-produces-sanitisers/article31187027.ece
419,2020/03/27,"In Thiruvananthapuram, community kitchens keep hope aflame","They ensure that the indigent, bedridden, and senior citizens do not go hungry

For the past two days, Lekha has been arriving at the community kitchen at the Government Lower Primary School in Thycaud around 5.30 a.m. With the lockdown in place, her husband drops her here from her house in Vattiyurkavu. A midday meal cook at the school, her workload has increased several fold, but she has no complaints.

“Usually, two of us cook breakfast and meals for 300 children. Now, we are providing food thrice a day to a lot of people. Many employees from the city Corporation are helping us,” says Lekha, even as jackfruit curry is being cooked for lunch in a large ‘uruli.’ The jackfruits are offerings from the local community.

A day after Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan announced that community kitchens will be opened in every panchayat so that no one goes hungry during the lockdown, they have begun functioning across the State. These kitchens, a joint effort of the Kudumbashree Mission and the local bodies, are meant to serve the indigent, the bedridden, and senior citizens who have no one to buy them supplies.

“The Corporation informs us of the number of requests received the day before at the call centre, based on which the food is prepared. A lot of people walk in too, seeking food. Today, we provided meals to 15 fire force trainees, who were starving. We have formed small teams each for cooking, packing and distribution,” says P. Suresh Kumar, Corporation official, who oversees the kitchen.

The breakfast menu include puttu, kadala curry, banana. The lunch consists of rice, thoran, jackfruit curry, rasam and pickle and the dinner, chappathi, curry, and banana. The menu changes slightly daily.

Prime challenge

For the local bodies, the challenge is in identifying those who are really in need. A couple of the requests in the city turned out to be from affluent families.

At another community kitchen at EMS Charitable Society in Ulloor, six Kudumbashree workers are cooking for around 300 people. “We used to cook for those staying temporarily for treatment purposes at the society. Now, we are also cooking for those affected by the lockdown,” says Hedilqueen, a Kudumbashree worker.

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran said the kitchens would serve migrant labourers too. Around 200 people living in the streets here have been accommodated at a facility in Putharikkandam maithanam, and are being provided food from community kitchens.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/2esocp/article31186999.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28TVTVTOTALSHUTDOWN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/community-kitchens-keep-hope-aflame/article31187000.ece
420,2020/03/27,Coronavirus | Mikel Arteta opens up about his virus recovery,"The 38-year-old Arsenal manager tested positive for the virus on March 12 but has since recovered after self-isolating.

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who has “completely recovered” from COVID-19, believes people should be “emotionally more open” about the pandemic.

Arteta, 38, tested positive for the virus on March 12 but has since recovered after self-isolating.

“We are in a world where everything is social media, everything is a WhatsApp text,” said Arteta. “But how important is touching each other, feeling each other and hugging each other? I miss that with a lot of the people I love. We have to be emotionally more open. We have to tell each other what we are feeling.”

“We cannot just in two or three months’ time — if we are able to get over this quickly — forget about this, because it’s so important.”

Arteta said his main concern was his three children after his wife and their nanny contracted the virus.

“In terms of symptoms, it was a normal virus for me. I had three or four days which were a little bit difficult, with a bit of a temperature and a dry cough, and some discomfort in my chest. That was it.

“The difficulty is that I have people at home, three kids as well and I was worried. My wife has been through it and our nanny’s been through it.

“I am feeling completely recovered (now)...,” he told the club website.

“We are living in a unique situation, so I think all of us are trying to react to the situation that is coming on a daily basis and trying our best to overcome the situation.”

The Spaniard urged people across the world to stay indoors. and follow the guidelines put in place by the authorities in order to slow down the process of virus transmission.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/bvy9u8/article31186400.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28MIKELARTETA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/coronavirus-mikel-arteta-opens-up-about-his-virus-recovery/article31186401.ece
421,2020/03/27,A privilege training under Banerjee: I.M. Vijayan,"‘Sad we don’t produce players like PK and Krishanu any more’

He may have quit professional football a decade and a half ago, but I.M. Vijayan’s romance with the beautiful game continues.

At the age of 50, he still makes occasional appearances for Kerala Police and plays in the hugely popular seven-a-side tournament. These days the only way to associate himself with the game is kicking the ball around with his son at home in Thrissur.

Tough times

“These are indeed tough times for all of us,” Vijayan told The Hindu over phone. “It is even more frightening than the floods, which Kerala experienced for the last two years.”

The former Indian captain had seen the misery from close quarters. He is a Circle Inspector with Kerala Police, and was on duty in the flood-hit areas.

“I had also duty during the elections,” he said. “My colleagues in the police department are doing a great job. I know that I could also be asked to report for duty and would be glad to do my bit.”

Even as the coronavirus was spreading its wings across the country came the news last week that P.K. Banerjee, one of Indian football’s all-time greats, was no more. “I consider myself lucky that I could train under him,” Vijayan said. “He had coached me at Mohun Bagan and at the national camp. ”

He said he had grown up hearing about the legendary striker. “I remember former players like Syed Nayeemuddin speak in awe of P.K.,” he said. “Today’s generation might find it difficult to believe that he scored a goal against France at the Olympic Games and that we had drawn that match 1-1.”

That was in 1960 in Rome. And that was a time when India used to win medals, including gold, at the Asian Games.

End of a chapter

“With his demise, another golden chapter of Indian football has come to an end,” said Vijayan, who was one of India’s most-gifted forwards ever. “As a footballer it is indeed disappointing to find that the standard of the sport has come down hugely in India.”

He said it was unfortunate that new superstars are no longer emerging. “Apart from Sunil Chhetri, I wonder how many names are familiar for most of India today,” he said.

“It is a pity that we don’t find incredibly talented players like the late Krishanu Dey (who was known as the Indian Maradona). It was a privilege playing along with, and against, him.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/btf21n/article31176305.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27VIJAYAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/a-privilege-training-under-banerjee-im-vijayan/article31176306.ece

The accused Dinesh Kumar, a diploma holder in mechanical engineering, was riding a two-wheeler without wearing a mask and apparently without any valid reason when a police team deployed near the Aranthangi Government Hospital stopped and questioned him.

A video clip of the youth vociferously arguing with a woman constable went viral in the social media.

In the clip, the youth is seen claiming that it is right to venture out in his place. He wonders why the police is venturing out when people are being asked not to come out.

The youth was also seen telling the police that the Chief Minister should come to his place as it was his ‘fort’ to ‘show the virus’.

Another video clip, circulated along with the earlier one, shows the youth on his knees and being caned by a policeman, apparently at a police station.

The policeman is heard telling the youth that the police and doctors were risking their lives and working in this crucial juncture. The boy is seen pleading with the police that he would remain cautious in future.

The sources said a case against the youth was registered under IPC sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) read with Disaster Management Act.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/youth-who-argued-with-police-arrested/article31186339.ece
424,2020/03/27,When food grains come through PVC pipes,"The idea was initiated following the 21-day lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Joint Registrar of Cooperative Societies, G. P. Arularasu said.

The Public Distribution System (PDS) shops have devised innovative ways to ensure personal distance is maintained by card holders while purchasing ration at the shops in the district.

PVC pipes have been installed in all 1,208 shops in the district so that the food grains are not touched by the shopkeeper or the customer.

The idea was initiated following the 21-day lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Joint Registrar of Cooperative Societies, G. P. Arularasu said.

“We do not want the food grains to be touched by bare hands at all. The shopkeepers have been given face masks and hand sanitisers. They have also been ordered to clean their hands each time they serve a customer,” he said.

The six-inch PVC pipes have been installed next to the weighing machines at the shops.

The customer will hold the bags which they bring at one end of the pipe while the seller would drop the items slowly from the other side.

Rows of circles have been drawn in front of the shops in such a manner that the people can stand within it to maintain personal distance, Mr. Arularasu said.

Meanwhile, Mr. Arularasu said that the announcement on distribution of additional food grain announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman would be made by the District Collector soon.

425,2020/03/27,Retail traders of Gandhi Market can sell vegetables at G. Corner,"‘Vendors from Uzhavar Sandhais to be temporarily shifted to open grounds’

Retail vendors at Gandhi Market will be allowed to sell fruit and vegetables at the G. Corner ground from Monday onwards, said Tourism Minister Vellamandi N. Natarajan here on Friday.

“Vendors from the six Uzhavar Sandhais in Tiruchi district will also be temporarily shifted to open grounds or bus stands notified by the district administration so that the public can purchase from them,” Mr. Natarajan said speaking to reporters after chairing a COVID-19 preparedness meeting held at the Tiruchi Collectorate. The Thennur Uzhavar Sandhai will function at the Central Bus Stand from Saturday onwards.

The decision came after crowds swarmed the Gandhi Market area early on Friday morning despite instructions from the district administration that only wholesale shops would be allowed, he said.

Mr. Natarajan said that over 195 calls have been received from March 1 on the special COVID-19 helpline numbers. “The public can call 1077, 0431- 2418995 or 9952381108 at any time of the day in case of queries. A team of doctors and nurses are fully equipped to answer the people's concerns,” he said.

Regarding the first patient who tested positive for COVID-19 in Tiruchi, Mr. Natarajan said that he is responding well to treatment. “A total of 86 passengers had travelled on the Air India flight from Dubai on which the patient was on. Eight people including those seated near him, and his family members have been home quarantined,” he said. Throat swabs and blood samples have also been taken from them last night for tests.

The district administration worked swiftly in setting up a quarantine centre at the Kallikudi market and was able to monitor 112 patients, of whom 23 hailed from Tiruchi, Mr. Natarajan said.

From March 1, a total of 4,120 people have been home quarantined in the district. “These include all Tiruchi residents who had travelled abroad and landed in other cities,” Mr. Natarajan said. The Tamil Nadu government has decided to paste stickers on the residents of all in home quarantine. “A total of 2,262 stickers were stuck until Thursday. The rest will be done today,” Mr. Natarajan said.

The district administration has also received permission from the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to transport bananas outside the district as it is harvest season.

Meanwhile, S. Sivarasu, District Collector said that the police department has registered 121 cases of violation of the lockdown in the district. A total of 11 vehicles have also been seized.

“From Friday evening onwards, if two or more people travel in a vehicle, it will be seized,” Mr. Sivarasu said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/amw1xl/article31186316.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY28MINISTERTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/retail-traders-of-gandhi-market-can-sell-vegetables-at-g-corner/article31186317.ece
426,2020/03/27,Nagapattinam to enforce petrol rationing,"The Nagapattinam district administration will start implementing petrol rationing for two-wheelers from Saturday for the lock down period, as a measure to contain the spread of novel coronavirus.

This measure comes in the wake of the difficulty being experienced by the police department in controlling the presence of youth roaming about in two-wheelers without any purpose, and causing the risk of spread of the virus.

District Collector Praveen P. Nair convened a meeting of fuel outlet owners on Friday and instructed them to provide fuel for only ₹100 per person. However, those engaged in essential services could get more fuel by producing their identity cards.

The district administration has also prevailed upon the police department to deal with the motorists who move about without any purpose strictly. From Saturday, the driving licence of those who move about without wearing helmets will be seized. Also, pillion riding will not be permitted. If any motorist was found with a driving licence, the vehicle will be seized, the Collector said.

Fuel outlets must also make markings for personal distancing in two-metre intervals.

Seeking the cooperation of those who return from other countries and States to smoothen the process of home quarantine for a 14-day duration, the Collector assured that essential commodities such as fruits, vegetables, milk and grocery will be supplied at their doorsteps. Advocating voluntary registration by dialling 1077, Mr. Nair said that even the family members of those under home quarantine must keep a distance and desist from stepping out. Teams comprising officials of health, police, and Revenue departments were in a state of readiness to render assistance round the clock, he said.

428,2020/03/27,"Tiruchi Railway Division loads over 9,000 metric tonnes of rice in four days","The Tiruchi Railway Division has been moving essential commodities especially paddy and rice by rail despite the lock down enforced to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the last four days from March 23, the division loaded 9,480 metric tonnes of rice and 6,766 metric tonnes of paddy.

Besides essential commodities, it had also loaded 62,577 metric tonnes of coal to various power houses which include the Mettur thermal power plant and the ILFS power plant at Pudhuchathiram from Karaikal Port.

The division had also loaded 28,980 metric tonnes of lignite from Vadalur to Uthangalmangalam where the TAQA power company is situated.

Railway sources said the Tiruchi division would be taking all steps to ensure uninterrupted movement of all essential commodities.

Meanwhile, the Tiruchi Railway Division has fully closed six broad gauge sections falling under its jurisdiction till April 14 as a temporary measure.

The divisional railway administration had sent a communication in this regard on Wednesday to the field-level railway personnel working in those sections. The broad gauge sections which have been fully closed were: Tiruvarur - Karaikudi, Karaikal - Nagore, Nagapattinam -Velankanni, Nidamangalam - Mannargudi, Kurinjipadi - Cuddalore Port and Villupuram - Puducherry.

A senior railway official said the sections were closed since no freight operations by rail were taking places on these stretches. Whenever there was a requirement, the sections would be opened at a short notice, the official added.

However, the station masters have been asked to visit the respective station/ traffic level crossings every day to ensure that all railway assets were in proper order.

In the Tiruvarur - Karaikudi section via Pattukottai, Peravurani and Aranthangi only one DEMU (Diesel Electric Multiple Unit) train was being operated until recently with mobile gatekeepers on board ever since the stretch was converted from metre gauge to broad gauge.

Although the railway administration had completely stopped operation of passenger trains in all sections, it was operating freight trains for movement of essential commodities.

The Tiruchi Railway Division has also communicated that there would be restricted operations in the Villupuram - Katpadi, Villupuram - Cuddalore - Alapakkam and Thanjavur - Mayiladuthurai broad gauge sections with single shift from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The chord line section from Tiruchi Junction to Villupuram via Ariyalur and Vriddhachalam continued to remain open round-the-clock for operation of freight trains.

Southern Railway administration has also instructed that the freight trains should run at a maximum speed not exceeding 50 kilometre per hour in all sections in its jurisdiction.

Further, only a minimum number of personnel should be called for freight trains operations to move essential commodities. A senior official said the railways were ready to transport essential commodities whenever required at short notice.

Railway sources said all traffic staff were asked to be readily available on mobile phone at all times to attend to any emergency duty. Railway personnel have also been asked to maintain personal hygiene.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/tiruchi-railway-division-loads-over-9000-metric-tonnes-of-rice-in-four-days/article31184253.ece
429,2020/03/27,Private hospitals shut doors for visitors,"Visitors are not allowed to call on in-patients and barred from entering the hospital premises. Only one attendant per patient is allowed to stay at the hospital.

Falling in line with the directions issued by the Health Ministry, private hospitals in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts have put in place stringent measures on their premises to check the spread of COVID-19 pandemic.

Visitors are not allowed to call on in-patients and barred from entering the hospital premises. Only one attendant per patient is allowed to stay at the hospital. In order to make this initiative purposeful, in most of the private hospitals inter-changing of caretakers at regular intervals was also not entertained except for critical cases where changeover was inevitable.

Interestingly, the move seems to have elicited a good response from relatives and friends of the patients, said a security personnel of a private hospital in Thanjavur. “Some people who initially insisted that they be allowed to call on their dear ones convalescing at the hospital, later got convinced and went back,” he said.

“As far as outpatients were concerned, attendants are allowed, if necessary,” said S. Marimuthu, president, Indian Medical Association, Thanjavur branch. The patients were allowed to meet the doctors only if they complied with the COVID-19 virus spreading prevention exercises. If such patients were found suffering from high body temperature, they were referred to Thanjavur Medical College hospital immediately, Dr. Marimuthu said.

Tiruvarur

In Tiruvarur district, those seeking medical advice were told to interact with the doctors through video conferencing and only if needed they were given an appointment to meet the doctor, said B. Lakshmanasamy, president, IMA, Tiruvarur branch,

At the hospitals, the staff were posted on duty on alternate days and all those entering the premises were asked to use hand sanitiser.

In both the districts, private hospitals have postponed elective surgeries, Dr. Lakshmanasamy said.

Efforts were also being initiated to comply with the government’s direction to keep 25% of beds for use in case of any exigency that might arise due to COVID-19 pandemic. At some hospitals, some of the non-medical employees such as ward boys, cleaners etc., have failed to turn up for duty from March 25 presumably due to fear of contracting COVID-19 virus.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/9ez0nc/article31195882.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY28VISITORTAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/private-hospital-shut-doors-for-visitors/article31184226.ece

As per the list provided by the Immigration Department, a total of 4961 persons have landed at the airports in the country on March 1 and on later dates and reached their native places in Thanjavur district.

The list was provided to the 1,183 teams formed based on the number of public distribution shops in the district, in order to ensure that all those living in the jurisdiction of the respective PDS outlets were covered without fail, have intensified their efforts.

These teams have started calling on the families of such persons to enquire about the health condition of the foreign returnees and as well as those residing in those houses, official sources said.

As part of the exercise, the foreign returnees have been stamped for self-quarantine even though they do not suffer from COVID-19 symptoms.

Stamping objected

While officials justified their action of stamping foreign returnees by claiming that it would help monitor their movement, relatives of some of the foreign returnees such as Balan of Salai Street, Kumbakonam, opposed the action by stating that such a measure causes mental agony not only for the person but also for the individual’s family members. Stamping a healthy person was unwarranted, he said.

Meanwhile, a woman who returned from Singapore was spotted along with her mother at Melavasal near Mannargudi in Tiruvarur district on Thursday.

According to sources, the 44-year old woman hailing from a hamlet near Vaduvur had returned from Singapore on March 13 against the advice of her husband. She went to her relative’s house at Alakudi in Thanjavur taluk instead of going to her house and stayed at Alakudi till March 25.

She left Alakudi on March 26 after her relatives had asked her to return to her house in view of the COVID-19 virus scare. But instead of proceeding to her house, she called up her mother, and started searching for a house at Melavasal hamlet.

As their replies were not convincing, the residents who the women approached for rental accommodation grew suspicious and informed the Mannargudi police.

On interrogation, the woman admitted that she had returned from Singapore and she was stamped for self-quarantine. She was sent home by the officials.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/special-teams-ascertaining-health-condition-of-returnees-from-abroad/article31184210.ece

432,2020/03/27,Karaikal tries out a novel strategy to keep people indoors,"Karaikal district administration has initiated a novel method of reaching out to residents with daily supplies such as milk, vegetable and groceries to make sure they stay indoors.

Dividing the district into 18 zones, the administration has identified three self-help groups in each zone to perform the task. There will be a nodal person in each zone with whom the residents in the jurisdiction could convey their requirements over phone, District Collector Arjun Sharma said.

The nodal person will take the orders, procure the supplies, and have them delivered at the doorsteps through the members of the self-help-groups in a time-bound manner.

Alongside, the residents have also been provided with the phone numbers of super markets in their respective areas. The super markets have also been instructed to deliver essential commodities at the doorsteps

Earlier this week, the Collector, in keeping with the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs for observance during the 21-day lock down period, deployed Executive Magistrate/ Incident Commanders for overall implementation of containment measures in their jurisdiction.

Tahsildar /Deputy Tahsildars have been designated as incident commanders under the overall supervision of sub divisional magistrates.

They will ensure movement of essentials and sort out complaints received from the public with utmost seriousness, the Collector said.

A 25-year-old woman tested positive for COVID-19 ,making her the first case of the infection in Ariyalur district. She is under observation at the Ariyalur Government Hospital and is being closely monitored, doctors said.

The woman, a native of Ariyalur had been working in Chennai for a few years. “She had been working in a shopping mall in Velachery, Chennai and was residing in Saidapet,” official sources at the Ariyalur GH said.

The patient had approached the doctors at the hospital on March 20 with a cold and fever after returning to her home in Ariyalur the previous day. “We will conduct another test on the 7th and 14th day after the first test. There is no need to worry,” the doctor said.

The patient's family, co-workers and close contacts have been traced and asked to remain in home quarantine, he said. Passengers of the bus in which the patient travelled in, would also be traced, he added.

Ariyalur GH has a set up a 200-bed isolation ward on its campus to tackle the novel coronavirus outbreak. “Work on the construction of our two-floored new building has just been completed when the need for isolation wards arose. We decided to use the entire building,” a doctor said.

434,2020/03/27,"Exposed to the elements, and virus risk too","Post lockdown, destitute and migrant workers have turned most vulnerable

After imposition of lockdown, people who are destitute and homeless, and migrant workers have turned out to be both vulnerable and potential carriers of coronavirus (COVID-19).

At present, there are about 200 migrant workers from Odisha and Chhattisgarh and about 6,000 destitute and homeless persons in the city. About 1,800 destitute persons can be found in the core city area, comprising zones II, III and IV. And, most importantly, about 15% of them are mentally or physically challenged.

According to secretary of the Association for Urban and Tribal Development (AUTD) Pragada Vasu, about 240 homeless persons are accommodated in the eight shelter homes in the city, three of which are operated by the AUTD and the remaining by other NGOs and the GVMC.

‘Potential carriers’

“The threat of contracting the virus is low for those remaining indoors. But those who live in the open under the flyovers, near railway stations and RK Beach are prone to get infected and become potential carriers,” says former bureaucrat E.A.S. Sarma.

“Prior to the lockdown, these destitute persons used to get some food from the passers-by. A few restaurants used to give them leftover food, if any. However, post lockdown, they are stuck at one place as they cannot move about due to strict enforcement of law by the police. As a result, finding a morsel of food has become scarce,” says Mr. Vasu.

Need of the hour

“A few NGOs such as the AUTD have taken upon themselves the task of serving food to such persons, but that is not adequate. There is a need for the government to intervene and provide them food, clothing, medicines and shelter,” Mr. Sarma observes.

Referring to the migrant workers, Mr. Sarma says that many of them hailing from Odisha are stranded in the city. These helpless people are squatting under the city’s flyovers. Efforts are on to provide them temporary shelter. They need medical attention. The local authorities are providing food.

The arrangements made by the authorities to allow smooth transactions at the fishing harbour in the city amid the lockdown failed to yield the desired result as utter chaos prevailed at the auction centre on Friday, throwing the social distancing norms to the wind.

A similar situation was reported from the fishing harbour on Thursday, after 15 boats after their voyage returned to the shore with a good catch.

In an attempt to contain the rush, the authorities decided to allow the sale of fish from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.

On Friday morning, a huge number of customers and retail traders thronged the market and the authorities failed to regulate the crowd.

Chaotic scenes were witnessed when a big crowd gathered at the auction centre and market. Sources said that the number of police personnel deployed at the entry point of the harbour could not regulate the crowd.

Strict regulations

Andhra Pradesh Mechanised Boat Operators’ Association president P.C. Appa Rao told The Hindu that the failure to adhere to the social distancing norm would make the people vulnerable for the COVID-19 infection. He urged the authorities to ensure strict regulation for prospective buyers.

Meanwhile, the fisheries officials held talks with the district administration on this issue. Sources said that delayed arrival of police to the auction centre led to the confusion on Friday.

Social distancing

The district administration has put the containment area, about 3-km radius from the house from where the fourth COVID-19 positive case was reported under surveillance, Collector V. Vinay Chand said here on Friday.

“The health department was expecting that the patient’s samples would test positive as he came with a close contact of the third COVID-19 positive patient. The sample report confirming positive was received from Tirupati on Thursday night,” he said.

All containment measures including sanitation and checking the health conditions of the residents have been followed and the teams would repeat it one more time, Mr. Chand told the media here.

Surveillance app

The Collector said a constant surveillance was being maintained on 2,795 foreign returnees in the district, for which the officials were using a special app.

The district officials have sent 112 samples for testing till date, of which four cases have been tested positive, while 96 samples have been confirmed negative. “We are awaiting results of 10 more samples. Two samples have been sent for tests again,” he said.

579 field teams

The Collector appealed to the citizens not to panic, but made sure that they followed all the precautionary measures diligently. “As many as 579 exclusive field surveillance teams are working in the district. They are rushing to houses whenever they receive a complaint,” he said.

Isolation centre

Mr. Chand said that the district administration was all prepared for the coming days in case if the infection count went up. The Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) will serve as the regional isolation centre for four districts of Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam.

“Only critical and hyper critical COVID-19 cases (above 50 years of age and people having health complications) from these four districts will be referred to the VIMS, while the other cases will be referred to other district COVID-19 hospitals—Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases (GHCCD), NRI and GITAM. All the persons who were placed under quarantine at the VIMS have been shifted to Gayatri Hospital,” he added.

The Collector said that two accommodation centres for the persons who were stranded in the city due to the lockdown had been set up. “We have opened a 80-bed centre at Vepagunta and another 60-bed facility at MVP Colony. As of now, 23 stranded persons including those from Arunachal Pradesh have been accommodated to the MVP Colony facility. If necessary, we will increase the capacity,” he said.

‘Abide by 2-km rule’

The Collector also appealed to the citizens no to go beyond 2-km radius of their houses to buy essential commodities.

“The administration has set up more rythu bazaars in various areas. In a bid to make vegetables available, the APSRTC is running Palle Velugu special buses from seven different places. We have given permission to five major suppliers for door delivery of essential commodities,” said Mr. Chand.

Videos and pictures depicting alleged poor sanitation and facilities at the quarantine facility at Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) and isolation ward at Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases (GHCCD), continue to surface on social media platforms.

Another video surfaces

On Friday, a video of a person showing unhygienic food packets allegedly supplied to the patients in the isolation ward at GHCCD was doing the rounds in several WhatsApp groups. This was not the first video, as a few days ago pictures of the food being provided in polythene packets circulated in the social media, drawing criticism.

Responding to these pictures and videos, Collector V. Vinay Chand on Friday ruled out the allegations over poor quality food and lack of proper toilets at the quarantine facilities.

He questioned the authenticity of such videos and pictures. “Earlier I came to know that packing of food was not good and asked the supplier to change it immediately. Similarly, the sanitation department is maintaining the toilets in good condition. We have been responding to the complaints instantly and taking proper steps to ensure comfort to those in isolation facilities,” he said.

“I agree that the GHCCD is not of a five-star hotel range hospital, and it is not designed for COVID-19 treatment. However, we are creating basic facilities there.

Bhairavi Prakash, Founder, Mithra Trust

People are reaching out to us on Instagram for help. We have a highlight reel, Covid19 Tips, to offer resources that we update regularly. We’ve also had discussions on several topics, like being ‘productive’ and learning a new skill. Many feel this pressure is too high, especially when everyone is posting about what they are doing. We say, it is okay to not be productive; it is okay to binge-watch shows, stress eat, and cry. Different people cope in different ways. Dealing with financial strain is another hot topic, as many freelancers and entrepreneurs are not sure how to pay bills this month, or if the services they offer will stand valid. The pressure to have a solution or a new offering is also very high. My three self-care steps: do something you love [sing, dance, etc], connect with someone you have not spoken with in a while, and engage with inspiration [nature, motivational quotes, art]. We’ve just launched The Meh — virtual gatherings that provide a safe space to express fears and concerns, a sense of community and belonging, and tools to help cope and ride out this wave.

Remember, you are not alone. Be honest about experiencing panic and fear. Reach out to one person a day, check on them, share something uplifting. Follow the news just to be aware [too much will induce panic]. Read offline and online, walk or exercise indoors, meditate, spend time with pets [if any] and connect with nature. I’d suggest looking for creative activities, looking for creative activities, DIY craft hobby videos, or even signing up for an online course. It is the best time to explore and experiment.

Dr Debanjan Banerjee, geriatric psychiatrist, NIMHANS, Bengaluru

For the last month, I have been constantly answering queries and debunking misinformation related to the illness. I get five to 10 calls every day about the risks, the need for testing, routes of viral transmission and treatment requests. A patient with an anxiety disorder reached out because his neighbour works in an office where a case was detected. Another medical practitioner contacted me because she feared infecting her five-year-old child. Stay away from social media as much as possible — you do not need to be updated with every statistic! And do not self-medicate. The elderly are the most vulnerable because, in most cases, they do not use smartphones and need to be told about the precautions. Research shows even a weekly telephonic counselling session can help improve their quality of life. Resources to follow: icmr.nic.in, who.int, cdc.gov, and ha-asia.com

Due to an overload of misinformation, uncertainty about the future, isolation and changed lifestyles post the lockdown, people may experience issues such as anxiety and stress. Those with existing conditions are also finding it difficult to cope. So it is critical that we prioritise our mental health. Start with meditation or yoga, consume good content and know that you can reach out to people when facing emotional distress. Recommended resources: Visit apa.org and mind.org.uk. Covibook — available for download on mindheart.co — is great to deal with anxiety among children. Earlier this week, the Foundation has also started a newsletter.

441,2020/03/27,"I, me, myself: The lockdown edit","It is like the holidays are here early, but with none of the benefits. Amid fears of Covid-19 and being housebound, people who are living on their own speak up

It is the season of coronavirus and panic. It is also the season of memes. From silly ones that call our PM the prime minister because of his prime time 8 pm speeches to the gazillion posts on the West panic buying toilet paper (water and soap are your best friends), there’s a veritable flood on social media. But we certainly need the laughs — in the midst of worrying about falling sick, shaky finances, emptying pantries and being in each others’ hair all day long.

“I’ve been alone, on a two-week quarantine. I’ve been on FaceTime with my therapist because it was traumatic trying to get back from Italy. I’ve been finding comfort and humour in my Instagram community. I started the ‘Where we write’ series because, even as a writer who spends a fair amount of time at her desk, this lockdown entailed even longer hours. So I started thinking how everyone around the world is spending time at their desk; I wanted a glimpse of that. I loved that every work space was different and unique — just like us all. And what we shared was this lockdown experience and having a space to retreat to,” says Janice Pariat, writer-poet.

A tribe that’s coping with it a little better, however, is the one that’s been living alone. It is a lifestyle choice they’ve always enjoyed, and it hasn’t changed today — despite not being able to step out or meet people. “I was reading the other day that divorce rates have gone up in China, so there are perks of being single in the time of corona!” laughs actor Chandan Roy Sanyal, as we connect over WhatsApp and voice notes. On a break from shooting in Ayodhya for Prakash Jha’s upcoming web show, he is using the time to relax and catch up with friends on group video chats (“they are calling me up at three in the morning!”).

Of course, this is privilege, and they are the first to admit it. But they also insist that they should be the ones to instigate conversations now. “Since we — the 1% who can stay at home in nice surroundings and with stocked pantries — have the luxury of learning from this, we should,” says Varun Rana, former fashion features director of Harper’s Bazaar India. “We need to take the time to re-evaluate our social, retail and consumerist behaviour. A big conversation that is going to come out of all this is mental health... and the state of medical care and education in our country.”

We speak to a few on how they are handling the 21-day lockdown.

Chandan Roy Sanyal, 40, actor, Mumbai

There is a lot of darkness and anxiety now, but I’m coping well. Because I travel so much, I don’t get much time to stay at home. Now I’m finally connecting with my house that I moved into a year back — watering my plants, feeding my cats and listening to the birds from my balcony. I’m getting hooked. I also make funny Instagram videos [dancing to ‘A Real Hero’ by Electric Youth and ‘O Maria O Maria’ from Saagar to show how you can make daily chores like mopping fun] to cheer people up. Life has become more structured; I sleep and wake up on time, do my twice-a-day yoga/stretching sessions, cook, read, listen to music. I’ve picked up the guitar again and my aim is to compose my first song on it by the time the 21 days are over. With so much to read and see, I’m constantly on social media — I follow Ricky Gervais [writer-co-creator of The Office], I really like his form of comedy. I also have great neighbours. The Malayali family who lives across from me sends over sambar, Kerala fish curry and rasam, which I love. But I do fear losing the internet and electricity [there was a power outage the other day]. That’s when it will be World War III.

Varun Rana, 36, Communications consultant, Delhi

I’ve been living by myself for the past three years and I’m used to managing things on my own. But being alone has forced me to [rethink priorities]. Every day I’m on Instagram video chat with friends and old teachers from around the world, rediscovering connections. We are doing online hangouts — pouring a drink and chatting. I’m also talking more with my parents. At first, though, I was screaming at them to stay home; it seems they’ve become the kids and I’ve become the parent. I’m re-evaluating things that I’ve taken for granted, discovering different ways of being. I have a beautiful terrace garden, where I’m growing green beans [and reaping and stir frying them]. I’m also getting back to cooking — I just made an orecchiette in an amatriciana sauce, and some sweet atta cheelas (pancakes) with coconut and nolen gur from Kolkata. A real discovery is my music. I’ve picked up my sitar again and I do riyaz every day. It brings me a lot of peace and a sense of calm. In this uncertain world, there is the surety that when I strike with my finger is on a certain fret, a specific sound will come out. Nothing can alter that fact. I also try not to dwell on the disadvantages [of the present time]. Social media is such an echo chamber — the more negativity and first world problems we put out there, the more we amplify it.

Samit Basu, 40, novelist-filmmaker, Delhi

I’ve been by myself for almost 17 years. I know it is pure privilege, but apart from the news, life remains mostly the same. It is the worry about the pandemic that is the challenge... and trying to buy the essentials without getting beaten up by the police! If you’ve worked from home for a long time, you develop systems to cope. Most writers I know are now doing more house management, supply chain management. While I don’t have any feelings of loneliness or panic, it can be a concern for others. So I spend time reaching out, just letting them know that things will be OK. I’m also telling friends that, at a time of unprecedented crisis like this, there is no need to start setting productivity goals, saying, ‘I will now run through my checklist of lifelong ambitions and I will become Tolstoy by Friday’. People should give themselves space to cope with the crisis. I’m always writing something, and I’m doing research for a new book. A peeve, however, is that balconies are now full of anxious people shouting on their phones, and I’m far too intimately acquainted with who is going through a break-up and whose office is not doing well. I’m worried that soon they are going to start playing anatakshari or tambola. I’ve also cut myself off from fake news by relentlessly blocking and muting suspicious people and sources on Twitter and across social media. That is a huge mental health step — people aren’t factoring in the psychological damage of being exposed to such news day after day.

Swapna Gite, 31, manager - Corporate Communications, Pune

I’ve been home alone for almost three weeks and [despite the challenges] I don’t think I will rethink staying independently in the future. I’m happy being by myself. I’m using social media more now — following groups that do live yoga sessions on Instagram [my gym is sharing circuits too]. The office is making sure we are live on video for all our meetings, so we feel engaged and keep things interactive. Recently we had a farewell party online. My colleague is based in London, so we patched in on Microsoft Teams, opened a bottle of wine and had a digital party. It was lovely! I do feel lonely sometimes, so I’m planning my days: yoga/exercise in the morning, then I cook something healthy — today I’m going to try a few different types of salads — work, log on to Netflix [I like watching inspiring shows like Self Care], and settle down with a book and a glass of wine. I’m enjoying Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life right now. I don’t watch too much news; I depend on WhatsApp friends’ groups for relevant articles. But food is always an escape. I explore various sources and chefs’ pages before I experiment. I recently replicated a strawberry salad I’d tried some time back in Goa.

Varun Singh, 29, project manager - Marketing Insights, Sodexo, Paris

The quarantine measures are stricter in France. I can’t go farther than 2 km from where I live and every time I step out I have to carry a self-attested certificate with the purpose clearly stated. It has been tough, but I’m coping with the isolation. I’ve always enjoyed the independent lifestyle and, of course, technology helps. I’m constantly on Zoom and WhatsApp — for my family’s Sunday video call, my dad patches in from Delhi, my mum from Bengaluru, and my brother from Bristol, UK. Our work meetings are on Microsoft Teams; we’ve suddenly jumped into this digital way of interacting and it is working. I also try to get in some physical activity every day [there is a beautiful park nearby]. This is super critical for me, to clear my mind and keep me motivated. A couple of months ago I’d started CrossFit, and, fortunately, I’d decided to buy the equipment. This is coming in handy now. I’m also a big advocate of meditation. Friends keep me busy. We catch up on the Houseparty app, to play Pictionary and quizzes in a virtual room. Since there is a lot of time for personal development, I am doing courses in machine learning on Coursera and Udacity — one is theoretical and the other, practical. And for my French, I have the local radio on all the time.

Saina Jayapal, 41, PR consultant, Bengaluru

I’ve been living alone for well over a decade, but as an extrovert, the quarantine is quite hard on me. There is only so much Netflix you can watch! This is not the first time that I have been through this — when actor Rajkumar was kidnapped [by brigand Veerappan in 2000], we were in a similar situation. The difference is, then, we could tell where the danger lay. Since the coronavirus is an invisible entity, it is more anxiety-inducing. That said, I’m used to being prepared for most eventualities, with backups for water, medicine and food. There are a lot of elderly people living in my apartment block, so I shop for their groceries and leave it outside their doors to maintain social distance. Otherwise, I have been cooking up a storm.

Deepti Adlakha, 35, professor, Queen’s University Belfast, UK

We are getting inventive with ways to approximate human contact and keep our spirits up, through virtual coffee meetings and hangouts. I am used to working remotely but not every single day — so this is a new normal. The key is establishing a routine for both work and leisure. Flexibility is an advantage. I can manage my day better and take breaks in-between to recharge. The lockdown has provided me with quiet time to myself, an opportunity to break away from the rush of everyday life. I am catching up on books I’ve wanted to read and pending writing tasks, which otherwise fall to the bottom of my list due to time pressures. My challenge has been dealing with the heightened anxiety and fear, inevitable in these unprecedented times. Being away from family back home in India causes an overall sense of helplessness as I worry about their health and well-being. It is very important to take care of not just physical health, but also mental health during a crisis. I start my day with deep breathing and stretching exercises, followed by yoga and guided meditation. I repeat this process in the evenings and also go for a walk around the block, while maintaining my physical distance.

Rishi Singh, 27, operations management, Rolls Royce (aerospace), Bristol, UK

Things now are unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. It feels like we are all living in a movie. I still have to go into work, but the workforce has been split and put in shifts to minimise mixing. One of the silver linings is that, unlike earlier, when my working hours tend to stretch, now I am forced to stick to a timetable. So, when I can get home I have more time to myself. I use a threefold approach for my mental health. A big way for me to stay sane is to go out and do some form of exercise. So I run or cycle; it refreshes my mind and the endorphins keep me in a good state of mind. Then I try to avoid reading too much news related to coronavirus [except for the absolute essentials] because if it is all I’m going to be thinking about it is not healthy. Finally, I have a pretty wacky set of friends who are in the same boat, with no outlet for their wackiness. We catch up regularly online for some light-hearted banter. I’m not big on social media and I stay in touch with my family over WhatsApp. I’m thinking of signing up for a course on Coursera and also brush up on my Hindi, which is deteriorating.

Aravind S*, 33, manufacturing engineer, Iowa, USA

I came to the US on a project on March 1 and have been at my hotel, under lockdown, since March 20. I’ve been working from my room and it has been over four days since I stepped out. Staying alone and away from my family is challenging; I am disturbed physically and mentally. I have stopped availing the complimentary breakfast because I don’t want to risk it. I have stocked up on whatever is available and I am cooking in my room’s built-in kitchen. I avoid spending too much time on social media as the surfeit of information causes panic. I have colleagues at the hotel and we help each other with food and emotional support. I listen to music on YouTube and watch movies on Amazon Prime Video to keep busy.

Disha S*, 33, senior bank executive, Alipurduar

I have been living alone only for a few months, so dealing with something like this has been really challenging. And since banks are working, we have no choice but to report to work. My family [in Siliguri] is worried, but the onus is on us to help essential services function smoothly. There are fewer people at ATMs now and we are seeing more cash withdrawals. My regular workday is from 9 am to 3 pm. We try and keep things jovial at the workplace to help us all cope together. As there is no public transport, I walk to work and back, which is about 2-2.5 km. I watch movies on Netflix and Amazon Prime, and listen to music. I have started reading again and Sidney Sheldon’s The Phoenix is my current favourite.

Anwar Rasheed*, 34, marketing executive, New Delhi

I have been indoors for over a month because I fractured my foot and am still recovering. Being away from family is tougher now, but I am trying to remain upbeat, learning how to cook by watching videos on Instagram [@kannammacooks]. My friends are also guiding me over WhatsApp video calls. I am a voracious reader. I am also trying out adult colouring books and entertaining myself with dog videos online.

D Elango, 59, senior AC technician, Chennai

My two daughters live in Bengaluru and my wife stays with one of them, to help take care of our grandchild. I usually travel on the weekends to see them, but with the lockdown, that is out of the question. We keep in touch through regular calls and WhatsApp. It gets very lonely, no matter how much I try to keep myself occupied. Since last Sunday, I’ve been home and the lack of face-to-face human interaction is taking its toll. So I spend my time watching TV, movies on Amazon Prime Video, listening to music and reading. I have also been doing all the house work and cooking, so there are a lot of learning curves.

442,2020/03/27,Kochi’s love for community animals,"Animal welfare groups rally to feed community animals during the Covid-19 lockdown

Kochi: “With hotels and homes shut due to Covid-19, there is virtually no food for the street dogs in the city,” says Ashwini Prem of Oneness Foundation, that works for animal, plant and human welfare. “If these are times of distress for us, it is equally distressing for the community animals that depends on us for their food.”

Kochi has around 7000-10,000 street dogs and, once the lockdown was announced and the city came to a standstill, they are at a loss for food.

“Community kitchens have been set up for people who are unable to access food but what about animals?” says Ashwini. Oneness called for volunteers who would reach out to the animals but found that the police would not allow them to move around. “In case permission is granted — and we are very hopeful as different districts and states have exempted travel for such acts — food will be distributed at a fixed time and place,” says Ashwini.

So far, the organistaion has 20 volunteers but the number is not enough, she says. They have created a chart marking a volunteer for an area to drop off food for the animals.

Dhyan Foundation, based in West Kochi, has also swung into action. The organisation, which runs animal shelters, has been feeding community animals through a unique Roti Bank that was begun earlier to feed animals in the shelter.

“We have asked people to contribute more rotis as we need to feed the animals on the streets who cannot fend for themselves,” says Dr Prasan Prabhakar, founder. They generally drop off food at certain key points where the dogs generally hang out.

443,2020/03/27,Lockdown parenting: It’s time to slow down,"The next few weeks will see you making great memories with your child and learning that you don’t have to be a super parent all the time

“Mama, let us chat about trains.”

On a normal day, this would have been a perfect way to spend a few quiet moments bonding with my 10-year-old. But it is 7 am, when I am in the bathroom trying to start another day of curfew with some me-time.

With the nation-wide lockdown firmly in place, families are struggling with having their children at home all day. Happily, for many, school exams are cancelled and the pressure to study has been taken away for now. Yet summer looms.

The minute lockdown orders were issued, parents panicked. What would our kids do all day, especially if they could not go out to play? No playdates, no summer camp, no office to escape to. All that time stuck at home — that is something to worry about, in addition to spying on elderly parents determined to go out to chat with the neighbours.

Ignore those forwards

Parenting in the time of coronavirus has taken on a whole new meaning with 24x7 access to social media and well-meaning, equally panicky friends. We have all received a dozen or more WhatsApp messages listing colourful DIY timetables, websites and apps that will not only keep your child busy but will also energise his/her brain on holiday. For parents already struggling to keep children busy, are these forwards helping or causing them more pressure?

Business analyst Sayantika Adak Ghosh ignores the WhatsApp messages, when it comes to her six-year-old son. “I have a more instinctive approach,” she says. “Some things are non-negotiable: food, schedule, discipline, behaviour. I let him figure out the rest.”

But Ramya Coushik, a software marketer, natural farmer and parent to two boys, 14 and 11, says they do not have a structure in place “as my boys and I believe that a rigid format would be a killjoy during summer vacations. Not everything gets done every day — they decide the schedule and get to each of the activities a couple of times a week based on their preference. We fit in TV and gaming [a rarity in our household] around the mandatory activities.”

Online lessons

Children in IB and some other schools still have assignments, e-lessons and homework to do. “I am making sure my daughter completes projects even though they may no longer be required to be submitted,” says Mumbai-based Pearl D’Silva, parent to a 10-year-old. She, however, does not feel the need to keep up with what her daughter’s classmates are up to. “We do homework but also practise maths, French, essay writing, painting and guitar.”

Celebrities are not exempt from the curfew studying either. On her Twitter feed, Twinkle Khanna echoes parents everywhere when she says, “Three hours into day one of virtual learning with my first grader and I want to stab my eye with a fork.”

Office-going parents who are now working from home have to be creative in getting things done. “I work for a telecom MNC,” says Sindhu Murthy. During routine meetings and calls, she makes her eight-year-old son sit beside her because he finds them interesting. “I do not mind the WhatsApp forwards. If it looks interesting, I do not think it is a nuisance. Doing these things with my child is more of an escape from this dystopian reality. I would choose making a paper cup ninja over looking through Covid-19 statistics any day.”

What’s your style?

In the first few days as countries worldwide began locking down their cities, social media had a lot of fun with memes on homeschooling and working-from-home. Homeschooling parents are having the last laugh, though. Their experience with having children at home all day (and the responsibility of educating them) is holding them in good stead now.

“Scheduling is fluid in our home, because we do not see learning as happening only from textbooks,” says Ijeoma Akomolafe. She and her husband Bayo, both professors, are homeschooling their children aged 6 and 2. “If my older one feels like playing shop all day, then we do so, and she learns to work with math, spelling, English by writing up receipts for the customers.”

For schooling parents, Akomolafe recommends you see this as a ‘gap year’, “a year you allow your kids to ask the most outrageous questions, let them play with mud — a year you learn to listen to them and to your own inner child. Find ways to integrate learning in everyday activities and allow the kids to plan and schedule their learning.”

She also reminds us that, “We are only as healthy as the sickest among us. The times are urgent. Slow down.”

This stressful time will also help us explore what kind of parent we are becoming. Helicopter parents might crash. Try being a hovercraft instead, or a gentler parent gliding over all the bumps in your day. You are still hovering, but there is a lot less noise and potential for hair-tearing scenes.

As for us, we are trying PE with Joe, learning how to be a sous chef and struggling not to finish our stash of tea-time snacks. The discussions about trains, planes and robots can wait until I am out of the bathroom. Which might take a while — these new handwashing guidelines are a sanity-saver.

Moms speak

Komal Narang, @myhappinesz

Earlier, my three-year-old was an outdoor kid and never had screen time. Now that I allow him to watch YouTube (mainly our family vlogs), he is taking some time to adjust to the change. Apart from his sleeping and eating schedule, which remain the same, we take each day as it comes. We’ve even started our own book club! It is restricted to six picture books or so a day. We used to read page after page, but now that we have the time, we have slowed down. We take time to look at the illustrations, I ask him what he sees... It is a more mindful way of reading.

Harpreet Suri, @momwearsprada

As a mother of two, a boy and a girl, I have been allowing them to use this time to explore as they please. While Arhann (9) has school work (they have started online classes now), Aayat (3) is enjoying time in our garden. Earlier, I used to stop her from playing in the mud and getting dirty. But I have realised that this is a golden period that they might never get again. So there are hardly any rules about what they should do through the day.

Ishani Vellodi Reddy, @ishanivellodiwellness

I have been very aggressive about planning each day, to make sure that I am spending quality time with Vishnu. I structure our schedules in such a way that when I'm busy with work, he has an independent activity. Then there are the things we do together for fun, like cooking or having a dance party — the kind of silly games we grown-ups never have time for otherwise. We have also taken the opportunity to teach him social responsibility, by telling him that we are staying home for the good of the country, and not just our loved ones.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/bk6ky5/article31181373.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-1026164798,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/over-the-next-21-days-you-can-learn-that-you-dont-have-to-be-a-super-parent-all-the-time/article31181376.ece
