1,['12/03/2020'],Vinay Forrt: 2020 will be a game changer for me: Vinay Forrt,"There is hope, confidence and contentment in Vinay Forrt ’s voice. His upcoming films will bring a twist to his acting journey, he tells us. He is effusive about his character David in Malik and excited about essaying the lead role in Lijo Jose Pellisserry ’s next, Churuli.In his Fort Kochi slang, the Thamaasha actor says that people who still identify him as Java from 2015-movie Premam would now get a shocker. “There is a dark side in every human, and Malik and Churuli will show another side of my acting,” says Vinay, as he joins us for a candid chat.It is a movie that actually said aloud the things that are usually said between two people. The film revolves around an event and every character in it is integral. It is a director's film and Shambu Purushothaman is someone with a strong point of view. Unfortunately, it did not do so well in theatres, maybe because the team didn't know how to market it well. I am sure that it will be celebrated once it comes on television or online.I play David; he is the second lead to Fahadh's titular role, Suleiman Malik. David is a real-life character, who lived in Thiruvananthapuram. The movie is inspired by a true incident. David is very close to my heart and the favourite among the characters I have played so far, because it is very different from anything I have done.It is a meaty role. It is a story about the survival of the people in the coastal area. David is a grey character, moving to the darker side, and the film explains why. He is loud and it was physically challenging for me to essay him, as well. I have four get ups in the movie and made changes in my body language and looks.The story goes through the character’s life from his 20s to his mid-50s. To prepare for the role, I did not take up any films for almost six months and the shooting went on for five months.After Take Off, I always wanted to do a Mahesh Narayanan movie. Mahesh has a vision about the movie and he gets what he wants.Of course. I grew up watching fishermen in Fort Kochi so the characters in the film were familiar to me. I was able to relate with their body language and the way the drape their lungis. David is raw and not at all sophisticated. Also, I was able to give a high tempo to his voice, and it is like this for 90% of the film. I have never played up the drama so much in any of my films. It is a blessing for an actor to have such dramatic characters. I usually internalise to get into character, here I was able to externalise as well.Jis is a very good friend of mine and Mikacha Nadan Mohankumar is a feel-good movie. In the industry, we jokingly call him the new-gen Sathyan Anthikad. Like Jis' other films, this is filled with goodness and everybody will enjoy it. The film has three important characters, essayed by Siddique, Kunchacko Boban and myself.My character, Aghosh Menon represents new-gen actors. He has only done four films, all of which were superhits and the film portrays his struggles with managing his sudden fame. It belongs to realistic comedy genre. For me Mikacha Nadan Mohankumar and Malik, almost shows me at two ends of the spectrum.Churuli was my bucket list tick as I had always wished that I should act in at least one of Lijo chettan's films ever since I saw City of God. Now, I can boast of having the lead role in Thamaasha, which was bankrolled by him and his directorial, Churuli. All this happened because of Chemban chettan ( Chemban Vinod Jose ), who suggested my name for these films. Lijo chettan is a different kind of filmmaker. We completed our shoot in 19 days. It has a superb screenplay by S Hareesh based on Vinoy Thomas ’ story.Malik and Churuli are very important for me, as post Thamaasha the scripts that came to me were all about the problems faced by a regular, simple guy and the characters where cliched. I had rejected many of these offers. These two films mark a different genre of grey characters.I am sure after the release of these films, the comments like ‘De da Java ponu’, ‘Eda Java’ will change. 2020 will be special in my acting life, which I began in my classroom at the age of four. Going by how it has gone so far, I know this year will be a game changer for me. It will showcase my favourite roles and my best films.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74575678,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1259990/74575678.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/2020-will-be-a-game-changer-for-me-vinay-forrt/articleshow/74575678.cms
2,['12/03/2020'],777 charlie: 777 Charlie’s pooches on pan-India road trip,"Team 777 Charlie has been busy travelling all around the country, and wrapping up one schedule after another. Speaking to us from Amritsar, director Kiranraj K shares, “We are currently shooting in Punjab, which is part of a 15-day schedule that includes other locations such as Gujarat and Rajasthan. With this, we complete close to 65% of the film, and will head back to Bengaluru. In April, the team will travel to Kodaikanal, Shimla, and conclude at Kashmir. We are looking at wrapping up the shoot by the first week of May.” This travel-heavy schedule might seem daunting to many, and here’s a good place to remind you that an adorable dog is at the crux of this movie’s narrative. And the team is working round-the-clock to ensure that the pooches playing the canine protagonist are properly pampered. “In all, three ‘Charlies’ travel with us. We’ve had them since they were puppies. Even prior to the shoot, we would take them on outings, so that they get accustomed to travelling. And they absolutely love it! The moment the shot is ready, and the main pup that plays Charlie spots the vehicle that she and Rakshit Shetty ’s character in the film travel, she jumps straight into the side car, raring to go,” shares Kiranraj. Apart from this, the team has also transformed a car into an air-conditioned caravan for the dogs to chill in. “Each location has varying climatic conditions. So, to ensure that the dogs don’t bear the brunt of it, the caravan is set up at the location before the dogs are flown in with us,” he adds.Given that the Coronavirus scare is a concern for any traveller, across the country and the world, this movie team is alert and keeping a close eye on the news. “All the primary safety measures are in place. We are equipped with masks and have basic medical kits. We are staying up-to-date on the news, keeping note of where the cases are cropping up, and altering our schedules accordingly. For instance, recently, few cases were recorded near Bikaner, Rajasthan, and we changed our travel plans promptly. We are adapting on the go, and, thankfully, everyone has remained hale and hearty,” the filmmaker signs off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74577436,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-124369/74577436.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/777-charlies-pooches-on-pan-india-road-trip/articleshow/74577436.cms

The actress, who considers namma ooru as her second home and has many close friends here – including golfer Anisha Padukone, who she calls her ‘chotu sister’ – got chatty with Bangalore Times about the importance of freedom of expression in the country today, the growing love for Indian cinema abroad and more. Excerpts:

Many actors hold back from expressing their views, but you don’t. What does it take to put forth your unfiltered opinion?

In a democratic nation, there should be absolute freedom of expression. It is non-negotiable. Whatever I am today is because of my parents and my country. If someone says anything against either, or if there is something happening in the nation which is not right, I will raise my voice. I don’t think that has got anything to do with being brave or bold. Of course, I’m primarily an artiste and not an activist, but, as a public figure, I feel that we should express our views.



Moving to cinema, Oscar-winning movie Parasite has proved that subtitles can be a game-changer for good content. Your thoughts on that...

A film with subtitles bagging the Oscars only proves that a good film is a good film. Cinema is a medium that transcends language barriers, as it can form an emotional connect with the audience. And that’s the new norm. It’s a welcome trend because, we are finally talking about diversity in its truest sense, as opposed to tokenism.Currently, there is a lot of curiosity around Indian content in the international market. And this includes actors, stories and the storytellers. We have such an amazing gold mine of cultures and stories, and the world is yet to experience that. I feel there is a change in the landscape of storytelling, too. Now, we have a lot more local language content coming out. I would like to see a Kannada or a Bengali show made really well that have the potential to travel around the world. We watch Spanish shows and never for a moment think it is local-language content that we are watching. I really think that our stories too can make an impact globally.Yes, of course. Content is king, and great writing has to be the priority. We still largely function from a star-led system. But, fortunately, that is changing now. It is all about good storytelling these days.I’ve always tried to pick films that make me happy. I’ve never thought about whether or not a particular movie is mainstream. I’ve made the best of the opportunities that I have got. For instance, if there is an offer from the Tamil film industry and I like it, I will take it up. Same will be the approach to an offer from the West.

I have ample scope to showcase various emotions and I felt this would be the right platform to display my talent. Amritha and I rehearsed for a couple of days before we went for the actual shoot,” he says, adding, “The film’s shoot is almost over.

So, I have always wanted to venture out as a filmmaker, too.”Talking about his debut venture, he says, “This one is a slice-of-life film based on friendship. It tracks the journey of a bunch of people from 1992-2020. Youngsters will be able to relate to the story. If there are 50 scenes in the film, audiences will be able to see themselves in at least 30 of them. This film is packed with several emotions, talks about family bonding, friendship and love.”The interesting bit, he says, is that the film will be an ode to AR Rahman . “Just like how 96 was an ode to Ilaiyaraaja sir, this film will be a tribute to Rahman sir.

And now, Naveen is working on Vijay’s directorial debut, Salaga, along with music man MR Charan Raj.” I am composing two of the four songs of the film, the first one being Sanjana I Love You , which will be released today. Vijay has always been closely involved with the creative aspects of his films and, back in the day, when I began singing for his movies, not only did we strike a rapport, but we also understood each other’s taste in music. When he asked me to compose a couple of songs for his directorial debut, I knew I had to give him my best. In a way, our personal bond was helpful, as I know what exactly he expects of me. Although Salaga is an underworld tale, it has a love story at its crux, and the song, Sanjana I Love You, written by lyricist-director Chethan Kumar , beautifully captures that emotion. Vijay wanted the song to reflect the fact that the protagonist is in love, while also having a fun element to it in a modern-day trendy tune. I composed it accordingly and have sung it as well. The promo of the song that we released online has been well received, so I am quite excited about the entire song coming out today, which has been picturised on Vijay and Sanjana Anand,” Naveen signs off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74577782,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-304316/74577782.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/vijay-to-serenade-sanjana-with-a-love-song/articleshow/74577782.cms

But there are not many that focus on the life of a swimmer. “That’s why I chose to make a film on a champion swimmer whose aim is to represent the country on an international forum. But this will not just be a sports entertainer — it’s a crime thriller that will revolve around a swimming champ,” begins Rathan Linga, who has completed 80 per cent of his film, Lock Ask him about the significance of the title and the director, who last helmed the critically acclaimed Attu, says, “The story is set in the backdrop of Muttukadu, where a family of three resides. While the parents are both doctors, their 18-year-old daughter is a state-level swimming champion. The day before she has to leave for a national meet, winning which could help her represent India internationally, she encounters a gang of psycho killers. How she, her parents and the killers get locked in a house and what would their fate be are what the film is about.”So, is the story a figment of his imagination or inspired by real events? “Several years ago, news of serial killing in the state made headlines. According to reports, these killers moved among public and murdered people when they felt like. Just like that! There was no planning involved. It affected me and that’s why I wrote this script,” he says, “The story happens in a span of three-four days and we are shooting in places like Pazhaverkadu and Thiruvallur now.”Rathan tells us that the film will be character-driven. “Madhushree, who has done significant roles in films like Gangs of Madras, Nadodigal 2 and Seeru, is playing the lead. She is also a swimmer and looks convincing as a schoolgirl who’s caught in a life-threatening situation. Srinivasa Varadhan and dance master Barathi are playing the role of the parents.

It has been almost eight months since I have been out of work. I am meeting people and discussions are on, but there is nothing concrete,” she says.Quality work apart, it’s also the long commute and low pay packets that add to actors’ woes.

They want us to reduce our price to half of what we were earning earlier, because of the current financial crunch.”That’s not all. Mreenal says that the pressure to look good 24/7 is affecting her mental health. She says, “The makers expect us to look pretty and keep fit, work for 12 hours every day and also put in extra hours.

11,['12/03/2020'],Yes Bank case: ED gets 5 days more to quiz Kapoor on 78 family firms,"Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor being taken to court for a hearing in connection with money laundering charges, i... Read More

MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court that Yes Bank co-promoter Rana Kapoor and his family members own 78 companies, with him managing their affairs. Seeking an extension of Kapoor's custody, the ED said it needed to ascertain the siphoning of funds from the bank into these companies.

ED's special counsel Sunil Gonsalves submitted that during Kapoor's tenure in the bank, amounts totalling over Rs 30,000 crore were disbursed as loans to several companies, which eventually turned to bad debt. ""(Of these loans) more than Rs 20,000 crore sanctioned during Kapoor's tenure have turned into non-performing assets. The sanctioning of the loans from the point of view of irregularity, quid pro quo, and diversion is being investigated,"" ED told the court.

After both sides made submissions, special judge Prashant R Rajvaidya remanded 62-year-old Kapoor in ED's custody until March 16. Kapoor was arrested early on Sunday morning and this was his second remand hearing. ED commenced arguments seeking custody extension for seven days. Gonsalves told the court ED needed to confront Kapoor with voluminous documents and several key witnesses, including the bank's management whose statements were yet to be recorded.

The remand plea was strongly opposed by Kapoor's advocate, Satish Maneshinde, who repeatedly told the court he was being made a scapegoat since the finance minister had made a statement about hauling up the person responsible for the bank's downfall. The defence also cited numerous awards won by Kapoor over the years. ""When he left the bank, its market cap was around Rs 93,000 crore; after that the value under a new management came down to Rs 5,000 core. The finance minister made a statement that somebody responsible for this should be hauled up. When (Kapoor) left the bank, NPAs were 1%, not the Rs 20,000 crore they are saying now. Therefore, he cannot be held responsible,"" Maneshinde submitted.

He said Kapoor had filed statements of all 78 companies in his own or his wife and children's control. ""None of the auditors has taken an exception to any of the investments or expenses incurred by Kapoor,"" the defence said. It said ED went to Kapoor's house on March 6 on bogus grounds to investigate if the bank's transactions related to a separate criminal case against DHFL's alleged involvement in the purchase of (deceased) drug smuggler Iqbal Mirchi's properties in 2010. The defence said that after ED realised it had bungled, as an afterthought it registered an offence relating to the purchase of debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore in DHFL.

The defence also said that for four months Kapoor was in London with his family and repaying debts. ""He has sold his assets and settled debts worth more than Rs 1,900 crore. He came back to India because there were negotiations between him and RBI and the top hierarchy of the finance ministerial department to take over the bank again because it was going down,"" the defence submitted. Maneshinde said that a week prior to this incident, Kapoor sat with several senior government and RBI officials.

The defence also denied that the Rs 600 crore loan given by DHFL to Kapoor's daughters' company DOIT Urban Ventures was a kickback. He said that Rs 130 crore in interest has been paid and the loan is being settled. ""No bribe taker will take the amount in cheque and no fool will return the amount or interest,"" the defence said. Denying that the security given against the loan was meagre and bogus, the defence said that assets of each of Kapoor's daughters was around Rs 1,700 crore. It said that they had sufficient assets to repay double the loan. The defence also denied that the loan taken was not utilised for business or the company was a dummy or the money was siphoned off for other purposes.

Maneshinde said that about Rs 175 crore was invested in an international design school and investments were also made in hospitality, eco-tourism, healthcare and wellness ventures and all companies were audited.

12,['12/03/2020'],Churchill Bros sack coach with five games remaining in I-League,"Panaji: Churchill Brothers FC have parted ways with coach Bernardo Tavares and have handed charge to Mateus Costa for the rest of the team’s campaign in the I-League .

The club’s decision was communicated to the Portuguese coach a day after the loss against Gokulam Kerala FC as the visitors struck in the 90th minute to win 2-1 at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Sunday.

Chasing the runnersup spot, particularly after Mohun Bagan had opened a huge gap – they eventually won the title on Tuesday – the loss against Gokulam Kerala hurt Churchill, and club patron Churchill Alemao decided to pull the trigger.

Tavares did not show up for training for the last two days and instead Mateus, who has coached Sporting Clube de Goa in the past, has been calling the shots.

“We decided it was time to bring in a new coach,” Alemao confirmed to TOI on Wednesday.

The loss against Gokulam Kerala left Churchill in eighth spot. As of now, they seem closer to the relegation zone with just three teams below them. But the teams are so close to each other that just three points separate them and second-placed East Bengal and Punjab FC, both of whom have played an extra game.

Churchill now have 20 points from 15 matches, the same as Gokulam Kerala, TRAU and Real Kashmir FC, while they are tied on points with defending champions Chennai City FC. Should they win their game against Real Kashmir next week, they will move up to third on the table.

It is not a surprise that Churchill have decided to shake things up, even though there are just five games left to be played. The runners-up spot in the I-League could have a lot of significance. Should ATK win the Indian Super League (ISL) final against Chennaiyin FC on Saturday, I-League runners-up will qualify for the AFC Cup group stage, thanks to ATK’s tie-up with Bagan from next season.

Churchill started with three consecutive wins, including a 4-2 demolition of Bagan in Kolkata, but since then lost their way. The former champions lost many games at home, including against considerably weaker opposition, with Tavares frustrated at the lack of sharpness upfront.

“It’s very difficult to be in this situation because we are working in a good direction. In football , the most difficult thing is to create opportunities, and when chances are created, there will be a goal. We’ve had bad luck too. But history won’t record the chances we created. After two three days, only the result is remembered. Moral victories don’t give you any points

“We are training everyday on finalisation. We are training to finish crosses, making overlaps and play small-sided games too. We have many exercises to help the team improve in these kind of situations. There is an element of luck too, but we cannot say that we have been unlucky all the time. There has to be more focus and attention upfront when shooting at goal,” Bernard had said in one of his pre-match press conferences, referring to the 20-odd chances they create in every game.

Churchill’s remaining five games are all away as they travel from Kashmir to Tamil Nadu.

13,['12/03/2020'],#CoronaScare grips NCR: Commuters unwilling to share cabs with strangers,"With over 60 confirmed coronavirus cases in India, the fear of catching the virus from strangers has only gone up. The COVID-19 outbreak has affected not only the way we greet each other but also the way we travel. People who used to prefer travelling in app-based shared cabs, which are far more economical, are not so keen on sharing space now – they would rather take personal cabs, instead of travelling with strangers. The idea is to reduce personal contact with strangers as much as possible.Ishita Gupta, a resident of Dwarka who works in Gurgaon, shares, “Last week, the person sitting next to me couldn’t stop sneezing. We were three people sitting in the backseat and were really close to each other. Generally, it wouldn’t have bothered me as much as it did now, with the fear of the disease spreading. I have now started booking personal cabs.” The personal cabs may be a on the pricier side but people are ready to shell out extra if it means that they can avoid sitting next to strangers. “I would usually take shared cabs as it becomes lighter on the pocket. However, with the panic around coronavirus, I have now started booking personal cabs for myself since the past one week,” says Shikha Joshi, a resident of Vaishali, who works in Noida. She adds, “They may cost Rs60-80 higher, as compared to shared cabs, but at least, the probability of me catching the virus from co-passenger reduces.” However, when it comes to carpooling with other residents of one’s society or neighbours, people are less sceptical. “We all know the people who travel with us, so we have not yet stopped the carpooling group. In case someone turns up sick, we would just refuse to take them on,” says Shivang Chauhan, a resident of Greater Noida West, who uses a carpooling group of his society to commute to his office.It’s not just the commuters who are taking precautions. Cab drivers, too, are making sure they sanitise their car after every ride and are preferring personal bookings. “I have switched from driving for cab-pool to driving for personal bookings. Though I cannot ask a sick person to get out of the car in either of the cases, but at least, the chances of driving with a person who’s unwell get somewhat reduced ,” says Satendra Yadav, who drives app-based cabs. Another driver, Shahid, shares, “We ferry over 50 people in a day in our cabs and we cannot choose who we allow in the cab. So we need to take all the precautions. Every time, after I drop someone, I clean the doors, handles and spray sanitiser on the seat.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74575592,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-53074/74575592.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/coronascare-grips-ncr-commuters-unwilling-to-share-cabs-with-strangers/articleshow/74575555.cms
14,['12/03/2020'],Homi Adajania and Dinesh Vijan talk about Angrezi Medium,"I remember, I narrated the story of Being Cyrus to Dinesh, and he asked me how many days I would take to make the film. I had no clue, as I had never made a film before. I told him that I'd finish it in 30 days. He said that if I took more than 30 days, I would have to pay from my own pocket. By the end of that day, I was a little worried. I asked him, ‘What if it starts raining and that disrupts the shoot?’ It was like dumb and dumber (laughs!).It was a level playing field. He didn’t know how to direct, and I didn’t know how to produce. We were trying our best to keep that fact hidden from the other (laughs!). The thing is that Homi and I learnt the business together and we have had an interesting journey.The only thing common between us was that we wanted to tell stories -- that was our passion. After the first film, I became a scuba diving instructor. One day I got a call from Dinesh for Cocktail. A romantic comedy was virgin territory for me. He approached me so that I could bring my own palette to the genre. Dinesh always believed in my potential, while I have been blind towards it. One thing that has worked for us is that we have never lie to each other. Even when I agreed to do Cocktail, I told him that I still don’t believe in the story, and I will give the subject my own twist. He said that’s exactly what he wanted me to do.Even films likeorthat I have backed have been as reckless as Cocktail. If I like a story, I want to tell it, and one does everything to make it happen. One week before a film’s release, I know where we stand. My average products have never worked. Initially, I would wish that I could get away with it, but that has never happened. If it is a good film, and it doesn’t work for some reason, then I am okay with it. But, if it is a bad film, then it is not forgivable.In the last 15 years, filmmakers have destroyed the business because we wanted to make money beforehand and we didn’t want anyone else to make money. We also wanted to ensure that if our film failed, we would not be at risk. That model changed for us with Stree (2018). Since then, we have made money and at the same time, done better films. Nobody wanted to put their money on Stree. I had no option but to back it myself. It was all or nothing, and it could have shut us down. I will tell you about my production house’s formula. We believe that if it doesn’t fire, nobody loses money and only if it fires, we make money. A film has to run in theatres. If that doesn’t happen, it is sad as a lot of work goes into it. My upcoming release, Angrezi Medium is an entertaining film. I have no problem if you love it or hate it. But, being indifferent towards a film is scary!Well, the experience changed everyone. It made me change the way I make my films. After all, you are making a film and not curing a disease. Don’t take it so seriously! The entire experience of shooting Angrezi Medium will always be a wonderful memory. Making this film has made me a better person. In fact, it has touched everyone in one way or another. It the kind of experience, which uplifts your spirit and makes you understand what resilience is. We knew all about the risks. We went into it with our eyes open. There was no question of tiptoeing around Irrfan. The fact is that we addressed the elephant in the room. He had cancer and was undergoing treatment. And we all were living life the way that way one is supposed to. Nothing has to stop at any point in your life. That’s the spirit with which we kept going. Irrfan, too, soldiered on with passion and wasn’t stressed about it. It was inspiring seeing him do what he was doing.When the unit was shooting in London, I was supposed to be on set only for five days, but Irrfan asked me to stay back. He told me he feels positive when I am around. So, I stayed back for him. There was never a gloomy moment on the set of the film.A lot of actresses were keen to play this role as the first one (English Medium, 2017) did so well. So, whichever manager approached us with their client's name, I showed them Radhika's audition video. And after that they agreed that Radhika was apt for the role.Dinesh showed me her audition for Pataakha (2018). I remember she had invited me to watch the film, but unfortunately, I wasn't in town. Later, she messaged me and asked if she could audition for this role. I turned down her request and told her that we wanted a younger actress to play the part of the 18-year-old girl. Regardless of that, she sent her audition video. I was just blown away seeing her performance.Yes, Angrezi Medium is very much out of my comfort zone.I feel that if you have something on paper, and a good director on board, then language can never be a barrier. I felt Homi would be perfect to direct this film because he is an amazing father. He has two boys, and I have seen their equation. He also has maximum respect for writing and writers.The film is about a parent and a child. Personally, as a father, I really get scared of some situations. You hold the hands of your little ones; show them the way, and then one day you let them go. You do that with a lot of pride and as much pain and a lot of hope in your heart that one day, when you need them, they will come back to you. This is the sur of this film. The writer got it, Irrfan got it, and then, we all were on the same page.He is a very good producer, let him produce (laughs!).We do a lot of stuff for validation. As you grow older, you realise this. I though t I was enamoured by direction. When I did it, I realised I genuinely loved producing. Ten years later, I feel the urge to direct, then I’ll think about it at that time. Right now, producing is working well for me. Now that I have been through the process of direction, it helps me better my production skills, too. I believe we have a lot of directors, but only a few producers who can add value to a director's vision. Though your failure teaches you much more than your victory, life is too short to make all your mistakes. So, you learn from other’s mistakes. Today, all filmmakers get along with each other and use each other’s creativity. It helps and it also gives a good vibe.Of course! After all, if films do well, then it is more conducive and beneficial for us as an industry. For some strange reason, earlier, we would feel that people didn't want someone else to do well within the industry. But that has changed now.When I met a well-known Hollywood film producer he said, “You know why Hollywood works? Because the top five people (of the industry) get along really well.” We need to take from each other if we want to grow the business.The film industry can be wiped out if we don’t stick together and grow the business.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74576546,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-71929/74576546.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/homi-adajania-and-dinesh-vijan-talk-about-angrezi-medium/articleshow/74576546.cms

It began over a week ago and has gone viral , sweeping social media with memes, and attracting a host of famous names to try it.The #fliptheswitch challenge is a 16-second video in which two people stand in front of a mirror and dance.

NEW DELHI: Congress's entreaties to three allies for Rajya Sabha berths in their bastions have come unstuck, dealing a blow to the party's hopes of using the coming elections to boost its upper House tally beyond its numbers. The principal opposition party had urged DMK in Tamil Nadu, JMM in Jharkhand and RJD in Bihar for support so that it could field candidates despite lacking the numbers. While DMK would have to concede a seat that it can win on its own, JMM and RJD have the numbers to help a Congress nominee win.

However, all three parties have turned down the requests and Congress would now have to contend with what it can win on its own across state assemblies. A calculation suggests that Congress can win eight seats if it can keep its flock together. The loss of over 20 MLAs, and possibly the state government, in Madhya Pradesh can cost the party the second seat that it was in a position to win in Bhopal.

The party will also have to be careful in Haryana where it has a very thin buffer to win a seat. Given that it requires numbers in the upper House to boost its diminishing political muscle, the refusal of alliance partners to heed its requests suggests that successive Lok Sabha debacles have seriously affected Congress' standing in the anti-BJP axis.

The party commanded a strong position vis-a-vis allies during the UPA decade. But even after losing power in 2014, it continued to have its way with partners in political negotiations. Now, the failure to eke out a single RS seat despite multiple requests marks a serious setback for the principal opposition party.

The most interesting bit happened in Bihar where Congress felt that ally RJD could be persuaded to cede a seat. Given that RJD's core ambitions revolve around the coming assembly elections in October, it was felt that Lalu Prasad's party would want to keep allies in good humour. But when private negotiations did not help, Congress state in-charge Shaktisinh Gohil wrote a letter to RJD ""to keep its commitment"", triggering a media spectacle. However, RJD shot back with a public refusal.

The same has been the response of DMK. Given that it has always given primacy to state politics, the Dravidian outfit was expected to be more indulgent towards allies after its failure to dislodge AIADMK in the last polls. JMM recently formed the government with the support of Congress, which won its largest tally in many years.

23,['12/03/2020'],"Allies leave Congress to fend for itself, scuttle plans to boost RS numbers","(File photo)

NEW DELHI: Congress's entreaties to three allies for Rajya Sabha berths in their bastions have come unstuck, dealing a blow to the party's hopes of using the coming elections to boost its upper House tally beyond its numbers. The principal opposition party had urged DMK in Tamil Nadu, JMM in Jharkhand and RJD in Bihar for support so that it could field candidates despite lacking the numbers. While DMK would have to concede a seat that it can win on its own, JMM and RJD have the numbers to help a Congress nominee win.

However, all three parties have turned down the requests and Congress would now have to contend with what it can win on its own across state assemblies. A calculation suggests that Congress can win eight seats if it can keep its flock together. The loss of over 20 MLAs, and possibly the state government, in Madhya Pradesh can cost the party the second seat that it was in a position to win in Bhopal.

The party will also have to be careful in Haryana where it has a very thin buffer to win a seat. Given that it requires numbers in the upper House to boost its diminishing political muscle, the refusal of alliance partners to heed its requests suggests that successive Lok Sabha debacles have seriously affected Congress' standing in the anti-BJP axis.

The party commanded a strong position vis-a-vis allies during the UPA decade. But even after losing power in 2014, it continued to have its way with partners in political negotiations. Now, the failure to eke out a single RS seat despite multiple requests marks a serious setback for the principal opposition party.

The most interesting bit happened in Bihar where Congress felt that ally RJD could be persuaded to cede a seat. Given that RJD's core ambitions revolve around the coming assembly elections in October, it was felt that Lalu Prasad's party would want to keep allies in good humour. But when private negotiations did not help, Congress state in-charge Shaktisinh Gohil wrote a letter to RJD ""to keep its commitment"", triggering a media spectacle. However, RJD shot back with a public refusal.

The same has been the response of DMK. Given that it has always given primacy to state politics, the Dravidian outfit was expected to be more indulgent towards allies after its failure to dislodge AIADMK in the last polls. JMM recently formed the government with the support of Congress, which won its largest tally in many years.

25,['12/03/2020'],Amit Shah: Action against Delhi riots accused will serve as example,"Union home minister Amit Shah speaks in Lok Sabha (ANI)

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday vowed to ensure punishment for those responsible for the Delhi riots irrespective of their religion, caste and political affiliation, asserting that action against the culprits would go down as an example for future rioters across the country.

“I convey my condolences to all those who have lost their family members. I promise that none of the guilty will be spared no matter which religion, caste or political party they belong to. Delhi Police will act with such firmness that these riots will become a case study of the consequences that should visit those engage in riots,” Shah told Lok Sabha after an over five-hour debate on communal violence in the Capital.

Home minister Amit Shah said the government wants to set up a claims commission to recover damages from rioters, and the Delhi high court has already been approached for the purpose.

“About 700 FIRs have been filed, 152 weapons used in violence seized and 49 cases lodged under the Arms Act. Also, 2,647 people have been detained or arrested so far,” Shah said.

Congress walked out of the House during the reply, provoking a sharp response from the usually quiet highways minister Nitin Gadkari.

Responding to attacks from Congress which demanded his resignation and others in the opposition, Shah strongly rebutted the charges of failure and police inaction, saying the communal violence that claimed 53 lives was a pre-planned, well-organised conspiracy executed with hawala funds. “The spread of riots on such a big scale in such a short time is not possible without a conspiracy. We have registered a case of conspiracy to probe this angle. Three people have been arrested for financing the violence in northeast Delhi,” he said.

A combative Shah marshalled details to refute that Delhi police, which works under the home ministry, had failed, saying that riots had been controlled within 36 hours and were not allowed to spread beyond 12 police stations. “The first complaint of riot was reported at 2 pm on February 24. It goes to the credit of the force that not a single incident of rioting took place after 11 pm on February 25,” he said.

Shah said it was an achievement considering that northeast district had the highest population density in the country, was marked by a maze of narrow lanes and had a historically high crime rate. “It borders UP from where 300 criminals were brought in as part of a sinister conspiracy to organise violence during the visit of US President Donald Trump,” he added.

The minister focused on the role of social media in what has been dubbed the first “digitised riots”. “More than 60 social media accounts were created specifically to incite communal violence between February 22 and 26,” he added.

Shah said many of the social media accounts were since shut but police were looking for those responsible. “If they feel that they will get away, they are mistaken, law will take its course,” he said, adding that 25 cases under the IT Act had been registered.

He responded to the charge that the Union government failure to take action against BJP members who made “provocative speeches” by referring to speeches of AIMIM’s Waris Pathan and others to say that inflammatory comments defined anti-CAA protests. He also mentioned the “aar-paar ki ladai” comment Sonia Gandhi had made at Ramlila Maidan, although he did not name the Congress chief. The minister stressed that riots were not a spontaneous outbreak.

Responding to the allegation that the Centre delayed debate in Parliament, he said the government wanted the riots to be discussed after Holi to avoid communal flare-up during festival time. “There has been a history of communal clashes during Holi. It seems others had other priorities,” he said.

He refused the demand for a community-wise break-up of fatalities and said, “I won’t give figures in ‘Hindu-Muslim’ as has been demanded by some members. 53 Indians have died, 526 Indians have been injured. Shops of 371 Indians were set ablaze and houses of 142 Indians were burned.”

Shah also denied that he was missing in action. “I was in Ahmedabad on February 24 because the public reception for the visiting US President had been organised in my constituency. I came back the same evening and stayed away from Trump’s reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan, and the banquet organised for him to concentrate on the deployment of security forces,” he said.

26,['12/03/2020'],UP takes battle over 'recovery' hoardings to SC,"LUCKNOW: The UP government on Wednesday moved the Supreme Court against an Allahabad high court order directing it to take down the ‘name and shame’ hoardings installed across Lucknow city against 57 persons accused of “vandalising public properties” during anti-CAA protests on December 19, 2019. The appeal would be taken up on Thursday by a vacation bench of Justice UU Lalit and Aniruddha Bose.

Confirming this, UP advocate general Raghevendra Singh told TOI that the government challenged the HC order though a special leave petition in the SC. “We will take up the same points in the SC that we took up before the HC. There is one additional point about the right to privacy under Article 21. Our contention is that the details of all these persons were already in public domain through print and electronic media and, therefore, there is no question of breach of privacy,” he said.

Meanwhile, three of those whose photographs are on the hoardings — retired IPS officer and activist SR Darapuri, Congress member Sadaf Jafar and theatre personality Deepak Kabir — will file a caveat on Thursday against the government’s plea. “The caveat would ensure that before the court delivers any order, it would have to hear us out,” Darapuri said.

He told TOI that they learnt about the SC petition very late on Wednesday. Hence, their lawyers could not reach the court in time.

Sources in UP home department added that till the hearing in the apex court, no action was likely to be initiated by the government to remove the hoardings. The court and government offices were closed for Holi on Tuesday and as soon as they reopened a day later, the government submitted its plea in the SC, challenging the high court order calling the Lucknow administration’s move an “unwarranted interference in the privacy of people”.

On Saturday, the high court had taken suo motu cognizance of hoardings put up across Lucknow last week, carrying addresses and photographs of 57 persons who were accused of damaging properties in the violence during anti-CAA protests on December 19, 2019. The government had already issued recovery notices against these persons.

Delivering its order on Monday, the high court directed the government to immediately remove the hoardings and file a status report by March 16.

27,['12/03/2020'],"SBI FD rates below 6%, lowest since ’04","MUMBAI: State Bank of India has cut deposit rates to its lowest level since 2004 and has done away with the minimum balance requirement for all its 44.5 crore savings accounts. The bank also trimmed interest rates on savings deposits by 25 basis points and cut the interest rate on loans by 10 bps (100 bps = 1 percentage point).Following the reduction in fixed deposit rates, the highest return offered by SBI is 5.9% on deposits above a year. The last time FD rates were below 6% was in August 2004. The bank's reduction in its marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR) by 10 basis points will bring down home loan rates for those who borrowed before October 2019.SBI had reintroduced the minimum balance charges in April 2017 after five years of waiving it. The penalty for not maintaining minimum balance was the cause of much heartburn as the fines were levied on those who did not have enough money. In FY18 the bank collected Rs 2,400 crore by way of these charges which caused an uproar as those who were penalised included poor people who had opened accounts after demonetisation. Thereafter SBI revised the charges to Rs 5 to Rs 15 + taxes on non-maintenance of average monthly balances.""We have been earning Rs 50-60 crore a month on these charges,"" said Praveen Kumar Gupta, MD, State Bank of India.He said that given the dissatisfaction over the charges the bank decided to waive them. The bank has also waived the charges for SMS alerts to customers. ""The people who were being hit by these charges were the ones that needed to be financially included. We were not charging this in the past and we felt that these charges were something we could live without,"" said Gupta.On the reduction of the interest rates on savings account above Rs 1 lakh from 3.25% to 3%, Gupta said that a uniform 3% rate makes life easier for everyone.Meanwhile, the reduction in the MCLR is the 10th consecutive cut in MCLR in FY 2019-20 and applies to the benchmark rate across all tenures. The bank's one-year MCLR, against which home loans before October 2019 were pegged stands revised to be 7.75% from March 10, 2020. Consequently, EMIs on eligible home loan accounts (linked to MCLR) will get cheaper by around Rs 7 per 1 lakh on a 30-year loan. EMIs on car loans will also be reduced by Rs 5 per 1 lakh on a 7-year loan.The cut in deposit rates comes on the back of a liquidity surge in the money markets. The crash in crude oil prices and an economic slowdown triggered by the coronavirus has raised hopes of RBI easing monetary policy. As a result, the yield on the benchmark 10-year debt slid as much as 13 basis points to 6.05% on Monday, a level last seen in 2009. SBI has brought its retail term deposit interest rates by 10 bps for '1 year & above' tenor and 50 bps for deposits up to '45 days'. Bulk term deposit interest rates are reduced by 15 bps for deposits in '180 days & above' tenors.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74585118,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-23248,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-fd-rates-below-6-lowest-since-04/articleshow/74585120.cms

NEW DELHI: The government reiterated in Parliament that 38,000 sq km of Indian territory was under China’s occupation in the Union Territory of Ladakh and that Arunachal Pradesh and the entire UTs of J&K and Ladakh would remain an integral part of India.

Responding to a written question in Lok Sabha, the government also called upon Pakistan to desist from making attempts to bring any “material change’’ in J&K and Ladakh

“China disputes the international boundary between India and China. In the eastern sector, China claims approximately 90,000 sq km of Indian territory in the state of Arunachal Pradesh. Indian territory under the occupation of China in the Union Territory of Ladakh is approximately 38,000 sq km,’’ junior foreign minister V Muraleedharan said.

He added that under the so-called ‘Boundary Agreement’ signed between China and Pakistan on March 2, 1963, Pakistan illegally ceded 5,180 sq km of Indian territory in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.

“India’s consistent and principled position is that Arunachal Pradesh and the entire Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh have been, are and shall be an integral part of India. This fact has been clearly conveyed to the Chinese side on several occasions,"" the minister said.

Replying to a separate query, Muraleedharan said the government was monitoring all developments taking place in Indian territories, including in territories under Pakistan’s illegal and forcible occupation.

“We have consistently called upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal and forcible occupation, and to put an end to human rights violations and desist from continued attempts to bring material change in these territories,’’ he said.

The minister was replying to a query seeking to know what the government was doing to realise the 1994 Parliament resolution on PoK.

“Government’s consistent and principled position, as also enunciated in the Parliament resolution adopted unanimously by both Houses on February 22, 1994, is that the entire Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh have been, are and shall be an integral part of India,’’ Muraleedharan said.

“My father used to sing this song (Baba Harihar Nath). I have to continue with those rituals,” said Tej, adding, “I am chota (younger) Lalu and whatever papa used to do I will do that. I am missing papa today and wish he will be among us very soon.”

Tej even took to posh city areas on bike. He then went to seek blessings of his mother and former chief minister Rabri Devi at her 10, Circular Road bungalow. Emotional Rabri could be seen blessing her son and his friends on the occasion.

It was in 2016 that the Lalu family had celebrated Holi at their official residence. In 2017, the family abstained from celebrating Holi because of death of 26 people in hailstorm in Bihar. From 2018 onwards, no Holi celebration had taken place at Rabri’s residence since Lalu had been jailed in fodder scam cases. In 2018, the death of Lalu’s elder sister Gangotri Devi was also a reason from avoiding any celebration that year.

Meanwhile, Tej flayed chief minister Nitish Kumar and ruling party leaders for not celebrating Holi. “Coronavirus has nothing to do with Holi celebration. They are doing politics,” he said.

No Holi celebration was held even at CM’s residence. Senior BJP leaders had also cancelled their Holi celebration this year as advised by the experts across the globe to avoid mass gathering taking into account the spread of coronavirus.

35,['12/03/2020'],30 injured as under-construction iron bridge collapses in Mandvi,"Surat: Tourists had a narrow escape when an under-construction iron bridge on the rivulet collapsed at the Jetpur-Kevdi eco-tourism site managed by the forest department in Mandvi taluka of Surat district Tuesday afternoon.

Nearly 30 people sustained injuries and were shifted to the government hospitals in Mandvi and Bardoli town for treatment. While majority of the injured were discharged after primary treatment, five people with fractures in their legs and hands were discharged on Wednesday.

The Jetpur-Kevdi eco-tourism site, witnessed a heavy rush of tourist due to the holiday on Dhuleti festival on Tuesday. According to forest officials more than 3,000 people visited the site on that day.

The bridge collapse occurred at about 12.30pm when about 30 people were standing on the under construction bridge to take selfies and photographs.

Sources said that the visitors were warned by the eco-development committee members on not using the under construction bridge.

Talking with TOI, deputy conservator of forest (Surat range), Puneet Nayyar said, “The construction work of the low-level bridge was on when it collapsed due to overload. The bridge was just 15-feet in height from the ground and thus there was no major injury to the tourists.”

Nayyar added, “An inquiry has been ordered into the incident as to how the visitors got access to the under construction bridge. The work had not been completed and that the stability check of the structure was yet to be performed. Strict action will be taken against those responsible for the negligence at the camp site.”

Sub-inspector of Mandvi police station, J S Valavi said, “Few people had suffered fractures and they were treated at the Mandvi and Bardoli hospitals.”

36,['12/03/2020'],AMC rebuked over stop-gap fireman,"Ahmedabad: The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) was censured by a local court for keeping a fireman as a stopgap employee for 29 long years after recruiting him on a permanent post through a selection process.

After the rebuke, the city civil court last week ordered AMC to make Somabhai Desai a permanent employee and give him all benefits that he is entitled to as a regular full-time employee of the government.

In ordering so, the court said, “Keeping a man in a state of flux for an indefinite time the way AMC did to Plaintiff (Desai) is an unfair labour practice which must be shunned.”

Desai joined AMC’s fire service in 1991,when the civic body undertook recruitment process for 40 persons. Desai was first in the waiting list. When a few selected candidates did not join the service, Desai was selected, but as a stopgap employee only. In 1995, he approached the court against his temporary job status. In 1997, the court ordered AMC not to terminate Desai’s service.

Twenty-five years after Desai approached the court, it finally concluded his case. The court said that AMC had not placed its advertisement on record for 25 years. AMC’s evidence was “arid” against Desai’s case. In fact, AMC commissioner and mayor gave appreciation letter and cash prize to Desai for his outstanding service in 2011.

In its order, the court observed, “It is now twenty-nine years that this man is working with AMC and with an element of uncertainly for all his age. There is no reason for such an uncertainty to continue... AMC is a State. It is not a private employer. AMC ought to accord permanent status to this employee while giving him all benefits that it usually gives to permanent employees.”

38,['12/03/2020'],IT services firms get H-1B relief in US court,"Lubna Kably | TNN

Mumbai: In what is seen as a major victory for the IT consulting and services sector, a US district on Tuesday overturned the highly restrictive policies issued by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ).

These policies, enforced by issuing memorandums, cast an onerous burden of proof (RFEs, or requests for evidence) and documentation requirement on companies that placed their employers at third-party client sites. Besides fuelling denials of H-1B visa applications, it also led to delays in processing of H-1B visa applications. H-1B is a popular work visa held by the Indian diaspora working in the technology sector in the US. Sponsoring employers in the IT services sector faced denials not only in case of new H-1B applications filed for prospective employees, but also in cases of visa extensions for existing employees.

Judge Rosemary M Collyer has held as invalid the policy memo issued by the USCIS in February 2018, which imposed burdensome requirements on IT services companies. It has also held as invalid a policy memo dating back to 2010 (referred to as the Neufeld Memo), that had created a new definition of employer-employee relationships. In short, these companies will, for now, not have to comply with the onerous requirement of providing detailed customer contracts and itineraries of employees that are deputed to client sites.

IT services companies had also faced another challenge—the tenure of H-1B visas that were allotted was shrinking. In some cases, it was only for a few weeks or days, as opposed to the permissible three-year period.

The order was passed in the case of ITServe Alliance , a large coalition of IT services companies in the US and several of its member companies. Judge Collyer also held that if the USCIS wishes to grant H-1B approvals for periods of less than the requested three years (or implicitly the period requested), it must articulate the specific reasons for the shorter duration. TOI had covered the petition that had been filed by the alliance and its member companies (many of which are run by Indian-Americans) in its edition of May 15, 2019.

Responding to the order, ITServe Alliance national president (for 2020) Amar Vanda said, “A decision like this has been long overdue. We finally have the judicial system agreeing with the employers that the USCIS has been out of bounds for a long time.”

Nasscom vice-president (global trade development) Shivendra Singh said, “We welcome the ruling. Slowing of visa processing for IT consulting businesses is a huge concern. The judge has pointed out that it exceeded law in the formal ruling. Between 2015-19, the denial rates shot up from 6% to 24% and for some individual companies, it has gone up to 50%. The key issue here is addressing the skill gap. And a short-term visa is used to fill that critical skill-gap catering to 75% of Fortune 500 companies. And if the process slows down, it nullifies the whole objective.”

Speaking to TOI, Cyrus Mehta, founder of a New York-based immigration law firm, said, “The decision applies common sense and sweeps away the nonsensical rules that the government has imposed on employers with the aim of killing this industry. Even H-1B workers will benefit as they can have more stability and enjoy predictability when they apply for H-1B extensions.”

Arlington-based Rajiv S Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com, said, “The order holds that the USCIS must not administer justice through random policy memoranda and, if it wishes to change the regulations, do so through a formal process. In fact, the USCIS seems to have illegally targeted the IT services sector.”

ITServe’s advisory director Kishore Khandavallim added, “Rather than implementing the rule of the law, the USCIS has resorted to random rule-making through internal ‘memos’. It’s game over and checkmate!” The USCIS had required assignment of day-to-day tasks to show that an employer-employee relationship existed. This resulted in challenges where an employer deputed its personnel to work on projects at client sites. The court’s decision now removes this hurdle. “Under the regulations, an employer should not be required to prove their control. Any one of these factors are enough— ability to hire, pay, fire, supervise ‘or’ otherwise control the work of the employee,” explained Khanna. In recent years, several H-1B petitions or even visa extensions for the same job are being denied by the USCIS, claiming the occupation is not a ‘speciality occupation’. “There are indications in this decision that the court is not buying the USCIS’ restrictive interpretation of speciality occupation. The USCIS is likely to lose many more cases on this issue,” Khanna added.

A recent analysis by the National Foundation for America Policy (NFAP) had shown that the denial rates for many IT services companies for new H-1B petitions had risen from about 2% in fiscal 2015 to over 30% in fiscal 2019. Both IT services companies that were multinationals and hired technology workers from India and companies that were headquartered in India suffered this high rate of denials.

The Trump administration can challenge this order in a higher court, but immigration experts think the IT services sector stands on a solid footing. Mehta summed up by saying, “This is a significant victory as the USCIS can no longer deny cases based on the alleged lack of an employer-employee relationship, or lack of a specific contract with the end client or based on speculative employment due to lack of a precise itinerary or time table. This victory will benefit IT service and consulting companies who have been subject to all kinds of arbitrary denials of H-1B requests when they placed workers with third-party clients, which is a legitimate business model and benefits corporate America.”

39,['12/03/2020'],Flipkart staff to work from home for 3 days,"Digbijay Mishra | TNNBengaluru: In a precautionary move amid the coronavirus outbreak, Flipkart has made it mandatory for staff at its Bellandur campus in Bengaluru to work from home for three days, starting Wednesday.The e-tailer’s largest campus houses 8,000-10,000 employees, who are working from home as part of the “dry-run” of day-to-day operations of the Walmart-owned company in the wake of Covid-19. Unlike Paytm, there are no confirmed Covid-19 cases in Flipkart yet. Paytm, which said one of its staff in Gurgaon had tested positive after coming back from Italy — the worst affected country outside China — had shut its offices last week across Noida and Gurgaon.The e-tailer is undertaking this exercise to ensure its critical functions and technology operate effectively in case of an emergency. In a memo to employees, Flipkart also told executives that have travelled abroad recently and have flu-like symptoms to not report to the office for 14 days and consult their managers. PhonePe, the group’s payments arm, will see 50-60% of its staff working from home starting Thursday at least for a week, a person aware of the matter said. PhonePe has around 1,200 employees.“Our BCP (business continuity plan) takes into account the potential risks a situation like Covid-19 can have on our strategic operations and our customer obligations. This trial is mandatory and we request your cooperation in helping us implement the same,” Flipkart told its employees. The company has noted that for the dry-run to be effective, employees should not postpone meetings, campaigns and regular work to a later date, “but use digital tools available to collaborate with teams and executive work”.The customer experience team of the company will work from partner locations and relevant details will be shared with them by their managers. This comes at a time when two employees of Dell and Mindtree have tested positive in Bengaluru and as of Tuesday, the tech-capital had four confirmed cases of Covid-19.“We are checking system preparedness for working remotely using digital/video tools,” a Flipkart spokesperson told TOI on its three-day mandatory work-from-home directive.Covid-19 is also impacting business and supply-chain management for Flipkart and its rival Amazon. Last week, TOI reported how both these companies are trying to minimise the disruption in securing various goods that come from China. The effects might be visible next month — on availability and pricing. An Amazon spokesperson said it is, among other standard measures, letting people work from home if unwell. In a separate statement, Flipkart said it is sanitising its facilities and getting them deep cleaned at regular intervals in light of Covid-19. It added it is also raising awareness among its delivery executives since they have direct exposure to consumers.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/flipkart-staff-to-work-from-home-for-3-days/articleshow/74584762.cms

GAYA: Probably for the first time in Gaya airport ’s history, Air India’s international weekly flight from Yangon landed empty at the airport. The AI flight operates on Yangon-Gaya-Delhi route .

The 13-member crew flew the empty aircraft from the Myanmar capital on Wednesday afternoon.

Confirming the zero passenger flight from Yangon, Gaya airport director Dilip Kumar said, “Another international flight, a chartered flight also from Yangon, landed and took off with no passengers. The chartered flight was booked to fly 107 tourists from Gaya to Yangon. However, no passenger reported for the flight and the aircraft returned empty. Though the Yangon flight landed with no passengers, 21 flyers boarded at the Gaya airport for the Gaya-Delhi section of the flight.”

Tourist footfall has nose dived at the Gaya airport due to Covid-19 outbreak. According to the airport director, as against an average of 400 tourists, the footfall was only 52 on Wednesday.

In another Covid-19 related development, Hla Tin, the 40-year-old Myanmar national kept in the isolation ward of the ANMMCH at Gaya, has tested negative. Subsequently, he has been discharged from the hospital. According to Gaya civil surgeon Dr BK Singh, the virological test report of the Myanmar national was received on Wednesday. Earlier, on Sunday, the Myanmar national during screening at the Gaya airport was found suffering from fever and other symptoms of Covid-19. He was immediately shifted to the isolation ward of the ANMMCH. A couple of days back, a Sherghati resident studying medicine in China was also discharged from the hospital as his virological test report was negative.

According to Gaya International airport director Dilip Kumar, altogether 18,986 passengers have so far been screened at the airport.

“Screening counters have been set up near the two aerobridges and screening was being done with the help of three infra-red thermometers. Two doctors and seven paramedical staff have been deputed at the airport,” he said.

SECUNDERABAD: With the state government allocating Rs 10,000 crore to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ( GHMC ) in the budget, the civic body’s urban biodiversity wing plans to renovate 22 parks in Secunderabad . These parks are located in Seetaphalmandi , Tarnaka, Mettuguda, Addagutta and Boudha Nagar.

“Basic infrastructure such as walkways, cement or iron benches, playing area for children and washrooms will be provided in each park. We will also develop lush green lawns inside the park and place ornamental plants. The project aims to revive lung spaces in Secunderabad,” deputy director of GHMC’s urban biodiversity wing Syed Maqsood Mohiuddin told TOI.

Speaking about the expenditure , Mohiuddin said, “Renovation of each park will cost around Rs 3 lakh. Proposal are being prepared with details of expenditure. These will be sent to the GHMC commissioner in a couple of weeks for approval. Once the civic chief clears them, we will float tenders.”

The project is expected to bring relief for local residents who are often forced to go for their regular walks to parks in other localities. Renovating these spaces will also improve greenery and air quality.

Replying to concerns regarding encroachments, a GHMC official says the civic body has taken much care to build compound walls around the parks to protect them from land sharks.

“If all goes well, the works will be completed within three months,” Mohiuddin said.

43,['12/03/2020'],"Kolkata cops clear first workday test, prepare for Tallah’s HS exam","Buses pass the Chitpore level crossing on Wednesday

KOLKATA: The cops have passed the first big test of the new traffic-flow plan between Chiria More and Shyambazar, but there are still some chinks in the armour that they hope to fix before Thursday, the first day of the higher secondary exams.

On Wednesday, goods vehicles were directed to Strand Bank Road. This proved advantageous for two reasons — the movement to Khagen Chatterjee Road became smoother with Cossipore Road offering more road space and RG Kar stretch remained snarl free. For now, this route will remain one-way to ensure hassle-free movement. “We will not allow any illegal loading and unloading on this stretch any more,” said an officer.

“The RG Kar stretch is slowly getting de-clogged. With Lock Gate now operating from north to south, the stretch has become even smoother compared to last week,” said Anindya Chakraborty, who travels to Shyambazar from Belgacchia every day.

The only bit of bad news from the RG Kar-Belgachhia sector was an accident reported around 9.40am, when 62-year-old Rabin Biswas was injured at Raja Manindra Road-Belgachhia Road crossing after being hit by a government bus plying on route D-23. Biswas was taken to RG Kar Hospital where his condition is stated to be stable.

The cops will continue to be deployed in huge numbers till the end of the HS exams. The only worry for vehicles taking the Lock Gate flyover concerns two crossings — PK Mukherjee and Galiff Street. With heavy crossover movement and motorists yet undecided on whether to take the PK Mukherjee Road towards Shyambazar or continue straight towards Central Avenue, the crossings witnessed some minor snarls in the morning office hours. TOI witnessed vehicles caught in the jam between 9.30am and 11am.

However, cops appeared confident that this was a minor irritant. “It happened on the first day when motorists are still trying to settle for the best possible route. Things will ease in the next 48 hours. Most are still unaware of the newer road options. Once they begin using them, things will look up,” said an officer.

Lalbazar officers indicated they would monitor the traffic flow for the next two weeks. The possibility of making the traffic flow tidal has not been ruled out yet. “We want to ensure that no student is inconvenienced during their board exams. With HS exams in progress, we will not go for too many experiments,” explained an officer.

“At present, for the northward journey, smaller vehicles should take Cossipore Road and buses should take Railway Service Road and the Chitpore level crossing for BT Road. For southward journey, buses and small vehicles should take Lock Gate Flyover for CR Avenue or Shyambazar. In this way, we have reduced the jams on RG Kar Bridge,” said an officer.

“As a precautionary measure, we are not allowing vehicles on Lock Gate flyover after midnight,” explained an officer.

Carrying balloons, water guns and buckets in hands, kids celebrated the festival of colours with enthusiasm. Adults and elderly people also had a great time greeting one another and meeting friends and relatives. They shared sweets and ate mouth-watering delicacies on the occasion. Many people also thronged shops selling mutton, chicken and fish.

Some youngsters celebrated ‘kurta-phaad’ Holi while gulping down numerous glasses of scented ‘thandai’. They also hurled water-filled balloons at passers-by from rooftops and balconies of their houses. However, a large number of police personnel were deployed at strategic locations across the city to avoid any untoward incident.

Budh Marg resident Mukund Anand (62) told this newspaper, “Holi is a time when we share happiness. My sons and daughters-in-law are here for the celebrations. We ate ‘gujiyas’, ‘malpuas’ and several other delicacies.”

Khajekalan resident Surbhi Lahiri said, “I had prepared ‘kathal ki sabzi’, ‘puri’, ‘pua’, ‘kheer’ and ‘dahi vada’ on Holi. I played with colours and ‘gulal’ with my family, relatives and friends. I also attended a family get-together.”

Cartoon masks and wigs were also in vogue among all age groups this Holi. Some youngsters spent time with friends at a water park in Sampatchak.

Saurabh Jaiswal, a resident of Patna City, said, “My friends and I played Holi with tomatoes at the water park. We also ate snacks and enjoyed some rides.”

Flyers are facing tough time to get direct flight to Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kolkata on an average fare. Reportedly, the heaviest rush can be seen on the Delhi-Patna route. The airlines executives say the increase in fares is due to demand and supply. “There is a huge rush, especially on Patna to Delhi and Mumbai routes. The airfare would remain high till March 16,” an executive said.

Travel portals showed on Wednesday that the one-way fare from Patna to Delhi is between Rs6,600 and Rs13,852 for the same day. Travel agents say the average airfare on the Mumbai-Patna route is usually Rs4,100, which now stands between Rs7,850 and Rs17,134. Airfare on the Kolkata-Patna route has soared from the average Rs5,400 to Rs12,177.

Kalpana Sinha, who studies in Delhi, said her train ticket could not be confirmed. “Today, I have booked a flight ticket at Rs7,280 for March 13,” she said.

Ranjit Kumar, a bank professional in Mumbai, said there is no direct flight available for Mumbai route. “I had to book a connecting flight via Delhi,” he said.

Railways has chalked out a contingency plan to cope with passenger rush after Holi. According to Danapur divisional railway manager Sunil Kumar, railways has opened additional ticket booking counters at Patna Junction.

According to East Central Railway (ECR) chief public relations officer Rajesh Kumar, railways has been running at least 17 pairs of weekly or biweekly special trains on the Barauni-New Delhi, Patna-Anand Vihar, Gaya-Anand Vihar, Patna-Lokmanya Tilak Mumbai, Patna-Pune, Gandhidham-Bhagalpur, Howrah-Gorakhpur, Patna-Ranchi, Patna-Indore, Patna-Secunderabad, Patna-Durg, Patna-Ahmedabad, Gaya-Bandra, Barauni-Bandra, Kolkata-Lucknow and Anand Vihar-Kamakhya routes to help passengers reach their respective places after festival.

47,['12/03/2020'],Victoria Memorial assigns room for nursing mothers,"Kolkata: For mothers with newborns, Victoria Memorial Hall will become a more inviting place from Friday with authorities recognizing their need for privacy to nurse babies. A room that is currently used by museum volunteers and guides to take breaks has been allocated as a mother-and-child room and refurbished with a table and couches.

“In the past, our staff and CISF personnel had brought up the need for a private room for mothers with newborns. However, we hadn’t been able to act on it till now as VMH was being renovated. Now that work is over, we are doing what is needed,” said VMH curator Jayanta Sengupta.

Sengupta had inaugurated such a room at the Indian Museum in May 2017 when he was functioning as the director in charge there.

The room at VMH, adjacent to the entrance hall, will allow nursing mothers the privacy needed to nurse their infants or even rest. Sengupta said the room was part of VMH’s ongoing efforts to make the facility more inclusive and friendlier towards visitors.

The issue was highlighted when a woman had trouble nursing her baby at a city mall a year-and-a-half ago. Thereafter, Kolkata Municipal Corporation had asked for child care rooms in all public facilities. All malls have since complied with the requirement.

On Friday, VMH will also inaugurate a Rajput miniature of Rani Padmini binding a turban on her head surrounded by companions as the ‘Object-of-the-Month’ exhibition. The painting will be on display in the Prince Hall on the southern side of the museum.

51,['12/03/2020'],Climate concern: City youths gift vendors power-saving LED lights,"Kolkata: A group of youths under the banner, Earth Day Network (EDN), embarked on a drive to replace incandescent bulbs with LED bulbs along the pavement of Asutosh Mukherjee Road on Wednesday. The act made a lot of difference — one LED bulb consumes less than 5% the energy consumed by incandescent bulbs and generates negligible heat.

“Our idea was to do something to fight the climate challenges in our small way,” said Ajay Mittal, director, EDN, India and South Asia. “We replaced 200W bulbs with 14W LED bulbs and made the hawkers pledge to switch to LED. We explained to them the benefits of using LED — both in terms of electricity cost and longevity. In run up to the 50th anniversary of Earth Day on April 22, we want everyone to take up a small action for change by challenging themselves to replace at least five filament bulbs with LED bulbs,” he added.

Raja Das, a textile hawker in Bhowanipore, said, “The EDN changed one of my five bulbs and told me how much I can save on my electricity bill by shifting to LED. The illumination of the LED lamp is quite good and I have promised to change all my filament bulbs into LED lamps.”

Earlier, Mittal and his friends, in their personal capacity, took upon the task of installing PVC ball valves on road-side taps to stop free-flow of potable water. That saved gallons from being wasted. “We pooled in money to replace filament bulbs and hope the corporate social responsibility fund will aid with the mass-scale replacement,” Mittal added.

Energy efficiency assumes significance in the current environment of shortages and concerns over climate change. The Indian government had launched a scheme to provide LED bulbs to domestic consumers while the KMC has started replacing incandescent street lamps with LED ones.

HYDERABAD: The special team of Ramagundam police raided a house on Wednesday in Sirsa village near Kotapalli of Mancherial district in Telangana and arrested three poachers who were trying to sell leopard skin.

The accused were identified as K Tirupati, S Gangaram and V Tulsiram of Marupalli in Gadchiroli, Maharashtra , residents of Marupalli village abutting Pranahita river in Maharashtra. During interrogation, the accused confessed that they killed a leopard at Marupalli village in Aheri taluk of Gadchiroli district and brought the leopard’s skin to Telangana for sale.

According to police, the accused were agricultural labourers and have been poaching animals by laying electric wire traps. After coming to know from people about the movement of the leopard near Sironcha forest area abutting Pranahita river in Maharashtra, they planned to kill it and sell its skin for profit. “The accused identified the locations where the leopard was moving by tracking its pug marks. They connected the wires to the overhead electric line and laid traps. After killing the leopard, the accused removed its skin and nails,” Ramagundam commissioner V Satyanarayana said.

The commissioner said that they are using drone cameras to prevent poaching and timber smuggling. “We are binding over timber smugglers and poachers. So far, we have bound over 56 offenders in nine cases,” the commissioner said.

Previously, In March 2019, Ramagundam police arrested six poachers and seized leopard skin along with its nails from their possession. Ramagundam police had also arrested 20 persons in a tiger poaching case in 2019.

MUMBAI: Strong flows into equity and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) helped the mutual fund industry report its highest ever assets under management (AUM) at Rs 28.3 lakh crore in February. The growth came despite liquid funds witnessing outflows.

In the one year to February 29, while the benchmark indices like sensex and Nifty had grown by about 6%, the MF industry’s AUM surged by 15%, data showed. Steady flows through the systematic investment plan (SIP) route, which was above the Rs 8,000-crore mark for the 15th consecutive month, signalled investors’ tilt towards having a disciplined, long-term investment attitude, industry players said.

According to industry trade body Amfi’s chief executive N S Venkatesh, continued vibrancy in monthly SIP flows at Rs 8,513 crore, and net inflows into equity AUMs at a record high this fiscal at Rs 10,796 crore, helped the fund industry’s assets to set an all-time high figure.

“We expect continued buoyancy in SIP flows in March too, though a few institutional investors may reassess their investment strategy, given the deep correction in markets. Equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS) continue to find favour with individual investors, with positive net flows at Rs 871 crore during the month,” he said.

Amfi data showed that total equity AUM topped the Rs 8-lakh-crore mark for the first time in history. In February, as a category, liquid funds recorded the highest outflow at Rs 43,825 crore, while equity ETFs brought in over Rs 16,000 crore.

SURAT: While she barely lived her own life, this 12-year-old girl from Surat has become a life saviour to five others. Thanks to the supreme sacrifice by Yesha Mangukia ’s heartstricken kin, the girl will continue to live on through her valuable contribution of liver, two kidneys and two eyes.

Yesha, a Class 7 student, and daughter of a diamond polisher, had gone to play at a friends house on the fourth floor of a building in the same society in Varachha area on March 9. However, while playing she accidentally fell off from the gallery and hit the ground floor. She slipped into unconsciousness from severe head injuries.

She was rushed P P Savani Hospital in a serious condition which referred her to Venus hospital. However, the doctors there declared her brain-dead and informed Donate Life, an NGO working for organ donation. After counselling, Yesha’s family members decided to donate her vital organs.

Immediately, the police swung into action and a 260km green corridor was made which passed through six districts — Surat city, Surat Rural, Bharuch, Vadodara Rural, Anand, Ahmedabad Rural and Ahmedabad city. Police in all these districts were kept in attendance so that the distance of 260km could be covered in just 2.55 hours, which in normal time takes nearly 5 hours.

“We approached Yesha’s family members who understood the importance of organ donation and agreed to be part of the noble cause. With the consent of Yesha’s father Bharat Mangukia, we informed to State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (SOTTO) convener Dr Pranjal Modi and Transplant Coordinator Dr Priya Shah about the availability of two kidneys and one liver and Lokdrishti Bank about the two eyes,” said Nilesh Mandlewala, founder of Donate Life, while talking to TOI.

“One kidney was transplanted into a boy and another into a girl in Ahmedabad. The liver was transplanted into a 52-year-old man,” Mandlewala added.

The regulator’s decision came even as it maintains the securities market ban on the erstwhile top honchos.The relaxation has been given following a plea by Thapar, V R Venkatesh (former CG Power CFO) and ex-board members Madhav Acharya & B Hariharan.The order pertains to a case of alleged fraud at the equipment manufacturer. Sebi has directed CG Power to take all necessary steps to recover amounts due to the company, which were extended to the four former executives and Thapar’s Avantha Group of companies along with interest.The markets watchdog noted that a “big corporate war” was going on between the present CG Power management and Thapar. “There has been a specific allegation against private equity firm KKR — which holds 8.1% in CG Power — with respect to market manipulation, insider trading and change in control of the company.”Sebi further noted that certain allegations were also made against Narayan Seshadri, an independent director on the board of CG Power, regarding his firm Tranzmute’s partnership with KKR.Moreover, Sebi has received complaints against Acharya concerning alleged siphoning of funds and a failure on the part of the CG Power board to adhere to corporate governance standards, including involvement of KKR in the company’s affairs. Though Sebi has not addressed these issues in Wednesday’s order, it said that it “may examine these complaints”.In a statement, KKR said, “We note that Sebi has not made any observation or findings in the order that is adverse to KKR, and we have not received any show-cause from Sebi.

MADURAI: In a petition to the city police commissioner, a patient’s relative on Wednesday accused doctors of a private hospital in the city of threatening to harvest organs of the soon-to-be brain dead patient for payment of dues to the hospital. However, refuting the claim, the hospital authorities alleged that it was an elaborate attempt to extort money from the hospital and said that the patient himself is conscious and recovering well.

According to the petition, the patient’s wife, Nithya V, said her husband Veerapandian was admitted to the hospital in October last year for treating subdural haematoma. He underwent two surgeries during the hospitalisation. Nithya alleged that the hospital had taken lakhs of money from them over the months but her husband had not recovered. She further claimed that on March 7 doctors came to her saying that her husband would soon be brain dead. As Rs 3 lakh was pending in dues to the hospital, they threatened to harvest her husband’s organs once he was brain dead for payment.

Meanwhile, hospital authorities accused Nithya and her family of cooking up stories in an attempt to extort money from the hospital. “It is true that Rs 3 lakh was pending in payment but we never threatened anything. The expenses of the treatment availed as claimed by them is also incorrect and much less. The patient is conscious and recovering well. On March 7, he was briefly on ventilator support but now he is better,” a senior doctor told TOI. He also said that the patient was being treated for multiple ailments and was an alcoholic and drug abuser.

PATNA: In a fresh turn of events in the Mahagathbandhan in Bihar over Rajya Sabha seats, Upendra Kushwaha-led RLSP has supported Congress’s demand of one seat from RJD. RLSP claimed RJD had committed one seat to Congress during the Lok Sabha elections last year.

“RJD’s Rajya Sabha member and national spokesperson Manoj Jha had said it in a joint press conference of Mahagathbandhan ahead of the previous Lok Sabha elections. RJD must fulfil its commitment to abide by the alliance dharma,” RLSP general secretary Madhav Anand said.

Given the strength of RJD, Congress and other allies in the state legislative assembly, the Mahagathbandhan can easily win two out of the 5 Rajya Sabha seats for which election is to be held on March 26.

Under the seat-sharing arrangement for the 40 Lok Sabha seats in 2019, RJD had contested 19 seats, Congress nine, RLSP five and Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM (S) and Mukesh Sahani-led VIP on three seats each. The Mahagathbandhan had left Ara Lok Sabha seat for CPI(ML), which also lost.

Incidentally, Congress’s Rajya Sabha member Akhilesh Prasad Singh’s son Aakash Kumar Singh had unsuccessfully contested on RLSP ticket from Purvi Champaran. Party insiders said now RLSP is supporting Congress in its demand for a Rajya Sabha seat from RJD in a show of solidarity.

Nevertheless, RJD functionaries are non-committal. “It is not our concern whether Congress wants to send its candidate to Rajya Sabha. We are thinking about whom from the party to send from our quota,” RJD state president Jagdanand Singh said.

RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari claimed that Congress’s Akhilesh went to Rajya Sabha in 2018 from RJD quota only. “RJD has always respected its allies and shown generous attitude in all matters. However, we should not always be expected to make sacrifices. Hence, we are firm that people from RJD will only be sent to Rajya Sabha from our quota,” Tiwari said.

Though the last date of filing nomination papers is March 13, only JD(U) has announced its candidates so far and retained Harivansh and Ram Nath Thakur. The other retiring Rajya Sabha members are Kahkashan Perween of JD(U) and Dr C P Thakur and R K Sinha of BJP.

On the BSE, IndusInd Bank was down 5.8%, Federal Bank lost close to 1.9% and Axis Bank was down 0.8%.

The RBI had countered social media messages highlighting the fall in market capitalisation of banks, stating that there was no link between solvency of a bank and its market capitalising.Two old private banks — RBL Bank and Karur Vysya Bank — issued statements assuring depositors that the banks were sound and well capitalised. Shares of both banks closed in the green on Wednesday.

KVB is a fundamentally strong institution across all relevant parameters,” the bank said.Banks unions called for Yes Bank to be brought directly under government control. “In order to protect the interest of the depositors and bank’s clients, Yes Bank should be immediately brought under the public sector.

CHENNAI: The AIADMK government on Wednesday made it clear that the state legislature was bound by the Parliamentary law and adopting a resolution against CAA in the assembly would be unconstitutional. As revenue minister R B Udayakumar clarified the government’s standpoint in the assembly, the opposition DMK and its allies, the Congress and the IUML walked out of the House, charging that the Tamil Nadu government was not protecting the rights of minorities.

Udayakumar said as per the Centre’s instruction, house listing and housing census in Tamil Nadu would take place between June 16 and July 30, this year, ahead of the decennial census scheduled in February 2021.

Later, DMK chief M K Stalin told reporters outside the assembly that the AIADMK government feared that it would lose power if it passed a resolution against the Union government. “They will not only lose power, they (cabinet) will even go to prison as the Centre is vested with the powers to probe charges of corruption,” said Stalin. Earlier, he said in the assembly that people were in a state of fear over the impending NPR exercise and sought to know if the state government received any reply from the Centre on its request to avoid certain queries in NPR 2020. He said the DMK did not object to the NPR 2010 format as it was only a routine enumeration. But NPR 2020 is designed to pave way for NRC, said Stalin.

Udayakumar said the state was yet to receive a response from the Centre. “How will it be constitutionally binding if we pass a resolution against a law enacted by Parliament? Cases (relating to challenging the constitutional validity of CAA) are pending in the Supreme Court,” the minister said. The state had not issued any notification for the conduct of NPR. It would be done only after it receives “guidance” from the Centre as the state has requested the Centre to avoid three queries in NPR like place and date of birth of parents.

Pointing to the BJP allies YSR Congress and Telangana Rashtra Samithi changing their stance on NPR owing to local sentiments, Stalin said the Tamil Nadu government should also pass a resolution in the Cabinet and in the assembly.

63,['12/03/2020'],"7 of a family, including 4 kids, drown in Tapi boat capsize","Divers fished out body of a deceased on Wednesday

Surat: Seven people of a family , including four children , died after the boat in which they had gone for picnic capsized in the Tapi River on Dhuleti.

The tragic mishap took place in the upstream of Ukai reservoir at Bhitkhurd village, bordering Nandurbar district, in Tapi district’s Uchchhal taluka on Tuesday.

About 13 people, of whom 10 comprised youngsters and children from a family in Konkani Falia in Sundarpur village in Tapi district’s Uchhal taluka, had gone for picnic at Bhitkhurd village on Tuesday. Sometime in the afternoon, the picnickers decided to hire a boat to visit the small island located in the middle of the river.

Sources said that Bhitkhurd village, which borders the Tapi and Nandurbar district in Maharashtra, is a picnic hotspot for locals in Uchchhal taluka during weekends and festival holidays. A few locals from the village also provide visitors boat rides in Tapi River.

While returning from the island at about 2.30pm, sudden change in atmosphere coupled with strong winds toppled the boat which overturned and capsized in the deep waters. About six people managed to save themselves by swimming back to the island, while the others drowned in the gushing waters.

After the incident, scores of people from Bhitkhurd and adjoining villages gathered at the riverbed helping the fire brigade teams from Vyara, Surat and Songadh who sent their divers for search and rescue operation of the victims who had gone missing in the river.

Among the six people who swam to safety, three belong to Bhitkhurd village including the driver of the boat identified as Jignesh Valvi, 30, Amit Gamit, 28 and Vikas Gamit.

Sources said that two bodies — Angel Konkani, 5, and Sanjana Konkani, 14 — were recovered by the rescue teams the same night after search operations continued till late. The remaining five bodies could be recovered the next morning from the river. The other deceased have been identified as Abhishek Konanki, 11, Aradhya Konkani, 7, Urmila Konaki, 21, Vinod Konkani, 18, and Rajesh Konkani, 32 —all residents of Konkani Falia.

Superintendent of police, Tapi district, NN Chaudhary said, “All the deceased are relatives and had come to enjoy Dhuleti holiday at Bhitkhurd village. The boat got overturned due to bad weather and strong winds.”

Chaudhary added that all the seven bodies have been recovered by Wednesday morning and were handed over to the kin after post mortem at the Uchchhal community health centre (CHC).

64,['12/03/2020'],"D-St on edge as Dow Jones crashes over 1,600 points","Mumbai: Crashing global markets are again pushing Dalal Street investors to the edge. On Wednesday evening, the American markets sank on fears about the spread of coronavirus, with the number of countries reporting cases of the deadly virus reaching 100. The crash in crude oil prices last week is also affecting global market sentiment, which could turn out to be a blessing for net oil importers like India.

The late evening sell-off in markets overseas more than nullified Wednesday’s slightly higher close in India after some initial volatility, market players said. In early trades, as there were reports that New York may consider a lockdown to contain the spread of the deadly virus, the Dow Jones Index crashed more than 1,600 points, or about 6.5%, while Brazil’s Ibovespa was down over 9,000 points or 10%. Across the Atlantic, in late trades, FTSE in the UK was down 1.4%, while Dax in Germany was barely changed from its previous close.

Latest data on the coronavirus spread showed that all schools in 16 countries have been closed even as the death toll crossed 4,000. In India, the financial capital reported its first two infections with the total in the whole country crossing 60.

For Thursday in India, a lower close for the US market will weigh on sentiment, but the cheaper crude oil will give some support to not only equities but also the economy. “Our markets will be affected by the global selling spree, but we may not mirror the Dow’s image,” said Arun Kejriwal, director of investment advisory firm KRIS . “Also, lower crude prices are a blessing in disguise for us.”

In Wednesday’s market, Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank contributed to the sensex’s gain, while Infosys, SBI and IndusInd Bank pulled it down. Outside of the index stocks, the Yes Bank stock jumped 36% to Rs 29 on the BSE after RBI and SBI worked overtime on a revival plan for the troubled lender.

65,['12/03/2020'],GJEPC pays Rs 17L school fees for 300 kids of diamond workers,"The grant was the part of ‘Pratibha’ project launched by the GJEPC

Surat: The Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) paid Rs 17 lakh school fees for 300 children of diamond artisans on Wednesday. The grant was the part of ‘Pratibha’ project launched by the GJEPC.

The event was organized at Ashadeep school in Varachha where the GJEPC distributed school fees cheques for 300 diamond artisans’ children to over 140 schools in the city.

The GJEPC office-bearers said that the aim of the project ‘Pratibha’ is to identify the talent of the diamond artisans’ children studying in schools and provide them with the opportunity to make their career in the gems and jewellery sector.

A survey was conducted by the Diamond Industry Career Foundation (DCIF) and Ratna Abhushan Welfare Trust, Surat, a few months back where the families of artisans needing support in terms of school fees were identified. The schools were invited to provide the details of outstanding fees for such students.

About 140 schools sent the details of about 300 students who were unable to pay the school fees due to the crisis in the diamond industry.

Regional chairman, GJEPC, Dinesh Navadia, said, “Many artisans lost their jobs due to the prevailing situation and many are getting partial salary from the units. It is difficult for the families of diamond artisans to survive in such situation. However, we conducted the survey and found 300 such children whose parents were unable to pay their school fees.”

Navadia added, “The GJEPC issued cheques worth Rs 17 lakh through the Gems and Jewellery National Relief Foundation (GJNRF).”

Police booked Ravi Khandare (35), a labourer, for allegedly killing his wife Mohini. The accused had stabbed Mohini multiple times. The woman was staying with her parents and the accused lived separately in a nearby home after the couple had a fallout. After killing his wife the accused went to his home and hanged himself.

Mohini’s family took her to a hospital where she was declared brought dead. The angry family members went to Khandere’s house and found him hanging from the ceiling. He had used a saree to hang himself.

According to the police, Khandere and his wife had separated from each other for the past few months after a dispute. Khandare had suspected Mohini of extra-marital affair, following which the couple used to fight frequently.

On Tuesday, Khandere came to the house of Mohini’s parents to seek the custody of his two daughters, as he was leaving for Maharashtra. When Mohini refused to hand over her daughters to him, Khandere got angry and attacked her with a knife.

PATNA: JD(U) retained sitting members Harivansh Narayan Singh and Ram Nath Thakur while BJP named Vivek Thakur as its candidate from Bihar for the Rajya Sabha election to be held on March 26. Harivansh is Rajya Sabha deputy chairman while Vivek is the son of Dr C P Thakur, whose term in the Upper House is expiring in the first week of April. The last date for the filing of nomination papers for the five Rajya Sabha seats falling vacant from the state is March 13.

The five Rajya Sabha seats scheduled to fall vacant are of Harivansh, Ram Nath Thakur and Kehkeshan Parween from JD(U), as well as of Dr C P Thakur and R K Sinha from BJP.

Bihar CM and JD(U) national president Nitish Kumar on Wednesday cleared the names after the party’s core committee members “unanimously” zeroed in on Harivansh and Ram Nath, JD(U) state president Bashishtha Narayan Singh said.

Similarly, the BJP central election committee presided by party president J P Nadda cleared the name of former MLC Vivek on Tuesday itself. However, BJP announced the candidature of Vivek on Wednesday. RJD sources said it will announce its two candidates on Thursday.

Given the strength of the MLAs of the respective political parties in the state, JD(U) and RJD will be able to send two candidates each to the Rajya Sabha and the BJP one. In the NDA camp, JD(U) has 69 MLAs, followed by 54 of BJP and two of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP). In the grand alliance, RJD has 81 MLAs, followed by 26 of the Congress, besides three from the CPI(ML).

Each candidate would require 42 MLA votes to get elected to the Rajya Sabha. If there is no sixth independent candidate in the fray by March 13, the five official nominees would be deemed elected to the Rajya Sabha.

From JD(U) side, Ram Nath is the son of former CM late Karpoori Thakur. He belongs to an extremely backward caste, a preponderant social group whose support to the NDA is considered crucial during the October-November assembly elections. Vivek from BJP belongs to Bhumihar caste, an equally critical segment from among the upper castes.

Also, there had been virtual revolt in the state BJP during March-April last year, because the party had fielded only one Bhumihar caste leader Giriraj Singh in the 2019 parliamentary elections. The revolt had forced the party to make open “promise” that Bhumihars would get representation in the Rajya Sabha election from the state.

By that token, the major NDA constituents have taken extra care not to ruffle the “political aspirations” of the powerful or predominant caste groups in view of the assembly elections, observers felt.

VARANASI: Bharatiya Janata Party’s OBC cell Sonbhadra district unit general secretary Sunil Giri was brutally thrashed by Renukoot police outpost in-charge and his colleagues after he allegedly passed obscene comments on police, on Tuesday.

Several BJP workers reached the outpost to save him. The police had to use force to disperse them after which they staged a sit-in. To pacify the situation, SP Sonbhadra Ashish Srivastava ordered to attach the outpost in-charge Anjani Kumar Rai to police lines and engaged a circle officer to probe into the matter. Srivastava said that future action will be decided on arrival of investigation report.

According to sources, Rai was standing outside his outpost on Tuesday morning when Giri reached there and started reciting Holi songs followed by obscene comments on Rai. The cop asked him to stop such recitals. When Giri did not stop, Rai allegedly slapped him.

As he continued to recite comments, Rai and his colleagues allegdely thrashed him inside the outpost. On hearing his cries, several BJP supporters reached there to save him.

In the meantime, inspector Pipari Abhay Narain Tiwari and other senior officers also reached there. They tried to pacify the situation but later had to use force to disperse the BJP supporters. Giri was admitted to Hindalco hospital.

The BJP supporters returned and staged a sit-in demanding suspension of Rai. BJP’s Duddhi assembly area in-charge Rakesh Pandey said that if Giri was involved in unlawful activity he should have been booked but police brutality was unacceptable. The stir was called-off after the SP announced to attach Rai to police lines.

PATNA: As predicted by weathermen, skies turned cloudy in Patna and many other places in Bihar from Tuesday, though no rainfall was reported from anywhere in the state.

India Meteorological Department (IMD) has, however, predicted showers on Friday and wet weather over the weekend as well.

The IMD has predicted fairly widespread rainfall in Bihar on Friday and scattered intensity of showers on Saturday and Sunday.

The Patna Meteorological Centre on Wednesday also stated that rainfall with thunderstorm is likely to occur at one or two places on March 12 and 15 and at a few places on March 13 and 14.

A yellow-coloured warning for thunderstorm with lightning and gusty wind (30-40) kmph at few places was also issued for south-west and south-east Bihar for Thursday. Similar warning has been issued for all 38 districts in the state on Friday and Saturday. A yellow-coloured warning alerts the authority to be watchful for extreme weather conditions.

Private weather agency Skymetweather also reported that east Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand may see rain on March 15. There are chances of hailstorm activities and lightning strikes as well.

Meteorologists attributed the showers to an east-west trough running from induced cyclonic circulation to north Chhattisgarh across east Rajasthan and north Madhya Pradesh.

The prevailing weather is also expected to drop day temperature. Patna Meteorological Centre has predicted maximum temperature to come down from the prevailing 29-30 degrees C to 27-28 on Friday and Saturday. Minimum temperature is expected to be in the range of 17-18 degrees C till Sunday.

71,['12/03/2020'],RBI taps private investors to take stakes in Yes Bank,"MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India has drawn up a revival plan for Yes Bank whereby not just capital but also funding lines will be finalised to ensure that there is no liquidity issue upon lifting the moratorium imposed on March 5. Meanwhile, investors in additional tier one (AT1) bonds have agreed to a plan where 80% of their investment will be written off and the remaining 20% will be converted into equity.

While the contours of the deal have been finalised, the plan to lift the moratorium by the weekend may not materialise as many investors in the consortium have to get internal approvals to invest. As per the plan, the RBI will soon announce commitments from the State Bank of India (SBI) and other banks. While SBI will provide the bulk of the funds, it is also leading a host of private investors. The plan is expected to be announced at any time after confirmation from the investment banks.

However, this is taking time because the banking groups are trying to figure which of their group companies are best placed to invest. Besides SBI, HDFC Group, Kotak Bank and ICICI Group have also been sounded out to invest in the equity of Yes Bank.

Private investors like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and R K Damani, founder of DMart, are likely to join the consortium. RBI wants several investors to ensure that none of them (other than SBI) hold more than 5% stake. The government is keen on having private investors to ensure that the package is not seen as nationalisation. Also, most public sector banks are themselves in a capital conservation mode.

According to the plan, within 24 hours of the announcement (day two), the banks will infuse Rs 20,000 crore into the equity base. On the third day, public sector banks will invest around Rs 30,000 crore into certificates of deposits (CDs) of the bank; and the moratorium will be lifted on the fourth day. The reason why the fund infusion is being done through certificates of deposits is that it will give an assurance that the funding is there for some time and at the same time since CDs are tradeable the investing bank can sell them if required.

Yes Bank is also reaching out to large investors to reassure them that post-capital infusion, the bank will be in a sound position and is supported by the strongest institutions.

The capital infusion will improve the creditworthiness of the bank and make it easier for others to lend. By fixing an equity base of Rs 20,000 crore, the banks which will invest in the fresh equity will get a 75% stake in Yes Bank and the stake of existing shareholders will shrink to a fourth of the expanded equity base. Shares of Yes Bank were trading at Rs 28 in the BSE on Wednesday, 28% over its previous close. At current prices, the bank is valued at Rs 5,600 crore, which is twice the valuation announced by the RBI under its draft plan.

The AT1 bondholders have an investment of Rs 8,500 crore in Yes Bank. This will be converted into 170 crore equity at Rs 10 per share. As a result, the bondholders will account for Rs 1,700 crore investment in the consortium with a three-year lock-in. One tricky issue that could come up is that all the MFs are holding AT1 bonds in pure debt funds. While the lock-in norms require them to hold onto the bonds, Sebi guidelines have some restrictions about such funds investing in equities. One way out might be for the regulator to allow them to side-pocket those equities.

HYDERABAD: Higher enrollment of female students has forced many co-ed degree colleges to convert into women’s colleges in the districts from the 2020-21 academic year.

In February, the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) had invited applications from college managements interested in applying for conversions from co-ed education to women’s college and vice-versa and received eight applications. Of them, seven colleges in the districts applied for conversion to women’s colleges. There is only one college, located in Hyderabad, that applied for conversion to co-ed education.

Sri Chaitanya Degree College in Warangal, Jagruthi Women’s Degree College in Rangareddy, and PHRM Degree and PG College in Mahbubnagar some of the colleges who applied for inter-conversion.

While the college located in Hyderabad has applied for conversion due to poor-enrolment of only female students, the trend is much the opposite in districts. Officials claim that only women colleges in districts have higher enrolment as against institution offering co-ed education.

“In the last four or five years, we observed that almost 90% of our seats were filled by female students. There were barely a handful of male students who sought admission in our college. So, we decided to convert the college from a co-ed to a women’s institution,” said Eshwar Siripuram , principal of Vikas Degree College in Karimnagar .

Meanwhile, experts say that colleges in the districts see less number of male students and most of them are sent to Hyderabad for their higher studies as opposed to female students. “In districts, enrolment for female students is much higher as parents prefer them to stay in their proximity due to security concerns. Whereas, for male students parents don’t hesitate to send them to Hyderabad,” said Ramana Reddy, president of Telangana Degree and Post-Graduate Colleges Association.

74,['12/03/2020'],"Anna univ may not get IoE status, HRD says time’s up","Chennai: Anna University is set to lose its chance to become an institute of eminence (IoE). After clarifying doubts and waiting for eight months for a letter of commitment from the state government, the Union ministry of human resource development has informed Anna University that IoE status will be given to the next university on the list if it does not receive a letter of commitment immediately. Savitribai Phule Pune University is next on the list.

The MHRD had in August last year announced IoE status for seven public institutions, including Anna University and IIT Madras, and seven private institutions. While central institutions were granted the status instantly, the ministry a demanded letter of commitment for Anna University and Jadavpur University from the respective state governments promising their share of funds.

Anna University would receive Rs 1,000 crore from the Centre and more autonomy for the next five years if it gets the IoE status. The state government would have to spend Rs 1,570 crore.

""Although MHRD has agreed to all the conditions of the state government and university officials cleared the doubts of ministers, there has been no positive response from the state government for reasons unknown,"" officials from the university told TOI.

Earlier, the state government sought clarification on whether the Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institution and of Appointments or Posts in Services under the State) Act, 1993, which envisages 69% reservation would apply to Anna University after getting the IoE tag. The MHRD said the state government’s reservation policy would apply even after getting the IoE status.

The colleague escaped unhurt, but the constable was booked for attempt to murder and under the Arms Act at Sector 3 police station. He was later suspended and sent to Police Lines in Sector 26.

On Holi, accused Raj Karan, deputed at VIP security, was sitting with Naveen Kumar and Pardeep Kumar, also constables, at a roadside tea-stall near Sector 3 police station. Pardeep smeared Raj Karan’s face and uniform with colours. Raj Kanwar kept warning him not to do so as he was on duty, but Pardeep paid no heed. On this, both constables entered into a verbal spat, which escalated into a brawl. In a fit of anger, Raj Karan took out his service revolver and pointed at Pardeep. As he pressed the trigger, Naveen intervened and the bullet missed the target.

Pardeep escaped unhurt, but the matter reached police station. Later, both constables entered into a compromise. However, senior officers directed the Sector 3 police station to lodge an FIR.

Past incident

78,['12/03/2020'],"Jaypee resists takeover, smells like court battle","Chandigarh: The city’s garbage-processing operator, Jaypee, has moved district court against last Thursday’s decision in the municipal corporation general house of taking over the plant in a week. The deadline expires on Thursday noon.

The court has issued notice to the MC for a 10am hearing before additional sessions judge Vijay Singla, where the civic body will get the case details. Sources in the MC said the decision about takeover and its cost could be the key points from the side of Jaypee, and the civic authority is ready with a reply based on National Green Tribunal’s orders for running the plant in a proper manner. “If required, we will keep those orders before the court,” an official said.

Sources said since the matter had financial jurisdiction of more than Rs 1 crore, it has been listed in the court of the additional sessions judge. The sources also said that after the decision in the general house to take over the plant, some of the senior representatives of the recycling company had met the senior MC officials but since the house had taken a call, the officials concerned were unable to help.

The garbage-processing plant at Dadumajra will go out of the hands of Jaypee Group after 12 long years. The memorandum signed with the company in 2005 was cancelled over improper processing, ending a feud that reached NGT. The house gave the company a month to dismantle its machinery. Else, the civic body will remove the equipment and recover the cost. The house decided to assess the value of the recently installed compost plant and pay its worth to the company.

The MC will call an expression of interest to hire a new company to run the plant. The councillors were unanimous in kicking out the company for relief to the villagers of Dadumajra and adjoining areas. A permanent solution to city’s solid waste management stayed in a mess for a long time, as Jaypee and the MC kept differing over the amount of trash being received at the unit.

Dadumajra villagers and the residents of Sector 38 West want the MC to shift the garbage-processing plant because of bad odour and improper operation, an issue they had raised even during the last Lok Sabha elections. A mountain of landfill building up outside Dadumajra village has worsened the situation.

One of the circulars issued by the state school education department ordered to stop using biometric devices to record attendance from March 9 to March 31. The device is prone to causing spread of infections as many people touch the same surface multiple times every day. The attendance during the days would have to be marked manually in a register. However, the circular was initially ignored by some of the district educational officers (DEOs) in Madurai district and concerns were raised by teachers.

“Some of the DEOs didn’t follow the circular on March 9 and 10 as they said they had not got an official order from the district chief educational officer (CEO) in this regard. Later, the CEO intervened and immediately asked them to stop using the biometric device,” said the headmaster of a government school. By Wednesday, all schools had stopped the use of the device.

Apart from implementing proper hand hygiene and cough hygiene among students, one circular called for teachers to advise children with fever and cough to not to come to school, instead they should go to a hospital. All students were to be given proper awareness about the disease and preventive measures.

HYDERABAD: A day after 120 students of Kasturba Gandhi Girls’ School at Khila Shapur in Jangaon were allegedly thrashed by the principal of the school for taking bath after playing Holi, after being told not to do so owing to water shortage, Jangaon collector K Nikhila suspended the school principal.

“Based on a preliminary enquiry, I have suspended the principal,” said Nikhila, adding that she will probe into the matter further.

She said that a complaint was filed against the principal, Sumalatha, stating that she had punished the students for washing their hair.

Balala Hakkula Sangham (BHS) president Achyutha Rao, who lodged a complaint with officials of Jangaon district , alleged that 120 students of Classes 6 to 9 of the said residential school were beaten up by principal Sumalatha for washing their hair after playing holi. “The students were asked not to wash their hair owing to shortage of water in the hostel,” Rao added, and said that the principal rapped the students over the knuckles with a cane.

The BHS demanded that a criminal case be registered against the principal under relevant sections of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act and Section 325 of IPC. The sangham further demanded that the principal be permanently sacked.

The incident came to light after the students’ parents staged a dharna in front of the school on Tuesday.

83,['12/03/2020'],State has no clue about the fishermen stranded in Iran,"Thiruvananthapuram: Even as groups of fishermen from Kerala trapped in Iran , one of the worst Covid 19-affected countries, are sharing SOS videos on Facebook , the state government is clueless on their actual numbers or whether these men are legal immigrants.

“The Indian Embassy in Iran doesn’t have documents on their (fishermen’s) residence in that country, which suggests that these men are working there without a proper visa. The embassy informed that it has contacted this group of fishermen. We can only believe what they (Embassy officials) say,” said fisheries minister J Mercykutty Amma.

Government has collected some addresses based on a few complaints received from their families and has forwarded the details to Indian Embassy through Norka department, she said.

But, state government sent the details of only 18 fishermen from Kerala, while the SOS videos repeatedly talked about hundreds of them being stranded in various places in Iran. As per the information received from the embassy, there are 800 Indian fishermen in Iran and the numbers could be much higher if there are illegal migrants, the minister said.

Meanwhile, fishermen organizations back home pointed out that around 900 fishermen from Kerala and Tamil Nadu were working in places like Kish, Kangan, Lavan, Mogham, Zero, Chiruyeh, Bhushar, Sharak and Alshoor in Iran. These organizations have sent separate letters to the Centre and Indian Embassy informing that the fishermen have run out of supplies and hence they need to be rescued on a ‘war footing’.

“We sent a letter to the Prime Minister on Monday for an immediate intervention to bring them back safely to their respective states. The changing Covid-19 situations back home seem to be diverting the governments’ attention,” said general secretary of National Fishworkers’ Forum T Peter. The trapped fishermen have run out of supply of food and drinking water, and their sponsors are not at all helpful, he added.

“We were informed by our fishermen that no official from Indian Embassy met them and listened to their grievances... We are eagerly waiting to know the schedule of the medical test for the fishermen. Please provide them the medical test at the earliest. They are waiting for several days to finish formalities, so that they can return to India...” said a letter sent by Justin Antony, founder president of International Fishermen Development Trust to Indian Embassy in Iran0.

Meanwhile, the latest video from the fishermen has criticized the state government and political organizations back home ‘for sitting idle’ on their plea for an immediate rescue. “We have among us several people who risked their lives to save people during floods in Kerala. Nobody seems to care about us, while help is extended to students and pilgrims. Don’t our lives have any worth?” they asked in the video.

84,['12/03/2020'],"Prospective kidney donors key to fight against chronic disease, say doctors","Madurai: Many prospective kidney donors, mostly relatives of patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD), who are hesitant to come forward for live donations must change their perception to tackle the disease, urged doctors and experts on ‘World Kidney Day’, observed on March 11.

Two of the major causes of CKD include diabetes and hypertension, conditions which are in turn drastically on the rise due to lifestyle factors. “Transplantation is the only permanent solution for CKD as compared to a lifetime of undergoing temporary fixes like medicine and dialysis. So, we try to convince a patient’s kin to go for transplantation,” said Dr N Dhinakaran, director and chief nephrologist, Madurai Kidney Centre and Transplantation Research Institute.

According to Dr K Balakrishnan, head, Department of Immunology, Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU), the role of kidney donors is vital to prevent hospitals from being overburdened. “It has come to a situation where patients have to wait in a queue in hospitals for undergoing dialysis. Sadly, even the educated have an inherent fear of losing an organ, when it comes to donating. Donors need to manage their diet and lifestyle after transplantation for lifetime,” he said.

Dhinakaran said that one of the main concerns that prospective kidney donors need to watch out for is that though the human body can function normally with just one kidney, in case of an infection, it would be difficult to manage. However, the onus is on doctors and counsellors at hospitals to convince the prospective donor and ensure that the person is ready to face any difficulty.

Balakrishnan, who also runs the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) laboratory at MKU which does HLA tissue typing cross-match tests for around 30 hospitals across south Tamil Nadu, said that around 100 kidney transplants have been done per year in the region during the past 10 years.

He said there was a sharp rise in the number of cadaveric kidney transplants in recent times. The number of cadaveric kidney transplants is almost three times higher in 2018-2019 as compared to 2015-2016, jumping from around 40 per year to more than 130 per year.

“Since 2015-2016, a total of around 500 cadaveric kidney transplants have been done. More awareness about organ donation has helped in the rise of the number of cadaveric kidney transplants,” added Balakrishnan.

86,['12/03/2020'],NGT orders check of civic incinerator on economic norms in Pune,"PUNE: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed a three-member expert panel to inspect the civic body’s incinerator plant at Keshavnagar, Mundhwa for disposal of animal carcass following a plea alleging that it was being operated without a valid environment clearance under the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification of 2006.

Among other fears, Keshavnagar resident Mohan Nanasaheb Kudale raised in his plea concerns about the health hazards posed to the residents around the plant and the pollution and foul smell in the area caused by it.

The green tribunal’s bench of Justice S P Wangdi and expert member Satyawan Singh Garbyal on March 6 directed the Union environment ministry’s regional office in Nagpur, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and the Pune district collector to jointly inspect the plant and file a report. The bench also asked the panel members to take action against the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in case they came across any illegality and submit a compliance report before the next date hearing on April 23.

The civic body had taken up the incinerator plant project in 2012-13 and conducted trials on March 10, 2013. That is when a local resident had filed a writ petition in the Bombay high court, citing lack of apt consent and clearances to operate the plant. The high court on July 11, 2013, directed the PMC to not operate the plant unless it secured all the necessary permissions. This was after the PMC’s lawyer gave an assurance to that effect.

Kudale’s lawyer, Saurabh Kulkarni, told TOI, “The matter was since pending before the high court, which finally disposed of the petition on January 24, 2020 after the MPCB gave its consent to the PMC on January 20, 2020, to operate the plant.”

He said, “The PMC has since commenced its operation at the plant, but it is our case that the MPCB, while giving its consent, did not verify whether the civic body had an environment clearance for the project. In fact, it still does not have such clearance and that is the reason, the NGT has involved the Union environment ministry’s regional office at Nagpur for the joint inspection.”

Kulkarni said, “Entry number 7 in the EIA notification makes it mandatory for all hazardous waste and incinerator plants to obtain an environment clearance before they go fully functional. In the instant case, the incinerator plant falls within “A” category projects and an environment clearance for the same can be issued only by the central government. This not being the case, the PMC still went ahead with operationalising the plant.”

Applicant Kudale has said in his plea that the 2000kg capacity incinerator plant (500kg per hour burning rate) has been installed with an expenditure of Rs3 crore. As per the EIA notification, it is categorised as a Common Hazardous Waste Treatement, Storage and Disposal facility falling within red category of industries for which the consent ought to have come from the Central Pollution Control Board and not the MPCB.

Nagpur: Women empowerment, discrimination and lack of opportunities at workplace, and challenges at personal and professional fronts were the focal points at a panel discussion on ‘Women in education administration – challenges, opportunities and solutions’ organized by Indira Gandhi National Open University (Ignou), Nagpur regional centre, to mark International Women’s Day, on Monday.

Regional director P Sivaswaroop, in his introductory address said that there is a difference between academic administration and office administration . “In the former, administration is done more in a consultative manner, however sometimes many administrations are apathetic to the problems faced by women,” he said.

The panellists included women who shared their experiences and challenges. Dr Shakti Sharma, Ignou coordinator, Raisoni Women’ College, said that by and large men don’t realize and acknowledge that women face discrimination. “In most organizations, there are few women at the top. Discrimination against women is not a problem of just women, but of men too.”

She stated that women have to work much harder and prove themselves again and again as compared to their male counterparts. “Fortunately, the world is changing. Today our voices are being heard and our potential is being recognized,” she said.

Dr Naqui Siddique, Ignou coordinator from Institute of Science, pointed out the difficulties in maintaining a work-life balance. “It is very hard to stay away from kids on holidays and festivals. It is inherently, but unjustly, expected from women to make sacrifices and compromises.”

Dr Sadhana Jain, from NSRC-ISRO, stated that if there is only one woman in a group of 10 while rest are men, chances of her getting an opportunity are significantly less. Jyotsna Meshram, head of the department of chemistry, Nagpur University, informed that there are less than 15% women working in science today. “This number needs to increase. It is unfortunate that society sometimes plays a negative role when it comes to women empowerment.”

According to Rajshree Yadav, dean, faculty of interdisciplinary studies, Nagpur University, it is very difficult to move forward without someone having faith in you. “We women are conscious beings with conscious minds. We are not mere showpieces. This needs to be taught to young girls and parents alike. Women have immense potential and ability. It all depends on the efforts one takes to harness it,” she said.

90,['12/03/2020'],‘DMK worried it can’t do politics over delta’,"Chennai: Asserting that no new hydrocarbon scheme would be allowed in the state as the AIADMK government had enacted a law to protect the Cauvery delta, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said in the assembly on Wednesday that the opposition DMK was scared that it would not be able to do politics over the delta hereafter.

The Centre has clarified that the final decision on whether to allow any particular project in a particular region would continue to vest with the state government. “Our government brought the scheme for the welfare of farmers. It is now clear that the DMK dislikes it,” the CM said, pointing to a recent query raised by a DMK MP in the Parliament about the competence of the state government in enacting a law on a Central subject. Palaniswami said the DMK’s drama would not help hoodwink the people of delta region.

He was responding to former DMK minister T M Anbarasan’s observation that the Centre had given its nod to Vedanta Limited and ONGC to drill 341 wells to explore hydrocarbons in Tamil Nadu. The Centre has also amended the Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, exempting hydrocarbon exploration projects from public hearing.

Later, intervening in the debate in the afternoon, the CM recalled a letter written by Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar, which he had read out in the previous assembly session just ahead of enacting the law. “You (the DMK) may not like it. But there is no confusion in our law. You are deliberately trying to confuse farmers in the delta,” the CM said.

While the law bans new industries, the CM said, banning existing units would not work as it would result in companies moving courts. The government would have to compensate their investment too, he said.

Pugazhendhi, 35, from Othakadai, a development officer at Aavin, had been suspended more than a week ago due to some issues related to his work. Pugazhendhi is said to have been under immense stress during the past few days.

On Tuesday night, Pugazhendhi ended his life, said police. On Wednesday, after his body was recovered and brought to Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) for autopsy, the Pugazhendhi’s kin protested demanding for action to be taken against those responsible for his death.

The kin refused to accept his body and sat outside the hospital disrupting traffic. They demanded for a judicial inquiry and action against higher officials at Aavin for being responsible for Pugazhendhi’s taking the drastic step. After long talks with the police, the kin dispersed and received the body for burial at their native village. The Othakadai police have, meanwhile, registered a case and are investigating. During investigation, the police recovered a suicide note in Pugazhendhi’s handwriting from his room as well.

Mohali: A 17-year-old boy was found dead under mysterious circumstances at his school in Mataur on Monday evening.

Harmanjeet Singh, a resident of Morinda, was a Class XI (medical) student of Meritorious School in Sector 70.

102,['12/03/2020'],Lull in Kerala over corona hits banana farmers hard,"Trichy: Traders from Kerala have asked banana growers in Trichy not to arrange consignments as a majority of hotels, shops and commercial establishments there are witnessing poor sales owing to the Covid-19 cases and subsequent restrictions imposed there. This has come as a double blow to farmers cultivating the Nendran variety who have been reeling under a drastic price fall.

Nendran cultivated in Trichy is predominantly sent to Kerala where it is consumed as a popular food item. However, the instances of Covid-19 cases in that state have now stalled the entire procurement of Nendran from Tamil Nadu, particularly Trichy. V Prabhu, a native of Pettaivaithalai, says he raised the variety on 13 acres. The harvest began two weeks ago, but he has so far sold the produce only from 3 acres. Meanwhile, traders who came from Ernakulam told him that they are going to suspend procurement for some time because of the Covid-19 impact.

“We don’t know how to sell and where to sell them now,” he lamented. Shino K Jose, a representative of a trader from Kerala who arrived at Pettaivaithalai told TOI that he was told to stop loading banana with Wednesday’s consignment. V Kalaichezhiyan from Uthamarseeli, who has cultivated Nendran on 5 acres, said his produce would usually be procured by traders from Thalassery, Edappal, Palakkad and Taliparamba in Kannur. “They have expressed their inability to procure banana from my field citing poor business in the state following the crash in overall sales in their state. We hope that the present condition will change soon”, he said.

When contacted A Akbar, 30, the proprietor of Akbar Food Exports in Ernakulam told TOI over phone that coronavirus instances have created panic among the public. “To avert any contact with others, people are avoiding hotels, shops and other commercial establishments. So we have curtailed banana procurement”, Akbar added. Deputy director of agriculture marketing, Trichy, Murugan confirmed that Covid-19 has brought down Nendran procurement considerably.

103,['12/03/2020'],Chennai: Police start fixing camera on MTC buses,"A CCTV camera (in red) in a bus

CHENNAI: Police have started installing CCTV cameras on Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses to ensure safety of passengers.

Three cameras were recently fitted, one externally and two internally, in a bus plying along route 54L (Poonamalle-Broadway). They were fitted in the front left corner (opposite to driver’s seat), rear end and above the left rear-view mirror.

While the first two are aimed at passenger safety, the third one is to ensure that no one travels on footboard and ascertain cause of accidents.

The initiative by Adyar deputy commissioner P Pakalavan and Saidapet inspector Pugazhendhi was primarily aimed at stopping Government Arts College, Nandanam students from travelling on footboard and creating nuisance but it has helped them in several other ways.

“For instance, we now have record of who all travelled on the bus. This will help in identifying bag lifting, pickpocket and eve-teasing suspects,” said Pugazhendhi.

The external camera will play a key role in solving other crimes too as it records all other vehicles, people on road during trip. Given that the bus is also moving at a decent speed, the external camera is able to record number plate details of vehicles with much better quality compared to static CCTV cameras,” he added.

Since the camera has a 15-day backup, footage can be easily retrieved soon after a crime is reported. Efforts are under way to install such cameras on buses on route 23C and 18K as well.

A senior MTC official said similar cameras will be fitted in all 3,300 buses soon at Rs 75 crore and tenders for the project were being prepared.

The protester, who was admitted to the hospital, had been agitating for a year with the demand to make Gairsain the state capital.

The action by police comes weeks after the administration had announced that the dharna sthal will be shifted from Parade Ground to Adhoiwala, Ekta Vihar. A notice (dated March 9) was put up by the administration which said that the designated site for protest is now shifted to Adhoiwala and all such protests shall take place in Adhoiwala from March 11 onwards.

However, the decision was vehemently opposed by protesters who claim that the administration only wants to weaken the impact of protests through the move.

“The current dharna sthal in the Parade Ground is situated right in the heart of the city. This is why protests get media coverage. The new location which is on the outskirts, won’t have that impact,” said Ramesh Singh, a protester.

“Adhoiwala protest ground is in a very bad shape. There is a bad stench there and the place has waterlogging issues as well. How can the administration expect us to protest there?” asked another protester.

Meanwhile, officials remained dogged in their pursuit of clearing the area and by late evening on Wednesday, JCB machines had already been deployed and the ground was being dug up for construction.

Nalini sought the relief on the ground that the governor has failed to act as per the recommendation of the state cabinet and release her.

Rejecting her plea, a division bench of Justices R Subbiah and R Pongiappan said the 2018 recommendation of the government will come into force only when the governor affixes his signature, which is mandatory.

Merely based on the advice of the council of ministers for premature release the detention cannot be declared by this court as illegal or unreasonable since it was not signed by the governor, the court added.

“The fundamental right or the personal liberty of the petitioner guaranteed under Article 14 or 21 of the Constitution has not been infringed and, therefore, we are of the view the petition itself is not maintainable,"" the court said.

PATNA: Works on construction of a four-lane elevated road between Kargil Chowk and NIT Mor is likely to commence by this year end. CM Nitish Kumar on Monday approved the project aimed at decongesting busy Ashok Rajpath.

While making a presentation on the elevated road, Road Construction Department (RCD) principal secretary Amrit Lal Meena said it will have four lanes. The road will also have connectivity with Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) along with an approach, connecting Ganga Path at Krishna Ghat. It will have an estimated outlay of Rs315 crore.

CM Nitish said the elevated road will benefit people near PMCH, Patna University and many areas further east.

RCD minister Nand Kishore Yadav told TOI on Wednesday that detailed deliberation was held on the design and alignment of the project. “The DPR for the project is targeted to be made ready in three months, following which bidding process will commence for roping in construction agency,” he said.

Deliberations were also held on alignment of a new four-lane bridge parallel to JP Setu on river Ganga between Digha and Naya Gaon. Instructions were given to officials concerned to finalize the DPR for the bridge at the earliest. Yadav said the bridge will be constructed by the state government’s funds.

The chief minister also asked the officials to expedite works on Lohia Path Chakra on Bailey Road. Instructions were also issued for spot inspection of the project site by principal secretaries of the departments concerned, under the leadership of chief secretary to remove the bottlenecks in its speedy execution.

“The concept of Lohia Path Chakra is one-of-a-kind in the country. Officials should do regular spot inspections,” Nitish said.

The CM also said the proposed elevated road from Chiraiyatand railway overbridge (RoB) to Kankarbagh Colony will decongest vehicular movement in that part of the city.

Patna apart, approval was also given to the design of a Laxman Jhula (suspended cable bridge) on Falgu river between Vishnupad temple and Sita Kund. The DPR for the proposed bridge has been made by Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited and it will be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs60 crore. “No vehicular movement will be allowed on that bridge.

111,['12/03/2020'],Social worker moves HC for sampling of road building material to test quality,"Nagpur: A social worker has approached the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court with an intervention demanding sampling of road building material to test quality and removal of undulations and rough surfaces from the paver blocks laid adjacent to cement roads to make them less bumpy.

He also objected on position of the median on roads below Mankapur to Kasturchand Park flyover contending that those are very wide which is leading to severe congestion in traffic.

The application was filed in the suo Motu criminal PIL (No 838/2019) based on TOI report exposing dreadful conditions of city roads leading to several accidents and loss of lives till January 15. The HC had appointed Raheel Mirza as amicus curiae to plead the case.

After accepting intervener Mrunall Chakravorty’s prayers, the court had fixed the hearing on Wednesday, but it couldn’t reach till the judges were seated.

According to the intervener, potholes develop due to inappropriate quality and inadequate quality of bitumen in the bituminous mix. “I haven’t seen any road building agency sampling the bitumen mix and sending them for quality testing. Surprise sampling by reputed agencies would help.”

Pointing out towards apathy of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) and National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) officials while laying paver blocks adjacent to cement roads in the city, Chakravorty said undulations and rough surfaces makes riding on them bumpy and stressful. “The Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) in Delhi has facility for checking undulations and roughness of roads. Those can be removed by scraping the surface or laying a coat of bituminous mix,” he pointed out.

Expressing surprise over how only middle part of any road is concretized even as tar roads are excavated fully and then paver blocks are laid, he said when he approached the authorities for reason, he was told that utility lines like for power and telecommunications are laid latter. For maintenance of those lines and their repairs, it’s very easy to remove those blocks, he was told. “Instead of blocks, the entire portion should be re-laid with bitumen to prevent bumpy ride. At least the portion from where paver blocks are removed should be covered with the coat of bituminous mixture,” he said.

Quoting NHAI officials on median on roads below new flyovers at Sadar, Chakravorty said they gave a reason that a narrow single separator median would lead to damage to pillars by collision of vehicles.

“I told them about MahaMetro’s pillars, some of which are standing at the middle of roads, which are having a protective layer. Even metal guards surrounding those pillars would be enough for their protection. Simultaneously, it would provide more space for the traffic,” he said.

PUNE: A magisterial court in Pune cantonment has ordered the remand of three engineering students, arrested on charges of fatally pushing their 23-year-old roommate off the 11th floor of a Kondhwa building, in police custody till March 14.

Police told the court on Wednesday that they wanted to recover the motorcycle used by the arrested trio — Abhinav Jadhav (23), Akshay Gorde (22) and Tejas Gujar (19) — to bring the victim, Sagar Narsinh Chilevari, to the crime scene, and establish ownership of the bike apart from getting trio medically examined for their blood, nails and hair samples.

Sagar, who was living with the three suspects in an 11th floor flat at Kul Utsav society on Pisoli Road, near Khadi Machine chowk, had taken a Rs15,000 loan at 10% annual interest from Abhinav and was unable to repay him. Abhinav had been asking for his money back.

Late on Monday night, Abhinav, Akshay and Tejas drove triple-seat on a bike to Swargate, where they picked up Sagar. They brought him back to the society, where they assaulted him and eventually pushed him off the 11th floor, police said.

Seeking a five-day custodial remand for the three students, investigating officer Mahadeo Kumbhar told the court that the police wanted to establish the spot in Swargate where Sagar was picked up from, apart from establishing the source of money loaned to him. The police also want to investigate the possible involvement of any other person in the crime and secure details of cell numbers and call data records. The police were also probing if Abhinav had given money on interest to anyone else.

115,['12/03/2020'],COVID-19: China slowdown set to shake Indian market sectors,"AHMEDABAD: The ripples of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak across certain countries are likely to hurt various manufacturing and market sectors in India, where imports from China stand at US $70 billion.China and some countries in South-East Asia have been the worst affected by the disease accounting for approximately 90% of the cases reported so far.A March report by rating agency ICRA titled ‘Ripple effect of COVID outbreak to impact India Inc',’ says sectors like automotive, pharmaceuticals and others stand to lose, while those like steel and oil and gas stand to gain from the coronavirus outbreak fallout.Given that China’s share of global GDP standing at 17% is substantial, a cascading effect of China’s slowdown on the global economy is inevitable as China and South-East Asia are key suppliers and consumers of certain products, the report said.Supply disruptions of key raw materials in pharmaceuticals, electronics and renewable energy sectors will affect production in India if the situation persists, the ICRA report states. These sectors have a direct or indirect import dependence on affected markets for components or sub-components.COVID-19 could cause demand disruption and price corrections in sectors like cut and polished diamonds, cotton yarn (textiles) and seafoods where the affected markets are large importers from India. There will also be effects on commodities like oil and gas, metals, among others, according to ICRA.In the current scenario, where dropping and lengthening of payment cycles is expected, an entity’s liquidity position is of paramount importance to support its credit profile.“ICRA expects entities with weak liquidity buffer relative to its upcoming debt service obligations to report significant weakening of their credit profile over the next couple of quarters,” the report stated.AutomotiveChina supplies 27% of India’s auto components, valued at US$ 4.5 billion. Critical items like safety components, fuel injection pumps, EGR modules, electronic components, turbochargers etc, are sourced from countries currently affected by coronavirus. Currently, companies have overall inventory for a few weeks, but lack of a single critical component can affect productionPharmaceuticalsImport dependence is high at 60% for API requirement, of which China accounts for 65-70%. For some intermediates and key starting materials (KSMs), China is the sole supplier. Domestic API manufacturers have supplies till mid-March, beyond which production and prices including that of raw materials will be affected if the situation continues.Solar energyIndia imports approximately 70% of its requirement of photovoltaic (PV) modules from China, which controls about 80% of the global supply of solar panels. Shifting to other suppliers is currently next to impossible. Thus, execution timelines for ongoing solar projects are likely to be affected and costs of PV modules expected to go up.Gems & jewelleryWhile China buys around 14% of polished diamonds from India, a larger proportion of exports from India (35%) are routed via Hong Kong. The problem was compounded as the shutdown occurred during the peak sales period in China. Increased inventory levels and supply glut may lead to price corrections as well.TextilesOf the cotton yarn produced in India, 30% is exported, and one-third of that goes to China. With China locked down, yarn realizations have corrected 2-3% since beginning of February. Domestic spinners may lose their competitive edge in the global market if the situation persists. In the long term, sectors like apparels can benefit.SteelBenefiting from the situation, domestic steelmakers have effected two price hikes since February, given the likely decline in steel imports to India in Q1 FY2021. Indian mills have the opportunity to increase market share in exports to key markets as well, given the restrictions in trade flows from Korea, China and Japan.Oil & gasWith the demand for oil and petroleum products waning in the wake of the COVID outbreak in China, international crude oil prices have dropped. Distressed cargoes are being offered to large consumers such as India, with refining companies in China unable to deliver. Profitability of upstream companies is likely to be affected.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74592338,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-163399,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-19-china-slowdown-set-to-shake-indian-market-sectors/articleshow/74584042.cms

Police said that the two brothers had arguments with Pathak and they shoved him away. As Vijay held Pathak’s hand, he punched him several times on his chest due to which Vijay let him loose and complained of severe pain.

Rajesh took his brother to a doctor in their village. But even after taking medicine when his pain did not subside, Vijay was taken to a nursing home at Ajwa Road in Vadodara. The doctor told Rajesh, that his brother’s health was critical and suggested him to take him to a cardiac hospital. The family members rushed him to a private cardiac hospital in Warasia. The doctors there declared him dead on admission. Rajesh then informed Waghodiya police about the incident and a murder case was registered against Pathak in the wee hours of Wednesday.

Cops went to arrest Pathak at his home in the middle of the night, but he had fled by then. “We have lodged murder case based on the preliminary reports and are searching for the accused. The exact reason for his death will be known once the post-mortem report will arrive,” said a police official. He added that Pathak manages his father’s medical clinic at Jarod.

Chief public relations officer (CPRO), North Central Railways (NCR), Ajeet Kumar Singh said minister of railways Piyush Goyal has directed the Railway Board to ensure adequate measures to spread awareness and inform people about preventive steps.

Railway Board chairman Vinod Kumar Yadav held a meeting with general managers last week to review preparedness and convey priorities and directions.

Staff members have been sensitized and coordination with health authorities is also being ensured,” Singh said. The official said people were being made aware through means of information, education, and communication (IEC) material (posters and pamphlets) regarding coronavirus and also being displayed for general public in local language at railway stations and in trains.

He said the material was also being distributed to patients visiting hospitals and in railway colonies. Control rooms and telephone helplines have also been set up at all railway hospitals, the CPRO added.

123,['12/03/2020'],From a humble beginning to hardcore Hindutva ride,"Hyderabad: Fortyeight-year-old Bandi Sanjay Kumar was in-charge of vehicles during the rath yatra undertaken by veteran BJP leader LK Advani when it passed through the undivided Andhra Pradesh in 1990. Thirty years later, Lady Luck smiled on Sanjay who became the Telangana state party president.

Born in a humble agricultural family in Karimnagar, Sanjay was inspired by RSS leaders before he plunged into public service. A strong Hindutva votary, Sanjay nurtured himself from the grassroots before becoming an MP for the first time when he won the Karimnagar seat in 2019 general elections.

“Though Sanjay’s simplicity was much appreciated, his ability to strike a chord with lowest rung workers and build a rapport with seniors and new leaders has always come in handy,” a senior leader from Karimnagar said.

In 2014 assembly elections, he contested from Kariamnagar but lost to TRS candidate. He contested in December 2018 but lost again to TRS candiate. “Unfazed by the defeat, he entered the fray from the Lok Sabha in 2019 and defeated the sitting MP,” a party leader said.

Sanjay served as Karimnagar convenor of ABVP, town president and vice-president of ABVP state unit. He was elected as a corporator (for three times) in Karimnagar.

His growth in the saffron party was gradual. Before winning the Karimnagar Lok Sabha seat with a margin of 96,000 votes against TRS sitting MP B Vinod Kumar, Sanjay was drafted by the party leadership to look after the party affairs in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. In his election affidavit, Sanjay had declared Rs 22.7 lakh assets and Rs 13.41 lakh liabilities. He had six criminal cases filed against him but had not been convicted in any case.

Sanjay’s appointment looked inevitable with outgoing chief K Laxman sharing with party seniors that he would be happy to serve in any position. There is a strong speculation that Laxman could be offered a Rajay Sabha seat from Madhya Pradesh or Karnataka.

Sanjay also worked as director of Karimnagar Cooperative Urban Bank for two terms. His wife Bandi Aparna works in SBI and the couple has two sons.

As of Wednesday, the hospital has seen nine foreign returnees admitted with symptoms of the virus though none of them tested positive. A 35-year-old man now under treatment also is recovering from the fever, said the dean.

Stating that the test results of suspected patients can be obtained in 12 hours from Kings Institute in Chennai, the dean said that one more testing facility is coming up in the government medical college in Theni. “None of the private labs in the city is authorised to take up the test to confirm Covid-19,” she said. A public health department official said that about 35,000 passengers were screened in the Trichy airport till Monday. Of them, about 1,200 passengers had symptoms such as fever and cough. Since they were residents of other districts, the public health department of the respective districts were intimated about their arrival for the necessary follow-up for quarantining.

This follows a report carried in TOI on Wednesday highlighting the farmers’ worries due to a sharp decline in price.

The report had also pointed out that facilities established by the government to help banana farmers by spending crores of rupees were idling for years. Following the report, the officials visited the primary processing centres established for the benefit of banana as well as onion farmers including in Mannachanallur on Wednesday. They elaborated the steps taken by the department to maximise the selling price of banana by linking them to proper channels.

Deputy director of agriculture marketing, Trichy, Murugan told reporters that two weeks ago Nendran was sold at Rs 33 a kg. However, the price had now slumped to a range of Rs 10 to Rs 13.

“To help farmers mitigate this situation, we have identified seven Uzhavar Santhai in the district and allotted separate shops for them to sell Nendran. Interested farmers can approach the concerned administrative officers in Uzhavar Santhai and enrol themselves”, he said.

Moreover, all efforts have been taken to operate all the primary processing centres at the earliest, he further said. “We have also planned to impart training to produce value-added products from their produce to maximise their profit”, Murugan added.

128,['12/03/2020'],Man arrested for his role in hostile takeover of city firm,"Pavan Rathi

Vadodara: Five months after the chairman of Manpasand Beverages Ltd (MBL) Dhirendra Singh had alleged hostile takeover of his company by Bharat Patel of Mumbai-based Finquest Financial Solutions Pvt Ltd’s (FFSPL) and his associates, Vadodara rural police arrested the first accused on Tuesday.

Pavan Rathi, one of the associates of Patel as alleged by Singh, was nabbed by the local crime branch from his home in Gorwa. Rathi was absconding since Singh had lodged the complaint at Bhadarva police station on September 27 last year. LCB sleuths reached his home on Tuesday to arrest him on receiving information a few days back about his whereabouts.

Police said that Rathi and three other associates of Patel – Vishal Zariwala, Parashiva Murthy B S and Hardik Patel – arrived at MBL’s office in the first week of July last year to take possession of all its property and bank documents and papers of the company. They told the account executive that they have taken over the company and will be handling all operations.

Rathi was made a signing authority along with Murthy and Zariwala of a new bank account of MBL. On July 23, the trio had transferred Rs 2.4 crore from MBL’s bank account to the new account. A day later Rs 2 crore from the new account was transferred to FFSPL’s account.

The trio has also been accused of transferring Rs 52.5 lakh from MBL’s bank account to the new account between July and August.

“The accused is being interrogated about more wrongdoings of his and others while they had taken over the control. Our teams are also trying to track down other accused,” said inspector D B Vala of LCB.

Last year, Singh was promised a loan of Rs 100 crore by FFSPL’s Patel and Ajay Agrawal as he had to pay Rs 17.77 crore to Central GST (CGST) department for bailing out his two sons and chief financial officer. Singh was asked to mortgage his personal holding of 44.32% in MBL and he was made to sign on a business agreement. Singh had claimed in his complaint that when he had signed the agreements, he was not mentally and physically fit, but as a former director of MBL Vishal Sood had assured him that he had seen all papers, he signed them, but later realized that he had been cheated.

City traffic police also booked 2,561 people for rash and negligent driving during the same period.

The number of cases was the highest in last three years. Police had caught 897 motorists in 2018 and 858 in 2019 for drunk driving, statistics revealed.

“For the last couple of years, our efforts have been concentrated on preventing accidents,” a senior official from the office of deputy commissioner of police (traffic) told TOI. The drive had a positive impact this year too, as the city did not report even a single fatal accident on Tuesday, said a cop from the police information centre. However, one Vikas Bagde, 47, died due to head injuries after his moped dashed against a road divider on Manewada Cement road on Monday night.

Armed with breathalysers, around 500 traffic police personnel from all 10 zones were out for crackdown on traffic offenders on both days for over five hours and stood at major intersections, taking motorists by surprise. The campaign reached its peak between 2pm and 4pm, and ended at around 9pm.

Along with booking the offenders, the police also detained their vehicles. A majority of those charged were in the age group of 20-50 and most were two-wheeler riders.

Among the 10 zones, the highest numbers of drivers were caught under the jurisdiction of Kamptee traffic zone with 150 cases, followed by Cotton Market with 144 cases, Sitabuldi with 116 and Lakadganj zone 111, respectively.

Besides this, the police also penalized 2,561 motorists — both two and four-wheeler riders/drivers for indulging in rash and negligent driving on both the days. 633 persons were booked for riding two-wheelers without helmets, while 555 motorists were caught after they were found riding their vehicles with two pillion riders.

But Rahoof is now stuck in his house at Vengara in Malappuram, following the sudden ban imposed by Qatar on March 8 on entry to all travellers from India and 13 other countries as part of Covid-19 precautions.

Worse still, Rahoof’s Qatar residency permit (work visa) is set to expire on March 14, making his return trip and even continuation of his job in the Gulf country all the more uncertain.

“I am now literally locked up here. I was planning to renew the residency permit soon after reaching Qatar and now there is no chance for me reaching Qatar before it expires on March 14. Some say that the expired visa can be renewed within a month of expiry if the sponsor approaches the passport office and submits an application. But with the indefinite travel ban in place, everything is uncertain,” he added.

Rahoof is not alone in facing such a predicament. The ban imposed by Qatar and Kuwait on entry of passengers from India has affected many expats who have come home on leave.

Also, non-resident Keralites (NRKs), who came home on long leaves, are concerned over the delay of their trip back to their place of work as Qatar visa rules say that foreigners holding Qatar residency permits are not permitted to be outside Qatar for a continuous period exceeding six months. “The travel restriction, which came all of a sudden, has left many stranded in Kerala. We now hope that the government authorities as well as employers would take a lenient view to enable the return of the people and safeguard their jobs,” said SAM Basheer, president of Qatar Kerala Muslim Cultural Centre.

Also, expats are worried if the travel disruptions to Gulf following Covid- 19 scare would affect their NRI status as the central government had, in this year’s budget, reduced the period of stay in India to 120 days from 182 days earlier to be categorized as non-resident Indians.

Police said the trio enacted the drama at the behest of the Hindu Munnani leader who had twin motives — avoid repaying his vehicle loan and also earn more prominence in the organization.

Somarasampettai police arrested M Sakthivel, 32, Manikandan union secretary of Hindu Munnani, his nephew Mukesh, 24, and their friend N Sakthivel. Sakthivel had lodged a complaint with the police in the morning that his moped parked in front of his house was set afire by unknown men around 2 am. He also alleged the involvement of other communities in the incident. Police said Sakthivel aimed at earning more prominence in his outfit by staging the drama. The arrest came after the police verified the CCTV footage that showed Mukesh and friend Sakthivel buying petrol in a bottle from a nearby bunk.

When the police grew suspicious and questioned them, it turned out that the two had themselves torched the two-wheeler. Sakthivel had stated in his complaint that the incident happened when he was sleeping inside his house. Police said that his wife and two children were at their relative’s house at the time of the incident. He had said that he found his moped burnt as he went to check after hearing the noise of window cracking from outside his house at Siva Nagar in Adhavathur.

134,['12/03/2020'],Ganga Mela to mark end of festivities,"Kanpur: The Holi festivity of the city will conclude in 'Anuradha Nakshatra' with Ganga Mela to be held on March 15.

The function, to commence after paying floral tributes to the revolutionaries, will conclude on March 15 evening with Ganga Mela to be held on the bank of the river (Ganga) and a Bal Mela at Rajjan Babu Park. According to Kanpur Hatia Holi Mahotsava committee in between the two events, the unique 'Rangon ka Thela' will roam in the traditional routes of the city,

Patron of the committee, Moolchand Seth and conveners Gyanendra Bishnoi and Vijay Singh said that on March 15, DM Brahmadeo Ram Tiwari, SSP Anant Dev and other celebrities of the city would garland the stone on which are inscribed names of the freedom fighters, and then hoist the national flag at Rajjan Babu Park.

The 'Rango ka Thela' procession, after passing through Nayaganj, Kahu Kothi, Birhana Road and Hatia, would reach Rajjan Babu Park, they said.

Briefing about the history of the Ganga Mela in 'Anuradha Nakshatra', Bishnoi said that in 1942 the British collector of the city had imposed restrictions on palying Holi, but a group of youths, belonging to Hatia locality, decided to break the restriction and play Holi. They, under the leadership of Babu Gulab Chandra Seth, first hoisted the tricolour and then played Holi.

“The police arrested the youths. The action led to fury and the entire city, as a mark of protest, decided to play Holi daily until the arrested youths were set free. The British government ultimately bowed to their demand and released the youths. Since they were released in 'Anuradha Nakshtra', the youths again played Holi which later on became a tradition”, Bishnoi said.

The members of the committee complained that though Ganga Mela had a historical significance, but still there were some problems. Rajjan Babu Park has been encroached by the people and Kesco had installed its transformer inside the park. KMC authorities had neither repaired the routes of 'Rangon ka Thela nor done any fogging in the open drains.

Meanwhile, DM Brahmadeo Ram Tiwari on Wednesday inspected the lanes of Hatia, Generalganj area and Rajjan Babu Park. He directed the Kesco officials to tie the electric wires hanging on roads and remove transformer from the park. He also asked them to install swings in the park for children on the occasion of Bal Mela.

The DM also visited the inscription stone and asked about the history of the mela from Hatia Holi Mahotsava committee and the locals. He said Kanpur would continue live with its old and historical custom of Ganga Mela.

KOCHI: The Covid-19 fear among the public is taking its toll on the city’s commercial sector too, as Broadway and Ernakulam Market, which are the prime commercial hubs, are witnessing a huge drop in sales. Merchants and traders said that people are unwilling to come to public places and the sales of goods have dropped to nearly half of the usual sales. Many of the shops that sell stationery goods, grocery, vegetables, bakery items, fish and meat, spices, textiles, etc. reported only 50% of usual sales on Wednesday. Shopkeepers said that the situation was worse on Sunday which usually witnesses brisk sales.

“The sales are too dim and the vegetables are decaying due to low demand. We are now selling most items at half the price to clear the stock but still there are not enough customers. No new stocks are being taken as we will have shut down if the situation worsens,” said Ramesh Kumar, a veggie-seller.

As the businesses in restaurant and catering sector too are witnessing a dip due to cancellation of public functions, the number of bulk orders to purchase confectionaries, vegetables, fish and meat has reduced.

“Celebration at weddings, housewarmings and other functions are either scaled down or cancelled and these lead to decline in bulk orders. Usually, we have a sale up to four boxes of samosas in the morning itself but today not even one box was sold. The sale of chips too has declined and we have reduced the production,” said Pratheesh Vakayal, who works with a bake house.

“There were only two customers since morning and there was no wholesale purchase today. Broadway street and footpaths were less crowded even during peak hours,” said Zulfikar Ali, a wholesale textile dealer in Cloth Bazaar.

But that hasn’t prevented him from attending his classes.From 1pm to 9pm daily, the masters student of mechanical engineering at Politecnico di Milano, is glued to his computer at his Vepery home, attending online classes conducted by his professors in Milan.“Our classes were to begin on March 3 after the vacation, but due to the Covid-19 outbreak, particularly severe in the Lombardy region, the university decided to postpone the classes for a week as a precautionary measure,” says Tamiloli.“A few days later, we were informed online classes will be held in a bid to control the situation. So I decided to return to Chennai.”Many Indian engineering aspirants are drawn to universities in Italy where the courses are good, affordable and they can hope to find good jobs in Schengen countries.But, with 60 million people on lockdown in Italy, and a death toll of 168, many foreign students have returned home.And Italian universities are ensuring they do not miss out on academics.Tamiloli is one of many students from Tamil Nadu continuing their studies in virtual classrooms.R Aravindh, who is also pursuing his masters in management engineering at Politecnico di Milano, returned to Trichy on February 21 and attended his first online lecture on March 3. “It’s a live lecture and we can ask questions just as in a real classroom.

137,['12/03/2020'],Nagpur’s RTE seats oversubscribed by 457%,"Nagpur: Applications for RTE admission in Nagpur reached a record-breaking mark with available seats for 2020-21 academic session getting oversubscribed by 457%. The deadline ended for this session on ????. The education department’s online portal has received 31,043 applications for 6,785 seats.

The education department is expected to announce dates for the online lottery soon after which the admission process will start. The RTE admission process is completely online to ensure transparency in the process. The software is operated from Pune but the initial set-up is done locally.

The lottery software uses a unique algorithm logic which gets its initial starting grid by numbers randomly chosen by students at a public event organized by the Nagpur education department. The number grids are filled by students using chits put in four separate bowls.

Students are then called to pick up chits one at a time and the digit is entered into the grid. Before entering into the grid the number is verified by education officials and parents so that there is no dispute later. Once the grid is complete it is displayed on a large screen and parents were asked to click a picture, if they needed, of the screen.

These grid numbers will be then fed into the lottery software by officials at Pune and that will decide the fate of applicants.

RTE activist Shahid Sharif said once the results are announced, parents must approach authorities if they notice any irregularities. “I am part of the RTE verification committee and if at all any kind of fraud is noticed regarding admissions, parents much approach this forum. Sometimes admissions are taken using fake documents and such activities must be reported,” said Sharif.

The biggest challenge for RTE admissions will be the boycott by many private schools for non-payment of RTE dues. Independent English Schools Association (IESA) has declared that over 20,000 seats will remain out of RTE admission ambit this session.

KANPUR: A woman and her son were killed while nine others injured in a clash during ‘Holika Dahan’ rituals between two families at Sukh Lal Kheda in Gangaghat police station area of Unnao district on Monday.

According to ASP Vinod Kumar Pandey, the incident took place on Monday night when the two families were performing the ‘Holika Dahan’, a ritual associated with the festival.

An argument broke out between the two families over some old issue, leading to the clash, he added.

“Both the groups attacked each other with sticks. Later, one group allegedly resorted to firing resulting in injuries to a woman identified as Gomti and her son Arvind”, he said.

The police official said both the injured died in the hospital.

“The deceased belonged to one of the two families. Six people from one side, and three from the other group sustained wounds. They are undergoing treatment at Lala Lajpat Rai hospital,” he said.

Both the sides have registered complaints against each other and the investigation is on, the police official said further and added, “Police and PAC personnel have been deployed in the area to ward of any kind of backlash.”

140,['12/03/2020'],Coronavirus scare: Medical tourist arrivals to Kochi drop by almost 75 %,"KOCHI: Coronavirus has hit medical tourism to the city, with most of the hospitals reporting 75-80% drop in arrival of foreign patients. Most of the hospitals said advance bookings have stopped as uncertainty looms over the spread of Covid-19 globally and even those who are in Kochi now for treatment are leaving mid-way. The patients made the decision after their embassies directed them to return home, said hospital managements.“We have not received any new patient in the past 15 days. Already, medical tourism to the city has dropped by 80%. Since Monday, after more Covid-19 cases were detected in Kerala, even those who are here are anxious,” said Dr Sunny Orathel, medical superintendent, Rajagiri Hospital.Most of the hospitals receive most of their foreign patients from Gulf countries, especially Dubai and Oman. They also have few patients from South East Asia, Africa and Europe. Also, persons of Indian origins (PIOs) plan treatment when they come for holidays during the months of July to September. But this season, even advance bookings from PIOs have dipped.“It seems everyone has adopted a wait and watch approach. Foreigners are reluctant to come to our hospitals in the prevailing situation,” said VPS Lakeshore CEO SK Abdulla.Since Monday, there has been a drop even in the number of patients who come for executive medical check-up offered by major hospitals. From an average 10 foreigners and 20-25 locals undergoing the medical check-up on a normal day, the numbers have dipped to 1-2 foreigners and 2- 3 locals this week.This is critical as medical tourism accounts for 25-30% of the earnings for most of the hospitals. “There is a significant fall in arrivals from foreign countries but the arrival of local patients has grown over the period. This is a trend across Kerala and is mainly due to the travel restrictions amidst corona scare. People now prefer to postpone elective procedures,” said Dr Harish Pillai, CEO, Aster Hospitals and Clinics, India.Though the first Covid-19 case was first detected in December 31, 2019, in Wuhan, its impact is being felt by the hospitals here only now. “Travel has been hit as flights have reduced operations. Now, the impact is being felt and it is very big,” said Dr Sanjeev Singh, medical superintendent, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences.“People are not willing to travel unless it is a medical emergency. Most of these cases are elective procedures. Hence, many are postponing the procedure,” added Dr Singh.Incidentally, those who have made advance payments are not keen to postpone despite many hospitals making the offer. This is mainly because they fear that the wait will be too long. Most of the hospitals work through medical agents abroad and patients have to make full payments on booking. Those who approach the hospital directly, have to pay about 50% advance. Now, the hospitals will have to return the money of those who cancel bookings.Incidentally, even ayurveda hospitals are badly hit. “After floods and Nipah, medical tourism flourished here. But now, again, we are hit. Patients who have been seeking treatment have left midway and the few who are here are anxious. We have lost Rs 1 crore in cancellation in less than a week,” said Dr Anvar AM, chief physician, Raha Ayurveda Hospital.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74587948,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-121081,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/medical-tourist-arrivals-to-kochi-drop-by-almost-75-/articleshow/74584116.cms
141,['12/03/2020'],Citizen films gambling kingpins in Mankapur dens,"A screen grab from the video

Nagpur: Some alert citizens have shot video clips of gambling dens at Mankapur, and they have gone viral on social media with the notorious names associated with the dens. After receiving the videos on Wednesday, senior police officers immediately sent a detection branch team from Mankapur police station to raid one of the dens, where four persons were arrested and some mobile phones were seized.

It’s learnt that residents of Mankapur are angry that their locality has become a haven for gamblers. There is also a threat of gangwar looming large as there is stiff rivalry between the gambling operators to outdo each other in attracting betters.

Shehzad and his brother Golu, both having faced police action in the past, are known to be the forerunners among the gambling den operators. Another gambling racketeer Bhurya, who managed to escape the raid on Wednesday, too is operating a den near Mankapur railway tracks. Golu’s rivals, Tassu, Baba and their gang too are operating gambling dens in the vicinity. It’s learnt that each group is eyeing an opportunity to attack the other.

The Mankapur-based gambling operators operate their dens along the railway tracks with the support of small-time goons and some hardened criminals who visit the places. PSI Kailash Magar of Mankapur police station, who led the raid on Wednesday after receiving a video of the gambler, said the operators use the railway tracks as a way to make for a fast getaway if cops arrive.

There had been a gangwar at Mankapur Chowk a couple of years ago between goons during the winter assembly session, leading to a riot-like situation.

A local resident, who shared the video of the gambling dens with TOI, said he found Feroze, Shehzad and Golu at the spot supervising gamblers playing with cash.

Feroze Goa, a former Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA) accused, and learnt to be operating a den at Goa Colony, near the railway tracks at Gaddigodam, also has interests in the popular dens of Shehzad and Golu at Mankapur.

It’s learnt Balya at Tandapeth, within the limits of Pachpaoli police station, despite a raid by crime branch, is still operating a major gambling den with one Mama from Ganga Jamuna. Pankaj and Shrawan also operate two major dens at Beda Hari and Toli in the outskirts of the city near Beltarodi.

City police chief BK Upadhyay said he would look into the issue of gambling operators thriving despite repeated action against them.

Vadodara: While trying to make video , a 16-year-old boy fell into Narmada canal near Chhani on Tuesday and is still missing.

According to fire department sources, Arbaz Pathan, a student of Class X and resident of Navayard, had gone to the canal on Tuesday afternoon with his friends. He was recording a video standing on the canal’s bank and accidentally stepped over a slippery surface and lost his balance. He fell into the gushing waters of the canal.

On hearing the sound, Pathan’s friends who were sitting at a distance, rushed towards the bank, but could not see him and alerted the locals who informed the fire brigade.

A team of firemen from Chhani fire station searched for Pathan till late in the evening but could not find him. They had to stop the search due to darkness. On Wednesday morning, firemen from Vadiwadi fire station too joined in the search operation.

“Our teams searched a stretch of 5km from the location where he fell in, but were successful in locating him. We will continue our search on Thursday too,” said fire officer Om Jadeja. He added that the strong water currents in the canal is hampering the search operation.

Sources said that Pathan was appearing in Class X board exams and was to sit for Mathematics exam on Thursday. His father drives an autorickshaw while his mother is a homemaker.

This year, the district administration had banned tourists from venturing around Mahisagar river at Sindhrot and Lanchhanpura villages on Holi after several incidents of drowning have taken place there. However, there is no notification stopping people from going near the canal which passes through the city.

143,['12/03/2020'],Ahmedabad: Ex-EPFO officer duped of Rs 59 lakh,"Representative Image

AHMEDABAD: A retired enforcement officer of EPFO (Employees Provident Fund Organisation) filed a complaint of cheating and forgery against three persons who introduced themselves as a UK national, a customs official and a bank employee, for duping him of Rs 59 lakh, states the FIR filed with cyber police on Monday.

Uday Bhatt, a resident of Satellite, in his FIR stated that he befriended a woman from England named Rosette Rosy Gaspard on Facebook in December 2019 and she began chatting with him on Messenger.

She told Bhatt her husband had died and she lived with her two-year-old daughter and would come to India on January 10, 2020 and wanted to meet Bhatt in Ahmedabad.

On January 10, at around 10.30am, a woman called Bhatt and introduced herself as a customs official and said that the English woman had been caught at Delhi airport with 50 Bitcoins worth Rs 50 lakh, for which she would have to pay a penalty of Rs 49,900.

Later, the woman also called Bhatt and asked him to pay the money and said she would return it when she met him. Bhatt went to a bank and paid the money for which the purported customs official sent a receipt to Bhatt’s WhatsApp number.

Later, the ‘customs official’ demanded Rs 85,000 for an ‘authorization certificate’ to convert the Bitcoins into Rs 50 lakh. Later, the purported customs official, a woman, told Bhatt to pay Rs 2.15 lakh for various other things. Bhatt followed the advice and paid money repeatedly. The purported customs officials sent him receipts for these payments, the FIR states.

On January 13, 2020, another person, who introduced himself as Khurana from Royal Bank of Scotland, called Bhatt and said that he would have to pay deposit money to get Bitcoins. He told Bhatt to make payments at regular intervals to get access to the Bitcoin money. Bhatt ended up paying Rs 55 lakh to various bank accounts in nearly 20 transactions.

After paying the money, Bhatt began asking the the England-based woman, purported customs official and alleged bank official about his money. They first gave him vague answers and later went incommunicado.

After waiting for two months to hear from the three, Bhatt approached cyber crime police and filed a complaint of cheating, breach of trust, forgery and use of forged documents along with charges under the IT Act.

144,['12/03/2020'],Kochi-Mumbai return fares dip to Rs 5k as virus spreads,"Mumbai: With a rise in Covid-19 positive cases in India, domestic travel by air and rail is being hit.

Aircraft are flying with fewer passengers, train journeys are being cancelled. A sure indicator of low demand for air travel was low airfares, especially last-minute airfares or those on flights scheduled to depart in 24 hours.

A route that witnesses high demand throughout the year is Mumbai-Kochi. But this week, you could fly to Kochi and back for only Rs 5,000. “A last-minute flight to Kochi generally costs Rs 6,000-7,000 one-way,” said a travel agent. Return airfares on Delhi-Kochi route began at Rs 7,200. Flights to Trivandrum were comparatively higher in demand with return airfares from Mumbai beginning at Rs 9,000.

Airline companies have slashed the airfares in the Gulf-Karipur sector as Covid-19 fears have led to a significant drop in demand.

For instance, the one way direct trip from Karipur to Dubai on budget airline Flydubai for March 13 costs just Rs 5,859 while the flight from Dubai to Karipur on the same date is cheaper still at Rs 5,214.

Travel industry officials said that the prevailing fares are much lower than the normal rates at this time of the year.

“Normally, the fares in the sector hover around Rs 8000-Rs 10,000 for the same period. There is a severe slack in demand and people are putting off travel plans due to concerns over possible travel restrictions,” P V Vijesh, manager of Al Hind Tours and Travels, said.

Also, Saudi Arabia’s decision to temporarily ban flights from nine countries, including United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, has affected passenger traffic in the sector as many people depended on connection flights of Gulf based-carriers to travel to Saudi.

Added to that is the ban imposed by Qatar and Kuwait on passengers travelling from India.

Other domestic destinations like Bengaluru and Hyderabad were cheaper, with Rs 3,800 return airfares for travel from Mumbai. From Delhi, cheapest airfares began at Rs 5,800 for Hyderabad and Rs 6,700 for Bengaluru return.

On Tuesday, the cheapest Mumbai-Delhi return ticket for travel on Wednesday and return later in the week, started at Rs 5,000, that is, an average of Rs 2,500 one-way.

PUNE: A 46-year-old social media content designer died of severe burns sustained in a fire that broke out around 3am on Wednesday at his residence off Bhandarkar road.

The Deccan Gymkhana police said Sandip Gokhale was asleep when the fire broke out. His relatives and friends told TOI that his wife, daughter and son had gone to a relative’s house at Karvenagar to celebrate Holi. They stayed back there and Gokhale was alone at home.

The cause of the blaze is being investigated. The police and fire brigade could not secure any immediate leads about what may have started the fire.

The Gokhale family lives on the ground floor of a two-storied building. The deceased’s relatives said he used to design logos and marquee for social media sites. “He would work for different companies and individuals. Everything was fine with him. His death has come as a shock to us,” a relative said.

Fire brigade officials told TOI that they received an emergency call at 2.53am. They rushed a fire tender to the house and brought the blaze under control within 20 minutes. “We found a man, who had sustained serious burn injuries, lying on the floor of the 200 sq.ft. house. We found two LPG cylinders in the house, both engulfed in flames, but managed to take them out safely,” an official said.

Around 3.30am, Deccan Gymkhana police and the fire brigade officials rushed Gokhale to Sassoon hospital where he succumbed to his burns around 4.45am.

The furniture, electronic goods and other articles in the house were damaged in the fire.

Local residents told TOI that the intensity of the fire was such that tall flames leaped out when the fire brigade officials broke open the doors of the house. The flames touched the roof of the building and neighbouring trees also caught fire. Deccan Gymkhana police have registered a case of accidental death.

149,['12/03/2020'],No law and order issue in TN: Govt to HC,"Chennai: The Washermenpet anti-CAA sit-in entering 25th day on Wednesday notwithstanding, the Tamil Nadu government told the Madras high court that there is no law and order situation in the state as alleged by a batch of PILs which wanted authorities to stop such protests across the state. “Adequate protection has been provided to both protesters and public,” state public prosecutor A Natarajan said on Wednesday while making the submission before a division bench of Justices M M Sundresh and Krishnan Ramaswamy.

The issue pertains to a batch of six PILs moved by various people, including Gopinath, a lawyer from Tirupur, alleging that the anti-CAA protests are causing inconvenience to public. On March 5, the bench passed an interim order directing the state police to ensure that no protests both in support of and against CAA are permitted without prior permission.

However, based on the apprehension raised by a section of lawyers that the order might be used to take adverse action against peaceful protesters and that the petitioner who is a ‘history-sheeter’ has approached the court without clean hands, the bench on March 6 kept its interim order in abeyance.

When the pleas came up for hearing on Wednesday, court hall 6 where the case was heard was filled with a battery of advocates both in support of and against the petitions. Senior counsel S Prabakaran and others representing the petitioners argued that if the marathon protests are permitted to continue, it would set a bad precedent. “This would encourage anyone who can organise 1,000 people to sit on Anna Salai for his/her demands,” Prabakaran said, wondering whether the state police would follow the same approach in all such cases. “They claim that it is their fundamental right to protest or assemble in a place. But by exercising their right they are affecting the fundamental right of other people to move freely,” he said.

Senior advocate R Vaigai, N G R Prasad and others argued that Gopinath is a ‘history sheeter’ and that the PIL being a fraudulent petition is not maintainable.

Recording the submission, the bench posted the pleas to March 17 for further hearing.

151,['12/03/2020'],"Showers affect revelry, but fail to dampen festive spirit","Prayagraj: As overcast conditions and sporadic showers partially affected Holi celebrations in Sangam city on Tuesday, city residents made up for the loss by coming out on the streets with great enthusiasm on Wednesday to enjoy the festival of colours.

The famous ‘kapda phad’ (tearing of outfits) Holi of Chowk area and floral Holi of Civil Lines was attended by a large number of locals on Wednesday.

Although the weather on Monday was fairly clear with bright sunshine and maximum and minimum temperatures at 29.2 degrees and 17.4 degree Celsius respectively, residents woke up on Tuesday to overcast sky.

As people started coming out to celebrate the festival, several localities witnessed drizzles.

The weather remained almost the same all day through as maximum temperature was recorded at 23.6 degrees (a drop of around 6 degrees) and minimum temperature stood at 12.7 degrees (around 5 degrees less than Monday).

Due to cold breeze and showers, many Holi revelers remained indoors or chose to play with dry colours like ‘gulal’ and ‘abeer’.

“We had called everyone to come in the apartment’s garden area. We had arranged for water, sweets and gulal to celebrate Holi like previous years but as cold winds returned, it was only sweets and ‘gulal’ which dominated Holi celebrations,” said Sukanya, a student of Allahabad University.

However, Holi celebrations remained unaffected in several localities of the city. Local residents, especially in Chowk, Khuldabad, Katra, and Sulem Sarai areas played Holi with traditional fervour.

People, however, celebrated the festival more on Wednesday as compared to the main day of the festival as weather became much more conducive for revellers. The famous ‘kapda phad’ (tearing of outfits) Holi of Chowk area was attended by a large number of locals.

Likewise, Holi milan events were organised by various private and government institutions, people greeted each other with ‘gulal’ and danced to the tunes of Holi songs. They embraced and greeted each other, offered sweets and wished prosperity to each other.

In various localities, men and women organised in-house parties. “We arranged DJ, Holi colours, eatables and sweets to celebrate the occasion with our near and dear ones,” said Meenu Khanna, a resident of Dariyabad.

152,['12/03/2020'],Pune: Poor census data limit Ayushman Bharat’s reach,"Representative image

PUNE: Poor quality of the census data has limited the reach of the Union government’s Ayushman Bharat Scheme, leaving out about 30% of the 50 crore intended beneficiaries.

The scheme, run under Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), was announced in September 2018, aiming at providing free health coverage at the primary, secondary and tertiary level to bottom 40% poor and vulnerable population.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had claimed that the scheme would benefit 50 crore economically disadvantaged people. However, till Feb 21, 2020, only around 12.20 crore e-cards under PMJAY were issued. Of these, 7.52 crore e-cards were issued by the Centre, while 4.68 crore by the states.

Indu Bhushan, chief executive officer of the Ayushman Bharat Scheme, said the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011 database, which is used to identify the beneficiaries of the scheme, was “outdated” and left out around “30% of the intended beneficiaries” from its coverage.

On low penetration of the scheme, Bhushan said, “The programme is based on entitlement and not enrolment. Besides, e-cards are just one of the ways to avail of the treatment under the scheme,” he said.

He said there were some problems with the quality of the SECC data. “We are not able to trace about 30% of the intended beneficiaries. Since, some states joined late and a few are yet to join, the scheme has reached to about 30 crore people,” he said.

Bhushan said less than one-fourth of the 50 crore intended beneficiaries had been issued e-cards in the 17-month period since the launch of the Ayushman Bharat Scheme.

Experts said people can also check their names on the official website to see if they qualify for treatment under the scheme. “Another reason for the slow rollout of PMJAY is that four states are yet-to-join the scheme and two states only joined recently. That leaves out at least 2 crore potential beneficiaries,” Bhushan said.

According to the government, four states — West Bengal, Telangana, Odisha and Delhi — are yet to implement the scheme, while Punjab and Rajasthan joined only in late 2019.

Further, the data available on PMJAY website revealed on Wednesday that about 90 lakh people had availed of treatment under the scheme at about 20,000 empanelled hospitals across the country.

Budget allocation

The Union Budget for 2020-21, presented on February 1, kept unchanged the outlay for the scheme at Rs6,400 crore. The budget for the ongoing 2019-20 fiscal was, however, revised from Rs6,400 crore to Rs3,200 crore.

Bhushan said, this decision was partly because many states merged their existing health insurance schemes with Ayushman Bharat, thereby, making them liable to contribute in its spend. The insurers quoting a low premium also decreased the expenses.

“When we started, we had estimated a quote of Rs1,000 per family but in many states, the average premium has been pitched at Rs700-800 per family. Most of them are are insured by public sector general insurers,” he said.

To insure the 30 crore potential beneficiaries (or about 6 crore families), the government spent Rs3,200 crore in the current fiscal, translating to about Rs533 per family. However, the Centre’s move to revise the allocated funds downwards signals its under-utilisation, experts said.

Pune-based activist Anant Phadke said the Centre was not meeting its own projections. “NITI Aayog's projection was Rs12,000 crore, but the scheme will require about Rs 20,000 crore every year,” Phadke said.

155,['12/03/2020'],Bhubaneswar: Ruckus in House over temple funds,"Jaganath temple in Puri

BHUBANESWAR: The Congress MLAs on Wednesday created ruckus in the assembly, seeking fixing of responsibilities for deposit of Rs 545 crore funds of Jaganath temple in Puri in crisis-ridden Yes Bank . In Delhi, BJD MPs met Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman , seeking her intervention for withdrawal of the fixed deposits.

Moments after the assembly reconvened for the second phase of budget session, the Congress members stormed into the well of the House. Raising anti-government slogans, the MLAs demanded a probe to find out who “took the erroneous decision of depositing the money in the private bank.” Amid the din, Speaker S N Patro adjourned the House first till 12.30pm and again till 3pm. Speaking to reporters outside the assembly, Congress MLA Tara Prasad Bahinipati said, “We put pressure on the government to find out the person who decided to deposit the funds in a private bank, pushing its fate into uncertainty. The God’s money may be lost.”

The BJP had given notice for an adjournment motion discussion on the temple fund issue, but it could not be taken up because of the continued disruptions in the proceedings. “We had given a notice for discussion on the temple fund issue. The discussion could have brought out facts to the public domain. The Congress members stormed into the well and the speaker adjourned the House. It seems BJD and Congress have an understanding,” deputy leader of opposition Bisnhu Sethi said. Both BJD and Congress dismissed Sethi’s allegation. “It is unfortunate the Congress members stalled the proceedings though the government is ready for discussion on any issue,” government chief whip Pramila Mallik said. In the meantime, BJD parliamentary party leader in Rajya Sabha, Prasanna Acharya, led a delegation of party MPs and met Sitharaman in Delhi. “The finance minister assured us that the Lord’s money is safe,” Acharya said.

Jagannath Sena, a socio-political outfit, lodged a complaint with the CBI, seeking a probe into deposit of temple funds. One Pradipta Naik has lodged a complaint with the Odisha Human Rights Commission , seeking its intervention in the issue.

PUNE: The traffic police registered cases against 158 people for driving in an inebriated condition across the city on the occasion of Dhulivandan on Tuesday and nabbed seven persons on the similar charge on Holi the day before.

Additional commissioner of police Sanjay Shinde said, “Action against drunk driving was taken across the 24 traffic divisions in the city to avert any accident. Revellers often consume alcohol and drive during festivals such as Holi. Such a behaviour can lead to accidents. A special drive was conducted on Tuesday during which 158 persons were nabbed for drunk driving.”

He said cases have been filed against all the violators at the Motor Vehicles Court . “The police will continue to take action against people driving after drinking alcohol. We appeal to citizens to follow rules and refrain from drunk driving to ensure safe and comfortable travel in the city,” Shinde added.

The number of such cases during this year’s festival of colours was down from 214 in 2019 ad 424 in 2018, the police said.

Traffic expert and Save Pune Traffic Movement director Harshad Abhyankar said the reduction in the number was a positive sign, but statistics alone were inadequate to say if the situation has improved.

“We cannot compare the number of cases registered during Holi each year, as we do not know if the enforcement was identical over the years. One has to find if the number of police personnel on road was same during the festival over the years,” he said.

Civic activist Vivek Velankar said, “We did not see nakabandis to nab drunk drivers on Holi, as we see the arrangement on the New Year’s Eve. Also, many people from the city know where nakabandi is and take alternative routes to evade the police. It is good that the police have nabbed 158 people for drunk driving. But the enforcement needs to be more stringent.”

He added, “Rangpanchmi is coming up and the message should go out that people will be caught for drunk driving. Spreading such information will also lead to greater deterrence.”

KOCHI: As Covid-19 fear grips the city, there is high demand for handheld infrared (IR) thermometers (non-contact thermometers).

Druggists said many companies, mostly those from the Infopark, are placing orders for infrared thermometers and there is not enough stock to meet the requirements. Even though new orders have been placed, the high demand across the world has affected the supply and production of these devices, said druggists.

Incidentally, till about Monday, there was a little demand for infrared-thermometers, with medical shops selling about one or two in a week. But suddenly that has changed and the demand for infrared-thermometers, masks, sanitizers and gloves has grown by almost 70% to 75%. Due to this, many medical shops at present don’t have these items in stock.

“Infrared thermometer permits temperature measurement from a distance without contact with the object to be measured using infrared rays. In the wake of Covid-19, people prefer these devices over conventional thermometers. We have received so many calls from IT companies to place orders for the devices but there in not enough stock, as these devices don’t have much demand normally,” said Aslam K A, a staff of a medical store.

With the state government having issued Covid-19 Standard Operational Procedure to IT parks that suggests health screening of visitors and suspected employees, many companies are using IR thermometers.

“In the past few days, nearly 10 to 20 lakh masks have been sold in the state. This is mainly because many Malayalis, who are travelling abroad, are carrying two to three boxes of masks as there is shortage abroad,” said P V Tomy, president, Chemist and Druggist Association, Ernakulam.

AHMEDABAD: Meghaninagar police of city in dock with an accused in a prohibition case making a TikTok video inside the lock-up on Sunday, featuring a Bollywood song and his four friends who had come to meet him.

Police ended up registering a case under the Information Technology Act against accused, Karansingh Shekhawat, for making video from inside the lock-up and publishing it.

A Meghaninagar police official said Shekhawat had been caught drunk on Sunday and put in the lock-up. His four friends had come to meet him and Shekhawat suggested they make a TikTok video so it would go viral.

Shekhawat’s friends accepted his advice and shot a video on the title song of the Sanjay Dutt-starrer ‘Khalnayak’. The video went viral after which police swung into action and registered a complaint in a face-saving exercise.

Head constable Shankar Bhanudas of Meghaninagar police on Wednesday filed a complaint under the IT Act along with abetment charges under the IPC, against Shekhawat and his four friends.

According to the FIR, Shekhawat and the four others shot the video between 10.45am and 11.15pm on Sunday when they were allowed to meet him. Cops gathered CCTV footage of the incident.

The cops were clueless about the identities of the four persons who helped Shekhawat make the video.

The incident raised questions about the negligence of cops at police stations. On February 25, a youth committed suicide by hanging himself inside the lock-up at Kagdapith police station.

KOCHI: The Cochin International Airport Ltd (Cial) is witnessing a huge decline in the number of passengers in the wake of heightened Covid-19 alert. According to sources, the airport, that usually handles around 30,000 passengers daily, now witnesses only 50% passengers, both in international and domestic sectors. While the cancellation of several international flights and stringent visa curbs by India and other countries hit the passenger flow in international sector, domestic sector is affected by cancellation of tickets. The cancellation of tour packages is also a reason behind the reduced footfalls.

“Many flights in international sectors are operating without enough passengers. The situation is more or less same in both arrival and departure sector,” said Cial spokesperson.

“The frequent change in travel rules is confusing passengers and they just don’t want to travel. We have been receiving cancellation calls even though we have given offers like rescheduling trips without penalty,” said Air India Express spokesperson.

KANPUR: Two persons were allegedly beaten to death by one of their friends on late Monday night apparently after a brawl at Udetpur village under the limits of Chaubeypur police station in the district.

Police have been conducting several raids to nab the accused, identified as Bhagwati of Udeitpur and his accomplices, said Superintendent of Police (Rural) Pradyumna Singh.

The deceased have been identified as Manoj Chaurasia (36), a resident of Udeitpur and Ajit Yadav (38), a resident of neighbouring village Ghaghpur in the district. Singh said Manoj and Ajit were consuming liquor at a outlet in Kishunpur when Bhagwati, accompanied by his aides, reached there and had an altercation with them over some issue.

“They indulged in a fight following which Bhagwati and his men attacked Manoj and Ajit with stone. They both sustained serious head injuries in the brawl,” the SP said adding that both were admitted to Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital where they were declared dead.

The families of both Manoj and Ajit have accused Bhagwati and his men of murder, said DIG Anant Deo. “An FIR has been lodged and separate teams are conducting raids to make the arrest of the accused possible,” DIG added.

170,['12/03/2020'],Coronavirus scare: Passengers sent home for 28 days of seclusion from Kochi airport,"Representative image

KOCHI: Medical teams have started segregating passengers who arrive at the international terminal of the Cochin International Airport from countries hit by coronavirus and are compulsorily sending them to 28 days of home quarantine, district administration officials said on Wednesday. The asymptomatic passengers were taken from the airport to their homes in an ambulance after they were asked to sign an affidavit stating that they will strictly follow the instructions of medical teams and will remain at home for the stipulated number of days.

Simultaneously, panchayat and police personnel in their respective areas have also been informed about the passengers sent for home quarantine.

“As many as 14 passengers came forward informing that they will go home only after they tested negative for coronavirus. Until then they will remain under observation in hospital,” said a health official.

“We can’t lodge all the passengers at a single location. It is best to send them home from airport by ambulance. It will help them avoid contact with others. It is safe to lodge asymptomatic people at home quarantine itself. Lodging them at a different location in quarantine will lead to more problems and they will get more tensed,” said a health official.

Of the 52-people who arrived from Rome on Wednesday, three passengers refused to cooperate with health officials. “They claimed they were not suffering from any illness and asked why there is so much mayhem here. But we convinced them about the need to take precautions,” said the official. As many as 35 passengers were sent to Aluva District Hospital for keeping them under observation. A majority of them were later sent to their homes.

Meanwhile, isolation wards were opened at more government hospitals on the district. As many as 10 rooms were opened at Aluva District Hospital and 40 at Muvattupuzha Taluk Hospital. Directions have been issued to government taluk hospitals in Perumbavoor and Fort Kochi to remove patients from pay wards so that passengers coming from Covid-hit countries, can be placed under observation.

Some of the private hospitals in the district have expressed willingness to accommodate the passengers.

Meantime, eight samples from private hospitals were sent to Alappuzha unit of the National Institute of Virology for test.

In total, 84 samples have been sent to the NIV unit. Six people were discharged from isolation ward on Wednesday.

Those who came from Rome on Tuesday were from Kottayam, Pathanamthitta, Thrissur, Kasaragod and Alappuzha districts.

171,['12/03/2020'],Many bigwigs now out of Jaipur mayors’ race,"Jaipur: Many party bigwigs are now out of the Jaipur mayors’ race as both the top posts in the two proposed corporations got reserved for women (OBC) in a draw of lots after the delimitation.

Now, the parties are counting on fresh faces from among the OBC women candidates for the elections. Before the lottery was drawn, many candidates from the Brahmin community having a strong grip were asserting their right to the seat of the mayor , claimed that the community had the highest number of voters in the city. Similarly, Vaishya community was also vying for political mileage.

Sources said candidates who were proposing their names meekly for the posts have become the frontrunners as possibilities to become the mayor have improved.

From the existing lot of councillors, a Congress minister’s relative is among the frontrunners from Greater Jaipur, if she wins the election. Similarly, in BJP a former councillor’s wife in the Walled City is also eyeing for the post after situation swung in her favour.

Speculations are rife, a daughter-in-law of a senior Congress leader can contest from the Walled City area and later can pitch for mayor’s post.

Many still believe it would be a challenge for both the parties to zero in on strong OBC women candidates. A BJP legislator said, “There are a few strong candidates from the present councillors’ lot. As elections are vital, the party will decide on fielding a candidate from outside after elections or choose them from the councillors.”

In comparison with the Congress, the list of strong and winnable candidates for mayor’s post from general category was strong in BJP. However, all those prominent faces are out of the race.

It was on Tuesday that Kottakkal police arrested three persons including a couple from Assam for forcing a 12-year-old Assamese girl for prostitution. It was the couple from Assam who brought the girl to Kottakkal. An Edarikode native Muhammed Ali who is owner of the rented quarters in which the girl was staying, was also arrested for supporting the abuse of girl.

On Wednesday, Malappuram police took three Assam natives , including the girl’s mother, into custody for forcing a 13-year-old Assamese girl for prostitution. The family was staying at a rented quarter in Melmuri. Police have collected statement of the girl and the arrest of the accused would be recorded later.

According to the statement given by the girl in Malappuram to ChildLine authorities, Muhammed Ali, who was arrested in connection with the Kottakkal incident coordinated the activities of the gang and she was presented to many people with the support of her mother.

Meanwhile Childline authorities in Ponnani have initiated probe into the complaint that an Assamese minor girl in Ponnani was sexually abused by several persons.

Child Welfare Committee (CWC) chairman Shajesh Bhasakar said that the similarity in the operation of gangs in Kottakkal and Malappuram is pointing to the possibility of involvement of sex rackets, which are sexually misusing the girls from other states such as Assam, Bengal and Orissa for monetary purposes and the details of fresh case reported in Ponnani would be available soon. “The victim girl in Kottakkal has already revealed to Childline volunteers that she was raped by several persons and the girl in Malappuram also revealed the same.

KOCHI: A major fire was reported near the tank wagon gantry of the Bharat Petroleum Chemicals Pvt Ltd (BPCL) at Irumpanam on Wednesday afternoon, causing panic among Irumpanam residents for a few hours.

Source said the fire was reported at 2.30pm after leakage in one of the main fuel pipelines, linking the storage tank of naphtha and aviation oil, near the tank wagon gantry along Seaport-Airport Road. Official sources said the situation remained under control and no casualties were reported. The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained.

177,['12/03/2020'],"In Kochi, CNG buses losing charm with private bus operators","KOCHI: The private bus operators who were planning to convert their diesel buses to compressed natural gas (CNG) powered vehicles are now not keen to go ahead with their plans. The reason? Diesel price has decreased, making the option of converting to CNG less attractive, as price gap between the two fuels has come down below Rs 10.“CNG looks attractive when diesel prices are high. Bus operators will be willing to change to CNG only if there is a difference of at least Rs 15 as it will be profitable for them. Otherwise, they will not be keen to convert,” said TJ Raju, president of Kochi Metropolitan Transport Cooperative Society Ltd (KMTC), adding that the government should take efforts to combat falling CNG prices.While private bus operators are willing to convert BS2 buses to CNG, they are not interested in converting BS3 vehicles, Raju added. “That means, buses up to 2010 models can be converted,” he said. He expressed the opinion that CNG buses will begin services in the city by March 31.The first bus, which was converted to CNG in New Delhi and brought to Kochi, is currently being used as a demo bus. Though all relevant documents of the bus have been submitted for approval, Raju said that he is yet to receive it. The plan was to introduce at least 400 such buses in the city. It costs Rs 3-3.5 lakh for converting a bus running on diesel to a CNG-fuelled bus.A Delhi-based private company has also expressed interest in opening a unit in Kalamassery for converting diesel buses to CNG operated buses. The representative of the firm said that they have submitted applications before RTO for setting up the workshop.“Apart from the private buses, there are school buses and buses operated by various institutions. There will be a good clientele in Kochi,” said a representative of the firm.Meanwhile, transport secretary KR Jyothilal said that there are conversion kits approved by Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI). The International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT) also certifies CNG conversion. “There are approved kits and authorised workshops. After conversion, the vehicle owners will have to get the entry changed in RC book as CNG from diesel. There are no other hindrances,” he said.However, on a question whether the price benefits of CNG will be passed on to the commuters, the bus operators said that it would not be possible. The commuters will have to pay the same rates applicable to diesel buses.Meanwhile, the Ernakulam Auto Rickshaw Drivers Co-operative Society said that the main obstacle they face is the lack of charging facilities for e-autorickshaws. Around 200 e-autos are expected to arrive in the city during March-April. “The local body and other transport agencies should take the initiative to provide sufficient charging points,” said MB Syamanthabhadran, representative of the society.The auto drivers said that they have to pay a rent of Rs 350 for using these vehicles. They charge commuters a minimum fare of Rs 40 and if passengers are willing to share the fare, each one of them will have to shell out Rs 10 for travelling 2km distance.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74586486,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-245367,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cng-buses-losing-charm-with-private-bus-operators/articleshow/74584157.cms
178,['12/03/2020'],Tamil Nadu’s Winning Assist for ISL final,"Chennai: It was 2012 when Edwin Sydney Vanspaul and M Soosairaj squared up against each other in the annual Reverend Father LD Murphy Memorial football tournament final, organised by Loyola College. It was Soosairaj, representing Madras Christian College, who triumphed on that occasion, as a penalty miss by Edwin proved costly for Loyola.

Eight years later, Edwin and Soosai will come up against each other once again. But this time, it will be on the biggest stage of Indian football — the Indian Super League (ISL) final between Chennaiyin FC and ATK . Till a few years ago young footballers from the state didn’t dare to dream big in football. Now, the journeys of Edwin and Soosai mirror the meteoric rise of Tamil Nadu football.

While Edwin from Neyveli played a major role in helping the Chennaiyin’s path to the final, Eraviputhenthurai’s Soosai did it for Kolkata’s ATK. Apart from them Chennai’s Dhanpal Ganesh (CFC) and Michael Regin (ATK), who is also Soosai’s elder brother, are expected to be on the team lists for Saturday’s summit clash.

The 27-year-old Edwin from Neyveli said it was beyond his expectations to see four Tamil Nadu footballers playing in the ISL final. ""We have a common WhatsApp group and the other day we were discussing how life has changed for us. Till a few years ago, we never thought we would make the ISL, leave alone play in the final. Now, people recognise us. It’s a privilege and we are willing to work hard to prove that we belong here,"" Edwin told TOI.

Soosai, who has been engaging in social media banter with Edwin over the past few days, says their feat will open avenues for TN’s aspiring footballers. ""It shows that if you have talent, skill and ambition, no one can stop you from realising your dream. It is about having the hunger and desire to use the platform and exposure ISL provides you. I hope this is only the beginning and we can inspire the next generation of footballers from the state,"" said Soosai.

Indeed, their achievements have gone beyond the field. Soosai, who comes from a fishing community, is proving to be a source of inspiration back from for the entire Kanyakumari district. ""There was a time when people would leave fishing to play football. But with nothing much happening they lost interest. Now, that interest is back,"" Soosai said.

People from the 12 coastal villages near Soosai’s hometown now set up giant screens to watch ATK’s matches after their daily chores. Soosai said with football academies coming up young talent is being guided and things are getting more structured. ""In Kanyakumari, we only play football. When I go home, many kids would ask me about my diet, routine, practice style … I would talk to them about off-season training and pre-match exercises. They are keen to follow it and make football a profession,"" Soosai said.

Behind these inspirational tales, there lies a story of anguish and frustration too. For the past two years, there has been no Chennai Football Association senior division league, a breeding ground for state footballers, due to differences between Tamil Nadu Football Association (TFA) and Chennai Football Association (CFA). Under the circumstances, whatever little opportunity the players have been getting is through the scouting process of Chennaiyin and former I-League champions Chennai City FC, based in Coimbatore.

Former India defender N Mohanraj, who has played in both ISL and I-League, said it is important that TFA and CFA cash in on the popularity of these footballers. ""Last year, TN colts emerged runners-up in U-19 league. This means there is talent. But then there is a high chance that these talents might get lost as they don’t have a league to hone their skills,"" the Namakkal player said.

Edwin credits the grind of the CFA league for his progress. ""Whatever might be our achievements, we can’t overlook that there is no proper football structure yet in our state. So the CFA league gives us game time and playing in the heat prepares us better. So it is my plea to the officials to sort out the differences and restart the league.

180,['12/03/2020'],Rs 59 crore of government’s loan waiver money stuck in Yes Bank,"Representative image

AURANGABAD: About Rs 59 crores, one of the instalments that Aurangabad district central cooperative (ADCC) bank limited was supposed to get from the state under the farm loan waiver scheme, is stuck in the Yes Bank after the Reserve Bank of India imposed a withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 a month on the customers.

The ADCC has shot a letter to the state government requesting them to help clear the situation.

ADCC director Abhijit Deshmukh told TOI, “We have written a letter to the government seeking their intervention in getting our Rs 59 crore of farm loan waiver stuck with Yes Bank. We are hopeful that the government will address the issue at the earliest.”

Only the major banking players such as Yes Bank are direct members of RBI, while the smaller as well as mid-rung ones including the cooperative banks are sub-members of RBI.

The money released from government is routed through its member banks, which further pass it to the sub-member banks.

ADCC has about eight lakh bank accounts, out of which, close to two lakh are loan accounts, with majority of them being crop loans. As on date, ADCC has total outstanding of Rs 900 crores in loans.

Sources in the bank said that they were to get about Rs 350 crores of the crop loan under the new Maharashtra government’s waiver scheme.

The state government announced farm loan waiver of up to Rs 2 lakh each last December. The first and second list of beneficiaries comprising about 21.82 lakh beneficiaries, who would be eligible for the waiver, has been released.

The money was to be disbursed from last week but the RBI restrictions on not allowing withdrawal of more than Rs 50,000 from Yes Bank hit transactions of at least 100 cooperative, mid and lower-rung banks in the state that routed transactions through the bank.

182,['12/03/2020'],3 corporators along with many out of voter list: Ex-corporator,"Representative image

AURANGABAD: Former corporator Sameer Rajurkar has claimed that at least one lakh voters’ names have either been reshuffled or have gone missing even as a claim has been made that the names of at least three sitting corporators are missing from the list.

“Althought the civic body on March 9 published a draft voters list, it is not available on its website. The administration has not yet made it available in the zone offices,” Rajurkar told reporters on Wednesday.

“It has now become difficult to ascertain and cross-check the voters’ names in the list,” he said.

Kaleem Qureshi, an activist whose family members were representing three wards, said the names of Shabnam Kaleem Qureshi, Malika Habib Qureshi and Khatija Qureshi were deliberately dropped from the list.

He said that even his name and that of his brother were missing from the draft list, though they were in the 2015 list.

Qureishi said he made a representation to the mayor in this regard. “I will pursue a legal course against those involved in such affairs as I suspect that it was done deliberately. Otherwise, there is no scope for my family members’ names along with about 500 others to go missing from the voters’ list.’’

Sources in the civic body pointed out that between 1,500 and 2,300 voters from Rozabagh (ward 13), Chetnanagar (ward 4) ward have been added to ward No 14 Wankhedenagar-Honajinagar.

“Voters too have been shifted from ward 53 (Samarthnagar) to the Kotla colony ward. Similarly, names of voters are missing from wards including Nageshwarwadi, Sillegkhan to elsewhere,” the sources said.

Rajurkar said that when according to the rules, the number of voters in a ward has to be between 7,000 and 9,000, several wards have the number between 3,500 and 4,800, while 28 to 30 wards have around 6,000. He said that 650 to 700 voters from Aurangpura have been added to the Gulandi ward.’’

Rajurkar demanded that the administration and election officials concerned institute an inquiry into the whole affair and urged them to add the voters of the Samarthnagar ward, which he represented earlier, to their original wards according to the 2015 voters’ list.

Rajurkar added that he has decided to challenge the voters’ list by filing his objections, but he wanted to alert people so that they check their names in the list to know whether they have been shifted to other wards or their names are missing.

186,['12/03/2020'],‘Civic chiefs have to be fair and impartial’,"Shyam Wardhane

Should the budget be head-wise or general?

Budget has to be head and even sub-head wise. They are important for prioritising work. Income received under a particular head and expenditure incurred on a particular work need to monitored for maintaining financial discipline in any organization and more so in public sector.

Do standing committee chairpersons present unrealistic budgets?

Yes. The standing committee chairman and members worry more about development works. They expect to meet aspirations of the people who they represent. In order to match the figures of expenditure, they increase the figures of income without considering the actual income received in the earlier three years.

Why does corporation fail to meet its revenue target year after year?

This happens due to lack of proper enforcement and monitoring system. There has to be checks and balances when it comes to valuation of property and it may happen that the property has more rateable value but assessed at a lower side causing loss to the corporation. When I was posted in the civic body, I exposed how shops near Law College Square were being taxed on the basis of residential properties though the civic body was supposed to levy commercial tax.

How should municipal commissioners deal with elected representatives?

Municipal commissioners have to be fair and impartial. He must respect every member because a corporator represents thousands of citizens. They are the elected representatives. We, as officers, have accepted the democratic principle. So, in my opinion democratically elected representatives need to be respected. Municipal commissioner has to adopt appropriate communication policy, plan and strategise for effective communication.

Have you ever faced political pressure during your tenure as municipal commissioner? How did you deal with it?

Yes. But I could convince the politicians through proper explanations. Sometimes, by refusing to do the things which rules and regulations do not allow. One can explain the difficulty in implementation. Maintaining transparency as regards to works done and works pending suggested by the elected representatives.

Should the municipal commissioner heed to advice from mayor and standing committee chairmen?

Yes, he should interact with all. He should take advice of various office bearers and senior officers of the local body but act only in accordance with law.

(Shyam Wardhane was commissioner of Nagpur Municipal Corporation from August 2012 to January 2015)

This was disclosed by Union shipping minister Mansukh Mandaviya to TOI.Last December, the Union government had passed the landmark ‘The Recycling of Ships Bill 2019’ that not only provides for environmentally sound recycling of ships but safety of shipyard workers too.“Out of the 134 plots in Alang, 95 have been certified by international agency for adhering to the Hong Kong convention norms.

KOLLAM: Chirakkara grama panchayath authorities, revenue and police have made efforts to keep watch on the 42 foreign tourists who have been quarantined over Covid-19 fears at an Ayurvedic resort and homestay here.

Following reports that some foreign tourists who had travelled along with the Pathanamthitta natives from Italy on the same flight were staying at the Mythri Ayurvedic resort and homestay at Chirakkara, revenue authorities sealed the homestay on Tuesday night and ordered to quarantine 42 tourists and 30 employees working there for 28 days.

Deputy collector Sumeethan Pillai had inspected the homestay and sealed it. Further, police personnel have also been posted at the homestay to prevent any of the tourists or employees going out breaching the orders.

Health standing committee chairman of Chirakkara grama panchayath Ullas Krishnan said there were 39 people from France and three from Belgium staying there. He said only three French men had travelled with the Pathanamthitta natives on the same flight.

“The foreign tourists usually stay from January to June here at the homestay. All the 42 people staying here have come at different times. They are not part of a single group. They came separately,” he said.

According to reports, the resort had more bookings from foreigners and many of them were on their way to here. “However, we have given strict orders not to accommodate or let anyone go out till the situation is brought to normal and the threat of pandemic is over,” he said.

However, asked whether the resort was unauthorised as stated by the deputy collector who sealed it on Tuesday, Kirshnan admitted that panchayath had issued only a building licence to operate the business.

“What the panchayath issued was an initial licence to start business. The rest of the licences had to be obtained from the District tourism promotion council and other government authorities as relevant for running a resort,” he said.

Asked whether there was any other resorts functioning legally or illegally in the panchayath accommodating foreign tourists, he said they had conducted a thorough checking and no other foreign tourists could be found anywhere else in the panchayath.

Ullas Krishnan said they had ensured that all the natives coming from foreign countries including gulf countries were sent to the Public Health centre for the initial screening to ensure that they don’t have any symptoms of covid -19.

In view of the presence of foreign tourists who had travelled along with the Pathanamthitta natives staying in the nearby Chirakkara , an awarness campaign was held at Kottiaym and neighbouring places under the aegis of the SFI, Kottiyam area committee. SFI Kottiyam area secretary Sachindas told TOI that they had distributed pamphlets at major junctions besides launching a house to house campaign to sensitize people that instead of getting panic, people should take extra vigil against the virus spread. He said the campaign would be continued in the coming days.

While 150 wards were carved out in Jaipur Greater, 100 were created in Jaipur Heritage after delimitation. In Jaipur Greater, 32 wards were reserved for OBC, 22 for scheduled caste, 7 for scheduled tribe and 89 for the general category.

In Jaipur Heritage, 21 wards were reserved for OBC, 11 for scheduled caste, 3 for scheduled tribe and 65 for the general category.

Meanwhile, BJP MLA Kalicharan Saraf on Wednesday expressed dissatisfaction with the delimitation of wards, saying, “Bapu Nagar has been divided into two parts. But, the people’s represenatatives were not invited during the delimitation process of wards.”

Former mayor and MLA Ashok Lahoti alleged that there were many irregularities in the delimitation process. “The wards were not re-organised proportionally. More than 40 objections were raised in Sanganer during the delimitation process. Even the electoral roll was manipulated,” he alleged.

District collector Joga Ram said, “They (the BJP MLAs) had raised a few observations with regard to the delimitation process, which was conducted by the municipal corporation and not collectorate. They didn’t raise any objection with regard to the lottery process.”

In Kota, district collector Om Kasera conducted the lottery for Kota North and South municipal corporations. In Kota North, 11 wards have been reserved for general category and five wards for women and in Kota South, eight wards were reserved for general category and four for women.

The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is biting off more than it can chew. This is evident from the inflated budgets presented by successive NMC standing committee chairmen over the years, said chartered accountant Kailash Jogani. “Provision for expenditure is made accordingly. There is bound to be financial trouble when the receipts fall way short of the target and expenditures keep on increasing,” he said.

According to Gopal Bhutada, a homeopathy practitioner, the problem lies with the NMC administration and not with the people’s representatives.

Taking a tough stance over the financial mess in the NMC, the new municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe stopped all development works before the NMC house prevailed over his decision. Questioning the civic chief’s approach, Bhutada said why didn’t Mundhe take similar steps when he was the CEO of Nagpur Zilla Parishad to resolve financial issues there. “The commissioner should first set his house in order,” said Bhutada.

Presenting a counter view, Dinesh Naidu, secretary, Parivartan: The Citizens’ Forum, declared that the NMC is the most mismanaged civic body in the country. “The revenue is poor and the NMC is solely dependent on funds from the state government . This is mainly because the corporators are incapable,” he said.

Trying to explain the revenue deficit, Prashant Ugemuge, an entrepreneur , said that abolition of octroi was a major dent. “Octroi brought regular cash flow to NMC. Now, the property tax collection is low and the civic body can’t rely on GST compensation. Efforts are not being taken to resolve property tax disputes. Instead, suggestions like dissolving NMC are being made, which seems more like a political agenda,” he said.

The problem is an accumulation of inaction over the years, felt Piyali Kanabar, a schoolteacher. “There have always been discrepancies in NMC functioning. Despite complaints, those have been left unrectified,” she said.

Instead of getting the property assessment process done in the right manner, the civic body is trying to squeeze more out of the existing taxpayers, observed Tejinder Singh Renu, secretary of Vidarbha Taxpayers Association. According to him, many don’t even receive the property tax demand. “The NMC should target new properties,” he said and added that the state government should increase GST share to local bodies for their smooth functioning.

Businessman Anand Chandwani blamed inaction by the NMC administration against tax defaulters on political interference. “Lower rung officers don’t do what is necessary fearing backlash from the netas,” he said, and added that this attitude will ruin the civic body.

Chandwani also claimed that honest taxpayers are being exploited but denied even the basic facilities they deserve.

Taking the point forward, Jogani said the system in Nagpur is discriminatory. Demanding a scientific assessment, he said that owners of old properties are being made to pay higher taxes, while the newer ones are paying less.

For Maria Shakir, an entrepreneur, one of the major issues is the lack of communication and information. She also puts the onus on citizens to check whether the civic body is functioning properly. Kanabar sees mismanagement in many aspects of its functioning. Giving an example, she said that the civic body is not transferring the excess teachers in NMC schools and paying salaries for literally no work.

Given the mismanagement in civic services, can roping in private agencies to handle them improve things? Kanabar said there is a flip side to privatization. Bhutada too finds a problem. “The agencies are appointed through political patronage,” he said. Giving his take, Ugemuge said private agencies have no option but to establish political links to bag contracts.

Offering a solution to increase NMC income, Jogani said that every property in NMC limits must be assessed properly. He even suggested generating income from unutilized properties of the civic body. “Rents should be charged for hoardings scientifically,” he said.

“New properties needs to be brought under tax net. Lease ground rent of NMC properties should be increased gradually, taking into confidence the lessees thereon to avoid litigation,” said Renu.

On the calling attention motion by four Shiv Sena MLAS from Mumbai to dissolve the NMC citing that the civic body has collapsed financially, Renu felt that there has been no misuse of funds but over ambitious projects like London Street and malls should be put on hold. “All unproductive expenses like welcome gate, political statues and likewise need to be scrapped,” he said. Kanabar gave example of Futala Road work as one of the unwanted projects.

Jogani too said that funds were misused in gardens and constructing cement roads in every lane when it was not needed. Adding to this, Shakir said new roads are dug up in no time, and then again money is spent on its repairs. “This is due to lack of coordination between various department,” she said.

Questioning the need for cement roads, Naidu said that tar roads too can be good but there is lot of corruption in the work, leading to poor quality. Bhutada was of the opinion that cement roads are not needed in city because they are suited only to coastal areas.

Giving his views on Mundhe’s style of functioning, Renu said that as municipal commissioner, he needs to be strict and work as per the law. “At the same time, he needs to take everybody along,” said Renu. “Mundhe is making a difference. There are so many people who attend the darbar he holds daily. Even the officers are wary of his strict functioning style,” said Naidu.

Mundhe is an example of how every municipal commissioner should work, added Ugemuge. Chandwani felt that every corporator should be easily approachable for the citizens.

Bhutada said there should be no fight between the executive and the legislature, else the common man suffers. On this, Naidu said that a pressure group is needed to take issues of citizens with the NMC. “NGOs should be called for their suggestions before a project is planned,” he said. On this, Renu said since there is no legal provision for this, people should contact their corporators and give suggestions.

Panellists also felt that the ruling party is having it easy due to lack of a strong opposition. “Opposition is only for the namesake. Can’t expect much from them. In fact, opposition and ruling party are of the same species,” he said. Kanabar added that vested interest are killing our society.

Renu was of the opinion that the opposition members are less in numbers and also a divided lot. “Still, they have the option of approaching the court if they can prove any wrongdoings,” he said.

RANNI (PATHANAMTHITTA): Iythala, the epicentre of the Covid-19 in the state, is a small village in Pathanamthitta district. The three carriers of the novel coronavirus, who arrived from Italy, are natives of this village which come under Ranni’s Pazhavangady grama panchayat.

Currently, 34 families in Iythala are under home quarantine. These families live in the neighbourhood of the Covid-19-infected family. Already, four close relatives of the family in the village have been tested positive for Covid-19. The members of the 34 families have, in one way or the other, come into contact with the Italy-returned family.

The Iythala village is geographically divided into two parts. The Covid-19 affected area is called Meenmuttypaarra where there are 95 families residing. The other part Iythala is on the banks of Pampa River where there are more than 300 houses. This part was badly affected during the floods in 2018. In Meenmuttypaarra there is a small stream and a water fall. Though there are no schools in the ward there are two anganwadis.

Joseph Kuriakose, president of Pazhavangady grama panchayat, said the panchayat is taking care of the 34 families and is also monitoring to ensure that none of the members go out of their houses. “Most of these families are either relatives or friends of the infected family,” he said adding that the panchayat has started supplying food grains and grocery for free to the affected families. “Compared to other countries, India it is much better,” added Kuriakose whose daughter resides in California.

Bobby Abraham, a member of the Iythala ward expressed relief as the lab tests coming out are mostly negative. “We don’t fear about the spread of the disease. Only issue we are facing now is that the members of the 34 families are stuck inside their homes. Some have come for vacation. Students studying in other institutions are being asked to furnish medical certificates to re-join,” he said.

Ranni tehsildar Sajan V Kuriakose said situation is under control and normalcy will be restored soon. He also said the district administration is trying to make the shops reopen so that things will return to normalcy soon. He said he had received complaints from the public about the migrant workers chewing tobacco and pan and spitting on roads.

Rajkot: Dhuleti , the festival of colours , turned gory with three murders being reported from Kutch and Rajkot on Tuesday. Seven persons were arrested for allegedly committing offences.

In Kutch, Gulam Jusab Shiru (55) was hacked to death by four assailants in Shirava village of Mandvi taluka. Police arrested Mamad Padhiyar, Abbas Shiru, Abdullah Padhiyar and Sultan Padhiyar for the crime.

According to the police, the accused had a long pending dispute with Gulam over the boundary of cattle sheds. On the fateful day, while Gulam and his son Rahim were herding out their cattle from the shed, Mamad entered into an altercation with them.

“As the altercation turned into a fight, the accused attacked Gulam and Rahim with axes and iron rods. While Gulam was killed on the spot, Rahim is battling for his life in Mandvi Civil Hospital,” said N M Chauhan, sub-inspector with Mandvi police station.

In Chobari village of Bhachau taluka in Kutch, Magha Meria (45) was rammed by a car by the accused, identified as Ramesh Varchand.

“Varchand purposefully rammed his car into Meria and killed him, as he was nursing a grudge against him after he ran into an altercation with him over an issue of driving,” said an official from Bhachau police station, adding that Varchand went absconding after the crime.

In Pad village on the outskirts of Rajkot, three persons were arrested for allegedly hacking to death Raju Ganava (24). “The accused, Shaitan Singal (32), Pappu Ajanar (50) and his son Mayalo Ajanar (21) had attacked Ganava over a financial dispute,” said an official from Lodhika police station.

Ganava’s younger brother Sanjay had eloped with Singal’s sister. As part of a compromise, Ganava had agreed to pay Rs 3.70 lakh to Singal, of which he had already paid Rs 2 lakh. Though Ganava had promised to pay the remaining amount later, Singal had started harassing him over the recovery of the amount. On the fateful day, when Singal came for the recovery, he entered into an altercation with Ganava, following which Singal and the co-accused attacked Ganava.

202,['12/03/2020'],Aurangabad: SPI alters pattern of entrance exam,"Representative image

Aurangabad: The Services Preparatory Institute (SPI) here has introduced reforms in its entrance examination pattern, including clubbing two papers. Also, answer sheets will now have Optical Mark Recognition (OMR), which will ensure speedy and accurate assessment.

On Wednesday, SPI director Colonel Amit Dalvi said the reforms have been introduced in the entrance examination for the benefit of the students’ benefit and considering the logistics.

“Earlier, the SPI entrance had separate papers for General Ability Test (GAT) and mathematics, which used to take place on the same day with an interval between the papers. These two papers have now been clubbed,” he said.

Giving the reason behind clubbing two paper, Dalvi said students often solve GAT paper faster than the stipulated time. They can use the remaining time to solve the mathematics paper.

“Earlier, the GAT and mathematics papers were of one-and-half and two hours duration, respectively. After clubbing the two papers, the total time given for the single paper will be of three and a half-hour. It will help students in effective time management,” Dalvi said.

There is, however, no change in the marking system. GAT and mathematics will have 75 marks each. The SPI had introduced negative marking last year and it will continue. A wrong answer will result in deduction of 0.25 marks, Dalvi said.

SPI authorities also said that logistic convenience was one of the reasons behind having a single paper as the institution has limited manpower.

Five years ago, the SPI had decided to carry out two separate papers instead of one. The examination pattern, five years ago, was a single paper of 100 marks comprising questions on different subjects.

On OMR technology, Dalvi said it would help in a quick declaration of result. “We will ensure the assessment of answersheets with OMR takes place twice as per the standard procedure. It will ensure accurate and speedy results,” Dalvi said.

AURANGABAD: The Services Preparatory Institute (SPI) has received 13,082 applications against the intake capacity of 60 seats for the entrance examination to secure admission to the academic year 2020-21.

The SPI, a one-of-its-kind state-run institution in Maharashtra, prepares students for admissions to defence courses. SPI director Colonel Amit Dalvi on Wednesday said almost 4,000 more (compared to last year) applications have been received this year.

“It is heartening to see the rising number of applications for SPI. This shows the ever-increasing popularity of our institution as well as ambition among students and their parents to join defence services,” he said.

Dalvi said the time-table of entrance examination for the academic year 2020-21 would be announced shortly. Followed by the entrance examination to be held in Aurangabad , Nagpur, Kolhapur and Pune, SPI authorities will conduct personal interviews of top candidates for its new batch.

Candidates studying English, Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in Class X are eligible to appear for SPI entrance. Aspirants must have secured a minimum of 60% marks in Class VII, VIII, IX and X.

Dalvi said a set of constrains makes such proposals improbable. “The institution has limited infrastructure, physical facilities, and human resources owing to which we cannot admit more students despite our wish. Our hostels and campus can only accommodate 120 cadets (in two batches),” he said.

While in past, the government was mooting to open new institutions in other parts of Maharashtra on the line of SPI, Dalvi said a study group was formed to take a call on such decision.

“The study group was formed last year to decide on setting up new SPIs across the state. It will submit its report to the government after necessary study,” he said.

During the genesis of SPI, policy makers and authorities concerned from defence services had planned setting up of the SPI at four places in Maharashtra. While the establishment of SPI in Aurangabad could materialise in 1977, plans of remaining institutions at other places still remain at conceptual stage.

204,['12/03/2020'],BJP picks veteran leader Gehlot for RS elections,"Jaipur: The BJP declared former minister and veteran leader Rajendra Gehlot (70) as its candidate for Rajya Sabha polls on Wednesday. His name came as a surprise for the party leaders who didn’t expect a veteran to be the party's candidate.

Sources said that his name was among the candidates forwarded by the RSS for the RS polls slated on March 26.

A two-term (1990-1993 and 1993-1999) from Sardarpura assembly seat in Jodhpur had lost the seat to the chief minister Ashok Gehlot in 1999 assembly polls.

His clout in the party has grown manifold during the government of Bhairon Singh Shekhawat (1993-1999) as he was elevated to the minister of prisons.

The defeat by Gehlot had stripped his political career and since then he was not given any major political role other than a post of UIT chairman of Jodhpur in 2006.

Once he was projected as a main political rival to CM Ashok Gehlot in the late eighties and in the nineties in Jodhpur.

At presently, he is holding a position of BJP vice-president but has maintained a distance from the limelight. He is keeping a low profile and believes in coming early and leaving quietly during the state-level organization meetings.

Elated over his name for the RS, Gehlot told TOI, “BJP is the only party which gives the opportunity to his grassroots workers. I now take this chance as a challenge to serve the state and western Rajasthan in a more effective manner,” said Gehlot, amid loud slogans from his supporters at his residence prior Jodhpur.

He was quick to chart out his priorities for the region, said, “Jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat is from Jodhpur and has taken several initiatives tackling the problem of water scarcity in the western districts. I will join hands with him in the cause and work towards providing an effective solution to the problem,” said Gehlot.

Even the BJP media cell is not prepared for the party's choice. The cell started collecting information on him after his name was announced by BJP high command.

AURANGABAD: Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray arrived in the city on Wednesday, on the eve of Shiv Jayanti, to celebrate the birth anniversary of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as per Hindu calendar.

The first-of-its-kind appearance of MNS chief in Aurangabad on the occasion of Shiv Jayanti has come in wake of Shiv Sena breaking its tradition and celebrating the occasion on February 19 as per English calendar.

MNS Aurangabad district chief Suhas Dashrathe said his party will leave no stone unturned to ensure grand celebrations of Shiv Jayanti on Thursday.

“Our party chief, along with his son Amit, has arrived for the Shiv Jayanti celebrations. We are not among those who give up their religion and culture for the sake of some political gains and therefore will celebrate Shiv Jayanti as per Hindu calendar in a grand manner,” Dashrathe said.

Dashrathe, who quit recently Sena to join MNS, said every Hindu takes pride in celebrating his or her festivals and major occasions as per Hindu calendar only.

As per party release, MNS chief is scheduled to pay tribute to Shivaji Maharaj at a special event planned at Kranti chowk where special tableau and other decorative arrangements have been made.

Surviving without a salary for the last five months, they sell three-litre of cow milk daily for a living, and get just Rs 100 for it.

Promised a salary, the couple has not been paid one ever since they were hired by civic body. Apart from the couple, a woman who removes cow dung, too, gets two-litre milk daily.

“Municipal board had appointed three of us here in October last year. We take care of 137 stray cattle, including cows. We clean the place and the cattle, feed them fodder provided by the board and ensure that none of the animals fall ill. But, despite our repeated requests, we have not been paid a single dime ever since we were appointed as contractual labourers. We have two children who go to a nearby government school. The cowshed is also incomplete. At least a small dwelling inside can help us live here with dignity,” says Kumar.

When contacted, UP Gau Seva Commission’s president Shyam Nandan Singh said, “This gaushala is under the municipal board’s management and we have little say in that. But I will look into the matter. If the caretakers are not paid, how will he take care of animals?”

Officials said five children were taken ill on Sunday after they had consumed overdose of ayurvedic medicine which was distributed at a health camp on Sunday.

209,['12/03/2020'],"Coronavirus in Kerala: Two years after deluge, Ranni faces another challenge","Ranni town, where five coronavirus cases have been reported, wears a deserted look on Wednesday

RANNI: Ranni town and Pazhavangadi market wore a deserted look on Wednesday afternoon after five Covid-19 cases were reported this week. Only two small shops were opened in the market- which sold vegetables and dried fish. A stationery store was also kept open on the main road. Among the 20 odd hotels in the town only three had opened, however, there were no customers.

It was only two years ago the town, which is situated on the banks of Pamba River, faced its biggest ever deluge. It took couple of weeks for the people here to bounce back to normalcy. Ranni market is considered as the biggest market in the district and people residing within a radius of 25km depend on this market.

NRI bank deposit and rubber have been the reasons behind the economic growth of Ranni, one of the largest taluks in Kerala owing to its vast forest land. According to a senior official of a leading bank in the region, NRI deposits in the taluk is around Rs 2,000 crore. The nearby Mallappally taluk is much more and is around Rs 6,000 crore.

“A majority of NRIs in Ranni are in the Middle East. Many from the Knanaya community in the region are also in the US and European countries,” said the official. He also said the total NRI deposit in Pathanamthitta district alone is around Rs 22,000 crore which is half of the total deposit in the district.

Mathew C V, president of the Ranni merchants association said though Ranni, which has around 850 merchants, had recovered quickly from the aftermath of the floods, this time it’s uncertain how fast normalcy would be restored. “Markets have been dull. People do not want to come out of their homes,” he said. “Awareness should be created amongst people regarding the spread of Covid-19 virus.”

Sony Zacharias, secretary of Ranni hotels association said the industry is in crisis. “After pressure from the merchants association I opened my hotel around 7am on Wednesday. The first customer walked in by 8.30am. Two more came in after an hour. I closed shop by 9.45am,” he said adding that he had to pay wages to his staff despite closing down the shop early. Hotels in the town have remained closed since Monday. Jose K Abraham, another merchant, said all the 230 shops on the premises of the Ranni bus stand remained closed. “It’s good that people are not coming out of their houses due to the situation. Most of them have stocked necessary products at home. However, they may not last for more than a week,” he said. After the floods, Corona scare has been a setback to the business sector, he added.

MUZAFFARNAGAR: A newly-married youth, 23, was crushed to death when a speeding tractor on which he was performing stunts for Tik Tok overturned on him, just 12 days after a youth drowned while shooting a video for the Chinese video-sharing app in the district.

Married just two months ago, Kapil was performing the stunts during the Holi revelry in Muzaffarnagar’s Khindidiya village on Tuesday.

“Kapil was performing stunts and another man was shooting a video from the mobile phone. But he lost control over steering and the tractor overturned on him,” said Ritiparn Singh, the village head of Khindidiya. According to villagers, Kapil was trying to lift the front wheels of the speeding tractor in air when it overturned, killing him on the spot.

Sources said that family members of Kapil cremated his body without informing the police. When contacted, station house officer (SHO) of Chapar police station said, “No complaint was given by the family members into the matter.”

This was second death in the last 15 days which could be attributed to the people’s craze to become famous on Tik Tok by performing dangerous stunts.

On February 28, Raj Qureshi (18) was killed while taking a plunge into a canal in Muzaffarnagar’s Meerapur area. Qureshi had decided to jump into the deep canal while his three friends were at the bank filming the stunt for Tik Tok. But, going by the video, it is evident that Qureshi hit a rock, got unconscious and drowned. The body was fished out two hours later.

The MRP on a pack of 20 masks was marked at Rs 500.With the rise in demand, most pharmacies in the city have run out of stock of N95 and surgical masks.A private employee in the city, V Bhavani Shankar, purchased two N95 masks from the pharmacy outlet in MVP Colony on Tuesday. “I was shocked when they charged Rs 300 for two masks from a pack of 20 though it should be Rs 50 for two masks. The manufacturing date and MRP have been blacked out. I took an empty 20-pack box and removed the ink, which revealed the pack originally costs Rs 500. When I questioned the pharmacist for charging such a high price over MRP, he justified it by stating that local retailers and other stores are charging even higher.”When TOI inquired at the Siripuram outlet of the pharmacy chain, the pharmacist said, “After two days, stocks may arrive and each mask is priced at Rs 150 as they are of high quality.”Inquiries at another pharmacy chain revealed that though face masks were out of stock, N95 were being sold at Rs 25 per piece while surgical masks were even cheaper but a standalone medical store at Lawson’s Bay Colony said the masks would cost between Rs 200-Rs 250 but were currently out of stock.Speaking to TOI, medical superintendent of Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases (GHCCD), Dr KVV Vijaykumar said, “There is no high and low quality N95 mask even if packaging may differ. Escalating the price to this extent is unfair when there is not a single COVID-19 case in the city, nor any requirement for the public to wear it. A three-layer surgical mask is enough for those suffering from cough and cold.”Dr PV Sudhakar, principal of Andhra Medical College said, “N95, which should not be priced more than Rs 20-Rs 30, is recommended only for hospital staff and health workers. Those with asthma, pregnancy or cardiac problems should avoid wearing these masks unnecessarily. Drug inspectors should take action against pharmacies for over-charging.”",visakhapatnam,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74583378,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-98050,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/med-stores-inflate-n95-mask-price-amidst-corona-scare/articleshow/74583379.cms

214,['12/03/2020'],Fencing mooted along rail tracks,"Thiruvananthapuram: Southern Railway, Thiruvananthapuram division, has proposed to construct fences to prevent dumping of garbage near railway tracks. Fencing is mooted along the tracks from Thiruvananthapuram Central to Pettah railway station. The aim is to keep the area garbage-free as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.

The Thampanoor–Pettah tracks run along the densely-populated areas of the city and dumping of waste is a common practice here, especially during the night hours.

According to a railway official, dumping of waste is a major issue for the railways and strict action is taken against people caught dumping waste in railway property. The Railway Protection Force (RPF), commercial staff and other railway staff had conducted a mapping of vulnerable areas between Thiruvananthapuram Central and Pettah, based on directives from division authority a few months ago. Regular inspections are conducted at these spots to check the issue.

The plan is to ensure fencing for around 3km railway tracks from Thiruvananthapuram Central to Pettah station.

As many as six CCTV cameras are installed in the stretch between Thiruvananthapuram Central and Pettah. Penalty is imposed on people caught dumping waste in the railway tracks.

“Strict checking on dumping of garbage on railway property was intensified after a team from National Green Tribunal (NGT) visited the station in August last year. The vulnerable spots are regularly monitored by RPF officers. Around Rs 2 lakh was collected as penalty for dumping waste in railway property including, railway tracks, open areas and station premises in 2019. Despite these measures, people continue to dump waste and fencing along the tracks was proposed as a solution. The fences will have a height of four to five feet,” said Ajay Kaushik, station director, Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station.

In a recent case in January, a team of RPF officers had caught a group of people who tried to dump waste on railway track in the city. Penalty was imposed on them and they were made to take back the garbage. tnn

“It’s one of the highest recognition for a kidney doctor to get his work published and appreciated by ASN. It has 22,000 active members worldwide and is the world’s largest professional society committed to the study of kidney diseases,” said Dr Pandya, while talking to TOI on the backdrop of World Kidney Day, observed on the second Thursday of March.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government has ruled out any lapses on its part in identifying the three Pathanamthitta natives who arrived from Italy, and were affected by Covid-19. Health minister K K Shailaja said in the assembly that there are limitations for the government in identifying all such passengers unless they honestly declare their travel details.

Replying to a submission in this regard by opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, the minister said the passengers who had arrived from Italy had not disclosed their travel to Italy. Instead, they said that they came back from Doha which was then not under screening. The minister said that the containment method followed by the government is effective, and the health department and its staff is working hard to locate till the last person who came in contact with the three-member family after reaching home.

Even though the department is doing its best to contain the virus and other states have lauded and decided to emulate the state’s best practices, it cannot be assured that there will not be any deaths in the state due to Covid-19. “We did not have any protocol or guidelines. We have created one on our own with the best use of resources available to us,” the minister said.

The minister said that there are 1,495 persons under surveillance in the state, of which 1,236 are in home quarantine and 259 in hospitals. She said that out of 980 samples that have been tested, 815 have been found to be negative while 14 of those returned from Italy and three from China have been found positive. The minister said that as many as 18 teams have been deployed in Pathanamthitta for identifying persons with symptoms of Covid-19. She said that a 166-member team is dedicated in tracing the contacts of those who have come into touch with the Italy-returned family while 68 health department officials are involved in isolation activities only in Pathanamthitta.

Restraining the farmers from transplanting summer paddy from this season, the district magistrate had also directed 14 departmental heads to ensure that farmers do not cultivate the particular crop in any part of the district. In addition, the agriculture department has been told to motivate farmers to replace summer paddy with pulses and maize. Defying orders, the farmers under Pilibhit tehsil circle have started transplanting summer paddy on their fields from Tuesday. The farmers have also filed a petition to Allahabad high court to repeal the DM’s order.

Notably, summer paddy is a crop that is transplanted in March to ripe in May. In absence of any monsoon rain during these months, the crop completely survives on underground water as it is irrigated with the help of pumping sets. The administrative restrictions on this crop were swayed by the thought to save the sub-soil water from any further depletion. According to an estimate, summer paddy is grown in Pilibhit across an area of around 30,000 hectare.

“I have filed a writ petition to HC on March 4 challenging the restriction on summer paddy imposed by the district administration. HC’s decision is expected on March 18. How can the administration debar farmers from choosing a cropping pattern which is neither prohibited by any court, government nor by the national green tribunal?” stated Chaudahary Dharmendra Singh, a farmer of Pachpeda under Puranpur tehsil circle.

A local farmer of Baivaha under Pilibhit tehsil circle, Harpreet Singh Chabba, told TOI that he assembled over 200 farmers on Tuesday and began transplantation of summer paddy at his own farm. “Summer paddy is a crucial source of our earnings, especially to repay our bank loans on time and thus to avert the recovery proceedings of the respective banks,” said Shankar Rai, the husband of Deepali Rai, the woman gram pradhan of Gabhiya Sahrai under Kalinagar tehsil circle.

Meanwhile, tehsildar of Pilibhit sadar, Vivek Kumar Mishra said that Chabba and other violators have been given a two-day ultimatum which would expire on Thursday.

RAJKOT: A sordid case of a married woman subjected to unimaginable brutality and sexual assault has come to light in Kutch after police arrested her tormentor on Tuesday.

The arrested person Mansukh Koli (30) not only raped her repeatedly, but also brutalized her by branding her private parts. He did not stop at this. Koli filmed the entire act of rape and branding on his mobile and started using the video to extract money from her.

“In the last six months, Koli blackmailed her into giving Rs 1.5 lakh including her ornaments. He raped the woman in her father’s farm in a village of Rapar taluka,” said KG Zala, deputy superintendent of police, Rapar.

Koli threatened to upload the video on social media. Even as she constantly pleaded with him to let her go and wailed, Koli remained unmoved and even thrashed her.

“The woman was tortured for nearly six months. We had formed five teams to track down Koli after the video somehow started circulating on Whatsapp and social media,” Zala added.

The police teams also tracked down the woman and convinced her to lodge a complaint against Koli.

“Once the complaint was lodged, we launched a manhunt for Koli. Meanwhile, Koli went absconding after learning about the police action against him. We tracked him down in the Little Rann of Kutch after he switched on his cellphone to send a message,” said Zala.

In her complaint, the woman alleged that Koli had raped her at knife point and had shot a video of the act while she was working in her father’s farm six months ago.

He had raped her several times in the past six months. Koli is married and has two children, police said.

Apart from Dangar, Shivraj Vichhiya, Shailesh Chandu, Dadu Chandu, Ashok Boricha, Balsinh Boricha, Vanraj Vala, Narendra Khuman and Gautam Khuman were booked under various sections of the GCTOC Act on Monday night at the Savarkundla rural police station.

A special investigation team (SIT) has also been formed by the Amreli superitendent of police Nirlipt Rai to investigate the case. SIT probe is headed by deputy SP K J Chaudhary with probationer ASP Sushil Agarwal as his assistant.

“This is the first case under GCTOC in Amreli after the act was enacted in Gujarat,” said R K Karmata, sub-inspector with Amreli local crime branch.

Of those booked, Dangar and Vichhiya are the gang leaders, who had spread their crime syndicate in districts like Amreli, Bhavnagar, Rajkot, Gir Somnath and Junagadh. The gang is allegedly involved in crimes ranging from murder, attempt to murder and extortion to kidnapping, money laundering, land grabbing and arms dealing, said Karmata, adding that the gang was also involved in smuggling of arms and explosives.

Dangar and her gang members have been ‘continuing unlawful activity’ despite several chargesheets filed against them for various offences, said Karmata.

Dangar was last year arrested for circulated a video on the social media in which she is threatening Amreli superintendent of police Nirlipt Rai and a woman sub-inspector of Savarkundla police station.

In the video, Dangar was apparently angry over arrest of her close aide Vichhiya held under Prohibition Act after he was caught in a liquor party by Ahmedabad police. Later, the Ahmedabad police handed over Vichhiya’s custody to Amreli police.

After Savarkundla taluka police station officials registered an offence in this regard, Dangar was traced to a hotel in Udaipur in Rajasthan and arrested on December 22 last year.

Of those booked under GCTOC, six accused including Dangar, Vichhiya, Balsinh Boricha, Narendra Khuman, Gautam Khuman and Dadu Chandu are lodged in different jails of Gujarat.

However, Vala, Ashok Boricha and Shailesh Chandu out on bail. “We have intensified our manhunt for the remaining accused, and we hope to nab them soon,” said Karmata.

An affidavit filed by the Ahmedabad district education officer R R Vyas stated that four children were not Indian nationals and these known foreign nationals were living at the ashram on the school campus without documentation. They were among the 24 students who were shifted along with the ashram to Ahmedabad.

The DEO listed the alleged illegalities and irregularities by the school in the Hathijan area that led to the cancellation of its recognition. This came in reply to the school’s plea in the HC, challenging the government action against it.

The DEO stated that of the 24 students from the Nithyananda ashram, 18 did not produce transfer certificates and eight students did not supply birth certificates. The DEO cited the school’s action of allowing use of its campus by the Nithyananda ashram as an irregularity.

The DEO cited the alleged forged NOC, the de-affiliation of the school by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the use of the school building since 2008 without ‘Building Use’ permission as reasons for the government’s decision to de-recognize and close the school. Education officials stated that school authorities were granted ample opportunity to explain their side with show-cause notices issued to them on various occasions, but the school management did not come forward to explain the alleged irregularities and illegalities. The affidavit also maintains that the school management has yet not challenged the DEO’s decision before the competent authority and it approached the HC before exhausting alternative remedies. Hence, the school’s petition is not maintainable, the government asserted.

229,['12/03/2020'],"Tepid response on Day 1, only 24 file nominations","Visakhapatnam: The first day of the nomination exercise on Wednesday was marked by a poor response. Only 24 candidates from various political parties filed their nominations for the GVMC elections . The lukewarm response has been attributed to the principal political parties, YSRC and TDP, working on the list of candidates.

The reservation process by the district administration reserved 50% of the wards (49 wards) to women candidates while many wards have gone to a different category or community than that of the aspirants/local leaders of that particular ward. These factors have forced the parties to search for new candidates to meet the reservation criteria. The parties are yet to figure out potential candidates, who command influence in their respective community/area and can spend some money on the elections. The delayed candidate selection process is expected to affect the nomination filing.

The maximum number of nominations is expected to be filed on the last day of the nomination exercise — March 13. According to sources, YSRC and TDP may release their lists on Wednesday night or Thursday. VMRDA metropolitan commissioner and GVMC in-charge commissioner P Koteswara Rao have urged aspirants to file their nominations without waiting till March 13.

Meanwhile, Rao visited Zone-V office in Gajuwaka to monitor arrangements for the GVMC polls. He asked officials to set up sufficient signage for voters. GVMC additional commissioner Thameem Ansariya visited Zone-II and Zone-III offices.

Later, both IAS officers inspected the Andhra University Engineering College buildings, which may be used for various election purposes.

Goa’s jail administration has tied up with local industrial training institutes and will also hire instructors in the coming months to impart the training to jail inmates, said inspector general of prisons (IGP) Gurudas Pilarnekar.

He said that female inmates will also be able to opt for tailoring courses as part of the ongoing efforts to rehabilitate offenders.

“New courses are being started at the jail. Plumbing and other courses like stitching and tailoring for women will be started,” said Pilarnekar. “A jail is not supposed to be just a prison, but a correctional facility.”

There are around 553 inmates housed at the jail, including 35 women. Other courses like papad-making and cooking are also in the works.

At a later stage, inmates will also be given training as fitters and welders. A proposal to teach electrical training to the inmates was not approved because of the risks involved. ITI instructors will help impart the training but the department also plans to recruit full-time instructors for some courses, said officials. The Colvale Central Jail already has a bakery where cakes, cookies, biscuits and patties are prepared and served to the inmates.

Additional IGP Ashutosh Apte said that the aim behind the exercise was to rehabilitate those behind bars and provide them with a means to earn a livelihood once they are released.

The Congress in the 2017 assembly elections increased its tally of MLAs compared to 2012 and thus can win two of the four Rajya Sabha seats up for election on March 26. The BJP presently holds three of these four seats.

The BJP on Wednesday announced two nominees. However, there are indications that the party will field three candidates. A BJP leader said, “Our party puts up a keen fight even at taluka-level elections. There is no question of letting one Rajya Sabha seat slip out of our hands.”

The leader added, “Two Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) MLAs and one NCP MLA have already announced support to us. A dozen Congress MLAs are keen to defect to the BJP. However, at this point, we may accept the support of three or four Congress MLAs only, which will enable us to win the third RS seat.”

Like other states, Gujarat Congress has also requested its central leadership to nominate general secretary Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra for the RS from Gujarat. However, the state leadership has no clarity about whether she will file her nomination papers from Gujarat.

At stake is the proposal to make the city the executive capital.

The capital issue is expected to be a key campaign plank for the YSRC while the TDP claims that establishing the executive capital in Visakhapatnam will encourage land encroachments and anti-social activities.

In spite of the YSRC’s victory in the state assembly elections, the party could not win any seat in Vizag core city. With several leaders such as former minister P Balaraju and former MLA Ch Venkatramaiah recently shifting their loyalty to the YSRC, the party is hoping to take over the reins of the civic body.

The selection of candidates and campaign strategies is being closely monitored by YSRC MPs and MLAs.

The TDP, with four MLAs in the core city area, has retained its key leaders. It was learnt that the final call on the mayoral candidate will be made by party president N Chandrababu Naidu but party leaders in the city are keen on fielding a former MLA as the candidate.

Speaking to TOI, Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority chairman and senior YSRC leader Dronamraju Srinivasa Rao said making Visakhapatnam the executive capital would change north-coastal AP, and particularly the city.

A TDP leader said the state’s development has been jeopardised under YSRC rule. “We will explain to the public how YS Jaganmohan Reddy’s rule has wreaked havoc,” said the leader.

Barricades have been set up in a 2km radius,"" a senior state Congress leader said. Party sources said leaders have tried to get through to some of the MLAs in Bengaluru through their spouses.

Minister for co-operatives Dr Govind Singh and minister for animal husbandry Lakhan Singh Yadav filed a disqualification petition against six ministers of the Scindia faction who are presently in Bengaluru. They are Tulsiram Silawat, Pradyumn Singh Tomar, Imarti Devi, Mahendra Singh Sisodia, Govind Singh Rajput and Prabhuram Choudhary.

CM Kamal Nath had on Tuesday recommended to Governor Lalji Tandon to disqualify these six ministers. PCC spokesman and chief of legal cell JP Dhanopia filed the petition with Speaker NP Prajapati on behalf of the two ministers. ""There is a provision under Article 191 of Constitution and Tenth Schedule that you cannot be MLA of one party and benefit another. There is a Supreme Court ruling in the case of Ravi S Naik versus Union of India. These six ministers contested the election as Congress candidates under the party symbol,"" Dhanopia said.

""They are ministers of a Congress government but are benefiting another political party. They flew in their plane and have been lodged in a resort by BJP and are trying to bring down the Congress government. These are all on record. This makes ground for their disqualification as members of the legislative assembly. The Speaker can take the decision to disqualify them,"" he said. The Speaker said he will wait till the ministers return and submit the resignation personally.

Members of ACGEPA, representing around 5,000 pensioners, in their complaint letter stated there are 31 empanelled hospitals in the city and some of these corporate hospitals are declining cashless treatment to CGHS beneficiaries on the plea on non-recoupment of hospital credit bills, which runs into crores of rupees.

238,['12/03/2020'],TDP picks Kesineni’s daughter Swetha as mayoral candidate,"Vijayawada: TDP has cleared the name of Kesineni Swetha as mayoral candidate for Vijayawada. Swetha, daughter of Vijayawada MP Kesineni Srinivas (Nani), had played a key role for TDP in 2019 general elections.

TDP, which has focused on encouraging youth in politics, has decided to give a chance to young candidates as mayor and counsellors for municipalities and municipal corporations. The party has decided to announce mayoral candidates before the polls and make them star campaigners across the wards.

Swetha studied psychology at Emory University, Atlanta, the US. She campaigned for Hillary Clinton during the 2017 US presidential elections. She was one of the keynote speakers at the National Women’s Parliament held at Vijayawada in 2017.

Following the annoucement, key TDP leaders expressed their happiness over the selection of Swetha as the mayoral candidate for Vijayawada.

Linagamaneni Sivarama Prasad, senior leader from the city said, “We welcome young blood to the party. These leaders are the future of the state. Swetha proved herself as a dedicated party leader by participating in election campaigns. We are confident that we will win 75% of wards and Swetha will be sworn in as the mayor of the city.”

Swetha is likely to file her nomination from the 11th division of the city. The party is planning to conduct a huge rally from the NTR circle as part of the nomination process.

Meanwhile, senior party leaders have swung into action to pacify colleagues who expected to be picked for the mayor’s post.

The fraud came to light a few weeks ago, but police registered a case against the bank’s 64-year-old gold appraiser Macherla Satya Vara Prasad Rao only on Tuesday night following a complaint from senior regional manager of the bank Vinod Pophale spelling out the exact amount siphoned off.

Machilipatnam-based Satya Vara Prasad Rao has been serving as gold appraiser for the bank for the past two decades. The gold, which was appraised by Rao and pledged by 68 individuals, was found to be imitation jewellery during an internal investigation.

Bank authorities issued a paper publication on March 1, 2020, advising gold loan borrowers to be present for verification of ornaments from March 1 to 7. A majority of the genuine gold loan borrowers visited the bank.

However, some individuals, who reportedly pledged fake gold and availed loans against it didn’t turn up for verification. Some even denied availing loans from the bank during investigation.

The internal investigation has revealed that Rao connived with a few gold loan borrowers and sanction loans from the bank’s Chilakalapudi branch.

Sources said the fraud came to light following a tip-off that some people had availed loans by pledging fake jewellery with the support of the gold appraiser. The amount swindled is estimated to be Rs 6.71 crore and a majority of the sum was taken by the appraiser himself.

Speaking to TOI, Chilakalapudi inspector M Venkata Narayana said they had registered a case against Satya Vara Prasad Rao under Sections 120 (B), 409, 420 and R/W 34 of IPC. Chilakalapudi police, along with Central Crime Station police, are on the look out for Rao, Narayana said.

State Congress president Girish Chodankar even wrote to the SEC complaining that their candidates have not received the electoral rolls in electronic format and that booth level officers were not creating awareness about the polls.

“For the upcoming ZP elections, electoral rolls have been provided with a lot of delay and secondly the rolls have not been provided in electronic mode as result of which voters slips have to be prepared manually, which is taking a lot of man hours in a situation where there is already paucity of time,” Chodankar said.

Congress has asked the SEC to ensure that booth level officers distribute voter slips and create voter awareness to ensure maximum voter turnout. “The endeavour of the election commission is to have free and fair elections and to have maximum voter turnout. But the BJP government is trying its best to trouble the Congress,” Chodankar said. The party president was speaking after chairing the state Congress executive committee meeting. The committee and office bearers met to discuss the preparations for the ZP elections.

Opposition leader Digambar Kamat, expressed confidence over the party’s prospects in the elections. Kamat brushed aside suggestions that Congress MLAs, especially Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, had not been consulted during the candidate selection process.

JAIPUR: The Congress leaders in Rajasthan decried the claim of some BJP leaders that Madhya Pradesh ’s political ‘ drama ’ could be repeated in the desert state. The Congress leaders here said that the BJP would do good to keep its own flock together.

Some BJP leaders are comparing MP situation in the context of relationship between chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his deputy Sachin Pilot. Pilot’s silence over Scindia action was also adding fuel to fire.

Pilot who was in Delhi, however, breaking his silence on the issue on Wednesday night in a tweet said, “Unfortunate to see @JM_Scindia parting ways with @INCIndia. I wish things could have been resolved collaboratively within the party.”

Former BJP minister Kalicharan Saraf MLA claimed that some Congress MLAs are in touch with the saffron party in Rajasthan.

The Congressmen decried the involvement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah in the toppling game.

State transport minister Pratap Singh Kachariyawas, while speaking to media, decried the role of the PM. “It is for the first time that the PM, home minister and defence minister conspiring to topple a democratically elected government in a state.”

He said if Scindia had met some BJP leaders before leaving the Congress, it was understandable. But the direct involvement of the prime minister and senior functionaries of government in this toppling game is a new low in the democratic history of the country, he said.

Harish Chaudhary, a senior minister in the Gehlot cabinet, while ruling out any rebellion in the Rajasthan Congress in the state said, “There is no difference within the Rajasthan Congress. The alleged difference over Rajya Sabha seat is a pigment of imagination as the Rajya Sabha seats are yet to be decided.”

Mahendra Chaudhary, party deputy chief whip, said the BJP’s claim of some Congress MLAs are in touch with them is nothing but wishful thinking. Better they keep their flock together, he said.

Patel on Wednesday said, “I did not speak on this subject in the assembly to maintain the dignity of our opposition party friends. Now I think I have to respond. At the Umiya Dham ceremony, the ‘others’ I referred to were those in the Congress. I mean to say that I am pitted against so many MLAs of the Congress in the house. I am a loyal soldier of the BJP.

Congress is getting split everywhere in the country and its leaders and workers are leaving the party everywhere.” No MLA of the Congress responded to Patel’s clarification.

In his reply, minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja said, “The Congress is eyeing the Gujarat CM’s post. This will never happen. Not one MLA will cross over to the Congress.

247,['12/03/2020'],Lack of toddy tappers has hit palm feni production: GU docu,"Panaji: Production of coconut feni has been on decline as very few toddy tappers, locally called ‘render’ are into various other trades today. Traditional toddy tapping requires the tapper to climb a coconut tree thrice a day— not an adventure many of the younger men from families traditionally into the craft, are willing to take up.

The draft policy document on feni production prepared by Goa University’s Goa Business School, highlights some of the problems involved in the production of coconut feni.

The draft feni policy states that the older generation of ‘renders’ continue in the strenuous profession with the help of their family members, but their activity is restricted to festive occasions in certain villages and towns.

There is an acute shortage of toddy tappers. The drastic drop in the number of toddy tappers has directly affected coconut feni production, says the policy document.

One of the other reasons toddy tapping has gone out of vogue with the passage of time, is because the fermented sap from the coconut palm is used for making other products such as palm sugar (jaggery) and vinegar, widely used in traditional Goan cuisine. These two products have apparently found more favour with those linked to their production, as they yield more revenue with smaller labour costs as compared to coconut feni production, notes the study.

The risk involved in scaling coconut trees has also contributed to the youth walking away from the toddy tapping profession. During the monsoon, climbing a coconut tree is a challenge.

“Moss growing on the trunk makes it slippery and the toddy tapper runs the risk of falling off the tree,” it says. Renders are not protected by any social security scheme.

The study also notes that being a toddy tapper is a short-lived occupation due to the high risk of developing health ailments. Constant climbing of trees puts tremendous stress on the knees, and toddy tappers develop orthopedic and joint problems that make it difficult for them to continue in the profession.

Observers said TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu ’s opposition to the state government’s move to elevate Visakhapatnam as executive capital had upset Ramesh Babu.

Panchakarla Ramesh Babu started his political career with Chiranjeevi’s Praja Rajyam Party and won elections from Pendurthi assembly segment in 2009. He contested from Yalamanchili after joining TDP following the division of the state and won the election. He lost the elections last year from the same segment.

Ramesh Babu announced his resignation in a media conference held at his residence here on Wednesday and showed the letter sent to TDP national president Naidu. “Vizag has given me so much. Not only paved a platform for my business and also my political career. I came here for livelihood. But I have developed a bond with this city. There is no need to oppose Vizag as executive capital. I conveyed this to TDP president Naidu but he insisted me to carry out agitations for Amaravati , which I have not done,” Ramesh said.

He asked Naidu why he had not discussed the party’s poor show in the assembly elections held last year. He alleged there was no place for persons working sincerely for the party. Taking up the cause of Amaravati farmers is genuine but what about backward districts in north Andhra, he asked.

TDP has insulted the feelings of the north Andhra people, he accused. He would not join any party now and discuss it with his followers before taking any decision, Ramesh Babu said.

The Congress central leadership, which is in disarray, had been woken up from its deep slumber from the rude shock of Scindia’s rebellion is now preparing for a show down.

The Madhya Pradesh Congress which had gathered its MLAs in Jaipur is preparing for a fight back as it thinks that the MLAs which had gone to Bangalore are not all necessarily with Scindia especially after he joined the BJP.

The MLAs, who reached Jaipur by a special Indigo flight, were taken to the resorts in three luxury buses with VIP security. While two buses went to Buena Vista, one went to Tree House resort, about 20km from the former. Both the resorts are tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city with policeman guarding the way.

A Congress leader said, “A faction within the Congress is all right but leaving the party and joining the BJP may not be palatable to many MLAs.”

He claimed that they were tricked by the BJP by taking them for a trip and confined them to a resort in Bengaluru.”

“Scindia may get away with a Rajya Sabha seat and a plum post in the Union ministry but what will happen to these MLAs who had to resign from their assembly seats as they do not have the numbers to overcome the anti-defection law. Many of them may not even return to the assembly in the bypoll after this ‘betrayal’ will naturally prevail on them when they vote in the assembly.”

In the meanwhile, the MLAs have been lodged at two a luxury resorts on the outskirt with senior Congress leaders including Mukul Wasnik and Harish Rawat joining them at Buena Vista.

The Congress government in Rajasthan have been playing the role of host very dutifully even during the Maharashtra crisis where the party was able to defeat the machinations of the BJP and forming a coalition government with Shiv Sena. It hopes to repeat the same.

255,['12/03/2020'],"SBI slashes deposit rates to below 6%, lowest since ’04","Mumbai: State Bank of India has cut deposit rates to its lowest level since 2004 and has done away with the minimum balance requirement for all its 44.5 crore savings accounts . The bank also trimmed interest rates on savings deposits by 25 basis points and cut the interest rate on loans by 10 bps (100 bps = 1 percentage point).

Following the reduction in fixed deposit rates, the highest return offered by SBI is 5.9% on deposits above a year. The last time FD rates were below 6% was in August 2004. The bank’s reduction in its marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR) by 10 basis points will bring down home loan rates for those who borrowed before October 2019.

SBI had reintroduced the minimum balance charges in April 2017 after five years of waiving it. The penalty for not maintaining minimum balance was the cause of much heartburn as the fines were levied on those who did not have enough money. In FY18 the bank collected Rs 2,400 crore by way of these charges which caused an uproar as those who were penalised included poor people who had opened accounts after demonetisation. Thereafter SBI revised the charges to Rs 5 to Rs 15 + taxes on non-maintenance of average monthly balances.

“We have been earning Rs 50–60 crore a month on these charges,” said Praveen Kumar Gupta, MD, State Bank of India.

He said that given the dissatisfaction over the charges the bank decided to waive them. The bank has also waived the charges for SMS alerts to customers. “The people who were being hit by these charges were the ones that needed to be financially included. We were not charging this in the past and we felt that these charges were something we could live without,” said Gupta.

On the reduction of the interest rates on savings account above Rs 1 lakh from 3.25% to 3%, Gupta said that a uniform 3% rate makes life easier for everyone.

Meanwhile, the reduction in the MCLR is the 10th consecutive cut in MCLR in FY 2019-20 and applies to the benchmark rate across all tenures. The bank’s one-year MCLR, against which home loans before October 2019 were pegged stands revised to be 7.75% from March 10, 2020. Consequently, EMIs on eligible home loan accounts (linked to MCLR) will get cheaper by around Rs 7 per 1 lakh on a 30-year loan. EMIs on car loans will also be reduced by Rs 5 per 1 lakh on a 7-year loan.

The cut in deposit rates comes on the back of a liquidity surge in the money markets. The crash in crude oil prices and an economic slowdown triggered by the coronavirus has raised hopes of RBI easing monetary policy. As a result, the yield on the benchmark 10-year debt slid as much as 13 basis points to 6.05% on Monday, a level last seen in 2009. SBI has brought its retail term deposit interest rates by 10 bps for ‘1 year & above’ tenor and 50 bps for deposits up to ‘45 days’. Bulk term deposit interest rates are reduced by 15 bps for deposits in ‘180 days & above’ tenors.

HYDERABAD: A road rage incident between a two-wheeler rider and a car driver ended in the death of a person, who intervened in their fight, at Hayathnagar on Tuesday night.

S Paramesh, 30, who intervened in the road rage incident, was allegedly abducted, put in the car by the driver, reportedly in an inebriated state, and driven away. However, a little later, the car was involved in an accident and Paramesh died in Hayathnagar.

Around 8pm on Tuesday, Paramesh and two others were travelling in an auto trolley on Kuntloor road. They came across a fight between a two-wheeler rider and two persons — Satish and Prasad— travelling in a car, Hayathnagar police said.

The trio halted the auto and intervened to stop the fight.

Paramesh and his associate Raju reportedly allowed the two-wheeler rider to leave the place. That annoyed the car occupants, who were already drunk and picked up an argument with Paramesh and Raju, police added. “They dragged Parmesh and Raju into their car and asked them to show where the two-wheeler driver had gone. They thrashed Paramesh inside the car,’’ Hayathnagar inspector K Satish said.

The car driver, who was reportedly driving at high speed, to avoid a head-on collision with another vehicle, veered it to one side and the car overturned. Paramesh suffered severe injuries, while others escaped with injuries, police said.

He was rushed to Osmania Hospital, where he succumbed while undergoing treatment late on Tuesday, Satish said.

Paramesh, who used to work at a door manufacturing company, was a resident of RK Nagar in Hayathnagar. He was heading home when the incident happened.

After the accident, according to police, the accused, both car drivers, fled from the location, abandoning their car.

Based on the car registration details and information provided by Raju, the two were booked under Sections 304 II (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 336 (Act endangering life or personal safety of others), 342 (Punishment for wrongful confinement), 363 ( Punishment for kidnapping) and 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the IPC and taken into custody on Wednesday. As the accused had fled from the location, police claimed that they could not measure their blood alcohol count (BAC).

The state cabinet had recently gave its nod for the development of the port in the government sector.

The state government had already received the Detailed Projected Report (DPR) from Rites consultancy agency which put the project cost at Rs 10,000 crore. Sources said the port project would be taken up in three phases to avoid financial burden on the exchequer. They added that bringing the first phase of the port into operational itself is expected to make the project self-reliant.

Ramayapatnam port is likely to handle massive exports from the granite industry in the district and also tobacco exports from the neighbouring Guntur district. At present, granite and tobacco industries are dependent on Krishnapatnam and Chennai ports.

The state government directed the district administration to set its focus on the acquisition of the land for the port project. The district administration has already readied about 540 acres of land against the total requirement of 3,600 acres and is readying plans to acquire the remaining land in next 3-4 months. “Since majority of the lands are dry lands, farmers were willing to give it up in return for decent compensation. We are negotiating with the farmers to strike the deals,” said a senior official.

The state government has already set up Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to rope in global agencies to take part in the development of the port. Sources said that the government would go for global tenders after securing the environmental clearances from the Centre.

Hearing a PIL by a 12-year-old Ahad Nizam to ban the game, a bench of Acting Chief Justice Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Justice Nitin Borkar was informed by his father, advocate Tanvir, the game has 250 million downloads and that children are exposed to 16 such games.

Government pleader Poornima Kantharia said PUBG is not allowed to be played by any school in the state. “At home, he should have parental control on his own child,” she said.

Advocate Rui Rodrigues, for the ministry of electronics and information technology, said the petitioner has rushed to court without following the procedure for grievance redressal under the I-T Act, 2000. “You may have the procedure but if there are 15-16 such games that have unwanted and unwarranted influence on children, does the government of India have material to show that playing these games has an adverse effect on a child?” the ACJ asked. Nizam submitted there are internet de-addiction institutes in cities such as London and that MCI is a respondent to the PIL. Posting the hearing after three weesk, the judges said in this situation it is better if MCI files its reply.

An intervention plea was also filed by two law students and PUBG players from Nagpur, through advocate Sushil Gaglani, saying a ban will infringe upon their fundamental right to play video games.

Making the announcement, RDA project director Sanjit Rodrigues said that Gaondongrim, Barcem, Latambarcem, and Ozrim have been picked for the ambitious project, which is being undertaken through the National Rural Livelihoods Mission ( NRLM ).

The announcement was made at a function to mark the completion of an immersion study for block and community resource persons, where chief minister Pramod Sawant was also present.

“For long, development has been focused on the towns. Maximum focus has been on the urban areas and the villages have been left behind,” Sawant said.

SHGs have been urged to focus on agriculture, food processing, catering, bee-keeping, groundnut cultivation and other sources which can generate revenue for women.

RDA will fund the purchase of a small cargo vehicle for the Khola farmers’ association so the farmers can immediately transport khola chillies to the local market.

“Forming SHGs is not enough. We can’t stop there. In the second phase of the NRLM we have to convert these groups into business entities. We have picked four villages for this,” Rodrigues said.

Rodrigues also said that duplication of work by government departments should be avoided and instead departments need to collaborate and converge central and state government schemes.

The RDA will also fund the construction of a community kitchen and subsequently obtain Food Safety and Standards Authority of India certification for it. .

Sardinha, while addressing reporters last week, had said that while AAP was the ‘B’ team of the BJP, the NCP was in cahoots with the saffron party.

“I never joined the BJP despite having got many offers to do so. The BJP leaders are good people, but I don’t like the party’s roots,” Alemao said and recounted how his refusal to support the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government led to its collapse by one vote. He reiterated that the NCP’s support to the BJP-led government in Goa was issue-based and “because the chief minister hails from the weaker section.”

268,['12/03/2020'],Viveka murder: AP HC shifts case to CBI,"Vivekananda

Vijayawada: The YS Vivekananda Reddy murder case was transferred to the CBI by AP high court on Wednesday.

Allowing the petitions of Viveka’s wife Sowbhagyamma and daughter Sunitha, Justice U Durga Prasada Rao said that time was essential in any investigation while pointing out that even after nearly one year of the murder, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the state government had failed to make any progress in finding the killers.

While allowing chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy to withdraw his petition seeking CBI probe, the HC dismissed the petitions of TDP functionaries BTech Ravi and Adinarayana Reddy.

The high court further observed that apart from being a prominent politician, Vivekananda Reddy was into real estate and other businesses also. There could have been involvement of persons from other states and CBI was better equipped to investigate it, the HC said.

Vivekananda Reddy was found murdered at his residence on March 15, 2019. Though he was found in a pool of blood with severe injuries, initially it was reported that he had died of cardiac arrest. The incident kicked off a political storm as it had happened ahead of general elections. The YSRC and TDP traded barbs alleging each other responsible for murder.

The state government constituted an SIT to investigate the matter. However, the composition of the SIT was changed thrice, which was questioned by family members. The SIT has examined 1,300 persons, conducted Narco tests on three suspects and arrested three for sabotaging the crime scene by screening the evidence.

Sunitha, in her petition, raised many doubts over the role of 15 persons including some family members who were present at the time of screening of evidence. She also raised doubts on her cousin Jaganmohan Reddy, who had himself moved high court demanding CBI inquiry while in opposition and changed his stance after coming to power.

269,['12/03/2020'],"Telangana: Unaware, panchayat officials employ grey langurs as guards","TimesView While the prompt action taken by the forest department is praiseworthy, strong action must be taken against the people involved behind the illegal trade of these protected species under Schedule-II of the Wildlife (Protection) Act. Wildlife authorities in coordination with activists and the police should immediately arrest people involved in capturing the animal from reserve forests.

KOTHAGUDEM: In an unlikely appointment, a gram panchayat office in Bhadrachalam has stationed three grey langurs to ward off other primates in the area. However, grey langurs are a protected species under Schedule-II of the Wildlife (Protection) Act and capturing them carries a penalty of either a three-year term or a fine of Rs 20,000 or both. After intervention from animal activists and forest department , the langurs were released back into the forest.Keeping in mind that other primates usually steer clear of langur-dominated areas given the latter is very territorial and more aggressive compared to other simian counterparts, the gram panchayat office had kept the langurs to guard the area. “Few people in our office said that they found these langurs somewhere and brought them to the office. They asked me if the langurs would be of any use to me. These langurs only listen to commands of these workers, as they used to train similar species earlier,” said Bhadhrachalam gram panchayat executive officer (EO), C Srinivasa Rao.When asked by TOI if the langurs had been chained to the office with his permission, Rao said: “The people who brought the langurs chained them. They might have brought them after villagers complained about monkey menace. We handed over the langurs to the forest department after I got a call from a woman who guided us and informed the forest officials.”Wildlife activists who raised an alarm about the chained langurs said that they went to rescue the primates after they received photos of a chained mother with her baby on the premises of the gram panchayat office. “A male langur was also seen nearby in a cage when we went to the spot. There were three langurs in captivity of the gram panchayat office,” said Uday Kumar, an animal activist.Members of Earth Quotient, an environmental organisation, have filed a complaint with police asking them to register an FIR. “Following complaints about monkey menace, gram panchayats and municipalities often appear to be buying langurs from illegal traders and poachers. We have both video and photo evidence of this,” said Dr K Shashikala, south India coordinator of Earth Quotient.“Rao spoke to me over the phone. He was trying to justify the incident unaware that this was a crime. WhatsApp evidence has been forwarded to him requesting immediate release of the langur back to its natural habitat. Rao stopped answering my calls since,” Shashikala’s complaint read. An FIR in this case was registered on Wednesday evening.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74583736,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-116645,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/unaware-panchayat-officials-employ-langurs-as-guards/articleshow/74583734.cms

The case is presently under trial and the special court has already recorded the chief examination of the witnesses. For further proceedings in the case, the witnesses wanted to identify the legislator, who is an accused in the case before the judge. The court had asked Akbaruddin Owaisi to appear before the court for the identification purpose.

In 2013, Akbaruddin had allegedly delivered a hate speech in Nizamabad upon which a case was registered by Nizamabad-II Town police and on February 5, 2013, the II-Additional Judicial Magistrate in Nizamabad district granted conditional bail to the accused legislator.

Later, upon the Supreme Court’s direction asking all the state governments to set up special courts for conducting trials against legislators, the hate speech case of Akbar Owaisi was transferred to the special court in Hyderabad.

Replying to question raised by MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy on the Warangal airport, minister of state for civil aviation, Hardeep Puri said: “Ministry has issued a Greenfield Airport Policy for development of greenfield airports across the country. The policy permits statement government or airport company or individual developers to establish a greenfield airport after obtaining site clearance and in-principle approval from Ministry of civil aviation.”

The developer shall make an application before a steering committee for the first stage clearance, known as a site clearance in the prescribed proforma. “We have not received any proposal from the state government or any other airport developer for construction of an airport in Warangal and Mamnoor in Telangana state as per Greenfield Airport Policy,” Hardeep Puri said.

“On request of the government of Telangana, AAI has undertaken preliminary study at the sites identified by the government of Telangana including Warangal,” the Union minister said. Basanthnagar in Peddapalli, Khanapur in Adilabad, Jakranpalli in Nizamabad, Gudibanda in Mahabubnagar and Kothagudem are the other sites identified.

The Mamnoor airport area is spread over 706 acres and has an airstrip from pre-independence era built by Nizam VII in 1930 and was operational till 1981. Khanapur in Adilabad, which was also inspected by the AAI team has already got 369 acres of the aerodrome that was operational during World War 2.

The Mamnoor airport served paper mills and also for the visits of VIPs. The Jakranpalli site, also inspected by AAI, is aimed at serving lakhs of ulf immigrants from Nizamabad region. The Kothagudem site falls under a reserve forest area.

Annual exams for lower classes soon after will require them to come to school just for a few hours a day.In its guidelines for safe operations in schools, Unicef said, “Precautions are necessary to prevent the potential spread of Covid-19 in school settings; however, care must also be taken to avoid stigmatizing students and staff who may have been exposed to the virus. It is important to remember that Covid-19 does not differentiate between borders, ethnicities, disability status, age or gender.

MUMBAI: The state government will close its National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project account with Axis Bank at its Nariman Point branch with immediate effect and open one in State Bank of India ’s Churchgate branch. The move comes a week after the state cabinet decided to close accounts of all departments, state-run corporations and civic bodies in private banks.

“All funds in Axis Bank, approximately Rs 2 crore, will be transferred to SBI. The department of relief and rehabilitation has issued an official order for the purpose,” a senior bureaucrat told TOI on Wednesday.

A week ago, the cabinet took note of Yes Bank’s financial condition. Its founder Rana Kapoor was arrested under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the Reserve Bank of India appointed an administrator. The cabinet then took a decision to withdraw all its funds deposited in private banks and transfer them to nationalized banks. The relief and rehabilitation department is the first to transfer its funds from Axis Bank to SBI. “It was found that civic organizations had deposited huge amounts in Yes Bank ,” said the bureaucrat.

It remains to be seen if the home department, too, transfers its accounts to nationalized banks. “For a prolonged period, salary accounts of most police officials were with Axix Bank. We expect all these accounts to be transferred to nationalized banks in a time-bound manner,” he said.

Apart from this, 15-km mono rail connectivity will also be taken up, and works for 29 km of total 68km outer ring road (ORR) will be launched by June this year. The decisions were taken at a meeting headed by municipal administration minister, KT Rama Rao , along with ministers belonging to erstwhile Warangal district, Errabelli Dayakar Rao and Satyavathi Rathod, with officials on Wednesday.

KTR said the Centre has in-principle agreed to develop Warangal airport at Mamnoor, on the outskirts of the city. Since Warangal is the second-biggest city in Telangana, KTR said all developmental works taken up under Smart City and heritage conservation works should be completed at the earliest.

“All the promises made by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao during his visit to Warangal a few years should be completed on war-footing basis, especially 2BHK houses,” he said. Officials informed that while the government had sanctioned 3,900 houses, 900 houses were completed and ready for inauguration, and 2,200 are under construction. Remaining 800 were not taken up due to local issues, officials informed the minister.

“To make the city clean and improve sanitation works, 1,000 public toilets will be constructed, and four dumping yards will be developed for disposal of waste. Currently there is only one dumping yard at Madikonda on the outskirts of the city,” KTR said.

At a time when the Indian women’s cricket team was slogging away on the pitches Down Under, Telugus all the way in Norway had started preparations for a women’s cricket tournament of their own. “We have already organised two edtions of the Women’s Cricket League and this June, we will be organising the third edition,” said K Tharakesh of the Norway Telugu Association who had migrated from Visakhapatnam.

“There is increasing enthusiasm among women to participate in this tournament year after year. We have already begun preparations (for this year),” said Tharakesh. The toughest part, he says, is the organisation with cricket being a relatively unknown sport in Norway. The organisers have to book the field well in advance and prepare the pitch for cricket.

The organisers even have to arrange the equipment, bats, balls and even the trophies. “From the bat, balls, stumps to medals and trophies we bring everything from Hyderabad in phases. So it takes a lot time to organise the tournament,” says Tharakesh.

Those representing in this tournament are already excited about them. Though many among them have not played cricket before or are not regulars, they take up this tournament with utmost sincerity. “We do have a day or two for practice sessions before the match. The matches are real fun. It is good see that at least for a day we are playing and the men are cheering us on,” said Shalini Hema, one of the cricketers.

But how did the idea of the tournament come about? According to the organisers, while conducting the Telugu Men’s Cricket League, they wanted to involve the women of the community as well. At first, they wanted to organise matches with mixed teams, however, this could not materialise as many families felt that if both husband and wife were at the tournament, there would be no one to take care of the kids. It was then decided to hold a separate tournament for women only.

“In the first two editions, we managed to form only two teams. But the way the tournament is gaining popularity, this year it might even be a triangular or a quadrangular series. These 12-over matches are played with hard tennis ball in this tournament,” said Tharakesh.

Addressing mediapersons on Wednesday, Savio Coutinho of the SCM demanded that stringent action be taken against the contactor involved in the execution of “substandard work” for the construction of the nullah along the Eastern Bypass Road, near Gujarati Samaj School at Aquem.

The SCM had recently stopped the work forcibly after the proportion of the concrete mix was found to be substandard and cube samples taken for strength tests in the laboratory.

“On the completion of seven days, the cube samples were subjected to strength tests at the quality control laboratory of the water resources department at Gogol, Margao,” said Coutinho.

“The cube samples collected in our presence were found to have compression strength of 57.7kg/sqcm and 66.6kg/sqcm, which is far lower than the required strength of 140kg/sqcm for a concrete mix of 1:2:4 proportion. Even the third cube sample fell short of the required strength and achieved a reading of 124.4kg/sqcm,” he said, and demanded the PWD order a probe into all the work being undertaken and that stringent action be taken against the contractor.

Coutinho also urged contractors to refrain from adopting corrupt practices of giving kickbacks to politicians to bag contracts.

“The situation in Goa with respect to public works is going from bad to worse with the percentage cuts getting higher and higher. If this continues, we will soon achieve the distinction of having 100% bills paid for 0% work executed,” he said.

Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game had instructed the officials to speed up the tax collection drive in the city given the approaching March-end. The NMC had set an annual tax collection target of Rs 133 crore — including the current demand of Rs 65 crore and the Rs 68-crore water tax dues of the last financial year. So far, the civic body has collected Rs 50 crore. It is yet to collect Rs 83 crore even though only 19 days are left in the current financial year (2019-20).

“We have intensified our tax collection drive. The municipal commissioner has already directed us to take action against the water tax defaulters ,” said the NMC officials. “We have snapped the connections of over 100 defaulters in the past fortnight. We will continue our drive until the defaulters clear their dues,” they added.

283,['12/03/2020'],RSS man Bandi Sanjay Kumar takes over as BJP chief in Telangana,"BJP MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar

HYDERABAD: BJP’s Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar , known for his strong Hindutva stand, was appointed Telangana state party president on Wednesday. The appointment came four months shy of his 49th birthday. He succeeds K Laxman.

Sanjay belongs to Munnuru Kapu (Backward Class) community, which has a strong presence in north Telangana. Backward Classes constitute 52% of the population in the state, a factor that may have played an important role in his anointment.

Interestingly, in more than 20 years, the 48-year-old leader, a first-time MP, has become the first saffron representative elected outside Hyderabad to take over the mantle of the party in the state.

Though Sanjay is seen as a hardcore Hindutva face, his equations with his senior colleagues in the party and closeness with Union minister G Kishan Reddy worked in his favour, sources said. “RSS wants a strong face which can iron out the anti-CAA, NRC and NPR scenario in Telangana and Sanjay fits the bill,” a senior leader on condition of anonymity said. “We can expect fireworks from now on,” he said.

Sanjay, who has risen through the ranks, served in Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the RSS, and was elected to the Lok Sabha in the 2019 general election from Karimnagar after defeating sitting TRS MP B Vinod Kumar.

Party insiders say Sanjay’s strong allegiance with RSS clinched the issue in his favour over strong contenders such as P Muralidhar Rao, DK Aruna, AP Jithender Reddy, Garikapati Mohan Rao and Laxman.

Veteran BJP leader Ch Vidyasagar Rao, a former Maharashtra governor, was the last BJP chief from outside Hyderabad (in undivided Andhra Pradesh) holding the party reins in 1999. He had also represented Karimnagar in Parliament. Laxman (Musheerabad assembly constituency), G Kishan Reddy (Secunderabad LS and Amberpet assembly seat) and Bandaru Dattareya (Secunderabad Lok Sabha MP) have served as the party chiefs. “The leaders who ran the party in Telangana between 2000 and 2020 were either from Hyderabad or united AP,” a party leader pointed out.

Sanjay’s name started doing the rounds only recently, while pollsters were betting big on Laxman getting a second term and Aruna to take on TRS and steer the saffron party to victory in 2023 assembly elections.

During civic polls in January 2019, Sanjay was embroiled in a controversy after he threatened to use bombs and knives on TRS and AIMIM activists if they target BJP workers. He even called TRS and AIMIM “anti-Hindu” for opposing CAA, NRC and NPR.

Meanwhile, party insiders say Sanjay’s appointment did not come as a surprise as his name was first considered for a Union MoS berth after his win in Karimnagar. With Kishan Reddy walking away with an MoS post, Sanjay had always stood an outside chance to get the party chief’s post, they said.

Sanjay will be heading the party for three years. A 20-member state committee of the party would be formed soon, party sources said.

284,['12/03/2020'],"Coronavirus scare in Delhi: No link with chicken, but sales see massive dip","NEW DELHI: While chicken has got nothing to do with the spread of the novel coronavirus , rumours and scaremongering on social media have impacted its sale drastically. Delhi meat merchants’ association has reported a dip of 70% in sale of chicken, while beef and mutton sale has seen a milder impact.Mohammad Arshad Qureshi, president, meat association, said the government’s animal husbandry department has clearly said that chicken consumption was safe. “There is no corelation between Covid-19 and the industry. It is just lack of awareness and basic knowledge about the disease that have caused the dip,” Qureshi said.The association estimated that overall poultry business was running at just 20-30% of what existed before January when information about this new disease started to pour in. “Mutton has seen a decline of just 20%, but it may be a seasonal downturn. Buffalo meat and fish sales have more or less remained the same,” Qureshi added.The impact of the downturn was visible from the wholesale market and the retail shops across the city. Manoj Rajora, who runs a Kacha Jhatka meat shop in southwest Delhi, said the region has seen 70% dip in meat sales. “People say they are taking precautions, but in reality both are not related. How many people can you convince,” he said.In central Delhi’s star chicken shop at Mirdard Colony, the sales reportedly dipped by 50%. Md. Salimuddin, the manager of the shop, said their customers were now reluctant to purchase meat despite it being part of their staple diet. “The rates have seen only a minor dip because we also have to pay the workers,” he argued. Chicken here was selling at Rs 140/kg. Rajora explained that since sales were down, people who reared chicken, also stopped bringing them to market. “The entire supply chain is impacted,” he added.Md Mushtaq, a meat seller in south Delhi’s Munirka, said the area has witnessed a drop in rates by Rs 60-70 in the past two months. “Demand usually goes up around Holi, but sales simply did not pick up this time,” he added. The rates in the high-end market of antibiotic-free meat, however, are still floating around Rs 145/ half kg from the past three months.Senior public health department official from South Delhi Municipal Corporation clarified that the meat consumption was safe and there has been no reported transmission of Covid-19 from chicken. “People seem to be confused between bird flu and the new virus. They should simply eat hygienically processed well-cooked meat,” he added. Meanwhile, DMMA members were busy forwarding the letter from the animal husbandry commissioner to poultry federation of India to counter the misinformation.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74585316,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-195711,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-link-with-chicken-but-sales-see-massive-dip/articleshow/74584462.cms
285,['12/03/2020'],Central govt staff demands CAT bench in city,"Visakhapatnam: Employees of the central government in Andhra Pradesh gathered here to demand the establishment of a Central Administrative Tribunal ( CAT ) bench in AP, specifically in Visakhapatnam, on Wednesday.

Currently, the Hyderabad bench caters to central government employees of both Telugu states. Andhra Pradesh has over 50,000 central government employees (both retired and in service), with over 60 per cent residing in Visakhapatnam.

Y Bhaskar Rao, a member of All Central Government Pensioners’ Association, Visakhapatnam said, “Since maximum number of central government employees (both retired and in service) are based in Visakhapatnam, a CAT is much needed in our city. Else, employees and old or ailing retired personnel have to go all the way to Hyderabad, spend money in lodging and accommodation and it is quite inconvenient for them. Therefore, we have given a representation to the chief medical officer of Central Government Health Scheme to take up our issues with the central government authorities.”

Senior advocate Kuppili Muralidhar and president of Forum of Legal Professionals said, “The CAT bench at Hyderabad consists of a chairman and two members (including a judicial and another administrative member). One of the member’s post is vacant. The chairman is a retired judge of the high court who flies down from Delhi each time there is a hearing. Visakhapatnam is ideally suited to house the AP bench of CAT and can have a new appointed chairman, vice-chairman and members.”

Bedi expressed optimism that the cabinet members will now accept her invitation for collaborative work in making Puducherry a clean, green, prosperous and water-rich Union territory. Excerpts from an interview with Bedi.

Now with the Madras HC bench setting aside a single judge order restraining you from interfering in day-to-day affairs of the elected government and suggesting Raj Nivas and the elected government work in unison, what are the efforts you have planned to undertake?

We hope that when we invite any of the honourable members of cabinet for discussions they shall accept the invite. (Earlier they were regretting by conveying both verbally as well in writing. Saying, ‘they do not need to meet’ or ‘at other places’ or ‘there is no need to meet”.) Also, when we were requesting them to join in on-site they either did not respond, or just excused themselves. We shall look forward to them now accepting the invites. I shall be grateful to them if they join in certain common programs like road safety, water rich Puducherry, green mission, allocation of unused built-up buildings like the World Bank-constructed fish market etc.

What sort of initiatives and efforts do you expect from the council of ministers and elected representatives to work in unison to ensure cordial relationship between Raj Nivas and the elected government?

That they will accept our invites which will help get their viewpoint. Also, the close work environment will speed up decisions on important public issues.

What are the main areas that remain stumbling blocks for cooperation between Raj Nivas and the elected government?

There are no stumbling blocks. The laws and rules are clear. We just have to abide by them. Be it service matters, financial approvals etc. Where consultation is required it is done as per law. The CS is ensuring this most adequately. This judgment will a great relief for bureaucrats.

Post the Madras HC order, do you plan to invite the council of ministers for a meeting to iron out differences once and for all?

I was inviting and I shall continue to invite. I do hope this time they turn up for the meetings... they accept the invite this time and turn up.

The council of ministers has been accusing you of adopting a confrontational approach towards the government. Are you willing to accept the HC suggestion and reach out to the CM to work together?

I have already said that the Raj Nivas was and remains open to HCM. He is always welcome to come and discuss any matter as he feels he needs to. And respect and communicate with a constitutional office as per the laid down protocol and decorum. I request all elected representatives to join me in field visits wherever they can, and let us know how we could be of help to them. As the goal is common ‘Water Rich Puducherry’, ‘Swachh Puducherry’, ‘Green Puducherry’, ‘Financially Prudent Puducherry’, ‘Law Abiding Puducherry’ and most of all a #ProsperousPuducherry.

He isn’t ashamed to hold a broom in public nor to clean roads. A graduate, Syed says he takes only pride in doing his work. He is one of the graduates who was appointed a permanent sanitary worker by the city corporation recently.

“Is there a norm that a literate should not become a sanitary worker and clean the city?” asks Syed, who had completed MBA and worked as a human resource (HR) with a private concern for close to a decade. “In my previous job, I had to work up to 16 to 17 hours a day. I hardly had any time to spend with my family members. I was missing my family terribly and it was stressing me out.” He is a father of an eight-year-old boy.

Syed said the moment he decided to quit the private company, he was determined to settle for nothing less than a government job as he always dreamt of becoming a government servant. The first recruitment advertisement that he came across was that for sanitary workers and he grabbed the chance without any second thoughts. He is happy that he had managed to get the job.

“It is true that I will get much lesser pay than what I used to get with my previous company. But, after taking up this job, I am able to spend quality time with my family and that is what important to me, and not the money or prestige,” Syed said. The corporation has offered him about Rs 17,000 a month, whereas he was earning more than Rs 40,000 earlier.

Like him, 28-year-old Sathyaprabha, who had completed diploma in computer science, has also taken up the job. She has been sweeping the streets of Race Course for the past few days.

She was also determined to take up a government job and had been trying for the same over the past eight years. “After seeing the way the government servants are treated and the respect they earn from the public, I was determined to become a one since my childhood. I may not be perfect at what I am doing right now, but I will manage to shine brighter.” She said the job has also helped her become financially independent.

Arguments before deciding his sentence will be held on March 18. The prosecution examined 12 witnesses in the course of trial and the accused has been held guilty of the crime, public prosecutor Satyawan Raut Dessai said.

Singh, a native of Basuchak village of Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh , is accused of attempting to kill his room mate on the intervening night of November 17 and 18, 2017.

Police records state that the victim, Lalbahadur Singh, then 35 years old, the accused who was 28 years old then and Chhoturam worked as casual labourers on construction sites and were staying in a rented room at Koparwada Curti together.

On the intervening night of November 17 and 18, 2017, Chhoturam went to a colleague’s room for dinner and did not return to his shared room. When he came back to his room, he found Lalbahadur lying unconscious and Anis was missing. He immediately rushed him to Ponda sub-district hospital and also informed his brother Monturam.

Following a complaint from Monturam, presently staying at Deepnagar-Curti, Ponda, police tracked the location of the accused. A team headed by then Ponda PSI Nitin Halarnkar apprehended the accused from Kenjar, a village on the Mangaluru airport road where he was on the look-out for a job, police said.

An offence under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code had been registered against the accused and a chargesheet in this case was filed in 2018.

BHOPAL: With BJP feeling it has a real chance of returning to power after 15 months, the question now is who will be crowned chief minister. Party sources say it’s a tug of war between three-time CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and chief whip in the assembly, Narottam Mishra.

A glimpse of this internal conflict was witnessed during the BJP legislative party meeting on Tuesday evening, when supporters of Chouhan and Mishra confronted each other and engaged in slogan shouting in a show of strength.

Supporters shouted slogans in favour of their respective leaders, and Mishra followers even raised questions on Chouhan’s role during the political crisis in Congress and the state, say sources.

Chouhan, with three terms as CM, is BJP’s most popular leader in MP and an obvious front-runner. Also in the running is Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar , who is close to PM Modi. And Mishra, the blue-eyed boy of Amit Shah, wields considerable clout in the party.

Sources said that Scindia will be offered a ministerial berth in the Modi government — perhaps a prize portfolio like commerce or heavy industries — so there is no chance of his coming to MP. BJP has offered an additional ministerial berth to a minister from among Scindia loyalists now in Bengaluru. And all the breakaway MLAs have been assured to be accommodated in boards, corporations and committees in Madhya Pradesh and the Centre, sources say.

Earlier, it was assumed that Chouhan would be made leader of opposition, replacing Gopal Bhargava. and move a no-confidence motion against the Nath government. But there was no talk on this at Tuesday’s meeting.

On previous occasions, Chouhan had opposed the name of Mishra for the post of LOP after which it went to Bhargava, say sources. Mishra’s name was also proposed for state party chief, but RSS backing propelled V D Sharma to the post. Now, a cold war has erupted between Chouhan and Mishra when they see the party inching towards formation of government. Sources in BJP feel the tussle could come to a nought as the leadership could well spring a surprise — just as it did with VD Sharma, and project a new face.

We had been to New Market. We will continue the raids in other markets too,” said DC (EB) Biswajit Ghosh.The EB officers said they would also be visiting the bigger traders to ascertain if there is indeed any scarcity of mutton. “The jump has been phenomenal and coincides with the festive season. We will talk to chicken traders as well. All the factors — that have been cited for the price hike and most of which date back to November and December when severe winter in north India had led to a spurt in demand — will be verified,” said another officer.Most goats come to Bengal via Patna from Purnea, Champaran and Ara. For chicken, the city mainly depends on Andhra Pradesh.“We visited several shops in the city and found that while wholesale prices are between Rs 620 and Rs 640 per kg, the price hovers between Rs 660 and Rs 700 per kg in retail market. We found that the recent hike is a result of the combined factors of unusually high demand and short supply,” said Ghosh.

HYDERABAD: While ordering immediate demolition of 195 polluting plastic units in Katedan area of Hyderabad, the Telangana high court on Wednesday also asked authorities to take action against officials who turned a blind eye all these years.

“With air and groundwater pollution reaching alarming proportions and the number of cancer and asthma patients on the rise, Hyderabad is all set to attain the dubious distinction of crossing Delhi,” said Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan while hearing a PIL against GHMC, pollution control board and power distribution companies for doing precious little to stop these illegal units from mushrooming.

The bench of Justice Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy said the sooner these units were closed, the better it would be for Hyderabad.

“The deputy commissioner himself filed a false affidavit before us saying that there were only three pollutant plastic industries in the area” said Dr Chauhan. “Later when the high court got the matter verified by member secretary G V Subramanyam of state legal services authority, he said that there were in fact a huge number of illegal plastic industries,” he said.

Later the deputy commissioner filed another affidavit admitting the presence of a huge number of polluting industries.

“Either the state or the polluting industries must pay compensation to the victims of pollution,” the CJ said.

GHMC commissioner Lokesh Kumar along with deputy commissioner D Pradip Kumar was present in the court under orders of court after the PIL filed by Vinay Palnitkar and MA Rasheed was admitted for hearing.

During the hearing, the commissioner made a candid admission that the GHMC did nothing in the last eight years to close these industries even though it concluded in 2012 itself that as many as 195 unauthorised plastic industries deserved to be closed.

“We issued closure notices to all of them and law mandates that they should be given a month’s time to get out of the area,” Lokesh Kumar said in court.

Appreciating the commissioner for admitting GHMC lapses honestly, the HC gave him the green signal to go-ahead with his job of closing down the pollutant industries.

The CJ criticised the PCB for sleeping over the issue for the last eight years.

The bench while posting the case to April 7 for further hearing, directed officials to file affidavits on what they have done in the last eight years in respect of these polluting industries and directed the PCB chairman and GHMC commissioner to be present in the court on that day.

298,['12/03/2020'],Video of ITBP personnel dressed up as bears to scare monkeys goes viral,"Dehradun: A video of two Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) personnel dressed up as black bears and scaring a herd of monkeys in the ITBP camp at Mirthi in Pithoragarh district has been doing the rounds in social media for the past few days.

The video, apparently shot by ITBP personnel, captures two men wearing a bear’s costume and walking towards monkeys in the camp. Seeing the men dressed as bears approaching, the simians can be seen running away from the spot in the video.

ITBP sources told TOI that they devised the idea after the monkey menace in the area became “too much to bear.” A senior ITBP official said, “The monkeys have become a nuisance for all the people living in the area. Our camp has over 1,000 personnel who live with their families and many a times, they have been attacked. In the past, all efforts to scare away monkeys have gone in vain. But the black bear dress has worked wonders for us.”

Elaborating on how the ITBP stumbled on the bear costume idea, commandant of 7th Battalion of ITBP, Anupreet Borkar said they picked it up from social media. “One of our personnel got the idea from social media. The method is very effective and it does not involve animal cruelty.”

An ITBP personnel, who had worn the costume, told TOI that it is easy to make and wear. “We have designed it ourselves and it’s free-size, so anybody can wear it. It is not a real bear hide but is woven with fur.”

He added that the first time he wore it, the monkeys got so scared that they didn’t return the entire day. “So far, the bear costume strategy has worked well and now there is fixed duty of two personnel who take rounds of the campus in shifts wearing the costume.”

Talking to TOI, hospital dean Dr R Balajinathan said the prices of hand sanitizers have gone up in the market as there was a huge demand for the same today. “We can’t spend that much amount on sanitizers. So, I asked the head of pharmacology department to prepare vaporized sanitizer on their own.”

Subsequently, a 10-member pharmacology department team started preparing the sanitizer. “The team prepared the sanitizer in the second week of February and after getting suggestions and feedback from other doctors, the team refined the product, which is much better than the several existing ones in the market,” the dean said.

The key ingredients that the team used to prepare the sanitizer include isopropyl alcohol, glycerol and hydrogen peroxide. “This sanitizer will get vaporized within a few seconds of application as it contains 75 % alcohol,” said Balajinathan.

Pointing out that the hospital requires at least 25-litre sanitizer daily for its staff, he said, “We were spending nearly Rs 30,000 a week on sanitizer. Now, we are just spending Rs 12,000 to produce the quantity required for a week.” The dean said there wasn’t any plan to market the product.

300,['12/03/2020'],"Government safe, say Congress MLAs in Jaipur","CM Kamal Nath speaks with media at his Bhopal residence.

JAIPUR: MLAs supporting the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh, including Independents, reached Jaipur on Wednesday afternoon amid a political crisis triggered by former Guna MP Jyotiraditya Scindia leaving the party and joining BJP. The Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh is facing a severe crisis following the resignation of about 22 MLAs said to be loyal to Scindia.

Congress chief whip in Rajasthan, Mahesh Joshi, tasked with making arrangements for the legislators’ stay, claimed 89 MLAs had arrived in Jaipur. But sources said only 82 MLAs have come here.

“We had hosted Maharashtra MLAs in Jaipur in November last year, prior to government formation there, and the results have been good,” Joshi said, adding that the result of the current crisis in MP will also end up “in favour of Congress”.

The MLAs have been lodged at two resorts, Buena Vasta and Tree House, on the Jaipur-Delhi highway on Jaipur’s outskirts.

The MLAs arrived at Jaipur airport around 2.15 pm on a special flight from Bhopal and were received by CM Ashok Gehlot and other party leaders, including state transport minister Pratap Singh Kachariyawas , party chief whip Mahesh Joshi, deputy chief whip Mahendra Chaudhary, and MLAs Rafeeq Khan and Amin Kagzi.

Senior Congress memebrs, including AICC general secretaries Mukul Wasnik and Harish Rawat , also have reached Jaipur. CM Ashok Gehlot, too, went to Buena Vista resort to hold discussions with the MLAs and senior party members.

At Jaipur airport, the MLAs looked in high spirits and claimed that some of them who had gone to Bengaluru were not Scindia loyalists but had been misguided and would soon return to Congress.

Sajjan Verma, PWD minister in the Kamal Nath-led Congress government in MP, said he would go to Bengaluru and bring the MLAs back to Congress.

The MLAs told reporters there was no threat to the Kamal Nath government and that it would survive. They lashed out at Jyotiraditya Scindia for betraying Congress and joining BJP for selfish ends.

A Congress legislator, Sunil Saraf, said BJP was trying to end democracy by dismantling the party system but would not succeed. “The Kamal Nath government will complete its full term. There is no threat. We all are together,” Saraf said. He said the Congress MLAs who supported Scindia had been “misled and deceived” by BJP.

MP Congress member Kantilal Bhuria, who also came to Jaipur with the MLAs, said, “There is no threat to the government. The state government has the majority.” He added that the MLAs would visit tourist sites in Jaipur.

Congress MLA Harsh Yadav said those who had gone with Scindia would be rejected by the people.

NASHIK: The District Aids Prevention and Control Unit has advocated enhanced screening of people to detect cases of HIV, even though the number of infected has been showing a steady decline.

The panel’s call went out during a meeting held at the district collectorate on Wednesday to review the treatment being provided to HIV positive patients.

Additional district collector Nilesh Sagar asked the units to expand the horizon of screening people to ensure that no one is left out.

“We are seeing a negative growth in the cases of HIV positive patients. We are happy because it is on the decline. We, however, want to further increase the scope of scanning so that more and more people are brought under the umbrella and nobody is left out,” said the additional collector.

As part of this initiative, Doon-based organisation Social Development for Communities (SDC) Foundation is working in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP), which has developed a technology to convert plastic waste into diesel.Scientists at IIP have installed a plant with a capacity to produce 750 litres of diesel. The scientists said that the plant has a per day capacity of one tonne, and with setting up of around 10 plastic banks in the city from which they are getting plastic waste, and more in the pipeline, they are hopeful of producing more fuel from waste in the coming months. The plant had been inaugurated by Union minister of science and technology and earth sciences Harsh Vardhan in August, 2019.During the inauguration of the plant, the union minister had announced that for the purpose of collecting plastic, NGOs would be roped in.In Doon, the task of setting up plastic banks is being propelled by SDC Foundation. “The entire concept of a plastic bank is based on community participation. In this regard, we have met individuals, businessmen, RWA presidents as well as educational and government institutions. The idea has been well received by all, as a result of which, plastic banks have managed to become a reality,” said Anoop Nautiyal, founder, SDC Foundation.So far, SDC has set up 10 plastic banks in the city, from which more than 1200 kilos of plastic have been collected. The plastic collected is of two categories — polypropylene which is handed over to IIP for conversion to fuel, while the second category is called multi-layered plastic (MLP) which is recycled through local recycling channels.“When the concept of plastic bank was discussed with us, we knew at once that there could not be a better means of disposal of plastic generated at our showroom,” said Narendra Batra, director of a two- wheeler dealership in Dehradun.Once the collected plastic reaches IIP, it is kept at the plant for initial round of manual segregation. “Before putting the plastic inside any kind of machinery, it’s mandatory to ensure that there is nothing in the plastic which could possibly damage any equipment. This procedure is also important to segregate multi- layered plastic commonly generated from snacks wrappers etc. Once the process is completed, the plastic is prepared for the next treatment,” said Sanat Kumar, scientist leading the project at IIP.After performing the manual segregation, the plastic is shredded in small pieces which are then left for drying inside an enclosure. The dried plastic pieces are then sent to the main plant.The process of converting plastic into diesel lasts for over 36 hours. After the plastic is converted to diesel, the fuel is sent to the engine testing laboratory for checks.“Since the project is ongoing, we are studying every detail minutely for quality check and making the technology fool-proof. Over a span of one year, the quality of fuel produced at the plant has improved drastically. This can be ascertained from the fact that the diesel produced in the laboratory has emission of less than 10 ppm (parts per million) which is as per the standards of BS-6 fuel emissions. The plant is capable of producing 750 to 800 litres of fuel from 1000 kilograms of plastic, and we are working towards increasing it further,” added Kumar.",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/from-waste-to-fuel-how-doon-is-leading-the-way-in-setting-up-plastic-banks-for-sustainable-management-of-trash/articleshow/74582644.cms

BHOPAL: For all the fanfare with which BJP welcomed Jyotiraditya Scindia into the saffron fold in Delhi on Wednesday, the Maharaj’s entry has ruffled the feathers of BJP leaders who have been fighting against ‘dynasty rule’ all this while.

Scindia, who was so long their prime target, is now in the same camp. Also, the power equation in the Gwalior-Chambal region will now get complicated as Scindia’s stronghold is also the turf of heavyweight BJP leaders Narottam Mishra and Narendra Singh Tomar — both CM hopefuls.

Scindia and tribal leader Harsh Chouhan have been named as BJP candidates for Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh. There was intense lobbying within state BJP for these nominations for the past two months and many are feeling left out.

A little before 2pm, half an hour before Scindia was to join BJP, speculation erupted in political circles that BJP national vice-president and Rajya Sabha member Prabhat Jha has resigned from all posts, miffed by Scindia’s inclusion in the party. Around 4.15pm, Jha clarified through a tweet that no one should doubt his commitment to BJP. “I have nothing to do with these baseless reports. I condemn this mischief,” he tweeted.

“I was in Parliament. I didn’t know about these rumours till I came out of the proceedings. I have only one thing to say, nobody can challenge my morality, authenticity and loyalty to the party,” Jha told TOI over phone. BJP state media in-charge Lokendra Parashar said: “The reports of Prabhat Jha quitting party posts are false, baseless and mischievous.”

Sources said that former BJP minister Jaibhan Singh Pavaiya and some other leaders, who have been fighting to end ‘dynasty rule’, have not uttered the customary ‘welcome’ on Scindia’s joining BJP. Several leaders in Gwalior region are said to be upset over the decision to include Scindia but are keeping quiet, said sources.

Taking a dig at the situation, Congress state media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “What will Scindia do? Shivraj will now be his leader. How will he manage with his opponents like Prabhat Jha, Jaibhan Singh Pavaiya and Kailash Vijayavargiya? Speculations of rebellion in BJP?”

NASHIK: An engineer working with the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited’s ( MSEDCL ) Bhadrakali sub-division was allegedly assaulted by two people whose power supply was cut due to outstanding dues.

A case in this regard has been registered with the Bhadrakali police who have arrested one of the two people even as the prime suspect is missing.

According to complainant Shashank Pendharkar, the assistant engineer was in the office on Wednesday morning when two people approached him. One of them had outstanding dues of Rs 14,360. They created a ruckus in the MSEDCL office as their power connection was snapped.

Pendharkar told police that MSEDCL had earlier sent notices to consumers seeking immediate clearing of dues; however, since it was not done, it was decided that the power supply of defaulters would be disconnected.

However, the duo engaged in a heated argument with the MSEDCL staff and assaulted an engineer, following which he approached the Bhadrakali police station.

The duo has been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including section 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt).

Police said that a manhunt has been launched to nab the other suspect.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

NASHIK: The state government has suspended divisional education officer Nitin Bachchhav for creating fake identities of teachers for state government’s Shalarth programme.

Under the programme, teachers from government and government-aided schools get themselves registered for getting their salary directly into their bank accounts.

School education minister Varsha Gaikwad made this announcement in the state assembly while answering to a query raised by Pachora MLA Kishor Patil.

Patil, while asking about payment of teachers, said he had got number of complaints that teachers of various schools in Nashik division — Nashik, Ahmednagar, Dhule, Jalgaon and Nandurbar — had received fake ‘Shalarth IDs’ which enabled them to receive payment from the state government.

In reply, Gaikwad said she had received information from offices concerned and an FIR has been registered for further action against those on the wrong side of the law. “Acting divisional education officer has also been suspended,” she said.

Bachchhav said he would present his case in front of the enquiry officers. “I have nothing to say at this point of time,” he said.

KOLKATA: An old air-conditioned Metro rake faltered inside the tunnel soon after starting from Shyambazar on Wednesday afternoon. Metro services were disrupted for nearly 15 minutes due to the incident that spread panic among passengers. Officials finally reversed the rake and evacuated the panicked passengers at Shyambazar around 3.19pm. The empty rake started towards Kavi Subhash and also carried passengers from the Central station as no other defect was found.

“The incident occurred around 3.03pm soon after the Kavi Subhash-bound rake had left Shyambazar station. Initially, there was brake-binding and then it refused to withdraw power from the third rail. When the rake stopped, one-and-a-half coaches were still at the Shyambazar platform and the driving motorman immediately instructed the conducting motorman (the one at the rear of the train) to run it towards Shyambazar. Passengers were evacuated as soon as the rake reached Shyambazar,” said Metro Railway CPRO Indrani Banerjee.

While Metro Railway started operating the new AC rakes arriving from ICF, Chennai, it is still stuck with some older ones. Metro has now started running over 75% AC services and the older rakes are also being used. This has resulted in some technical glitches over the last few months.

Raje shared the same picture on Twitter to welcome her nephew to BJP, the party which had her mother Vijaya Raje Scindia, the then head of the Scindia family, as one of the founding members. With Jyotiraditya Scindia joining BJP, this is first time since 1977 when the entire Scindia clan is together in one party. While daughters Vasundhara and Yashodhara Raje had followed in the footsteps of mother Vijaya Raje Scindia, son Madhavrao had joined Congress.

Although Madhavrao had first become Lok Sabha MP from Guna as a Jansangh candidate in 1971, he contested the 1977 elections as an independent and never returned to the saffron-fold, not even even when he rebelled against Congress in 1996 after being denied ticket in the wake of Jain Hawala case. Jubilation in the Scindia family was visible after Jyotiraditya’s entry into BJP.

“If Rajmata Sahab was here today, she would be elated to see you put the nation first. I admire your strength of character and courage. It’s good to be on the same team. Welcome to BJP,” said Vasundhara Raje.

Yashodhara, a BJP MLA in Madhya Pradesh, said differences within the family are over as she tweeted: “Descendant of Rajmata has taken a decision on the national interest. We shall work together for the nation-building ... all differences are over now. We welcome Jyotiraditya to the party (sic).”

Jyotiraditya joining also brought to fore contributions of Vijaya Raje Scindia, who played a pivotal role in the political journey of Jansangh and later BJP. BJP president JP Nadda recalled how she had contributed to the party since it’s “shaishav” (infancy) days. The Scindia matriarch had retained her faith in the saffron organisation even after pressure was on her to join Congress during the Emergency and preferred going to jail.

Former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, said, “It's a joyous day for BJP and me personally. Today, I remember Rajmata Scindia ji. Jyotiraditya Scindia has become a member of BJP family. Yashodhara ji is here with us. Entire family is with BJP. They have a tradition where politics is a medium to serve the people.”

311,['12/03/2020'],Dist sees increase in forest cover over past two years,"Coimbatore: The forest cover in the district has increased by 9 sq km in a span of two years, said additional principal chief conservator of forests Debasish Jana.

He said compared to the forest survey of India’s report in 2017, the 2019 report showed that forest cover in Tamil Nadu has increased by 83sqkm. In Coimbatore, it has increased by 9s qkm.

He said, “If tree growers and farmers continued at the same rate, we could reach our national target of achieving 33.3% forest cover by 2030.”

Jana was speaking at the inauguration of day two of the tree growers mela organized by city-based Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding on Wednesday. Speaking about the country and state’s target of achieving 33.3% forest cover by 2030, he said the most recent forest survey report in Tamil Nadu showed a forest cover of 23.9%. “But we are seeing a definite increase if we compare the 2017 and 2019 reports. The credit for this goes to the tree growers and IFGTB which produces quality planting material for mass scale plantations,” Jana said.

Jana admitted that they were practical difficulties in mass scale plantation of trees, because agricultural land or fertile land can’t be used for this purpose as it would create food production issue.

He said multiple institutions including TNAU and IFGTB were working on creating WhatsApp groups for tree growers.

“They will upload videos on how to prune a teak tree, because if you prune it wrong, the tree gets injured, knots will form, and you won’t get good prices in the market. The group is also expected to update details like market price for the quarter, deweeding technologies, soil working ideas etc.,” he said.

He also advised farmers in the region who are eager to cultivate sandal, because of its high monetary value, to first check if they have resources to set up a security system for the trees to ensure it does not get smuggled off. “It is also important to check if they have the right condition to cultivate sandalwood, because the real value and money is in the tree’s heartwood. The outside sap is not that valuable,” he said.

Farmers were also encouraged to get into tree farming because it acts as an insurance against sudden crop price falls or even natural disasters. “These trees are like an insurance policy and can be used for your child’s education,” he said.

“We want farmers to give us feedback on our varieties or even varieties they are growing, to tell us the issues they face, so that we can research ways to solve it,” IFGTB director S Murugesan said.

The sound of wails and cries were heard on Wednesday as the coffin carrying her mortal remains reached her home on Taki Road at Barasat’s Kalikapur.

Her only son Raja, also seriously injured in the accident that was reportedly triggered by a landslide, accompanied his mother’s body. A pall of gloom descended on the neighbourhood since Tuesday evening after the news of Saha’s death was circulated in the neighbourhood.

The SUV involved with the accident was carrying 11 tourists, including Jharna, Raja (32) and their shop worker Subrata Das (28), who was also injured.

The Saha family owns a ready-made garment shop in Kalikapur. After Jharna’s husband Montu Saha died two years ago, she used to run the shop with her son. The three had set out for Sikkim with 16 others, including some kin, on March 5.

“We had hired two SUVs for a trip to Peling from Jhilok on Tuesday afternoon. While our SUV was passing by Lingtam Hill near Rongpo, the vehicle was caught in a landslide. Boulders crashing down the hill landed on our SUV, after which it fell into a nearly 100 feet gorge. We cried out in horror. Most of us almost fell unconscious. My mother was sitting in the middle row along with Rishipriya Ghosh (13), my relative who lived in Manicktala. Both my mother and Rishipriya died. When I regained consciousness, I found myself on a hospital bed near Rongpo,” said Raja as he broke down.

The body of Rishipriya arrived at her Maniktala residence. Her school friends and relatives bade a tearful adieu to her.

BHOPAL: When Congress on Wednesday morning claimed that 13 of the 19 Scindia faction MLAs who are in Bengaluru ‘want to return to the party’, his supporters released a series of video statements to say they are loyal to ‘Maharaj’.

They also claimed that they are 22 in number and will “follow their leader wherever he goes”. Minister Imarti Devi, an ardent supporter of Scindia, said, “There are 22 of us in Bengaluru and all of us came here willingly and with the blessings of Jyotiraditya Scindia . Maharaj has taken the right decision to keep us here. If we need to jump into a well, we will. But will follow Scindia wherever he goes. Imarti will be there beside him.”

Another minister, Pradyumn Singh Tomar, said: “You know the present political situation. Why did we choose to go with Shrimant (a title to address members of the Gwalior royal family)?”

Tomar argued that Scindia wants development of Gwalior-Chambal region. “He stood with every poor person. Just think how many of us have been picked from the streets and brought to this position. It is our responsibility that development takes place. Since there has been no development, he took this step and we stand with him for the people,” Tomar said.

Imarti, a three-time MLA, claimed Scindia was sidelined “so much by Congress that it was worse than BJP rule”. “Kamal Nath did not listen to us,” she alleged.

In another video, Manoj Choudhary, Congress MLA from Haatpipaliya, asked: “Why did they behave this way with Maharaja? We remain with him and will continue to be so.”

Another minister, Mahendra Singh Sisodia, said: “Jyotiraditya Scindia has not betrayed Congress. He has been betrayed by Congress and Kamal Nath. Despite knowing that Scindia’s hard work brought Congress to power after 15 years, he has been ignored, along with his supporters. They keep saying there is no money and yet Rs 12,000 crore of development work get sanctioned for Chhindwara. Are other ministers and MLAs not to be considered for developmental work in their constituencies? What happened to the promise of farm loan waiver in 10 days? What happened to the promise of stopping corruption and exposing Vyapam scam?” tnn

Fortunately, there were no commuters at that time. Authorities of the Hooghly River Jalpath Paribohon Samabay Samity — that maintains the jetty and runs a launch service connecting different jetties on either banks of the river — had issued a warning about the impending high tide and ensured commuters remained off the gangway.

After the gangway collapsed, launch service between Babughat and Shibpur were suspended for the rest of the day. A samity spokesperson said: “Engineers examined the gangway. It will take three to four weeks to repair and restore the gangway”.

317,['12/03/2020'],Work on Zuari bridge at faster pace than Cortalim diversion,"Panaji: For a year locals squabbled while state officials struggled to build consensus on the new 2.5km service road at Cortalim to facilitate work on the new eight-lane Zuari bridge. During this period, work on the bridge at the Cortalim stretch has already progressed and there may be no need for the road, work on which has commenced recently. Work on the service road was to begin in January 2019, but was delayed by a year due to a number of obstacles.

When the work was finally initiated, locals at Thane in Cortalim placed a condition on the construction work. They said they feared flooding during the monsoon and demanded that bridge contractor Dilip Buildcon construct minor culverts on the stretch, sources said. Company officials, however, told villagers that concrete pipes would be used instead to ensure that the natural flow of water in the area is not affected.

“The villagers were not in agreement. They said that the road would have to be removed and the land restored before the end of April, which was not possible, as it is too soon after the road is constructed,” sources said.

Meanwhile, Dilip Buildcon had already invested time and effort into levelling the ground in preparation for constructing the road.

“Only the preliminary work on the service road has begun and it would require at least another month to complete it. By the time the road is completed, the monsoon would be here already,” vice-president (constructions) Dilip Buildcon Atul Joshi said.

The service road was designed to lead from the Cortalim junction to RK Marbles in Thane. This diversion was a precondition Dilip Buildcon had set for the state to ensure safety of road users while the work on the new Zuari bridge progressed. However, with the service road delayed and the December 2021 deadline for the bridge looming, contractors have already started work on the superstructure.

This means that the service road, which is lying incomplete, and on which work can now be taken up only post monsoon, will be redundant.

The decision to create the service road was taken under former chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s tenure. After many disagreements among then ministers Ramkrishna Dhavalikar and Vijai Sardesai, and a series of inspections, it was agreed to construct the diversion parallel to the railway line, on land leased from Konkan Railway.

But work hit hurdle after hurdle, first because the land had to leased from the Konkan Railway, and then because some locals, who had encroached on the land, objected.

VELLORE: A six-year-old girl student of a private school who reportedly fainted while playing in the school ground during her PET period at Kejalnayakkanpatti near Kandhili in Tirupattur district was declared brought dead at Tirupattur Government Hospital on Tuesday evening.

Charging that the girl was beaten to death by one of her teachers and demanding that the school administration take responsibility for her death, parents and relatives of the girl protested in front of the institution.

A senior police officer said Pachaiyappan, a native of Puliyampatti in Krishnagiri district, along with his wife runs a fast food outlet in Kumbakkonam. His daughter Devadarshini, 6, and son Darshan, 5, were raised by their paternal grandfather Govindhraj at Puliyampatti and studied in Class I and UKG at a private school at Kejalnayakkanpatti.

The school teachers in their statement to police said, “The siblings reached the school in the school van on Tuesday. Devadarshini was in the school playground along with other students for the PET period around 3pm when she fainted. She was immediately rushed to a primary health centre located close to the school and was immediately referred to Tirupattur Government Hospital as her pulse was not stable. At Tirupattur GH, doctors pronounced her dead and the body was shifted to the mortuary for autopsy.”

“In the wee hours of Wednesday, the girl’s parent reached the mortuary and found injury marks on her face. They suspected foul play by the teachers and protested along with their relatives,” the teachers told police.

Speaking to TOI, Ulaganathan, inspector of the Kandhili police station, said, “Demanding arrest of the school correspondent and to seal the school, more than 200 relatives of the girl led by Pachaiyappan picketed the institution and indulged in a road roko on Tirupattur-Krishnagiri road. After police detained school correspondent Nirmala, they withdraw the protest. However, Nirmala in her statement said the injury marks on the girl’s face were sustained when she hit the ground after losing consciousness. She claimed the girl was not manhandled by any of the teachers.” A case under Section 174 of CrPC has been registered and further investigation is on with Nirmala and other teachers of the school, he said.

The director of the institute issued a notification on Monday stating that student intake would be stopped from the academic year 2020-2021. The students say this move would undermine the value of their degrees.

The notification said the ministry of textiles was now contemplating to set up a centre of advanced research on textiles at the institute. “The ministry has also communicated that the new admission 2020-2021 does not seem a viable option. However, the existing batches will continue till they complete their graduation,” it said.

Last month, the students staged a protest for around two weeks by boycotting classes seeking that the institute be affiliated to the Central University of Tamil Nadu (CUTN), so that it would get more funds for research and development. The students had said there was a decision to bring the university under the National Institute of Fashion Technology. They had also complained that the institute lacks laboratory facilities and qualified faculty members.

A protester said following their protest then, the institution’s administration had said they would not be able to get affiliated to CUTN but would function under the ministry of textiles. “We had withdrawn our protest as we thought half of our demands were met. But now they have said the institute would be closed and a research centre would be set up in its place. This would undermine the value of our degrees. We fear we also cannot aspire to get admitted in any other higher education institute of repute,” an undergraduate protester said.

Protesters also said they feared that if the admissions are stopped, the permanent faculty members would be sent away and in their place guest faulty members would be brought in their place, which would affect the quality of academics.

Around 150 students of the institute have been protesting at the campus.

Efforts to reach the institute’s director went in vain. When TOI contacted the institute, it was said the director was in Chennai. Other faculty members were in a meeting at the campus, it was said, but they couldn’t be reached for comment.

More than 450 healthcare professionals, including doctors and nurses, from government medical colleges, the state health department and private hospitals attended the programme. They were taught the basics of the diagnosis of the disease and which patients they should refer for testing and treatment protocols in place.

The programme focused on self-prevention, checking the spread of the infection, diagnosis and treatment. “Since health professionals have to work close with patients, they were told the ways to protect themselves, including wearing masks and washing or sanitizing their hands before and after examining patients,” IMA state secretary Dr A K Ravikumar said. “Patients showing symptoms like fever, cold and cough with a recent travel history from abroad or fever with body pain is the main criteria for testing for the virus,” he added.

Reminding the professionals that anti-viral drugs for the virus are yet to be found, the programme pointed out that treatment is symptomatic for the disease. “If the patient is at the risk of developing pneumonia or some lung infections, we should treat them accordingly.

“I am the prime target for DMK president M K Stalin now. I am told that the DMK would start spreading more false information about me in the coming days,” the minister told reporters in the city. He said the DMK’s IT wing and certain leaders were behind the alleged misinformation campaign against him on social media.

“DMK leader R S Bharathi should stop his derogatory speeches,” he said pointing out that Stalin had not condemned the alleged unpleasant remarks made by the former against the media and the judiciary.

Velumani, however, said the AIADMK government would continue to do the good work. “We have spoken about expansion of VOC Park in the assembly during the demand for grants. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami as well as forest minister Dindigul C Srinivasan have assured support for the project. The government will bring in more welfare projects,” he said.

327,['12/03/2020'],Man accidentally shot dead on hunting expedition in Bicholim,"Keri/Bicholim: A hunt for mouse deer in a forest at Sarvan, Bicholim , went horribly wrong when one man died after he was accidentally shot at by his hunting companion on Tuesday evening.

The incident has also highlighted that trophy hunting and poaching wild animals for their meat, skin, teeth, bones and blood is still rampant in the state.

Bicholim PI Sanjay Dalvi told reporters that when the accused, Anand Gawade, 39, fired at a mouse deer he had spotted in the forests of Vhavati on Tuesday, the shot mistakenly hit his companion, Santosh Govekar, severely injuring him.

Govekar, 55, was rushed to hospital by his relatives where the doctor on duty declared him ‘brought dead’. Gawade was consequently arrested under provisions of the IPC and the Arms Act. He also surrendered his rifle and two bullets to the police.

On Wednesday afternoon, North Goa SP Utkrisht Prasoon and a team of Bicholim police visited the area where Govekar was shot. They recovered his blood-stained shirt and found two bullets in its pocket. A blood sample of the deceased was also sent for testing.

This is not the first time someone has been accidentally killed while on a hunting expedition. Amrut Singh of the Bicholim animal rescue squad told TOI that one other hunting companion had mistakenly been killed under identical circumstances 8-10 years ago.

The forests of Vhavati in Sarvan’s Vathadev, which lie on the left bank of the Bicholim river, are foraging areas for several herbivores such as mouse deer, barking deer and wild boar. Incidence of animals being hunted in this area during the summer is generally high given the growing demand for their meat. Apart from rifles, snares, traps and explosives planted in potatoes are also used to hunt wild animals.

When contacted, North Goa deputy conservator of forests Kuldip Sharma said his staff was working hard to curb poaching. The Keri range forest officer also said forest guards have been patrolling the Sarvan-Karapur area and taking all the necessary steps to tackle poaching. However, despite having an anti-poaching squad in place, the forest department lacks vehicles and trained staff to contain the illegality.

NEW DELHI: One of the death row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya case has sought an FIR against two police constables for alleged physical assault inside Mandoli jail, where he is lodged. The incident, however, is stated to have taken place in July, last year.

Pawan Gupta’s counsel A P Singh filed an application and said the incident took place on July 26, 2019, when the convict was thrashed “very badly on the head and also his entire body with a stick” inside jail number 14 of Central Jail, Mandoli. Singh said that a court issued notice to the jail authorities concerned.

Gupta was beaten up again on July 28, 2019, when he once again received injuries all over his body besides being verbally abused, the application said. “Blood oozed from his head and only after repeated requests and a prolong delay he was sent to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital,” the plea claimed.

It has been contended in the application that when Gupta’s father approached the local police station to lodge an FIR, he was harassed and threatened. And despite representations before various police authorities no action was taken, it added. “Please take legal action as soon as possible,” the application said.

On March 9, another convict, Vinay Sharma, approached the lieutenant governor’s office seeking commutation of his death sentence to life imprisonment.

Sharma, in his petition, described his life behind bars and what he faced during his confinement. The plea also urged the LG to allow Sharma’s lawyer to make oral submission before him.

329,['12/03/2020'],Students protest move to convert textile institute into research centre,"Representative Image

COIMBATORE: Students of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International School of Textiles and Management (SVPITM) in the city have been protesting for the past two days against the move to convert the institute into a research centre.

The director of the institute issued a notification on Monday stating that student intake would be stopped from the academic year 2020-2021. The students say this move would undermine the value of their degrees.

The notification said the ministry of textiles was now contemplating to set up a centre of advanced research on textiles at the institute. “The ministry has also communicated that the new admission 2020-2021 does not seem a viable option. However, the existing batches will continue till they complete their graduation,” it said.

Last month, the students staged a protest for around two weeks by boycotting classes seeking that the institute be affiliated to the Central University of Tamil Nadu (CUTN), so that it would get more funds for research and development. The students had said there was a decision to bring the university under the National Institute of Fashion Technology . They had also complained that the institute lacks laboratory facilities and qualified faculty members.

A protester said following their protest then, the institution’s administration had said they would not be able to get affiliated to CUTN but would function under the ministry of textiles. “We had withdrawn our protest as we thought half of our demands were met. But now they have said the institute would be closed and a research centre would be set up in its place. This would undermine the value of our degrees. We fear we also cannot aspire to get admitted in any other higher education institute of repute,” an undergraduate protester said.

Protesters also said they feared that if the admissions are stopped, the permanent faculty members would be sent away and in their place guest faulty members would be brought in their place, which would affect the quality of academics.

Around 150 students of the institute have been protesting at the campus.

Efforts to reach the institute’s director went in vain. When TOI contacted the institute, it was said the director was in Chennai. Other faculty members were in a meeting at the campus, it was said, but they couldn’t be reached for comment.

330,['12/03/2020'],"Bhopal: For supporters, loyalty to Scindia is above party","Congress MLAs show their resignation letters in Bengaluru on Tuesday

BHOPAL: Political observers believe that chief minister Kamal Nath and senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh despite their sound political acumen failed to gauge the extent of influence Jyotiraditya Scindia exercised on his supporters, which may ultimately proved “fatal” for the incumbent Congress government in MP.

“Nobody, how-so-ever big leader can claim that all his supporters including the ministers and MLAs would quit the party on the issue of his neglect or disrespect. This is difficult more so, if the party is in power, but Scindia pulled it off. It’s here that the party leadership erred and were caught on the wrong foot in denying the “safe” Rajya Sabha seat to him,” said a senior PCC office-bearer on the condition of anonymity.

The question, obviously, is what is the source of Scindia’s enormous charisma among his supporters?

“It is unprecedented. Personal loyalty towards Scindia ahead of commitment to the party is obviously one of the reason, but there is another major factor what I could gather from Scindia supporters had been hinting at neglect by the party and the bureaucracy. In fact, they also had the same grouse as Scindia. They were also feeling marginalised as Scindia did. And, when Scindia decided to take the initiative, they followed suit, said political analyst, Girijashankar.

He recalled that none of the supporters of his father late Madhavrao Scindia except a few little-known names had left the Congress party when he floated his own party after being denied ticket by the Narsimharao’s Congress party in the aftermath of Hawala scandal nor anyone went with Arjun Singh when he launched Tiwari Congress with N D Tiwari about the same time.

Political observer, Jairam Shukla , said “It’s of course unprecedented in MP but I feel by the time budget session of state assembly begins on March 16, at least half of them would be won over by Kamal Nath. As the euphoria ebbs out, the rebel MLAs would also think about their own future.

Shukla also gave example of Gujarat BJP leader, Shankar Singh Vaghela , in this regard and said when he revolted against Keshubhai Patel in 1995, he had support of 105 out of 121 BJP MLAs, but when he decided to send his supporters to Khajuraho, the number reduced to 47 and ultimately a peace formula was brokered and Suresh Mehta was made the CM. “I am not contemplating a peace formula here but no. of Scindia supporters who revolted may come down by half”, he said.

A leader from Chambal region traced loyalty of Scindia supporter MLAs to feudal culture which still dominates Chambal and some other pockets of Madhya Pradesh “MLAs supporting Scindia went with him because they believe that the influence Scindias wield over electorate in Chambal region has a major role in ensuring their win.

A recent communication from the directorate of school education to all chief education officers said it was decided at a meeting held by the commissioner of social welfare to identify an unused classroom at a government high school or higher secondary school per union to be converted into a dining hall for the students who avail the midday meal scheme. It has also sought details of such schools.

“There is no separate dining hall for the midday meal scheme in almost all the government and aided schools. Students find a space inside the school campus to sit and eat,” said a midday meal worker.

She welcomed the move, saying that would help the students have food in a hygienic atmosphere.

“If funds are earmarked for constructing dining halls and kitchens in government and aided schools, such facilities should be set up in all the schools in a few years,” the midday meal worker said.

333,['12/03/2020'],Suspected Maoist held in pre-dawn operation near Anaikatti by TN cops,"Coimbatore: In a pre–dawn operation, the ‘Q’ branch sleuths of the state police nabbed a suspected woman Maoist near Anaikatti at the Tamil Nadu–Kerala border on Wednesday morning.

The suspected Maoist P Srimathi, 27, hailing from a village in Sringeri near Chikkamagalur in Karnataka, along with a woman was picked up by the sleuths from a TNSTC bus based on a tip. The police team rounded up Srimathi when the bus was nearing a check post at Anaikatti around 5.30am. Police sources said that the duo was traveling from Kerala to Karnataka via Coimbatore.

The source said that both Srimathi and the other woman were taken to an undisclosed location for interrogation and were likely to be produced before the court in Coimbatore on Thursday. Police were tightlipped about the identity of the other woman who was detained along with Srimathi.

Police said that Srimathi was a member of Kabani and Bhavani dalams of the Communist Party of India (Maoist). Though there were no cases registered against Srimathi in Tamil Nadu, over 20 cases were registered together in Kerala and Karnataka. She was on the watchlist of Karnataka and Kerala police.

When the Kerala’s anti–Naxal police force Thunderbolt carried out an encounter killing four suspected Maoists in Agali forests of Palakkad district in October last year, word spread that Srimathi was one among them. In fact, a team of Karnataka police even visited Kerala after the encounter, but it turned out that Srimathi was not among them. However, sources said that Srimathi was present along with other cadres when the Thunderbolt team swooped down on them killing four, but she managed to escape.

Since police believed that Srimathi might have sustained bullet injuries during the escape, vigil was mounted in hospitals along the TN–Kerala border on suspicion that she might get admitted for treatment. However, she managed to evade arrest till Wednesday. Soon after she was produced in the court and remanded, the Karnataka cops are expected to seek her custody in connection with the cases there.

This is the second arrest of a prime Maoist suspect in Coimbatore district after Deepak, another Maoist sympathizer who was arrested in November last.

334,['12/03/2020'],Excise raids across state to crack down on arrack sale,"Vijayawada: In the largest-ever joint operation by police and excise officials aimed at curbing illegal liquor trade, raids were conducted across the state on Wednesday. The operation, code named Operation Sura, was led by excise and sand enforcement IG, Vineet Brijlal and was under the direct supervision of DGP D Gautam Sawang.

As many as 759 teams, each with 10 to 15 members from both police and excise departments, raided suspected places where arrack is brewed, belt shops and sale of non-duty paid liquor (NDPL).

The coordinated operation started as early as 5am with respective district in-charges supervising the teams. The enforcement teams seized 1,03,052 litres of jaggery wash, apart from 4,150 litres of illicitly distilled liquor. The raid was conducted in view of the local body elections to curb distribution of liquor to woo voters.

Speaking to TOI, Brijlal said Operation Sura was the largest coordinated operation conducted across the state. “Although the timing of raids is significant in view of local body elections, we would like to sustain the momentum with the synergy between police and excise enforcement wings to ensure that the state becomes arrack-free. The cooperation extended by the DGP, commissioners of police and district SPs was remarkable and we are looking forward to take the enforcement work to the next level,” he said.

While arrack was found in every district except Nellore, which stands out with no case of being booked with regard to it. Although the number of villages raided was second highest after Guntur, Nellore was found to be arrack-free. The district seems to be continuing its legacy where the Anti-Arrack movement took the combined Andhra Pradesh by storm in 90s.

But the raids revealed that Kurnool, East Godavari and Srikakulam accounted for more than 50% of the total jaggery wash destroyed across the state. The arrack menace seemed to dominate in districts with forest cover and borders with other states.

The enforcement officials also seized 1,575kg of dry ganja at Paderu in Visakhapatnam district apart from seizing illicit liquor. Five people were arrested and three vehicles have been impounded.

“For many of us, cancer means death. But, I’m a living example in front of you all. We can defeat cancer at any stage,” she said while sharing her experience of battling cancer.

The actor was diagnosed with high-grade cancer two years back, in 2018. Doctors had told her that she had 30% chances of survival. She decided to take the battle head-on and finally emerged victorious.

Sonali visited Nagpur’s National Cancer Institute (NCI) on March 5 to celebrate the first anniversary of ‘Ayushmati’, a unique initiative of NCI that supports free cancer screening for healthy women above 40 years of age.

In the last one year, 1398 women from Nagpur got themselves screened for three types of cancers in NCI for free.

“We all believe that cancer is not going happen to me. But we need to understand this can happen to anybody. Women feel shy or experience fear even from getting screened for cancer. If you don’t get screened, how will you detect it in the early stage?,” she asked while appreciating the Ayushmati project.

Sonali embraced and advocated the tagline of the National Cancer Institute which is “Freedom from Fear of Cancer”. “I think it is important to spread the message — Early Detection Saves Lives,” she said.

The programme began with the introduction to the National Cancer Institute and its initiatives, especially “Ayushmati”, by Shailesh Joglekar, General Secretary and CEO.

Dr Anand Pathak, medical director, gave an outline about the journey of ‘Ayushmati’ and the data trends observed. He impressed upon the need for cancer screening for women for early detection due to the growing prevalence of cancer among women in India.

Shital Teli-Ugale, Metropolitan Commissioner, NMRDA was the guest of honour.

“A complete household revolves around women and the well-being of women determines the well-being of the family. If we save lives of women through early detection, we are saving the complete household and all the members involved,” she said.

She encouraged women to come forward for early detection and appreciated the efforts taken by National Cancer Institute by conducting “Ayushmati”.

Sonali Bendre, chief guest of the function, expressed how fascinated and shell-shocked she was after visiting the National Cancer Institute as she compared it with other globally located cancer hospitals.

She shared her experience of battling cancer and her denial saying, “How can this happen to me? We all have the believe that this is not going happen to me. But we need to understand this can happen to anybody.”

“Ayushmati” will continue operating for the next year and would invite women who have visited through the past one year for cancer screenings and continue to encourage other women above the age of 40 to get themselves screened.

341,['12/03/2020'],Coimbatore: Hindu Munnani goes back on assurance,"COIMBATORE: Hours after the religious outfits assured the district administration that they would drop all their protest plans for a week, Hindu outfits went back on their word and declared that they would hold a massive rally on Thursday in the wake of the attack on an RSS functionary on Wednesday evening.

“To condemn the Coimbatore police, which failed to control extremism, Hindu Munnani would take out a rally from Anna Statue on Avinashi Road to the district collectorate,’’ Hindu Munnani spokesperson C Dhanabal said. He alleged that the police had failed to prevent the attack on RSS functionary Suryaprakash at Sundarapuram as well as in controlling the anti–social elements.

Earlier in the day, Hindu outfit members who were summoned for a meeting by district collector K Rajamani assured him that they would not hold any protests for a week. They said the protest planned on Wednesday evening condemning the attack on one of their functionary was also being withdrawn.

State president of Hindu Munnani Kadeswara Subramaniam said that they took the decision in the afternoon to withdraw the protest heeding to the directions of the district collector. “But we would organize a massive protest in April if the police department fails to take action against those who had attacked the functionaries of Hindu organizations. The date would be finalized after discussion with party members,” he said.

However, the members held an emergency meeting and decided on the Thursday rally after the attack on Suryaprakash. In the wake of the Hindu Munnani rally, police have started beefing up security further in the city even as steps were on to get them drop the rally.

State president of SDPI Nellai Mubarak alleged that though seven incidents including attacks on party functionaries and stone pelting on vehicles took place, the accused have not been arrested.

The swab samples of the suspected Covid-19 student, who landed from Italy via Chennai, were sent to Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) at SVIMS in Tirupati and NIV, Pune.

While the test in Tirupati showed positive, officials are waiting for confirmation from Pune as the latter is better equipped to diagnose viral infections.

During screening at the Chennai airport, the student tested negative for high temperature. He later developed symptoms of Covid-19 leading to his isolation at government general hospital in Nellore on Monday night. Earlier, he was in home isolation for three days but developed cold and fever.

With a suspected positive case, officials were alerted. Teams at the GGH were also alerted to take additional care in handling the suspected case. Sources said that on average three to five samples are sent to VRDL at SVIMS daily for past one week from various parts of AP.

Meanwhile, the state control room at the office of the director of health and family welfare, however, said so far no positive cases of Covid-19 has been reported in Andhra Pradesh. Of the 48 samples that were sent for examination, 44 tested negative while the results of the remaining four samples are awaited.

344,['12/03/2020'],Coimbatore: New sanitary workers while away time as expectations fall short,"Representative Image

COIMBATORE: While a few women were busy sweeping a road near the city railway junction on Wednesday, a middle-aged woman with a broom in her hand was engrossed in a conversation on her phone. She was one of the candidates recruited as a sanitary worker by the city corporation a few days ago.

“It’s just the third day of her work but officials are really tired of dealing with her,” a corporation official said, when asked about the middle-aged woman. “Officials have been putting huge effort just to make her pick up the broom. Even after that, she neither does her job nor allows others to do their work peacefully.”

She is not the odd one. In the Town Hall area, four of the five workers, who were hired recently, did not turn up for the work after officials informed them on their first day of the work that they would have to sweep the roads, the official said.

“Of the four, only one managed to touch the broom on the first day and clean the roads for an hour. Even she left work crying. They thought that they would be given some office work. They were not ready to touch the brooms,” the official added.

Another official attached to the health wing of the corporation said similar reports were coming up from almost all the wards where new appointees were deployed. “Not all the new appointees are uninterested in work. Some of them are diligent and are already picking up the pace. But, some others are under the impression that they could get some office work by clearing the recruitment conducted for sanitary workers.”

At the time when the temporary sanitary workers are striking, lack of co-operation from some of the new appointees has put other permanent workers and officials under pressure.

A sanitary worker from the Vadavalli area said even before the strike, they were assigned multiple tasks due to less manpower.

“Now after half of the sanitary workers had gone on strike, our work has increased multiple times. Even before we could complete a task, another work is assigned to us and we are working overtime to complete it,” he said. However, we could not conduct door-to-door collection of garbage or clear bins in all the areas, he added.

345,['12/03/2020'],Shiv Sena moves Bombay HC for standing committee chairman repoll,"Representative image

NASHIK: The city unit of the Shiv Sena filed a petition in the Bombay high court, drawing the latter’s attention to the civic administration’s observation that the strength of the party should increase in the standing committee of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC).

The party has requested the court to order a fresh election for the post of the standing committee chairperson.

M L Patil, the civic body’s lawyer, said that he bench of Justice S J Kathawalla and Justice R I Chagla on Wednesday announced to hear the matter again on March 19.

After the mayor announced the appointments of eight new standing committee members on February 24, the state government had stayed the appointment after the Sena complained that BJP had more members in the panel than its strength in the civic body merited. Even the civic administration had stayed the polls, which was supposed to take place on March 3.

However, Jagdish Patil, the BJP group leader in the NMC, moved the high court challenging the state government’s stay order and the decision of the civic administration to stay the poll for the standing committee chairperson.

The state government had also asked civic chief Radhakrishna Game to file a status report about the appropriate representation of each party in the standing committee based on the party’s strength in the House.

In his report, Game had observed that the strength of BJP should be reduced from nine to eight and that of the Sena should increase from four to five. The strength of Congress, MNS and NCP should remain unchanged. These three parties have one member each in the panel.

“In our petition to the high court, we have submitted a copy of Game’s status report. We have requested the court to order the NMC to hold re-election for the post of the standing committee chairman . We are optimistic that the decision would be in our favour,” said senior Sena corporator Ajay Boraste.

COIMBATORE: The state’s minority welfare department has been sanctioned Rs 5 crore to repair and renovate churches that function out of their own buildings. The district administration has called on the churches in its jurisdiction that are more than 10 years old to approach them for the financial assistance for repair and renovation .

A communication from the district administration said the churches have to be functioning from own buildings for more than 10 years to be eligible for the aid. The site on which the church stands should be registered and so should be the church. “It also should not have received any foreign funding for repair and renovation works earlier,” the communication said.

On applying for the assistance, a team that is constituted by the district collector would visit the church to study the building plan and project cost and based on merit recommend the same to the directorate of minority welfare. “The funds will be given in two instalments,” it said.

Those who wish to get the assistance should download the forms from http://www.bcmbcmw.tn.gov.in/ and submit the same at the backward classes and minority welfare department at the district collectorate, the communication said.

COIMBATORE: Even as the government machinery has plunged into action to contain tension sparked by communal elements in Coimbatore, a gang assaulted a member of a Hindu outfit on Wednesday evening.

Two men wearing helmets barged into the shop of Suryaprakash, 28, an RSS functionary, near Sundarapuram in the city outskirts around 6.30pm. The men assaulted Suryaprakash with rods and fled the place within moments in a motorbike. Soon after the attack, Suryaprakash, who sustained injuries on his head and in arms, went to a private hospital for treatment in his friend’s bike as a pillion rider. Police who rushed to the spot and conducted inquiries said they are yet to identify the assailants and the motive.

Incidentally, the attack took place when DGP J K Tripathy who flew down to Coimbatore in the afternoon, was holding a meeting with senior cops in the city on measures to be taken to contain the violent attacks.

On Tuesday night, unidentified men who were travelling on a two-wheeler had hurled stones at the auto of A Sheriff, 32, a resident of Kuniyamuthur, when he was traveling near Puttuvikki road in the city.

Tripathy has instructed the officials to step up vigil in the city and crack down on the anti–social elements sparking tension. He has also told the authorities here to expedite investigation into the assaults and petrol bomb attacks over the past few days and arrest all those behind the incidents.

Earlier in the day, ADGP (law and order) Jayanth Murali held a meeting with city commissioner Sumit Sharan where they discussed ways and means to diffuse the tension and reign on the outfits which are upping the ante every passing day.

District collector K Rajamani for his part held a meeting with Hindu outfit members and asked them to bring normalcy to the city. The collector told the functionaries that communal clash would pull down the growth of Coimbatore at a time when the city is bracing up for massive development.

Rajamani said both the district administration and police department was taking steps to ensure law and order in the city. “Following a few unpleasant incidents that took place in the city, meetings were conducted with outfits and they had assured to extend their full support to us. We have been taking serious steps to bring normalcy in the city,’’ he said.

He warned of stringent action against those who spread fake or hatred messages in social media.

Akimov was found in possession of narcotics worth 4.90 lakh in January 2019 in Siolim . The court stated that the complaint in detail prima facie shows the involvement of the accused.

Police placed on record the seizure report, the house search panchnama, which shows that the raid was conducted in a flat and papers indicating that the investigating officer complied with procedure of sending the report to higher officers.

Akimov was allegedly caught with 30.8g of suspected MDMA, 7.6g of suspected 30 Ecstacy tablets, 0.3g of suspected 20 LSD Papers.

“The substance was sent for examination and was found to be tested positive for the above substances. Hence, charge has to be framed against the accused under Section 22(c) and 22(b) of Narcotics, Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985,” the court stated.

In the second case, Pattison was allegedly found to have cultivated cannabis plant weighing 740g worth Rs 2.45 lakh in the international market, in the compound of his property in Porvorim .

After being sent for chemical examination to Central Forensic Science Laboratory, the report tested positive for Cannabis. The chargesheet papers show that information was received, and sent to higher officers and only thereafter, the police proceeded for the raid.

The court found the investigating officer followed procedure contemplated under Section 57 of the NDPS Act and stated that the material on record is sufficient to frame charge.

“Besides prima facie material, the police has taken photographs of the plant and property where the plant had been grown. All this shows that the accused has committed offence,” Agha stated.

BHOPAL: Amid the political developments in the state, secretariat bore a deserted look on Wednesday. Most of the bureaucrats and staff were not seen at their workplace a day after Holi.

The chief minister’s office on the fifth floor of Vallabh Bhavan—which on weekdays is abuzz with ministers, MLAs and officers turning up—saw no such hustle bustle. Chief minister Kamal Nath ’s OSDs were not seen, except a couple of them. Political activities are being coordinated from CM House at Shyamla Hills in Bhopal, said sources.

A handful of ones who had turned up were seen discussing the fate of the state government. On March 5, the Nath government appointed additional chief secretary M Gopal Reddy as the OSD to the chief secretary’s office.

Offices of additional chief secretaries and principal secretaries were locked since morning. Officials, who are part of the crisis management team of the government, remained hopeful.

“It would not be that easy for BJP”, said an officer, who is part of the crisis management team. MP budget session is set to begin from March 16 and a floor test is expected anytime once thereafter. Kamal Nath took oath as chief minister on December 17, 2018. On December 31, Sudhi Ranjan Mohanty was appointed as chief secretary.

Mohanty is retiring on March 31 and Reddy was set to replace him. It’s normal practice to get the would-be chief secretary to the chief secretary office as OSD in advance so that he gets a hang of the job. If the ruling dispensation changes, it may impact Reddy’s prospects as chief secretary. It may also put on hold policies and schemes floated by Nath government.

352,['12/03/2020'],Red tape holds up proper salaries of Gaganauts,"Isro chairman K Sivan

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: India may be tom-tomming its maiden human spaceflight mission “Gaganyaan”, which is planned for 2022, but is yet to provide the four selected fighter pilots, currently undergoing training in Russia, with the requisite documentation and authorisation due to persisting bureaucratic bottlenecks.

The government sanction letter (GSL) for the four IAF pilots or “astronaut-elects”, who began their 12-month training programme in Russia from February 10, is yet to be signed and issued, said sources on Wednesday.

Incidentally, Isro has also been allocated only Rs 1,200 crore of the Rs 4,257 crore it wanted in the 2020-2021 budget for the Gaganyaan programme. As cleared by the Union cabinet in December 2018, the total cost of Gaganyaan — which envisages sending a crew of astronauts to space and bringing them back safely to earth before India’s 75th Independence Day in 2022 — is pegged at Rs 10,000 crore.

“Without the GSL, the pilots cannot get their proper salaries, allowances and furnished accommodation in Russia under the rules. Nor can their families join them in Russia. As of now, ISRO is making ad hoc payments to them for their sustenance. The bureaucratic lethargy even for a prestigious national mission like Gaganyaan is simply staggering,” said a source.

Sources say there is also some dispute between the finance and external affairs ministries over whether the four pilots should get “consular status” as has been proposed. Isro officials were unavailable for a response despite repeated attempts by TOI.

But a senior IAF officer in Bengaluru said: “Since Isro is the overall implementing agency of the Gaganyaan mission, the department of space had the responsibility of getting the test pilots the required documentation. They have not done it. We’ve been told there has been some issue with the finance department’s clearance, and that they are working on the matter.”

The four Group Captain-rank pilots, all with 20-24 years of service, were selected from an initial pool of about 60 after extensive screening and tests. They are undergoing the planned training programme at the Yuri Gagarin Research & Testing Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC) at Oblast in Russia as part of the pact Isro signed with Glavkosmos, a subsidiary of Russian space agency Roscosmos, in June last year.

Glavkosmos director general Dmitry Loskutov had earlier told TOI that the training will include comprehensive medical and biological training, along with a strict physical regimen. They will also study in detail the systems of the Soyuz manned spaceship.

“They’ll be trained for the eventuality of an abnormal landing of the descent module in various climatic and geographic zones. During the scheduled flights aboard the special Il-76MDK aircraft, they will also be trained to move and operate in weightlessness modes and environment,” he said.

At the end of their training in Russia and India, one or two of the four pilots will finally be selected to circle the earth in India’s first manned spaceflight mission after Isro undertakes two unmanned missions with humanoids. The country is keeping its fingers crossed.

At the time, Covid-19 had mainly affected only northern part of Italy and the Lombardy region. “I had planned to return on March 14, but since Italy went into a complete lockdown since yesterday, I rescheduled my tickets to return on March 10,” Jayabal said.Jayabal said he left the airport and approached multiple hospitals in Rome, both public and private. All the hospitals refused to give a certificate. “According to Italian law, only patients with Covid-19 symptoms can be tested for it. Doctors said they can’t simply test us just because we want to return to our country,” he said.Jayabal said the Indian embassy in Rome knows the Italian law and should inform the Indian government that getting Covid-19 negative certificates for people without symptoms is not possible. “The Indian embassy is impossible to reach, because the hotline does not work.

NEW DELHI: In 12 Delhi University colleges, teachers and non-teaching staff haven’t been paid their salaries for two months now. The funds have apparently been withheld by Delhi government because the colleges haven’t notified their governing bodies , approval for which, they claim, is awaited from the university.

The 12 institutions, fully funded by Delhi government, are Indira Gandhi Institute of Physical Education & Sports Science, Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies, Shaheed Raj Guru College, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College, Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar College, Acharya Narendra Dev College, Bhagini Nivedita College, Keshav Mahavidyalaya, Maharaja Agrasen College, Aditi Mahavidyalaya, Mahirishi Balmiki College of Education and Bhaskaracharya College of Applied Science.

Besides the faculty, salaries and payments to sanitation workers, contractual labourers and other non-teaching staff have also been held up. At DDU College, principal Hem Chand Jain claimed, “It seems we will not be able to pay salaries even from April 1.”

When asked for his response, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia countered that the government-aided colleges had been doing a lot of “illegal work” because “without governing bodies in place the colleges can't function”.

The issue may take time to be thrashed out. Another principal pointed out, “We are yet to get a concrete response from Delhi government on when and how the issue will be resolved.” He, however, revealed they had information that government representatives would meet vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi on March 17 regarding the matter. A DU official confirmed the meeting.

The official also disclosed the possibility of the university’s Executive Council approving the names at its sitting on March 13. EC member Rajesh Jha had this to say: “The VC has not acted as per statuary laws on the governing bodies. Last year, the DU administration did not table the names for the EC’s approval.”

The DU official also accused the AAP government of “flouting norms in selecting some of governing board nominees” and argued that in the pattern of assistance, which is like an MoU between the government and the university, there was no clause saying that government funds wouldn’t be released to an institute that didn’t have a governing board.

Besides the state government, the university administration too is facing flak. Sujit Kumar, commerce teacher at Bhim Rao Ambedkar College, attributed the face-off to “a fight between two political parties”. He said that while Delhi government was wrong in withholding funds, “we believe the DU administration failed in its duties to resolve the problem due to political reasons”.

Kumar backed his view by noting, “If Delhi University had reservation about some of the government nominees, it could have asked for new names. But in some colleges, DU decided to go ahead with truncated governing boards. In some others, it could not even identify university or teacher representatives.”

PUNE: A mob of around 20 young men thrashed two athletes after they objected to wrong-side driving in Pashan.

The incident occurred in Sutarwadi on Monday night. The athletes, Adinath Naik and Jaygovind Yadav, have lodged an FIR with the Chatushrungi police, who registered a non-cognizable offence against the 20 men. The police also registered a non-cognizable offence against Naik and Yadav after one of the men lodged a cross complaint.

Naik told TOI that Yadav and he were riding a scooter towards Pashan from Sutarwadi around 8pm. “Near a school in Sutarwadi, two men on a motorcycle rode at us on the wrong side of the road and Yadav objected,” Naik said. He added the duo took a U-turn, intercepted and abused them.

Yadav tried placating them, Naik said. “One of them picked up a rock and hit me on the back and I picked up a bamboo stick to defend myself,” Naik said, adding, “His accomplice fled the spot and returned with 20 youths.”

The mob immediately set upon the duo. Naik’s left hand was fractured in the incident, while Yadav suffered bruises on his abdomen, hands and back. “Some local residents intervened and rescued us,” Yadav said.

But it didn’t stop there. “Sometime later, the mother of one of the youths came to my house and tried to slap my wife,” Naik said.

Yadav said that they have been staying in the area for a few years. “Naik is practising for a national athletics competition, while I am practising for ultra races. We had a narrow escape. Had anything happened to our ligaments, our careers would have ended,” he said.

“We have registered cross complaints. Our probe is on,” police said.

JAIPUR: The application money for retail liquor shop licences came down to Rs 860 crore for the next financial year compared to the current year when the revenues were higher at Rs 1007 crore.

But a senior official in the excise department said that when the lottery system is conducted for the second consecutive year, the revenues generally go down. Secondly, the slowdown in economy is another reason behind lesser number of applications as it has affected the sentiment of businessmen.

“This year’s lottery revenue is Rs 860.24 crore. Second year lottery held in 2017-18 was Rs 834 crore. According to the trend, this is a better achievement. Also, we cannot ignore the fact that there is an economic slowdown in the country which has also affected the business sentiment,” said the official.

Rajesh Dukia, who puts in applications regularly, said that if the licence period is for two year, it makes a business case for the applicant.

“By the time one settles down to the business, it takes 3-4 months. So, a good part of the year is over. But if the licence is for two years, it provides more time to do business,” said Dukia.

But some in the industry pointed out that the margins are not there now and they are not getting the assured returns of about 20% which is putting off people.

“The new policy announced for 2020-21 is not very investor friendly. That’s why the response is not very encouraging this time,” said Naresh Pareek, treasurer of Raj Liquor Welfare Society.

He said the government should have withdrawn the mandatory increase in sales policy. Secondly, he said the prices have liquor have gone up significantly. “Such an adverse policy will only encourage bottle legging. In neighbouring states, the prices are very low and the government will lose revenues instead of increasing them by raising the rates,” added Pareek.

But the department sources said that they are hopeful of reaching closer to the revenue targets of Rs 12500 crore set internally for the next year. Others said the transparency measures announced in the policy like providing bills and getting details of the liquor through a smart chip could have been a dampener for retail shops who charge extra bucks over the printed rates.

“When they don’t get the mandated government return, they try to recover that from charging extra money over the printed rates. With new measures in place, that practice will have no scope,” said a retailer.

Manohar Krishna Prabhu was missed this year when he informed he would be away in the wake of the coronavirus scare. No one knew then that he would soon succumb to the virus.Prabhu, one of the senior most devotees of the Iskcon order, died in London, bringing a pall of gloom over the ongoing Gour Purnima festivities in both Mayapur and Kolkata. Krishna is the sixth UK national and the first one of Indian origin to have died of Covid-19.Krishna and his family moved to London from Gujarat many years ago and embraced Iskcon about 25 years back. The family was always present in every congregation that the London center organised since its initiation, devotees in city said.Krishna loved to spread the word of Geeta and read the Bhagvatam in every gathering and distributed copies of the Geeta among foreigners, trying his best to explain to them its universality.“He called his annual visits to India his pilgrimage because it gave him an opportunity to visit the Iskcon temples at Vridavan, Kolkata and Mayapur. We couldn’t believe our ears when we read that Prabhu is no more. He was a pillar of our London centre, better known as the Bhaktivedanta Centre at Watford, London,” said Radharaman Das, spokesperson of Iskcon, Kolkata.Interestingly, Bhaktivedanta Manor is an estate that belonged to George Harrison of the Beatles, who donated it to Iskcon after he got interested in Indian spirituality. His son is also in the ICU, and has been affected by the virus it was said. The two got infected by an Italian, who visited them over sales of some equipment.Prabhu was loved by all in both city and Mayapur, because of his affable nature. “He had retired from his business and devoted himself to the service of Iskcon,” Das said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-19-victim-was-iskcon-devotee/articleshow/74584700.cms

The festival, which boasts “70 artistes from 14 countries”, is set to become the state’s first Covid-19 casualty as Rane has asked the CM to act “in public interest and in the interest of the people of Goa”.In his letter, Rane mentioned a circular issued by the government of India on Wednesday which stated that persons coming from 14 identified countries must self-quarantine themselves for 14 days. Thus, he asked Sawant to direct the organisers to postpone the festival till further notice.The festival was to feature artistes from Argentina, Spain, Italy, Vietnam, France, Germany, UK, Spain, Portugal, Georgia, Switzerland, Russia and Japan. Many of these countries are in the throes of the global coronavirus scare Earlier in the day, art and culture minister Govind Gaude was keen that the festival carry on. “The show must go on,” he said.“This is a pre-planned programme so it should go on. Everyone knows about the virus and international airports are thoroughly conducting checks and only then are allowing people to go ahead. It is therefore the responsibility of the health department and the airports authority of India (AAI). Proper care must be taken by each and every one.”While many institutions worldwide cancelled their events in view of the coronavirus scare, the Ketevan organisers were keen to go ahead. Festival director Santiago Lusardi Girelli had said there would be no artists coming from “critical areas”. “We are following Indian government regulations,” he told TOI. “So no artistes from countries like Italy, Iran, China and South Korea will be hosted at the festival.” Girelli said that artistes representing Italy and Spain were “cancelled”. The move comes in the backdrop of the government of India suspending visas and e-visas granted to nationals of France, Germany and Spain.Meanwhile, the festival seemed to have taken some precautions in the wake of the virus. “Volunteers will wear gloves to hand out tickets and keep hand sanitisers at the festival venue for attendees,” the festival’s PR head told TOI earlier on Wednesday. Sources said that some of the artistes have already arrived in Goa, while others are scheduled to arrive. The festival team told TOI that many artistes already have their visas, and are expected to make it for the event.Though Goa has not yet seen a confirmed case of Covid-19, the the fear of the virus spreading at mass gatherings has led to the cancellation of major events across the globe, like Coachella. Even Holi celebrations in Panaji earlier this week received a lukewarm response owing to the fear of any breakout, while the event scheduled in Ponda was cancelled.Rane, meanwhile, said that the AAI is screening international fliers, and that there is no need to panic. However, he appealed to the people to avoid mass gatherings as a precaution.The Ketevan festival is held annually at various venues in Old Goa, including the ruins of St Augustine church, the church of Santa Monica, and St Antony’s Chapel.

Naidu squatted on the highway in protest against the police preventing him from entering the DGP’s office by locking the gates. TDP cadres and CPI state secretary K Ramakrishna joined Naidu’s protest resulting in tension in the area.

Naidu criticized the police for not allowing them to meet the DGP and lodge complaint about the failure of police administration during the run-up to the elections to local bodies.

With Naidu reaching the DGP’s office along with a number of party activists, the police refused entry citing security reasons. Naidu sat on dharna demanding that the DGP should come out and accept their complaint. The TDP activists shouted slogans against the government and chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy.

Naidu said it was unfortunate that the DGP was not willing to see Bonda Umamaheswara Rao and Budha Venkanna who escaped with minor injuries in Macherla. He said YSRC goons and leaders were resorting to violence across the state with the help of the police.

He said that State Election Commission (SEC) should look into the attacks and countermand the elections wherever there is violence. He said the elections to the local bodies were not being held in free and fair atmosphere due to pressure from the chief minister. Meanwhile, the police cordoned off the entire area. Later, additional DGP Ravi Shankar Ayyanar visited Naidu and held discussions with him. He requested Naidu to end the protest. Naidu ended his protest by handing over his complaint to Ayyanar.

BHUBANESWAR: An purported video showing a group of men assaulting a woman in full public view in Old Town area here on Tuesday has gone viral, triggering backlash from citizens. As many targeted the police and state government over worsening law and order situation, Shree Lingaraj police said the motive behind the attack was land dispute and that they had detained two of the attackers, both residents of Old Town area.

In her complaint, the woman alleged that some members of a local community club has usurped a patch of her land near Bindu Sagar. “Their plan is to kill me so that they can take over our entire land. On Tuesday, the club’s members started pelting stones at my house. When I opposed, they assaulted me in public,” said 38-year-old Sabita Sethy.

She also complained that a number of people were seen filming the act on their smartphones, but none volunteered to stop the men from assaulting her.

As the video went viral on social media on Wednesday, people came down heavily on the police for the unsafe atmosphere in the city. “We do not see the fear of police in the eyes of anti-socials. Miscreants are striking at ease,” said Prabodh Mohanty, a social media user.

The alleged assault comes in the backdrop of the daylight attack on a Sikh businessman in Laxmisagar area of the city in January.

Opposition BJP and Congress reacted sharply on the issue. “It is disgraceful and shocking to see miscreants assaulting a woman in public. What could be worse than this? This has put a question mark on the law and order situation,” tweeted senior BJP leader Bhrugu Baxipatra.

State Congress president Niranjan Patnaik also took to twitter to target the police over the worsening law and order situation. “Govt has failed to protect its citizens, especially women & girls. Such violent acts have left people in a state of fear & panic,” Niranjan tweeted.

Police said all those involved in the attack on the woman would be arrested. “On coming to know about the attack on a lady last evening, police contacted the lady & on our initiative a case has been registered at Shree Lingaraj police station. The identity of the accused is known. The attack is over a land dispute. Action under law is being taken,” read a tweet from the DCP’s office.

Uttar Pradesh topped the list with 22,655 fatalities (15% of all road deaths) last year while Rajasthan, Odisha, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Assam also reported a large number of deaths.All states and Union Territories barring Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Manipur have submitted their provisional accidents, fatalities and injuries data of 2019 with the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety. The panel has been compiling quarterly details to monitor the performance of states in curbing fatalities.According to the provisional data, Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttarakhand saw the decade’s highest year-on-year decline in fatalities in 2019. While Delhi reported 227 fewer deaths in 2019 as compared to 2018, Gujarat and Maharashtra registered 696 fewer fatalities. Karnataka reported 673 fewer road deaths followed by Uttarakhand (181).Delhi with 1,433 deaths and Tamil Nadu with 10,317 reported the lowest death tolls in the last decade, a comparative analysis of the details show.The data also indicates the impact of the amended Motor Vehicles Act , which came into force from September 1, on road deaths.The details shared by states and UTs show that between January and September last year, 300 more people had died as compared to the same period in 2018. However, during the last three months (October to December), there were nearly 1,900 fewer deaths and 5,000 fewer injuries in road accidents as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year, which reversed the trend of increase in fatalities.“If the earlier trend had continued after September, we might have ended up registering more fatalities than 2018.

The civic chief will now present the budget to the standing committee on March 16.

NMC secretary and deputy municipal commissioner Rajesh Mohite issued a notification in this regard on Wednesday.

Now, the mayor has convened the general body meeting on March 20. Only one proposal of levying user charge for lifting door-to-door garbage, which was issued by the state government in July 2019, was tabled before the house for discussion.

As per Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, municipal commissioner is supposed to present civic body’s budget by February 15. Mundhe, who joined NMC on January 28, had put many restrictions on the ruling party and also asked officials to prepare his budget mentioning all works. All this delayed the civic chief’s budget.

Following a tussle between the ruling party and municipal commissioner, on March 5 mayor Sandip Joshi had announced special meeting over the issue.

Tension further fuelled in March first week after four Shiv Sena MLAs from Mumbai submitted calling attention motion in ongoing budget session of state legislature demanding dissolution of NMC. The mayor had alleged Mundhe conspired with Sena MLAs to tarnish the image of the city.

Ruling party leader Sandip Jadhav confirmed that the special meeting was cancelled following a requisition from the party. He further explained that the mayor has issued the notification on March 5 to convene the special meeting on March 12 while the municipal commissioner has submitted a letter to standing committee chairman to seek either March 11 or March 12 to present the civic body’s budget.

“The ruling party has decided to cancel the special general body meeting as the commissioner has already sought standing committee’s meeting date for presenting his budget,” said Jadhav. Senior official from the civic administration said that as mayor was out of town, deputy mayor Manish Kothe has sent a letter to NMC’s secretary informing about cancellation of the special meet.

Sources said the ruling party cancelled the special meeting for two reasons — the mayor is out of town and the second reason is suspecting humiliation by the civic chief in the special general body meeting for not responding to the former’s letter to present budget.

Meanwhile, the newly appointed standing committee chairman Vijay Zalke has convened a meeting on March 16 allowing municipal commissioner Mundhe to present his budget.

Unlike other states, the Odisha government is yet to announce closure of schools due to the possible spread of the virus and so many parents are reluctant to send their children to schools.“It is certainly a scary situation. Every day we are seeing reports of the disease spreading fast in India. Many states have announced early closure of schools. In schools, students are bound to come together. It is difficult to expect that they will follow the sanitation guidelines. So I feel it is better to keep my child at home,” said Namita Mandal, mother of two school-going children.While most of the private schools have suspended classes after the end of the final examination, in government schools, exams are scheduled start from this week for Class IX and next week for the rest.Of the total 85 students in a government-run primary school in Unit-4 area, only 37 were present on Wednesday after the school reopened after a break of three days. It was a similar situation in most of the government schools in the city.Parents said, it is high time the government suspends prayers, daily assemblies and group competitions to prevent a large gathering of students. “Though no positive case has been detected in Odisha yet, but as a precaution the government should suspend school prayers and other mass gatherings,” suggested Ramani Ranjan Sahu, a parent.“Officially the classes are not suspended but since students have had a long weekend owing to Holi, the attendance seemed to thin,” said Sonamika Ray, headmaster of Capital High School. “We are taking all measures advised by the government to create awareness among students regarding coronavirus,” she added.On Wednesday, the health and family welfare department has asked school authorities to identify students, teachers or any staff member suffering from cold or flu and showing symptoms of sneezing and coughing and advise them not to come to school.Besides, schools have been asked to keep furniture clean and sanitise items of mass use like doors, windows, computers, cupboards and so on. “All schools must use covered dustbins and make provision for water in toilets.

The facility is not even active in places like the Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park or the Katraj zoo, which attracts a lot of visitors. A section of the water purification plant in the zoo has been converted into Hirkani cell. According to the civic staff working in the zoo, the centre is closed due to lack of maintenance.

The PMC officials said they have set up such cells at different places, including the PMC headquarters, in Shivajinagar .

Rajkumar Jadhav, the zoo director, admitted that the facility is closed. “We have plans to improve the facilities in the zoo and a plan has been approved. We will again set up a Hirkani cell,” he said.

Started in May 2011 by the Nashik district health office, Hirkani Kaksha is a special cell where lactating mothers are taught the importance of breast-feeding. The PMC head office started it in 2016.

NEW DELHI: Soon, your debit/credit card will double up as your Delhi Metro smart card . Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is planning to implement an open loop-based system by early next year that will allow credit or debit cards of any bank to function as a travel smart card.

“Currently, a few metros like Noida Metro Rail Corporation , Kochi Metro and Nagpur Metro have similar facility but they are applicable only for cards issued by a particular bank. DMRC’s system, however, will be able to accept transactions from all banks through the RuPay card issued by them,” a DMRC spokesperson said.

The rail company is planning to implement Open Loop National Common Mobility Card-based RuPay cards issued by all banks. The new system will be first implemented in the high-speed Airport Express Line, which currently operates between New Delhi and Dwarka Sector 21 and is going to be extended up to Dwarka Sector 25.

Currently, Delhi Metro uses ‘closed loop’ tokens and smart cards, while the Airport Express Line also has facility for QR-code based mobile tickets. DMRC plans to implement the new interface through a contractor, which will handle the open loop card and the existing DMRC smart card.

The process of changing from a closed loop system to an open loop will include retrofitting of the EMV reader on existing AFC gates. The next step will be the acceptance of open loop NCMC card-based RuPay card, having store value and trip pass, on the already installed gates having EMV readers, the spokesperson explained.

“The intention is to make the systems interoperable with other public transport fleet in the capital — DTC, DIMTS, Rapid Metro, etc,” he added. The work of implementing the new system on Airport Line is likely to be completed by December 2020.

It was only 24 hours ago that former AP legislative council deputy chairman Satish Reddy resigned from the TDP and the second jolt came to the main opposition party with a senior party leader from Kadapa district switching sides and joining YSRC.

Speaking to reporters after joining YSRC, former minister Rama Subba Reddy hailed YS Jagan as a dynamic leader who had introduced several welfare schemes for the benefit of various sections of people.

He rubbished criticism that he had joined the YSRC out of fear of being targeted by the ruling party and said nobody threatened him and it was his own choice to join the YSRC which was providing good governance in the state.

Launching a counter attack on TDP, the former minister said the party leadership was insecure and had no chance of winning local body or municipal elections in the state, the opposition party is resorting to diversion tactics by accusing the ruling party of abusing power.

‘Children safety paramount’

BENGALURU: With the department of public Instruction (DPI) declaring holidays for students up to grade 5 from Tuesday, some schools have decided to call off exams of higher classes and are also considering declaring holidays in a day or two.The DPI announced the holiday for students up to class 5 in all schools of Bengaluru North , South and Rural educational districts as a precautionary measure against Covid-19. Officials, however, said no decision has been taken on cancelling exams and added that an appropriate order will be issued in this regard once schools reopen.According to several school heads, given the government directive, the final examination scheduled from the second week of March had been cancelled. They have sent emails and SMSs to all parents about the same.Some like Delhi Public School (Bangalore East) and DPS (Bangalore South) announced that they’d be promoting students in classes 1 to 5 based on their performance through the year.Though the department had asked schools to wrap up exams for kids above class 5 by March 23, some institutions planned to declare early holidays for them too.As per circulars sent by some other schools to parents, the managements have taken a call to declare holidays for all classes, cancel examinations or use alternative methods to conduct tests and promote students based on their performance during the year.Susan Barrid, principal of National Centre for Excellence told TOI the institution decided to declare Wednesday as the last working day for all the classes as parents were getting anxious about their children’s safety. The school will put up worksheets for students below grade 6 and descriptive question papers for students in grade 6, 7 and 8 on the Edumerge application instead of the exams. “The answer key will be put up in the evenings (of the examination days) and parents are expected to monitor their kids. We will consider the cumulative of all exams as well to grade the students,” Barrid said.Anuradha Krishnan, principal of Primus Public School said plenty of worried parents are requesting postponement or cancellation of exams even for children in higher grades. “I will be taking a call on this by the end of the week. As the syllabus is complete, we might have to conduct online exams for children’s sense of closure,” she said.Sishu Griha said the annual exam marks for classes 6 and 7 would also be on the basis of the annual average of all tests conducted through the academic year. “We will be sending the annual exam question paper to your registered email address as per the scheduled exam timetable. This is for academic purpose only. However, your child must write it under exam conditions,” the school informed parents. New Horizon Public School announced that the annual exams for grades 6 to 8 scheduled to start on March 12 stand cancelled and students will be promoted on the basis of their year-round performance.The school said they may reopen for the next academic session earlier than the scheduled date.D Shashikumar, general secretary, associated managements of primary and secondary schools (KAMS) said: “As per the Right to Education Act (RTE), there is no provision to fail any student at the primary level.

JAISALMER: The number of camels in Jaisalmer and Barmer districts is declining of late, as many are dying due to skin-related diseases. Although the state government claims to have organised camps to treat the ailing camels and to vaccinate them, cattle rearers claim the measures are not enough to deal with the issue.

The state government has allegedly cut down funds for veterinary medicines and not enough funds have been given to organise camps to treat the camels, due to which the immunisation cannot be done, leading to the camel deaths.

Recently, a team from the Bikaner National Research Centre on Camel visited Jaisalmer and set up a camp for the purpose with a local NGO and vaccinated 555 camels in Lathi area. Cattle rearers are worried about the camel deaths. The animal husbandry department does not have sufficient medicines and funds to provide relief to the ailing camels.

According to the 2011 cattle census, in Jaisalmer, there were 50,000 camels and till now, camps have been organized at two places to treat the camels wherein the animal husbandry department is claiming to have vaccinated 500 camels in each camp. Confirming this, animal husbandry department Dy director Dr Subhash Jangid said that skin diseases among camels have spread in many parts of Jaisalmer and many have died while the department is making all efforts to control the diseases. Camps have been organized at Lathi, Sam, Barhat and Khana villages, where 500 camels have been vaccinated in each camp and the camels have been given medicines.

He accepted that this year, medicines worth Rs 15 lakh have been received for treating the cattle, which is very less and they have written to the government demanding more medicines and funds.

Generally, an additional budget of Rs 10,000 is given for organising camps and for medicines, but this time, the budget was not given. Sumer Singh Bhati, a leading cattle rearer from Jaisalmer, who has around 1,000 camels, is worried and said that this time, around 7% camels have died in Jaisalmer due to the skin ailments and it is very difficult to get the cattle vaccinated. The animal husbandry department is not paying any attention towards the issue and is not organizing any camps in his area, he claimed.

The authorities don’t realise it is impossible to find clinics or doctors as Italy has sounded a red alert for the virus and the entire country is under lockdown. Hospitals are overcrowded and have strictly told us that people without symptoms can’t be tested. We are caught between the devil and deep sea,” the IT student said.According to Karthik, over 50 people are stranded at the Milan airport alone and they can’t even venture out as there is a standing order since Tuesday against people leaving the premises without valid reasons. Violators can be arrested and fined 200 euros, he said.The hunt for the certificate and visit to medical facilities in Italy only render individuals more vulnerable to the virus, he added.The students also claimed that they were advised to call the helpline of the Indian ministry of external affairs, which in turn directed them to contact the Indian embassy or the consulate in Italy. “But when we contacted the embassy, we were told that the new rule (demanding Covid-19 [negative] certificate) is being strictly followed as per government instructions,” said Ashish, who is from Shivamogga and stranded at the Milan airport.Over 75 Indians are stranded in Rome and they include many from Karnataka. “Local Indian authorities have not paid heed to our pleas. We are being turned away from hospitals here as we don’t have any symptoms. Most students have an Indian medical insurance which is not valid here. We want to come home and are ready to be quarantined in our country,” said Madan Gowda, a student stranded at the airport in Rome along with 61 other Indian students since Tuesday evening.In a similar case, many Indian students, including 10 from Karnataka, who boarded an Alitalia flight from Genoa airport in northwestern Italy on Wednesday were allegedly forced out following orders from Indian embassy officials as they lacked Covid-19-negative certificate, sources said. Indian mission authorities in Rome were not available for comment till Wednesday evening.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74585625,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-473518,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/without-testing-negative-students-cant-leave-italy/articleshow/74584526.cms

402,['12/03/2020'],High court criticizes Kerala government for ‘unnecessary’ appeal,"Representative image

KOCHI: The high court has criticized the state government for unnecessarily filing an appeal on a verdict to pay Rs 1.5 lakh as compensation after a woman died following a sterilization surgery, leaving the family chasing justice for 25 years.

Justice Devan Ramachandran criticized the government for filing an appeal (RFA No. 356/2003) in the case over death of Valli T on January 31, 1995 following a laparoscopic sterilization at a primary health centre (PHC) on January 26. Tirur sub court had ordered for paying Rs 1.5 lakh as compensation in June 2003 but the government had filed an appeal, resulting in delaying justice further by 17 years.

Valli’s husband had alleged before court that she died due to negligence and carelessness of the doctors and nurses who were in charge of the surgery and that she was not given adequate postoperative care. While the surgery was conducted by doctor Vasanth R Galgali, the team included doctor Vijaya Gopal, medical officer at PHC, Vettom; Sulochana of JPHN PHC, Pallar; and doctor Girija Bai TP, government hospital, Tirurangadi.

The trial court had found that there was no negligence during the surgery but that Valli was not properly advised about postoperative care by doctor Vijaya Gopal and Sulochana.

The high court said in the judgment that the appeal should have never been filed as the death of Valli is conceded. The fact that the family was made to wait endlessly for more than 25 years is shocking to the conscience of the court, the judgment said. The court pointed out that it is an admitted fact that she underwent the sterilization surgery and that she suffered acutely on account of pain and infection, leading to septicaemia. The compensation awarded by the trial court was justified, the court said while ordering the government to pay the compensation and interest within two months.

BHUBANESWAR: The BJD is all set to get all four of its nominees in Rajya Sabha after the opposition BJP decided not to field its candidate for the election scheduled on March 26.

The four BJD candidates — Subash Singh, Munna Khan, Sujeet Kumar and Mamata Mahanta — filed nomination papers here on Wednesday in presence of party president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik.

Naveen signed as a proposer on the nomination paper of Singh, while several senior ministers and MLAs of the ruling BJD were present on the occasion.

While a candidate requires at least 30 first preference votes to be elected to the Upper House, the BJD has 113 MLAs while BJP has 23 MLAs. With only nine MLAs, the Congress is not in a position to field even a candidate. The lone independent MLA has announced to support BJD nominees in the Rajya Sabha race if there will be an election while another CPM MLA has decided to abstain.

Though BJD has numbers for three candidates, no other parties have absolute majority for the forth candidate.

“Since we don’t have adequate numbers to elect a member to the Rajya Sabha, our party’s state and central leadership decided not to field a candidate in the Rajya Sabha poll,” said leader of opposition Pradipta Kumar Naik.

Though March 13 is the last date for filing of nomination, names of the victorious candidates is likely to be announced after completion of the deadline for withdrawal of the nominations on March 18, said an official source.

The election was necessitated after Anubhav Mohanty, Narendra Swain, Sarojini Hembram of BJD and Ranjib Biswal of Congress vacated the seats. Though Mohanty’s seat fell vacant after he was elected to the Lok Sabha in 2019 elections, tenure of other three leaders will end on April 2.

Naveen recently announced names of BJD candidates for the Rajya Sabha polls, giving emphasis on all the four regions of the state. Singh, a popular trade union leader from the coastal area, had joined the BJD before the 2014 elections. He had recently resigned as the chairperson of the Odisha Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board.

With a total movable and immovable properties worth Rs 83.5 lakh, Singh said, he would continue to raise issues for welfare of the working class and labourers in the country. He has seven cases pending against him.

Khan, who is associated with the BJD since its inception, hails from the southern Odisha. In his affidavit, Khan has mentioned that the value of his movable and immovable properties is Rs 31 lakh and Rs 1.09 crore, respectively.

An alumnus of Oxford and Harvard Universities , Kumar from the western region has movable properties worth Rs 1.10 crore while value of his immovable properties is estimated at Rs 74 lakh. Kumar has also invested in five companies.

Belonging to the Kudumi community (a backward community) from Mayurbhan (north Odisha), Mahanta said she would continue to fight for the causes of rural women. Mahanta has properties worth Rs 8 lakh.

HYDERABAD: A photograph of Rajendra Nagar corporator K Srilatha’s husband holding an AK-47 assault rifle went viral on social media on Wednesday. Police said they are inquiring into the issue.

Rajendra Nagar police said Mahatma, husband of Korani Srilatha, had switched off his mobile phone and became incommunicado. No gunmen were allotted to either the corporator or Mahatma. Police suspect the weapon might belong to the gunman of either an MLA or an MP. “Once we contact him, we can know from where he got the weapon. Depending on the details of the inquiry, we will corroborate with the person to whom the weapon was assigned by the department,’’ Rajendra Nagar inspector G Suresh said.

Police sources said if the weapon was not misused, there might not be any case against Mahatma. In case, if the gunman had given the weapon to Mahatma for taking a photograph, departmental action might be initiated against him based on the instructions of senior officials.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday told the assembly that the number of criminal cases reported in the state has come down significantly during the LDF rule.

The number of cases registered in police stations across the state was 6.85 lakh in 2015. The same has come down to 5.57 lakh in 2018 and it further got reduced to 5.09 lakh in 2019. “There is a significant year-on-year fall in the number of cases. Compared to 2015, the number of cases registered in the state has come down by 1.76 lakh,” the chief minister said. He was replying to a discussion on demands for grants for police, jails, stationary and printing and other administrative services.

Number of serious offences has come down during the last four years. While 2.57 lakh grave offences were reported in 2015, it got reduced to 1.76 lakh in 2019. The conviction rate, as per the latest statistics, was 82.24 %, he said. The chief minister also said the government was committed to induct more women into police force.

At the outset, he declared his decision not to react to the discussions based on the CAG report that put the State Police chief in the dock. “The law would take its own course as far as the CAG report is concerned. I don’t wish to make comments upon something on which is awaiting the scrutiny of the forum competent to look into it,” he said.

In reply to questions raised by opposition members, CM said his government had ordered an inquiry based on the C&AG findings on Vizhinjam project as such allegations had been rife even before the C&AG came out with the report.

Pinarayi Vijayan said it was not the first time that police department has purchased high security vehicles through single tender process. Such purchase decisions were taken in 2003 and 2004, he said.

Bird deaths were reported in the city at Azhoor and Karode panchayats. Three egrets were found dead on a tree on the premises of MLA hostel. The fire force retrieved the carcass and officials with animal husbandry department sent the samples to State Institute for Animal Diseases (SIAD) to identify the cause of death. More than 30 crows were also reported dead at Azhoor and Karode panchayats and samples from these places were also sent to SIAD, Palode.

Officials with animal husbandry department (AHD) said that samples were sent for detailed tests in the wake of bird flu outbreak in Kozhikode where avian influenza was confirmed in domestic poultry, forcing mass culling of birds. “We sent the samples to SIAD as a precautionary measure. The state already has a confirmed case of avian flu in Kozhikode and we have to take precautions,” said an AHD official.

The carcass received at SIAD was in a putrefied state. The district is not known to have reported avian flu in recent times and according to officials there was no need to panic. The SIAD team will do a preliminary investigation and even if avian flu is suspected, it has to be confirmed by the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal. The samples will be tested in Palode on Thursday and in case of suspicion, the samples will be sent to Bhopal for confirmation. As per protocol, NIHSAD will communicate the findings to the Government of India and then a communication will be sent to the chief secretary, following which an official notification will be issued.

AHD officials and veterinarians said that the deaths of egrets and crows during summer many not be a cause of panic and these could be isolated incidents. Extreme heat stress could be one reason for the death of egrets.

Sometimes deaths also happen due to poisoning or bacterial infection, animal disease specialists said. The nature of the influenza virus is such that it has high mutation rates and undergoes frequent genetic reassortment (combination and rearrangement of genetic material) rendering vaccinations ineffective.

The lone preventive mechanism is culling and containment which was what the officials did in Alappuzha in 2014.

The carcasses of egrets also became a topic of discussion in the assembly session, with MLA P C George demanding a probe into the death of egrets.

KOLKATA: Senior Kolkata Police officers on Wednesday said they were awaiting an official notification on a possible internet ban in a few pockets of Kolkata — in south-west, central and north — during Higher Secondary examinations that begins on Thursday. HS Council, however, said a formal decision has been taken on banning internet in five sensitive districts. Sources said West Midnapore, Malda and Murshidabad, along with some pockets in Kolkata, were among the ‘identified’ districts. The move is aimed at curbing papers leaks that had dogged the West Bengal Higher Secondary Council (WBHSC) during last year’s examinations.

WBHSC president Mohua Das on Wednesday said the council had identified and provided details of ‘sensitive’ examination centres to the home department. “Five districts have been identified. However, the number of blocks can’t be divulged since we do not want to alert cheats. Internet service at these places will be suspended during the examination,” she said.

Though she refused to name the places where internet services would be affected on exam days, a few pockets in south-west, central and north Kolkata may experience internet shutdown for a short duration if the home department issues the necessary notification.

The council also urged the West Burdwan DM to track down various WhatsApp groups that were indulging in malpractices with help from coaching centres before exams and called for greater survelliance at these sensitive venues.

Das, on Wednesday, announced severe measures including de-affiliation against schools that do not take adequate precautions against HS aspirants resorting to unfair means during the board exam. “If we identify teaching staff, faculty members or invigilators to have remained a mute spectator during cheating, we shall be forced to take extreme measures,” she said.

As many as 300 metal detectors are being installed at examination venues to have a blanket security cover. Any candidate who is caught with a mobile will be expelled from the examination for the day. “Anyone who is found to have taken pictures of question papers or is found to be a part of the cheating racket, their registration will be cancelled and they can no longer appear in the HS in the future,” said Das. The invigilators and venue supervisors have been instructed to initiate an RA against candidates if they are involved in assaulting invigilators, creating ruckus inside the examination centre or taking away part or full answer scripts without submission.

KORAPUT: At least 23 National Child Labour Project (NCLP) schools in Koraput district have closed down since April last year due to lack of funds.

An official said the schools were run with 100 per cent grant from the Union government and a bridge course of two years was provided to dropout students aged between 9-14, those who were engaged as child labourers in various hazardous and non-hazardous activities.

Each school had an enrolment capacity of 50 students and in 2019 as many as 790 students of the district were moved to the mainstream after clearing the bridge course.

An official source said the scheme was very helpful in getting child labourers of the district back into the mainstream and also arrest the practice of child labour.

“Owing to lack of proper communication between the Union labour ministry and the labour department of the state government, the schools have been closed,” alleged Jeypore MLA Tara Prasad Bahinipati.

The MLA claimed that while it is the duty of the state government to monitor and review the activities of the NCLP schools and subsequently to apprise the Centre, it has not been done at the state level for years.

Also, non-allocation of grants has hit the child labour survey works at panchayat level and as many as 70 staffers, including 30 teachers, working under the NCLP have been pushed to an uncertain future, he alleged.

“The NCLP staffers have not received their salary since October 2018 and are in dire straits. Sincere efforts should be done to ensure that the school are opened in the upcoming academic session,” Bahinipati said.

An official said all related up-to-date documents have been submitted to the NCLP wing of the ministry of labour. “We are in regular touch with the NCLP authorities for the funds. Already, we have lost one year and the survey work is yet to be done. Once, we receive the funds, then the pending dues of the staff will be paid and schools opened,” said Prasanna Kumar Panigrahi , district labour officer, Koraput. The project was launched in 1995.

Revanth Reddy was arrested on March 5 on charges of instructing his associates to use a drone camera to take an aerial view of a farmhouse in Janwada. He was sent to judicial remand till March 18.

Revanth is currently lodged in Cherlapally prison.

Apart from Revanth, Narsingi police had also arrested six of his associates — Praveen Paul Reddy, Vijay Simha Reddy, Jaipal Reddy, Rajesh, Shiva and Om Prakash Reddy — for using drones in violation of government orders to photograph private property.

Following the judicial remand, Revanth’s legal team moved a bail petition, and after the arguments, a court in Kukatpally dismissed the bail petition on Wednesday.

“The prosecution argued that the case is still under investigation and if the bail is granted there is a chance for intimidation of witnesses. The bail petition was dismissed by the court. We are planning to go for an appeal in the higher court,” defence counsel Panduranga Reddy said.

On Wednesday, the Hyderabad police made elaborate security arrangements near the house of the MP at Jubilee Hills, anticipating a huge turn out of supporters, in case he gets a bail.

The police bandobust is still continuing at the MP’s house to prevent any kind of untoward incidents.

The officials said such people should self-report to doctors at Naidu Hospital. Those who have flu-like symptoms, but don’t have a recent history of international travel, can seek treatment from a neighbourhood physician, the officials clarified.“District health officials have directed all private medical practitioners in Pune to refer patients with the history of international travel in the past 28 days and also have flu-like symptoms to Naidu Hospital,” said Sanjay Patil, president of the Indian Medical Association ’s (IMA) Pune branch.“We have been receiving a lot of queries from people from across the city and even those from outside about whether they need to be screened for novel coronavirus infection (Covid-19), as they have flu-like symptoms. People with no history of international travel should not panic. Only symptomatic people, who have recent history of international travel, should report to the hospital to rule out the possibility of contagion,” state surveillance officer Pradip Awate said.Covid-19 and the seasonal flu are similar in many ways. Both are respiratory diseases that spread through the droplets of fluid from the mouth and nose of someone who is infected. Both are contagious, produce similar symptoms and may cause severe symptoms in some.“There has been a sudden rise in cases of viral illnesses following the drop in temperature and also the wide fluctuation in the mercury levels. We have been seeing many patients complaining of cough, cold and fever. Many of them often ask whether it is the Covid-19 infection. We clear their misconceptions and treat people without any recent history of international travel,” senior family physician Prakash Mahajan said.The doctors stated that Covid-19 and seasonal influenza viruses “have a similar disease presentation”. Both viruses are transmitted by contact, droplets and fomites. As a result, the same public health measures, such as hand hygiene and good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue) are important actions all can take to prevent infection.Senior physician K K Aggarwal, president of the Confederation of Medical Associations of Asia and Oceania, said, “To tackle any disease or infection, it is imperative to dispel myths associated with it.

‘Mere ghar aayi ek nanhi pari’ presented by Priya Gupta, followed by ‘Choti si pyaari si aayi koi pari’ by Prasad Kulkarni and ‘Dil hai chotasa, chotisi asha’ by Kishori Ganvir wonderfully brought out emotions experienced by a family when a girl child is born.

‘Phulo ka taro ka’ presented by Sachin Patrange won hearts of the audience as it highlighted the love between a brother and sister.

‘Solah baras ki bali umar’, ‘O hansani’, and ‘Kya khoob lagti ho’ signalled the age when a girl grows up to become a beautiful teenage girl who experiences many emotions for the first time.

Feelings of love were best expressed through songs like ‘Kora kagaz tha yeh man’, ‘Hava ke saath saath’, ‘Lambi judaai’, ‘Aaj unse peheli mulakat’, ‘Phool tumhe bheja hai khat me’, and more.

Songs on marriage, the next important phase in a woman’s life, were well received by the audience. They included ‘Shayad meri shaadi ka khayal’, ‘Priye praneshvari’, ‘Yeh tera ghar yeh mera ghar’, ‘Itna na mujhse pyaar badha’, and a few others.

A total of 31 ambulances in Madurai region have been identified to handle the crisis. Crew in these ambulances are equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) and disinfection kits to handle suspected patients . Madurai regional manager of GVK EMRI R Prasath said that 31 ambulances have been identified from their 289-strong fleet in the 14 districts in Madurai region. The vehicle to handle Covid-19 suspects has been stationed at Madurai airport.

Over the last one week, the number has been increased in such a way that there is at least one in the district headquarters of every district. It is for easy transportation of suspects from the primary health centres and taluk government hospitals to tertiary care hospitals in the district headquarters or in nearby districts. The number of such ambulances has been increased to five in Madurai to make it easy for easy transportation from neighbouring districts to the Government Rajaji Hospital as it is the referral centre for this region.

432,['12/03/2020'],"List action against 1,137 buildings in Besa-Beltarodi: HC","Nagpur: Expressing deep anguish over delay of over a decade in acting against 1 ,137 buildings flouting norms in Besa-Beltarodi area, despite its specific orders in 2010, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday sternly directed the collector to submit a detailed action taken report.

A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote told the collector to provide details of builders involved in the violations and also names of civic officials who failed to act against the illegal structures. While adjourning the hearing for four weeks, the collector was asked to complete formalities before next date.

The directives came while hearing a plea by social activist Anil Wadpalliwar through counsel Shreerang Bhandarkar alleging rampant violations of basic rules and regulations by hundreds of high-rise buildings and townships in Besa-Beltarodi. According to him, even Development Control Regulations (DCR) was not followed and there was massive violation of floor space Index (FSI) by greedy builders.

Earlier, Bhandarkar had filed a civil application citing HC order of January 27, 2010, where the collector was directed to start survey of all buildings and other constructions in Besa-Beltarodi and report on whether those are built as per the norms. He was also directed to examine whether those structures had permission from the competent authority and, if not, to stop their construction. He was further told to issue notices to all such buildings and conduct a thorough inspection, either himself or though an officer not below the rank of a deputy collector. All these directives were issued by then division bench comprising justices Sharad Bobde (now, Chief Justice of India) and Vasanti Naik.

At the same time, the petitioner was allowed to add other areas where the city is growing like Hudkeshwar and Wanadongri, along with Kamptee, Wardha, Koradi and Bhandara Road. Subsequently, the collector constituted a panel of senior officials from his office, who submitted a report to him after inspecting all buildings.

The collector in his affidavit of October 27, 2010, through then government pleader Nitin Sambre (now HC judge) came out with shocking revelation that as many as 1,460 constructions, including high-rise buildings and townships in Besa-Beltarodi, were in complete contravention of rules and regulations due to ignorance of concerned authorities.

In his latest application, Bhandarkar pointed out that no action has been taken till date by the respondents to remove or regulate illegal constructions, which has led to massive problems in the locality. The buildings also pose a big threat to life and security of the residents. While attaching several media report of blatant violations, he contended that none of the authorities had taken care to submit any report for over 10 years since 2010 in HC, and also failed to reply on similar structures in other fast growing areas on city’s outskirts.

433,['12/03/2020'],Corporation seeks people’s proposals for next budget,"Thiruvananthapuram: Carrying forward the participatory budgeting model, which was introduced by the city corporation in 2019, the civic body is collecting proposals from the public for the 2020-21 budget. Public can post their proposals on the official facebook page of mayor K Sreekumar . Proposals will also be received at the main office. The final date for receiving proposals is March 15.

The city corporation has been keen on ensuring public participation in key projects over the last three years starting with choosing wards for smart city project and in preparation of new master plan. Ward level meetings were also convened as part of Clean Killiyaar mission . Recently, the mayor has collected suggestions from city residents to finalize spots for day and night vending zones.

In 2006, Pune municipal corporation had allotted Rs 38 crores through participatory budgeting in wards under civic administration. The civic body had invited suggestions from citizens at ward offices and compiled suggestions on basic infrastructure like roads, electricity, slum development, water supply and drainage.

According to a World Bank report, participatory budgeting (PB) began in 1987 in Porto Alegre, one of the most populated cities in South Brazil. PB is a process through which citizens present their demands and priorities for civic improvement, and influence through discussions and negotiate the budget allocations made by their municipalities. Since 1989, budget allocations for public welfare works in Porto Alegre have been made only after the recommendations of public delegates and approval by the city council.

Public consultation will be a key factor in formulating proposals for the master plan preparation as well. The civic body tentatively scheduled development seminar ahead of the budget on March 14, however in the wake of regulations following Covid-19 outbreak, the seminar will be postponed.

435,['12/03/2020'],Sparks fly in assembly over distribution of flood relief,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The opposition, on Wednesday, locked horns with the government in the assembly over disbursement of financial aid for 2018 and 2019 floods victims.

Seeking leave for adjournment motion, the opposition alleged lapse on the part of the government in the suicide of a Meppadi-native Sunil Chandran, one of the flood-assistance beneficiaries, and also demanded a high-level probe into the involvement of CPM leaders in siphoning off funds meant for flood victims in Ernakulam.

Replying to opposition charges, revenue minister E Chandrasekharan said the government had categorized Sunil Chandran under those who were eligible for flood assistance for 75% to 100% damaged houses, and had disbursed Rs 1,01,900 as the first instalment. But since the account number he had provided was SBI Janapriya account in which only a maximum of Rs 50,000 can be credited at a time, it got rejected. The minister added that the government has taken steps to credit the fund by clearing the technicalities.

He said a probe is under way and a case has been registered against the culprits involved in siphoning off of funds from chief ministers’ distress relief fund (CMDRF). He said the first accused Vishnu Prasad, an official at Ernakulam collectorate, had illegally diverted Rs 10,54,000 to the account of another individual. An SIT has been constituted under assistant commissioner, Kochi, and the probe is under way, the minister said.

Meanwhile, the opposition said the funds were transferred to the account of M M Anwar, who is the husband of Kaulath, who is the director of CPM-controlled Ayyanad service cooperative bank at Thrikkakkara. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala alleged that the government was helping CPM leaders which is why it is not taking any action against the cooperative bank.

The opposition also alleged that siphoning of CMDRF and flood assistance is not just limited to Ernakulam, but there are many such instances across the state that needs to be comprehensively probed. The opposition MLAs later staged a walk-out after speaker P Sreeramakrishnan refused to admit adjournment motion on the basis of explanation from the revenue minister.

MADURAI: About 100 women from Kanyakumari, Arockiapuram, Kovalam, Colachel, Rajakkamangalamthurai and Thoothoor region, who are relatives of fishermen stranded in Iran due to the Covid-19 restrictions, took part in a fast in front of the Nagercoil collectorate on Wednesday pleading for steps to bring them back.

“I am suffering from tuberculosis, diabetes and have pressure but I am fasting here to get the government to repatriate my son from Iran,” said 60-year-old S Arulselvi of Manakudi. She told TOI that her son Saviour Daniston, 32, who has a five-year-old son and a six-week-old daughter who he has not seen so far. “He says they are all afraid. We petitioned the collector last Monday but my son and fellow fishermen are still awaiting help,” she lamented.

The women asked how the government can ignore the fishermen while 58 students and tourists from India have been repatriated. “The Arabian employers are telling our men that India will not come to their rescue and they will have to resume fishing,” says Mehala Reeda, 29, wife of Michael Rajan. “Let them send an aircraft or a ship to bring them all home,” she said.

G Abraham of Makkal Pathai which organised the fast said it has been 2 weeks since the nearly 800 Indian fishermen stranded in Iran raised the issue but the embassy officials have not visited them. “Luckily nobody has been infected so far but they are struggling without food and supplies,” he added. Fishermen Ascar and Robinson, who are among those stranded, said officials from embassy have not contacted them till date.

“We are managing with the available food by reducing our intake. We have asked our employers to provide food and expect it to reach us in a couple of days. We don’t know when swab samples will be collected from us for testing us for Covid-19 and repatriated,” Robinson said.

A decision on the transfer was taken by the cabinet on March 4. Sources said that principal secretary (revenue) V Venu, who had openly taken a stand against the transfer, has decided to go on leave for a month in protest.

In a strongly-worded note to the chief secretary, a copy of which was also marked to the chief minister’s and revenue minister’s offices, he had asked the government to reconsider the decision. He had said that the abrupt transfer of a young IAS officer will not only demotivate him, but also send a negative signal to the IAS officers. He had further said that there are several decisions in the past prescribing the procedures before shifting an officer, such as convening a civil services board (CSB), to ensure stable tenure to officers, which have not been considered while transferring the officer.

Later, the IAS officers’ association also came up with a resolution stating that such frequent transfers are extremely demoralizing and would adversely affect governance. It had also demanded that cadre management of IAS should be streamlined, and due process of CSB should be followed (which will act against removing any officer who has not completed a minimum assured tenure of two years unless without specific reasons) in cases where the officers are transferred within a short period of their posting.

However, the government refused to change its decision and now issued the posting orders of the new survey director, R Girija. An officer from 2014 batch of the IAS, Premkumar was posted as the director of survey and land records few months ago.

HYDERABAD: Members of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) led ‘Chalo Assembly’ protest on Wednesday demanding higher budget allocation for education sector. Dozens of students marched to the assembly around 11am as they tried to lay siege to the complex. Raising ‘we want justice’ slogan, some students attempted to climb the assembly gates, while others sat on the road to protest.

Agitated by reduction of budget allocation for education sector over the years, ABVP members blamed TRS government for neglecting public education.

Vacant vice-chancellor and teacher posts in universities, failure in releasing notification for government jobs, pending fee reimbursement dues and school fee regulation were some of the issues raised by the protesters. “We strongly condemn nominal funding for education in the state budget. The government should immediately establish a female university and resolve other issues,” said Matta Raghvender , a ABVP member.

Nagpur: For 30-year-old Akash Khurade, it’s going to be a tough decision to bury alive more than 9,000 birds in his poultry farm.

“I don’t have any option but to bury them. I feel like committing suicide before doing that,” said Khurade, an MBA. He intends to seek permission from the state government to end his life in case he has to bury the birds.

Khurade started the poultry farm in his native village Lasnapur in Amravati district eight years ago with 1,000 birds. His management skills earned him an identity as one of the leading poultry farms in Vidarbha. But, due to rumours circulating after the coronavirus outbreak, chicken demand has gone down drastically and he is left with no option but to kill the birds.

“Not coronavirus, but rumours associated with it will claim more lives,” he said.

“Ahead of Holi, I had 13,000 birds ready for market. I was expecting at least Rs80 per kg rate as it takes more than Rs74 per kg to feed and vaccinate chickens and grow then to a 2kg bird. Due to low demand, I sold only some 4,000 birds at Rs13 to Rs14 per kg rate,” Khurade said. He is willing to sell off the remaining birds too, but merchants are not approaching him now. Those who approach are offering less than Rs7 per kg, which is less than even two-day feed cost of a bird.

This year, due to baseless rumours that coronavirus is spread through non-vegetarian food, people have stopped eating chicken. Khurade said he has very limited resources and cannot feed these birds for another 2-3 days. Depressed since past three-four days, he blamed news channels for fuelling the rumours.

“Every alternate day, most Marathi news channels run debates on chicken and coronavirus issue. Customers get influenced by these channels,” said Khurade, who runs a farm besides his poultry business. “I have been paying all loan instalments on time till date. Government should think of providing some relief to people like me,” he concluded.

Poultry birds are brought up in such a way that they don’t know how to search for food and will die of starvation if not fed artificially. They can’t live outside the poultry shade and there is also a risk of infection if not looked after properly. Hence, standard way of wiping out a poultry farm is to bury the birds in a pit alive. Many poultry farmers and hatcheries in India are doing this after low demand due to coronavirus rumours.

However, this is devastating for many young and educated youths in Vidarbha who have taken poultry farming as an enterprise. Navneet Darokar has 5,000 birds in Amravati, Madhav Jadhav has 6,000 birds near Nanded, while Aniket Raut has more than 3,000 birds in Yavatmal. As per existing policies, they can take insurance cover for their shades and equipment but birds cannot be insured due to their short life. These are just a few names, said Dr Raja Dudhbale, president of Vidarbha Poultry Farmers’ Association.

“We are trying to create awareness through all possible platforms. But, it’s becoming difficult to convince people day by day. Small poultry farms in Vidarbha are getting buried alive with birds. State government should provide some relief or it will trigger suicide by poultry farmers,” he said.

The screening is a part of the cluster containment strategy the health officials adopted to check the spread of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) in the community.The strategy entails screening of people living within a 3km radius of any housing society where an infected person lives.“The cluster containment strategy is being implemented on Sinhagad Road and also in Manjari Budruk near Hadapsar. The couple and their daughter, who tested positive for the Covid-19 infection, live in a housing society on Sinhagad Road,” a state health official said.“The private cab driver, who ferried the couple and their daughter from Mumbai to Pune, also tested positive for the contagion. He lives in a housing society in Manjari Budruk. We have also started screening people living in and around the society where the cab driver lives,” he said.Agra was the first city in India to implement the strategy after six residents contracted the infection from their relative who had returned from Italy. The five positive cases of Covid-19 in Pune — four travellers and a private cab driver — in two days underscored the need to curb the spread of the virus within the community as well.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Monday called upon states to adopt the cluster containment strategy, making district collectors more accountable, and laid emphasis on contact tracing and strengthening (district) surveillance teams to avoid widespread community transmission.“In the cluster containment approach, we immediately start checking and sensitising every household within the 3km radius of the house of an infected person and also those who have come in contact with the affected to prevent the community spread of the virus.

446,['12/03/2020'],Trust violated lease conditions: Revenue min,"Thiruvananthapuram: The government has decided to resume the 65 cents of land known as Pathrakulam from Sri Vidhyadhiraja Trust , after it was found that the trust had violated several conditions including remitting the land value when it was assigned to it, revenue minister E Chandrasekharan said.

Replying to a submission in this regard by MLA O Rajagopal, the minister said that the revenue secretary had conducted hearing on January 9 and February 25 during which the trust members were heard on the basis of the court order. “The order to resume the land was taken after hearing the trust office bearers, examining all the relevant documents and the high court order in this regard and finding that the trust had violated conditions including the condition to remit the land value, while assigning the land to them,” the minister said.

The land which was assigned to the Vidhyadhiraja Trust in 1976, was resumed by the government in an order on February 29, in which it was said that the land will be protected as government land hereafter. The order had also said that it can be explored if this land can be utilized for mitigating floods in East Fort and Thampanoor areas in the capital, and the specific area within the land where Chattambi Swami temple is located, can be considered for handing over to the Vidhyadhiraja trust.

The trust had again filed a writ petition against the government order and the high court has asked the government to maintain status quo, last week. The minister said the government has followed only legal steps in this matter.

447,['12/03/2020'],"All births, deaths not registered in Bihar: Study","Image used for representatioanl purpose only

PATNA: Even as the registration of birth is mandatory for the people aspiring to avail the benefits of almost all welfare schemes launched both by central and state governments, Bihar lags far behind in ensuring registration of vital elements under the civil registration system (CRS). Only 3/4th of the births and less than half of the deaths are being registered in the state, says a recent study made by Patna University’s Population Research Centre (PRC) in collaboration with UNICEF.

While the level of registration of births and deaths in the country stands at 84.9% and 79.6% respectively, it is only 73.7% and 37.1% respectively in Bihar, the study indicates.

The study made by Jayanta Kumar Basu of UNICEF and Dilip Kumar, B K Pandey and Ajit Kumar of PRC points out that the levels of registration vary substantially from district to district. For example, in 2018, the level of birth registration ranged from as high as 99.1% in Purnia to as low as 44.2% in East Champaran. Similarly, in case of death, the level of registration varies significantly from 51.8% in Munger to 5.5% in Banka.

According to the study, the need and importance of civil registration, particularly that of birth registration, is well perceived by the community. This is despite the fact that not much effort has been put forward by the district authorities in terms of information, education and communication (IEC) inputs. Hoardings on civil registration were once supplied by the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, but the same are not visible anywhere now. Interaction with various stakeholders as well as the community suggests that since birth registration is a requirement for school enrolment, Aadhaar registration, as well as for availing the benefits from schemes like Mukhyamantri Kanya Utthan Yojana, Janani Suraksha Yojana, Dhan Lakshmi Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Matri Vandana Yojana, the people have now become interested towards registering the birth of their children.

The awareness is, however, much lower in case of death registration. It transpired that only if the dependents of the deceased have some vested interests, they feel the need for death registration. This includes claim from life insurance, inheriting the title for land holding, etc.

Then, there are certain myths and misconceptions associated with birth registration as well. In some communities, there is a custom of not giving the name of the child just after birth. But, furnishing the name of the child is a necessary condition for birth certificate. This is a reason why they are not inclined to have the birth of the child registered within 21 days. This holds true also for home deliveries as well as institutional deliveries from private facilities.

The study suggests that for augmenting the process of registration, the monitoring role of the state, district and sub-district functionaries needs further strengthening with particular focus on quality of data collected and their use in decision making. Despite the fact that the state-wise targets for civil registration are set by the Registrar General of India, the targets set for the district and the sub-district level need to be worked out based on some scientific methodology. Aspects of migration, live births reported by the health management information system, etc may be taken into consideration, the study adds.

PRC joint director Dilip Kumar observes that registration of birth is a fundamental right of every child and is the first step towards establishing his or her legal identity. There is no denial of the fact that the information on vital events (birth and death) is not only essential for socioeconomic planning and development, but also for evaluation and effective implementation of various public schemes and programmes. It assumes more significance in the present context of preparing National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), he adds.

The preparatory measures were kick-started on a war-footing on directions from the general manager (GM) of Southern Railway to all divisional-level officials on Monday. The instructions were in detail and specific, a senior railway official said.

Isolation wards designed with 126 beds to accommodate suspected people have been set-up at the Railway Training Institute, Arasaradi (24), Railway Basic Training Centre, Thiruparankundram (13), RPF barracks, Dindigul (22), RPF barracks, Tirunelveli (26), Multi-disciplinary divisional training institute, Virudhunagar (25) and Madurai Divisional Health Unit (16).

The Madurai divisional health unit will have eight beds for men, five for women and three for children.

“The wards will be a first stop to quarantine suspected cases, from where they will be shifted to government designated hospitals. Machinery is in place to monitor suspected cases at different railway stations,” a senior railway official told TOI. Commuters need not panic as the wards are only a preventive mechanism.

The railways is also focusing on intensive disinfection. On directions of the divisional railway manager V R Lenin and chief medical superintendent, Baskar, staffs are engaged in disinfecting places such as the ticket counters, waiting halls, toilets, drinking water taps, pantry area, benches and handrails of stairs that are used or frequently touched by many.

“Disinfection drives are also carried out in rakes at the terminating stations like Madurai, Tirunelveli, Ramanathapuram and Tuticorin with focus on trains operated by the division. The rakes would be disinfected at least once a week,” the official said.

The schedule is planned to ensure that it does not affect the regular operating time. Officials said that efforts are under way to provide additional antibacterial products such as sanitizers and wipes at the stations, on the trains and in employee work areas.

Regular public announcements are also made at all important railway stations to create awareness among passengers and employees on the Covid-19 preventive measures. Education and communication material on coronavirus are also displayed at important locations.

451,['12/03/2020'],"Shah misleading Parliament, must resign: Congress","Congress leader in Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary speaks during the ongoing Budget Session inside Lok Sabha... Read More

Congress on Wednesday demanded home minister Amit Shah’s resignation for his “failure to contain the Delhi riots” even as most opposition parties demanded an independent judicial inquiry into the communal flare-up that claimed 53 lives and left over 500 injured.

Congress MPs staged a walkout during Shah’s response in Lok Sabha, claiming he was “misleading Parliament” instead of accepting his failure in containing the riots.

On Wednesday morning, Congress’s Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury gunned for Shah’s scalp as he referred to the violence as a “defeat of humanity”. Accusing PM Narendra Modi and Shah of being like Roman emperor Nero and “playing the fiddle in Ahmedabad to host President Trump” while Delhi burned, Chowdhury also referred to the midnight transfer of a Delhi High Court judge who pulled up the government and Delhi Police for “inaction” and called it a “midnight surgical strike on the judiciary”.

This saw heated exchanges between treasury and opposition benches. Even as BJP MPs asserted that the government had nothing to do with the judge’s transfer, BJD MP Pinaki Mishra clarified that the transfer was, indeed, cleared by the law ministry.

Questioning Shah on why he was “missing in action” from riot-hit areas when NSA Ajit Doval could visit to calm nerves, Chowdhury said, “Why did Ajit Doval have to step in? NSA does not step in to control law and order. He reports directly to the PM and his office. This means the PMO did not have the faith in the home minister’s office. It seems India now has two power centres, the PMO and the HMO.”

Several opposition parties echoed Congress’s charges. TMC’s Saugata Roy said BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi's speech was “communal and polarising” and that she played the devil's advocate for “defending” BJP’s Kapil Mishra. He said the minority community suffered more in the riots and demanded Shah’s resignation.

AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi said there was a “tsunami of Hindutva hate” and called for an impartial probe to find the perpetrators of the violence. BSP’s Danish Ali opposed Lekhi for “identifying” women of one community, a remark that led Speaker Om Birla to direct members not to take the names of any caste or religion. Birla also directed that some of Lekhi’s comments be expunged .

Referring to the riots as shameful because even the media and judiciary was not spared, DMK’s T R Baalu said, “Even mediapersons were not left alone. Those belonging to CNN, NDTV, Times of India, Reuters, India Today, and News18 were mercilessly attacked. Their equipment was seized and thrown into dustbins. All this happened during daylight on February 24, 25 and 26.”

BJD’s Pinaki Mishra said he was embarrassed and ashamed as an Indian by what happened. “I believe that there must be the most dispassionate, the most ruthless possible investigation into why these riots occurred, who the perpetrators were and they must be brought to book mercilessly. But this must be an independent inquiry and this must inspire confidence,” he said.

NCP’s Amol Kolhe said Indian was in the grips of “religious nationalism” and expressed concern over children being asking questions on religion. Samajwadi Party’s Shafiqur Rehman Barq demanded action against BJP’s Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma. He also said Muslims were feeling insecure and demanded a judicial inquiry into the violence.

The hapless state of the roads caused much inconvenience to the commuters. Besides, sewer overflow in several wards added to the woes.

Even after extension of deadline several times, Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) has not been able to make the city roads pothole-free. Damaged roads in all the 100 wards of the city were targeted to be repaired by December last. However, many city roads remain untouched.

Senior municipal councilor Ravi Mathur said, “Quality of the repair work was very poor. In several wards, concrete of the roads repaired last year has started wearing out. Rainfall has caused waterlogging on the roads. The problem faced by people will be raised in the municipal board meeting.”

Wazirpura resident Vinod Kumar Singh said, “Even after the delay, the authorities have failed to repair the roads causing a lot of inconvenience to the commuters. Potholes are causing accidents on daily basis. We raised the issue several times but officials took no action.”

Half of the city roads maintained by AMC are not in a good condition. Roads at Madia Katra, Boghipura, Kailashpuri, Shahganj locality, Paschimpuri, Sikandra road, Maruti Estate, interior roads of Pratapura locality, Belanganj, Peepal Mandi, Langdey ki Chowki, Daresi, Heerabagh, Devri Road, Nunihai are among those in dire need of repair. Roads in Trans-Yamuna and Shahdara localities around Yamuna bridge and Guru-ka-Taal also require repair work.

The areas where sewer overflow took place on Wednesday include Awas Vikas, Paschimpuri, Sikandra, Kaushalpura, Freeganj, Lohamandi, Shahganj and Albatiya.

Municipal commissioner Arun Prakash said, “Complaints of water-logging on roads due to early morning rainfall have been received. Officials have been directed to identify all the roads that have potholes and start the repair work.”

According to the meteorological department, one or two spells of rain or thundershower can take place on Thursday.

The corporation is taking many steps to collect taxes from the residents and private organisations in the city. Tax evaders face various actions, including disruption of water supply and disconnection of UGD connections. Garbage bins of corporation are also placed in front of the premises of people whose dues exceed many thousands.

A few days ago, the authorities placed a dumper bin in front of a house in Hanumarkoil street in the 81st ward. Pleas by the woman resident to take it away were not heeded to. The CPM members, led by secretary of Madurai Central CPM, P Jeeva took it up with the corporation officials. “They told us that they needed money to pay salaries for their staff and had to collect the pending dues,” said Jeeva.

He said the corporation’s actions were not acceptable as the authorities harassed many residents in wards 81 and 82 with dire consequences if they did not pay their tax dues. “ They let off evaders who have crores worth of pending dues and harass ordinary people who have to pay only a few thousands of rupees,” he said. To protest this, the members of the CPM took bins of garbage and dumped them in front of the south zone office. The bin in front of the house was also removed in the evening.

459,['12/03/2020'],"Coronavirus scare in Kerala: For three days, they raced against time","Ambulance drivers at Pathanamthitta General Hospital get ready to take people to isolation ward on Wednesday

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM : Hours after five Covid-19 cases were confirmed in Pathanamthitta, district administration and health department knew that they were in for a massive tracing exercise because one-to-one interviews with the affected persons gave a picture of a large ring of contacts.

Tracing and establishing communication with primary and secondary contacts within the minimal possible time was the challenge. The flowchart depicting date, time and place of movement of affected persons within three clusters was the result of a midnight discussion attended by the state health secretary, NHM state mission director and Pathanamthitta collector PB Nooh.

Officials were looking for a solution for fast-tracking the isolation process and spatio-temporal mapping (STM), which employs data on time and space of movement from a single point to multiple destinations, emerged the best ploy.

“We had to beat the virus and manual surveillance was the first choice. Instead of going after primary and secondary contacts, we wanted info on them to reach us. We thought of STM since it enabled plotting on map and date, time, place stamping. It also ensured greater public participation. Soon after we released the flowchart, we started receiving calls from places we had denoted in the flowchart and each call gave us useful information,” said NHM state mission director Rathan Kelkar.

Over the past three days, 900 primary and secondary contacts were traced and put under isolation. For that to happen, storylines were made, route maps were drawn. Before the mapping process, the team from community medicine started with direct interviews that yielded incomplete data because the patients were not forthcoming. The team then collected call details of the patients between February 29 till their time of hospital admission. The search produced 250-300 numbers.

“We contacted each person on phone and traced how many of them were in personal contact with the patients and where. It also gave us information about 15 persons who were not actually on our list,” said Nooh. Seventeen field teams, each comprising six members, then collected CCTV footage and data from supermarkets, shops and post offices.

By evening, the team sat together with different set of data and missing links were marked for further verification. A storyline would be made for each cluster of patients and data, made available using STM, helped finetune the details. For instance, the preliminary information about the hotel, which was a point of contact, was that it was somewhere between two distant locations. The team did more digging to arrive at a time, exact name and location of the hotel. It was added as the last entry.

As a final verification process, tower location of affected persons between February 29 and March 9 were collected. There was a confusion over the hotel they had visited. While some people told the team where the persons were spotted, they couldn’t corroborate it since hotel records and CCTV footage did not yield anything. In that case, tower location was used to know whether the parties were anywhere near the location of hotel.

A three-member team led by district informatics officer Gigi George put together manually derived information, route maps and CCTV data to prepare STM. “We received over 100 calls and feedback from the public helped to ensure crucial corrections and updation on STM,” said NHM district programme manager Dr Abey Sushan. The name of a bus was corrected, timing of patient’s arrival in a place was made more accurate based on public response.

Agaram is about six kilometres away from Keeladi.

Demands were made by many people, including Madurai MP Su Venkatesan, to take up excavation in the neighbouring villages of Agaram, Manalur and Konthagai as it could reveal more details of the ancient civilization.

The Tamil Nadu state archaeology department announced that the excavation in the sixth phase, which was started on February 19 this year, would be extended to the villages of Manalur, Konthagai and Agaram also.

Five phases of excavations have been completed in Keeladi in Thirupuvanam in Sivaganga district where an ancient river bed civilization was discovered nearly six years ago. While, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) carried out the first three phases of excavation, the fourth, fifth and now the sixth phases are being undertaken by the state archaeology department.

Excavation in Agaram is being carried out in two acres of land belonging to the Tamil Nadu government. This site falls within the Kalugerkadai panchayat and is opposite to the village tank. Panchayat president Kottaisamy and officials of the archaeology department participated in the bhoomi pooja and cleaning of the site began on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, a second burial urn was discovered in Konthagai, where the excavation was started along with Keeladi. Manalur is expected to be taken up soon, according to archaeological department sources.

AHMEDABAD: As a fallout of travel restrictions by companies across the globe due to COVID-19 outbreak in various parts of the world, the footfalls of international guests have dropped to the barest minimum across hotels in Ahmedabad, causing hotel occupancies to fall sharply. Estimates by hoteliers suggest that average hotel occupancy in Ahmedabad has dropped to 50% or in some cases even lower across leading hotels in the city.

“A number of business delegate groups have cancelled their booking at our hotel, as companies have imposed travel restrictions after COVID-19 outbreak in various countries. Most of these group bookings were from international guests. The average occupancy is around 70% at this time of the year, which has declined significantly,” said a city-based hotelier, on condition of anonymity.

Hotel business has also taken a hit because of cancellation or deferring of a slew of events and business conferences. “Two business conferences which were to be held at our hotel were cancelled due to travel restrictions imposed by companies. As a result, the bookings for guests were also cancelled affecting occupancies at our hotel. However, bookings from travellers in transit hasn’t been significantly affected yet,” said Subhrajit Bardhan, general manager, DoubleTree By Hilton, Ahmedabad.

As a consequence of falling occupancies, the average daily rates have also marginally declined at several hotels in the city.

To sustain revenues, hoteliers however are banking on vouchers and catering services. “Group movements have been restricted across companies. While some have deferred their trips, others have cancelled altogether. On an average, we saw a 15% decline. As a result, we are also focusing on alternate avenues to keep up with revenue growth targets, by offering vouchers and extending our catering services. At the same time, we are also trying to convince clients whose events in other cities got called off, to host them at our hotel,” said another hotelier, without willing to be named.

AHMEDABAD: Firozkhan Pathan , a survivor of the 2002 Gujarat communal riots, has written to the chief minister demanding stern action against ‘attempts to disrupt communal harmony .’

Lauding the state government for ensuring peace and harmony over the past 17 years, Pathan said in the letter that attempts are now being made by members of political parties to instigate communal hostility.

Referring to a recent input by the intelligence bureau that politicians, police officers and religious leaders were likely to be targeted, Pathan wrote in the letter that certain political leaders had spread messages on social media about the input. “Those political leaders who posted the IB input on social media platforms, must be identified and strict action should be taken against them. This is an attempt to disrupt communal harmony in the state,” Pathan said.

He said in the letter that the state government has ensured communal harmony and peace after the 2002 communal riots and this ought to be preserved. “I have asked the chief minister in the letter to initiate action against any political person who indulges in provocative speeches or spreads communal hatred, irrespective of which party the person belongs to,” Pathan said.

Pathan, 45, lost 10 members of his family in the Gulbarg Society killings on February 28, 2002. He contested the 2019 Lok Sabha poll from the Gandhinagar LS seat as an independent candidate. Union home minister Amit Shah won the seat with a record margin.

Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), India’s food regulator, had directed that from May 1, not only packaged sweets but also those displayed on trays, to be picked and chosen by buyers, should bear manufacturing and best-before dates to ensure customers’ health was not compromised with. But sweet manufacturers in the city, who have united under the banner of Paschimbanga Mistanna Byabasayee Samity, called the new rule absurd and said they would probably not follow it.

“We don’t have the infrastructure to display manufacturing and best-before dates on sweets. In Bengal, most sweets are made of chhena or cottage cheese. They expire fast, the shelf life of some being is less than 24 hours. So the question of mentioning manufacturing and expiry dates doesn’t arise,” said Samity president Rabindra Pal. “The sweet industry in Bengal is a cottage industry that runs on tradition and trust. This kind of an imposition in the name of health is absurd... All you can ask is whether the sweet is fresh or stale.”

Even if the bigger brands could display the dates, smaller brands would not be able to do so, he asserted. “Instead, FSSAI should ensure we can procure healthy raw materials.” a Samily member said.

The Samity members complained FSSAI was seeking reports for the water being used to make sweets. Calling it ridiculous, another member said, “For years, we have been using water supplied by the corporation or municipality. FSSAI should question the supplying authority, not us.” They pointed out that sending such reports would mean additional expenses that sweet manufacturers would not be able to bear.

They also complained instead to waiting to see if the manufacturers renewed their food safety licences or not by April 1, FSSAI had started imposing a fine of Rs 100 a day on all confectioners since March 1. “This is coercive and we are not going to accept it,” one of them said.

468,['12/03/2020'],"This screentime habit is equivalent to secondhand smoking for kids, say experts","All parents are cautious about ensuring that their kids grow up in the best possible way. From ensuring they eat right, study well and making sure that their internet access is curtailed, there are a lot many things to take care of when you have kids growing up in the house.However, there is one dilemma which is on the mind of many parents and that circles around screentime. As much of a boon the internet is, sadly, the internet and screentime isn't the best thing for kids and adults. With babies getting addicted to screens as young as six months, experts are now warning about another potential risk factor for kids- secondhand screentime. In fact, it is believed that secondhand screentime is just as dangerous as passive or secondhand smoking.While parents and guardians have the provision of limiting the content kids have access too, what they do not have control over is secondhand screentime. Secondhand screentime is what your kid watches when someone in close contact with the kid (i.e., the parent) browses through it in the near vicinity. The problem also becomes concerning if children spend time around parents or guardians who are on their phones for a long time.If left unmonitored, this can have drastic consequences for the child's development graph.Guidelines suggest that kids between the age of 2-7 are exposed to no more than one hour of screentime of gadget usage per day, while screentime should altogether be ""avoided"" for kids less than 18 months of age.Kids, when in contact with the parent who spends considerable time on the phone or the screen are at a higher risk of getting addicted to the screens as well and hamper the usual parent-child relationship. With secondhand screentime, there is a high risk of kids getting exposed to unmonitored content without proper supervision with the people surrounding the kids. Be it at the daycare, school, mall or any place where children are cared for by adults, spending a concerning amount of time around gadgets without proper control can have impacting consequences.Research shows that children have a tendency to exhibit irrational behaviour pattern when parents spend excessive time on their devices. They are also more prone to exhibiting symptoms like irritability, mood swings, slow language development, hyperactivity and reduced cognitive functions. Be it something as little as applying the same example, or throwing hissy fits to demand the parent's attention, there is also a high risk of excessive screentime impacting their self-esteem and emotional framework.Anything that crosses the 1-1.5 hour timeline per day is deemed dangerous for a growing child. In fact, for children in their adolescent and pre-teen days, the focus should also be put on the content quality they have access to.Excess screen time is bad for your kid's brain and there is more than one reason for you to cut down on your screentime. It is important to remember that kids model your behaviour and learn from what you do. So it is most important that you set the right examples for your child. Before you go about telling your kids to stop consuming internet fodder, be watchful of what you do on the internet. More frequently you use your smartphones, more likely are your kids to follow that.Screening what your kids have access to and what content you see can be quite a task, but it is something that has to be set in stone. As a rule of thumb, make sure you try and adopt a digital detox once you are home or in a child-friendly environment. When you are home, you can start by setting time limits and establish rules as in where phone or screens cannot be used.You can also try avoiding phone and screen usage when you are having a conversation with someone and that is the lesson you should be telling your kids too. No phones at the dinner table, having quality conversation is key.Parents can also make use of the same phones and timeline to impose curbs. Phones come with new features which set off alarms if the screen time exceeds limits.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74578001,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-151226/74578001.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/parenting/toddler-year-and-beyond/this-screentime-habit-is-equivalent-to-secondhand-smoking-for-kids-say-experts/articleshow/74578001.cms

He became symptomatic for Covid-19 two days later and took self-medication for a couple of days before approaching a family physician and subsequently reached Apollo Hospital.The data scientist was referred to the Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad where samples for Covid-19 were confirmed, leading to local authorities identifying 76 of his contacts in Telangana and 10 in Bengaluru within hours. All were put under surveillance for Covid-19 symptoms but tested negative.The contact tracing of 23 Italian tourists, of which 16 were found positive for Covid-19 and are admitted in different hospitals, was more challenging. The group arrived at IGI Airport in Delhi on February 21. The group, along with a driver, a helper and a guide, visited various cities in Rajasthan and also went to Agra.“We tracked down even the dhaba where the driver, travelling with the Italian group, got his dinner packed. They too have been put under surveillance,” a senior official in the Delhi public health division said.A group member was ill at the start of the tour but did not report this. He travelled with the group to multiple destinations in Rajasthan and reached Jaipur on February 29. After tests confirmed Covid-19, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) of Rajasthan immediately started contact tracing.

Observers said Shivakumar’s elevation, after months of dilly-dallying, was a bid to stem further exodus from the party.The Kanakapura MLA acknowledged the task before him, saying, “I will do my best to do justice to the faith bestowed on me by the party leadership and end faction feud in the party”.The Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president’s post has been vacant since Dinesh Gundu Rao quit, owing moral responsibility for the party’s debacle in the bypolls held in December last year. With declared assets of Rs 840 crore, Shivakumar is counted among the richest politicians of the country.Shivakumar, a seventerm MLA, has served as minister under three former Congress chief ministers — S Bangarappa, SM Krishna and Siddaramiah — and under the previous JDS-Congress coalition government led by HD Kumaraswamy. Alongside Shivakumar, the party named three working presidents of KPCC — Eshwar Khandre, Satish Jarkiholi and Saleem Ahmed. The choices, sources said, were meant to balance caste equations and keep the various factions happy: Khandre is a Lingayat, Jarkiholi belongs to a scheduled tribe while Ahmed ticks the minority box. Not surprisingly, former chief minister Siddaramaiah has been asked to continue as Congress Legislature Party and leader of opposition in the legislative assembly. Ajay Singh, son of late CM Dharam Singh, will be chief whip in the assembly while M Narayanaswamy will be the party's chief whip in the legislative council.The KPCC appointments come after prolonged deliberations on whether Shivakumar, a Vokkaliga, or MB Patil, a Lingayat, should succeed Gundu Rao. Patil was seen as a better bet to lead the party in the 2023 assembly polls since BJP’s Lingayat strongman and chief minister B S Yediyurappa is expected to hang up his boots.Sources in the party said Shivakumar had emerged as the frontrunner in the discussions and the leadership was willing to appoint him much earlier but a section argued that the party should wait until he got a clean chit in the money-laundering case.As KPCC chief, Shivakumar’s biggest challenge would be to end the faction feud in the party and his style of aggressive leadership is expected to come in handy. “He will have to not only appease the sulking Siddaramaiah group in the party but also revitalise the demoralised state unit by uniting all leaders,” said a senior party functionary. Alongside, he will have to deal with his legal troubles.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74585295,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-352932,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/troubleshooter-dks-will-head-congress-in-karnataka/articleshow/74585290.cms

CHENNAI: L Murugan, vice-chairman of National Commission for Scheduled Castes, was appointed president of the Tamil Nadu BJP unit by the party's national chief J P Nadda on Wednesday. The post has been lying vacant since September 1, 2019, after then state president Tamilisai Soundararajan was appointed governor of Telangana.

BJP will have representation in the Tamil Nadu assembly after the 2021 assembly polls and I will work hard to achieve it, Murugan said. After his appointment, which came as a surprise to many in the party, Murugan told reporters that it once again proved that hard work of even an ordinary cadre would be duly ""recognised"" and ""rewarded"" in the party. After S P Kirubanidhi, Murugan is the second dalit to head the party's state unit.

""Our primary work is to accomplish the task given by the party leadership,"" he said.

Murugan took up Panchami land issue involving DMK’s Murasoli

Before being appointed as the VC of the NCSC, Murugan, 42, of Namakkal was state secretary and later president of the party’s SC wing. He was also the secretary of the wing at the national level. He was also practising as a lawyer in the Madras high court.

Since September 1, names of several state and national leaders of the party, including Nainar Nagendran, R Srinivasan, K S Narendran, Karuppu M Muruganandam, A P Muruganandam and D Kuppuram were doing the rounds.

Meanwhile, a two-member team, from the party’s national headquarters, held a meeting on January 5 at the party headquarters in Chennai with the core-committee members and state-level office bearers to get their views for appointing a person to achieve the aspirations of the party in the state.

A few months ago, after a petition from BJP functionary Prof R Srinivasan, Murugan took up the Panchami land issue involving DMK’s mouthpiece Murasoli. However, the Madras HC, while hearing Murasoli –Panchami land case, directed Murugan to step aside from the issue following allegations that he had participated in an event organised by BJP, despite occupying a constitutional post.

473,['12/03/2020'],"Undeterred by personal loss, Yash turns messiah for hapless children","Yash Gourkhede, 24, had twice tried to end life under depression after his then teenaged friend Twinkle Surekha killed herself in 2016. The pain pricked college dropout Gourkhede so much that he started nurturing his personal wound by catering to the grief of others, especially helpless children.

Yash, a bank executive, has transformed into a messiah for children with lost childhood. His NGO ‘Twinkle Foundation’, founded in memory of his late friend in 2016, rescues children from trafficking rackets, forced labour, begging, prostitution and such dark alleys of life.

The youngster and his team have so far rescued around 950 children, including almost 300 from the city and outskirts. The actions were taken along with government agencies, police and some through personal initiatives.

“The biggest rescue was of 450 trafficked children following a tip-off from an NGO. These children were forced into begging near Tulja Bhavani Mandir at Surjapur in Osmanabad,” said Yash who carries out the work through his personal income and financial help from friends and well-wishers.

The first rescue act was done at Sitabuldi. They freed a small girl from the clutches of a begging syndicate. “The girl had cut off her hair and posed as a boy on the road just to avoid being raped repeatedly. She was into addiction and severely violated,” he said.

The rescued children are sent to government homes and shelters. Explaining the modus operandi of begging syndicates, he said. “They are well organized rackets who inflict injuries on bodies of children, severe their limbs and keep them unkempt. This way they attract sympathetic citizens who offer alms to child beggars,” said Yash.

Near Tajbagh, the team had also across racketeers who would rent out children with women to make them pose as needy mother and child. “Despite the high risk of being attacked, we never let anything come in the way of our work,” he said.

Yash, who has won several recognitions and awards along with his key support Barkha Patnaik, said his team also launched ‘Milan campaign’ to reunite lost children with their parents. “We are stretching our network globally by tying up with like-minded groups in Nepal, Pakistan, Russia and Australia,” he said.

“We have 15,000 children advocates who are basically volunteers having legal awareness. Another 1,700 volunteers are engaged in the field as investigation officers or rehabilitation coordinators,” said Yash and added that social media is the biggest platform for their work.

The team also creates mass awareness about ills and perils of child labour, begging syndicates and such issues. They are also reaching out to senior citizens who are being ill-treated by their families.

Yash believes in encouraging others, especially youngsters. “A one-day carnival is organized for the rescued children and the elderly citizens. This way they develop bonding like grandson and grandpa, even if it’s momentarily. Under a programme called ‘Pankh’, we also give award to youngsters for their achievements in different fields,” he said.

474,['12/03/2020'],Understanding of concepts key to answering well,"From the session 2019-20, the CBSE board has introduced Indian Economic Development (IED) for Std XII, which will make it tough for students to score 100, but it’s not impossible.

As per the new pattern, economics paper will consist of total 34 questions, which will include 20 questions of 1 mark (including MCQs, fill in the blanks, true-false, match the right answer etc), 4 questions of 3 marks, 6 questions of 4 marks and 4 questions of 6 marks.

Students must practice solved sample papers by CBSE to develop a strong understanding of concepts which will help you answer in a better way. Focus on past examination questions for macroeconomics.

As this will be the first batch appearing in IED, you can’t evaluate previous years’ paper. So, you need to practice NCERT questions in writing. Practice numerical problems and diagrams with pen and paper.

Never mix between sections. If you start with macroeconomics, then you should first finish it and then start with IED. Write your answers in points. Answer should be precise, relevant and up to the question. Length of answers and diagrams should be according to the marks allocated to that particular question. Solve numerical questions step by step. Inbox your answer and highlight the main points in theory answers.

After completing all the questions, revise your answersheet to check whether you have attempted all the questions and all the diagrams are properly labelled.

Remaining calm and focused will also help you in attempting all the questions, as you would feel confident which can help in remembering.

In section B of the paper, students should bifurcate which questions they are going to attempt.

Importantly, give preference to diagram-based questions, as these questions can fetch students full marks. Students must keep in mind to label all the diagrams correctly while solving questions based on them. Use pro-circle and roller scale to draw diagrams of pulley more easily, quickly and neatly.

Many students make simple mistakes in writing wrong units in numericals. So, avoid this and write correct units. In theory questions, students should not write very lengthy answers; these should be of appropriate length and the use of keywords will do. Paper checkers always look for correct words and exact content in answers.

For scoring good marks in physics, neatness in diagrams as well as presentation of answers are important. Students must check correct spellings of answers.

Try to attempt all the questions, do not leave blank spaces. Students should try to finish their paper 10 minutes early so that they can check answers and correct silly mistakes. Students are advised to use two hours of exam time properly, giving all the questions worthy time.

But the reality is different. While the contractor has provided soap, staying off dirty surfaces is not a choice for these poor labourers.“Khaana khaney sey pehley haat sabun sey dho letey hain. Ab sabun rakha hai cotnractor ney. (I wash my hands now with soap before eating my food. Now the contractor has kept soap for us,” said Rajesh who lives in Madanpur Khadar in South Delhi.

DHARWAD: Members of the Dharwad Bar Association gathered in front of the Dharwad suburban police station on Wednesday to protest what they dubbed the ‘humiliating’ treatment of a public prosecutor by cops.

The protesting lawyers charged cops with acting on a belated complaint filed by a constable attached to the Dharwad rural police station. In pursuance of the complaint being filed, a case was booked under the provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (prevention of atrocities) Act, 1989 against government pleader Sunil Gudi.

Similar scenes were also witnessed in Hubballi, where lawyers protested demanding action against personnel of the Hubballi rural police station. President of the Hubli Bar Association Ashok Baligar alleged that Gudi had been assaulted by Ganesh Kambale and Devaraj, PSI and CPI respectively of the Dharwad rural police station. “When Gudi had gone to the station seeking details of the case, the cops assaulted him. We have filed a case against the duo at the Hubballi suburban police station. They must be arrested immediately,” said Baligar.

The protest by advocates of the twin cities follows a demonstration on Monday, when they had taken to the streets questioning the treatment meted out to a member of their fraternity by police.

Gudi had alleged that the constable Ganesh Kambale manhandled him when the former visited the station. After lawyers sought immediate action against Kambale, Dharwad superintendent of police Vartika Katiyar suspended Kambale pending an inquiry into the case.

However, Kambale filed a complaint against Gudi on Tuesday evening, accusing the latter of having made remarks pertaining to caste. A complaint was lodged under the SC/ST Act at the Dharwad suburban police station. Questioning the timing of Kambale’s complaint, the protesting lawyers on Wednesday alleged that this had been done in a bid to seek vengeance. They further alleged that Kambale had been prompted to file the complaint by his superiors.

The current face-off between the two arms of the legal system – cops and lawyers – comes close on the heels of police trying to prevent Bengaluru advocates from entering the premises of a court when they were en route the court to file a bail petition on behalf of three engineering students from Kashmir. The enraged lawyers had pointed out that, in barring their entry to court, cops had violated provisions of CrPC Section 327.

The protesting lawyers in Dharwad on Wednesday said that they would not yield to any form of pressure, and would not allow police to stifle their voice. “We will continue this protest for an indefinite period until our demands are met,” they said.

The threat of the protest intensifying was endorsed by secretary of the Hubli Bar Association Guru Hiremath, who said that the stir would continue unless the errant cops were brought to book.

The protesters sought the withdrawal of the atrocities case against Sunil Gudi.

MANGALURU: The Science and Technology Entrepreneurs Park (NITK-STEP) Suratkhal, after 24 years since its inception, has incubated startups of its faculty . The NITK-STEP commenced in 1994, and was then known as KREC.

Thanks to a tweak in its norms in 2018, which earlier allowed everyone, except institution faculty members to incubate at the centre. Within two years of the change in the rule, two faculty members incubated two novel products. The first deals with the business of designing, development, customisation, implementation, maintenance, testing and benchmarking different kinds of software, mobile or desktop applications related to radars, video, sonar and automatic identification system (AIS) and global positioning system (GPS) sensor data processing. The second startup is a low-cost nanotechnology-based ultrafiltration water purifier.

B Venkatesa Perumal, professor, department of electronics and communication engineering and director, NITK-STEP, said that the rule was changed and approved during the 51st meeting of the board of governors (BOG) held in 2018, to consider faculty startups at NITK-STEP. “The change in the rule has resulted in two faculty members coming up with their unique startups, and more such faculty startups are in the pipeline,” added Perumal.

The first faculty startup to incubate at NITK-STEP is by Pathipati Srihari, assistant professor, department of electronics and communication engineering, NITK Surathkal. The startup is called Sri Shasha Prayathi Technologies Limited. The second faculty startup by Arun Mohan Isloor, professor and HoD chemistry, NITK Surathkal is Apahatech Solutions.

Perumal said that NITK-STEP is the oldest incubation centre in the region, which existed before anyone talked about startups, and was set up to help develop startups in IT, healthcare and agriculture. “In the last 26 years, 18 startups have graduated and become full-fledged companies, and 55 startups have incubated at NITK. These startups belong to students and locals from the region,” he said.

A number of companies incubated at NITK-STEP have evolved into successful techno-commercial ventures with multi-crore sales turnover firms employing hundreds of knowledge workers. A few of the innovators have been outstanding and bagged reputed, national and international level awards. Some of the successful firms, which started at NITK-STEP and have made a big name include Robosoft Technologies Private Limited, Udupi, Omnesys Technologies Private Limited and others.

BENGALURU: Seven months after the Centre abrogated Article 370 that accorded special status to J&K, police have issued a notice to companies in one of Bengaluru's largest business parks seeking details of people from the UT.Cops say they have asked the companies housed in the business park to provide the details to maintain law and order. Activists and lawyers slammed the police notice and called it ""unwarranted profiling"" of people from J&K. ""For law and order purpose, please give the details of employees who are originally from J&K and are working in various companies at Manyata Embassy Park in Nagawara Ring Road,"" the notice issued by Sampigehalli police station on March 5 read.The notice, a copy of which is with TOI, is signed by the station house officer and seeks names of employees from J&K, their mobile numbers, current address in Bengaluru, and the duration of their stay/work at the respective companies.According to sources, companies in the business park received the notice on Tuesday and are consulting legal experts before moving forward.Asked why they were collecting details of employees from Jammu & Kashmir, Sampigehalli inspector and SHO Nandakumar M said, “It’s nothing. We’ve just asked for it.” When pressed further, he refused to elaborate. Multiple calls made subsequently went unanswered.Bengaluru police commissioner Bhaskar Rao told TOI: “We have not issued directions to any police station to collect such details. I will look into the issue. The department has never endeavoured to collect individual details and no police station has been asked to do it at their level either.” News of the notice has been doing the rounds, triggering confusion and panic among employees.“Is it legal for the police to demand such details? Such measures will only add to apprehension among minority community members. This is unconstitutional. The companies may give away details since it’s a police notice. What about the safety of people from J&K living in Bengaluru? Why do police need our addresses,” asked an employee of one of the companies which received the notice.However, an Embassy Group spokesperson said he was unaware of any such notice. According to developers, Embassy Manyata is spread over 121.76 acres with 14.2 million square feet of leasable area.“It is the largest office park in Bengaluru and the second largest in India. It has 11 million square feet builtup area and houses 68 tenants with over 1 lakh park users,” they claimed.Advocate and rights activist Clifton Rozario said: “Cops can ask for such details only if they have credible evidence against any person or a group… This kind of random profiling is illegal. Every time authorities do such things, they undermine the Constitution and people’s belief in the system.”“Legal action should be taken against the officer if he has issued the notice without any instructions from the department,” said another activist. “There is no law in India that allows police to seek such details.

485,['12/03/2020'],"For DHFL depositors, it’s a lonely battle","Nagpur: “The money we got after selling our farm in Wardha was invested in Dewan Housing Finance Limited’s (DHFL) fixed deposit plan. As the funds remain locked up after DHFL went bust in October last year, our family now depends on rental income of Rs10,000,” says Sunanda (name changed) in her fifties. She prefers not to disclose her identity to avoid social embarrassment.

She is among the numerous depositors of DHFL in Wardha whose downfall also brought down Yes Bank. Even as Yes Bank depositors continue to line up to withdraw the permissible Rs50,000, those like Sunanda and others find them still better off.

With no relaxation to even withdraw part of the deposit like in Yes Bank, Sunanda and others in a group of 200 are now waiting for April 8 when the next hearing in the DHFL case is scheduled at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

Yes Bank was in trouble due to its exposure in DHFL. The total depositors in DHFL are pegged at over 77,000 having parked over Rs6,000 crore in all. Out of these, 200 have come together and are fighting their case in the NCLT.

“There must be scores in Wardha alone, especially in the interiors. Like us, many others were also made to deposit their funds in DHFL by the same chartered accountant, ” says Sunanda.

“Yes Bank’s depositors can withdraw at least Rs50,000, but for those in DHFL, the entire money has been locked up since October. There are individuals in Nagpur who have invested huge amounts,” says Anand Mirpuri, another depositor who runs a retail business here.

Mirpuri says he deposited funds in DHFL because it had AAA rating and continued to honour its liability towards depositors till October when the crisis began.

It was a tweet by Vinay Mittal, a retired intelligence officer living in Delhi, that he wanted to take up a legal battle for the depositors’ rights that led to 200 of them coming together. They have Rs150 crore of deposits in all, says Mittal.

“There are 77,000 depositors in all but most of them are not traceable. A large number is from interiors having parked smaller amounts up to a lakh or so. However, only 200 have formed a group so far,” Mittal told TOI.

“The depositor are from entire country. In Central India, large numbers are from Chhattisgarh,” he said.

A moratorium was imposed on DHFL’s transactions following a high court order, which was vacated by the Supreme Court and the matter went before the NCLT after which the restrictions continued. Following the apex court’s directions, the depositors who wanted to priority in payment of their dues from DHFL assets have now gone to NCLT.

“Initially, we went to the committee of creditors (CoC) appointed under insolvency proceedings which did not accept the plea. Later, our group filed an invention in the NCLT and the next hearing is now due on April 8,” he said.

“Our only demand is that the fixed deposit holder should be given priority when it comes to paying off DHFL’s due. We also expect the government to intervene in the case as we have been fighting the battle alone,” said Manjusha Asarani, another investor from Nagpur.

A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote further asked the petitioner to include completed and pending projects and also those where work is underway, in its report.

The bench was hearing a PIL (No 82/2018) by LBASS convener Avinash Kale through counsel Bharti Dabhadkar regarding incomplete irrigation projects that led to spate of farmers suicides in Vidarbha over the years.

Earlier, the petitioner moved an amendment application demanding directives to the Maharashtra government and Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC) to submit a report in this regard within a specific time, but it’s yet to submit it.

Blaming the VIDC for failure to complete even a single project in Vidarbha, which would have brought over 10 lakh hectares under irrigation and saved poor farmers from taking extreme steps due to crop failure and mounting debts, the petitioner contended not even 10% work is completed in all these projects.

Previously, the VIDC listed out a slew of reasons for delay in projects’ completion. It included PAPs opposition, lack of environmental clearance, introduction of lift irrigation scheme, unavailability of sand, metal, rubble and other material, and staff vacancy.

The causes of delays were introspected by conducting various discussions. orming committees and all feasible results/reports are being implemented. The VIDC and government are very serious in completion of remaining 64 ongoing forest-affected projects.

487,['12/03/2020'],"ED: Have details of Rs 5,000 cr Kapoor got as kickbacks","NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has claimed to have found details of at least Rs 5,000 crore in kickbacks allegedly received by Yes Bank co-founder Rana Kapoor from different corporate houses for extending them Rs 20,000 crore of loans that have now turned into non-performing assets (NPAs).

A £30 million investment in a hotel in the UK, another in New York for a similar amount, a yacht, and five properties in upscale localities of Delhi are some of the assets identified by ED as belonging to Kapoor and his immediate family members. The Delhi properties include houses on SP Marg, Kautilya Marg (both falling in the diplomatic enclave), Amrita Shergill Marg, Jor Bagh and Hauz Khas. As per Enforcement Directorate, the combined worth of the assets runs into thousands of crores of rupees.

The properties, identified in India, the US, the UK and France are estimated to be worth around Rs 5,000 crore, which the agency alleged were bought using alleged kickbacks the banker received in shell companies run by his wife and daughters. The payoffs were allegedly in return for over Rs 20,000 crore of loans extended to a troubled business house with interests in infrastructure, finance and defence, a realty and finance group, and DFHL, among others.

Most of these loans had turned NPAs in Yes Bank’s books, the agency claimed on Wednesday while seeking an extension in Kapoor’s remand in the money laundering case against him.

TOI had reported on March 10 about a house Kapoor’s wife Bindu had purchased at 40, Amrita Shergill Marg, Delhi, from industrialist Gautam Thapar.

Thapar had mortgaged his house to Yes Bank against a loan. However, the house was sold to Kapoor’s wife, which is a matter of investigation, for Rs 380 crore.

Kapoor’s modus operandi, agency sources claimed, was to extend loans to corporate houses who had defaulted on loans with other banks for a quid pro quo. Bribes were allegedly paid by these corporate houses in shell companies floated by his wife and daughters.

Shell companies under investigation include RAB Enterprises Pvt Ltd, in which Bindu Kapoor is a director and 100% shareholder.

Kapoor’s daughters — Roshni Kapoor, Radha Kapoor Khanna and Raakhe Kapoor Tandon — are 100% shareholders of DOIT Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd through Morgan Credits Pvt Ltd, another shell company.

The details of shareholding in shell companies linked to the Kapoor family are recorded in the FIR registered by the CBI, which has made Kapoor, his wife and three daughters accused. The FIR has been used by the ED to register a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act against the Kapoors.

488,['12/03/2020'],"Chennai: Boy gets transplant of bowel, abdomen wall","Patient gains more than 1.5kg weight, on immune suppression tablets

CHENNAI: Chinni Krishna is ecstatic that he can eat a full meal and step out of his house for a saunter. “I am so happy I can do this,” the 17-year-old told reporters on Wednesday, three weeks after transplant surgeons replaced his ultra-short bowel with a healthy organ from another teenager who died in a road accident.In March 2019, Chinni was hospitalised with sudden abdominal pain, and doctors removed most of his small intestine retaining just 5cm of the organ (normal size is 6 metres). Doctors don’t know what triggered the acute mesenteric ischemia – a condition where there is sudden loss of blood supply to the small intestine. But the condition left the organ permanently damaged and a large portion of it was removed as a lifesaving procedure.Since then the teen has been fed intravenously and was mostly on a hospital bed. By the time, he was brought from Kuppam in Andhra Pradesh to Apollo Hospitals here, he had lost nearly 20kg, suffered severe muscle wastage and was malnourished. The small intestine aids in digestion and absorption of food. “He weighed just 30 kg when we saw him,” said paediatrician Dr J Shyamala.Doctors knew before any further therapy, Chinni needed nutritional rehabilitation. Over the next nine months, nutritionists helped him regain 15kg. During the time, the hospital crowdsourced funds for his treatment as his family couldn’t fund the procedures. “Once he gained about 15kg, we told him to stay at home but we continued to monitor his weight gain and lab reports,” she said.He suffered two episodes of infections and severe liver injury, which made bowel transplant inevitable.“The call from the organ registery about a new organ came in February,” said transplant surgeon M Senthil.“When the donor’s family agreed to donate the abdominal wall along with the bowel, we were delighted,” he said. The organ came from an 18-year-old patient who was declared brain dead after a road accident.Taking the abdominal wall from the same donor has two advantages, he said. First, doctors can avoid using poor quality native abdominal wall muscle and skin that has been weakened by multiple operations. “We won’t be able to close the patient properly with the weak inadequate covering,” he said.Second, the newly transplanted abdominal wall serves as an advanced marker of organ rejection.“In a kidney or liver transplant simple tests or scans may reveal rejection. But a patient with bowel transplant may need endoscopy and biopsy. The newly transplanted abdominal skin can change that,” said senior plastic surgeon Dr Ganapathy Krishnan.If the patient’s immune system is working against the new organ, the skin of the abdominal wall will develop a rash at least 15 days prior to the samll intestine getting affected, he said.“It works like a visual canvas. It helps us stop graft rejections,” he said.Senior visceral surgeon of the hospital Dr Anil Vaidya had done this surgery more than seven years ago in the UK.The surgery isn’t that common here because getting abdominal wall is rare and it needs massive preparedness.On Wednesday, a team of doctors said 17-year-old Chinni Krishna had a largely event-free post-surgery period.In less than four days, he was started on solid food. “Chinni Krishna has gained more than 1.5kg body weight after surgery. He is on immune suppression pills but is doing well,” Vaidya said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74585317,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-360347,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-boy-gets-transplant-of-bowel-abdomen-wall/articleshow/74585306.cms

IVL, the flagship of the multinational Indorama group, has announced that it will establish a global business service (GBS) centre in Kolkata. IVL’s portfolio comprises combined PET, integrated oxides and derivatives and fibres.

The GBS centre will be located in the Candor special economic zone (SEZ) in New Town, Kolkata, which has been approved by global property giant Brookfield Properties. “SEZ approval has already been received and the centre will be operational in the second quarter 2020,” the company has said.

According to the group officials, the establishment of IVL’s GBS centre is part of a global initiative to retain its strong competitive position and ensure effective shared service function.

Sources in the state government pointed out that Lohia attended the Bengal Global Business Summit (BGBS) in 2018 and was impressed by the infrastructure in the city. “He wanted to do something here and finally gave nod for the centre. We are hoping for a bigger investment from the group,” he added. The centre will initially employ 250 people which would go up to 600 over time.

According to IVL, the GBS Centre will provide best-in-class finance and procurement services to all IVL entities globally. The GBS will enhance IVL’s agility, drive process standardisation, support future growth, drive cost optimisation and people development. “Kolkata is one of the key GBS locations in India, and already has an established centre for IT/ITeS firms,” the company has stated.

The actor is likely to spell this out when he meets reporters on Thursday after a meeting with Rajini Makkal Mandram district secretaries.

TOI had reported that Rajinikanth had, during his previous interaction with RMM office bearers on March 5, said no to the CM post-something which the gathering unanimously decried. At Thursday's meeting, he is expected to draw the district secretaries into a discussion on projecting someone else as the CM-candidate.

""Since Sunday, several of Rajini's associates have been meeting him, trying to convince him that he should be the CM candidate for the 2021 Tamil Nadu assembly election,"" said a source.

Rajini likely to spell out his political programme soon

The associate seeking anonymity said, “The actor has always said he was not interested in becoming the CM but keen on changing the system and political culture.” “He will reveal his mind tomorrow,” said Rajinikanth’s close associate and advisor Tamilaruvi Manian. Sources said Rajinikanth is likely to spell out his political programme that would include the formal launch of a party in the coming days. While his party’s electoral debut would be crucial for Rajinikanth, stakes are high for various players, particularly the AIADMK and the DMK. Chief minister and AIADMK co-coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister and party coordinator O Panneerselvam have a tough battle ahead to remain significant.

CHENNAI: Five men on Tuesday attacked an inspector of police after he tried to rescue a man the gang had abducted in a car on Anna Salai. All five were soon nabbed and the vehicle seized.

A court later sent M Raja Hussain, an accused in the 1995 bomb attack at the Hindu Munnani office at Chintadripet, his son Mohammed Saifullah 27, and Trichy residents S Rahmadullah, 25, A Asif Khan, 22, and S Thoufiq, 22, to jail. They were charged with kidnapping Royapettah resident K Faisuddin and attacking Triplicane police inspector Mohandoss.

On Wednesday afternoon, an order issued by director general of police K Tripathy transferred inspector Mohandoss to Madurai (south zone) on administrative grounds with immediate effect. The order further requested the inspector general of police, Madurai (south zone), to ensure he was in a non-sensitive post.

A police officer said Madurai native Raja Hussain, 48, who has a murder case pending against him at Vilathikulam in Tuticorin district, had appeared for trial on Tuesday. He and the others called Faisuddin, 48, who had not repaid the ?10 lakh he had borrowed from Hussain nearly a year ago, to a restaurant on Anna Salai around 11pm.

All the six were talking outside the restaurant when Faisuddin sought some more time to return the sum and Hussain slapped him, the officer said, based on the statement from the arrested men. The five men then bundled him into the car and drove away.

A few men standing outside the restaurant saw the man being dragged into the car and alerted the police control room. A team of personnel from the Triplicane station led by inspector Mohandoss rushed to the spot and then received information that the car was parked near the Royapettah clock tower, a short distance away.

The police team went there and the inspector is said to have asked them to release Faisuddin and come to the police station. Hussain and the others refused and instead picked up an argument with the inspector, claiming that it was an internal issue and that they would sort it out themselves. The argument soon led to a clash before Hussain and his men manhandled the inspector.

The other police personnel in the vehicle jumped into the fray, overpowered the men and brought them to the police station.

They were questioned and arrested. The inspector was taken to a private hospital and treated for minor injuries.

494,['12/03/2020'],Why the wait to adopt a child could get longer,"The wait for adopting a child could get longer with more than 29,000 prospective parents registered with Central Adoption Resources Authority (Cara) and just 2,317 children available for adoption, according to latest data.

Among the orphan children, 1,401 are with special needs. There are just 89 normal children below 2 years, the most sought after age group for adoption while there are 649 normal children who are over two years. There are 178 children in the ‘siblings’ category. As per rules, siblings have to be adopted together by the prospective parents.

These figures have been collated by voluntary organisation, Families of Joy, based on government data available on Cara website. The data reflect a worrisome trend about a wide and consistently growing gap between the number of prospective parents and children available for adoption.

With the number of prospective parents rising to over 25,000 over the years from around 5,000 earlier and the number of children being adopted hovering at around 4,000 every year on an average, Cara has started a process to review the adoption system to address the gaps. In 2018-19, 3,374 in-country adoptions were recorded while the number of inter-country adoption was 653.

Cara is focussing on simplifying procedures, expediting the process for declaring a child free for adoption, ensuring that no child is given away in adoption outside the legal system, and bridge the gap between the Juvenile Justice Act 2015 and Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act (HAMA), 1956. The government is also exploring amendments in the JJ Act to simplify the process.

After consultations with stakeholders on January 14, Cara has invited suggestions and feedback till April 3 from stakeholders, including prospective parents, specialised adoption agencies, child welfare committees, state adoption resource agencies and the public.

“Once all suggestions come in, we will study and see what changes can be done by way of notifications and refer those that will require legislative changes to the WCD ministry,” said Cara CEO Deepak Kumar.

Cara faces a big challenge in HAMA. Kumar explained that the JJ Act is a child-centric law and introduces intensive checks and balances to ensure that adoption is safe as prospective parents have to register with the adoption agency and the process is monitored.

HAMA is a personal law where there is no monitoring mechanism for adoption which is executed by the families involved. Hence many parents take the HAMA route to avoid procedures under the adoption regulation. Cara is of the view that this gap needs to be bridged and all children should be adopted from an officially registered adoption pool.

SRINAGAR: The 32-year-old Kashmiri man arrested along with his wife in Delhi last Sunday on suspicion of working for Islamic State is an IT professional who went to two of Srinagar's top Christian missionary schools, played competitive cricket at various levels and ran a software start-up before unrest in the Valley cut short his entrepreneurial journey and forced him to take up a job, his family said on Wednesday.Sehrish Sami, the younger sister of Jahanzaib Sami Wani, said her brother did not have any adverse police record or history of radical behaviour. ""My brother and sister-in-law read the Quran and other religious books, like many Muslims do. How are those 'incriminating' material, as claimed by Delhi Police ? Is reading religious literature a crime?"" she said.Till late on Wednesday, J&K Police apparently hadn't found anything on Wani or his wife Hina Bashir suggesting their involvement in illegal activity in the Valley. ""We are gathering details as of now,"" Srinagar SSP Haseeb Mughal said.An alumnus of Burn Hall and Tyndale Biscoe schools, Wani is the son of businessman and councillor Sami Wani. The family resides in the upmarket Shivpora locality of Srinagar, adjacent to the military headquarters in Jammu and Kashmir.According to Sehrish, her brother wouldn't have left home late last year had the internet shutdown since August 5 not made it impossible for him to work out of the Valley as a project manager of a United Kingdom-based IT company. ""The last time we spoke, he and my sister-in-law were all set to return home as internet services have just been restored in Kashmir,"" she said.Wani and Hina, an MBA in finance and marketing, got married on October 6 and moved into a rented home in southeast Delhi's Okhla on October 26. His employer arranged the accommodation, Sehrish said.Muzaffar Shah, a neighbour of the family in Shivpora, said there was nothing in Wani's behaviour to suspect he had been radicalised and roped in by a terror outfit like IS.Back in 2016, when Kashmir was in the throes of unrest over Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani's death in an encounter with security forces, Jahanzaib Wani was too busy trying to keep his start-up WalurSol afloat, his sister said.""My brother worked in Bengaluru for some time after completing his BTech. He then returned home to launch WalurSol, which shut down in the wake of the violence in 2016,"" Sehrish said. ""He again took up a job in Pune, although his heart was always here despite our father wanting him to settle outside Kashmir.""Wani's father Sami and father-in-law Bashir Ahmad Beig are currently in the capital trying to arrange ""legal remedies"" for their wards, family sources said.On Sunday, Delhi Police's Special Cell announced the arrest of the Kashmiri couple living in a rented flat at Jamia Nagar in Okhla for their alleged links with the Khorasan module of IS. Claiming to have found ""objectionable material"" in their possession, police accused the couple of also inciting protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.Sehrish came to know about her brother and sister-in-law's arrest from their landlord.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74585392,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-164737,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-kashmiri-held-for-is-link-a-startup-founder/articleshow/74585387.cms
496,['12/03/2020'],"Kolkata: Coronavirus spooks domestic flyers, airlines forced to slash fares","Maximum fare lower than usual minimum fare

KOLKATA: The Covid-19 outbreak — and the resultant nosedive in passenger traffic — has forced airlines to slash domestic fares, about a month after international flights.Industry insiders said ticket sales had dropped 15% to 20% over the past fortnight, and airlines started to lure passengers through fare cuts. While some carriers are rationalising flights on sectors, grounding planes doesn’t necessarily minimise loss.“The fares have been slashed to increase occupancy,” said an airline veteran. “Seats are a perishable commodity,” he explained, adding, “Once a flight takes off, the revenue against unoccupied seats is lost. Thus, whatever a carrier can garner from the sale of such seats adds to its coffers.” He said airlines have had a certain degree of comfort from a fall in oil prices, as fuel accounts for nearly 45% of an airline’s operational cost.Some airlines announced sales and sold tickets at rock-bottom fares to fill up empty seats; others reduced fares by as much as 25% to 30%.Though passenger loads and fares are traditionally low during the examination season in February-March, they pick up in April and are very expensive in May. The current scenario, however, was unfo-reseen. The fares are around Rs 2,700 for a flight from Kolkata to Delhi; Rs 3,400 for a flight to Mumbai; and Rs 3,300 for a flight to Bengaluru in April and May.“I haven’t seen immediate fares on all sectors dip this low,” said Manoj Saraf, managing director, Gainwell Travels. “Nor can I recall such low fares, with less than a month to go for schools to shut for summer vacations.”The fares are so unbelievably low that some were tempted to book a trip, when none was planned. “We were thinking about travelling to Europe this summer, but that was before the novel coronavirus scare,” said Amit Ghosh. “Last month, we decided against taking a break at this point. All that deliberation changed when I was casually browsing airfares. It was such a steal that I couldn’t help myself.” Ghosh booked three return tickets to Bagdogra for less than Rs 3,500 each, or under Rs 1,800 one-way.Even return fares during the weekends this month are a bargain. One can buy a return ticket to Delhi at just over Rs 6,000; to Mumbai at a little over Rs 6,500 and to Bengaluru for less than Rs 7,000. In fact, the maximum fare on offer on all the sectors, too, are lower than the usual minimum fare at this time of the year.Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi says hotel tariffs have also touched an all-time low due to low bookings, enabling people who can muster the courage to enjoy a bumper holiday at dirt-cheap prices. “You can actually stay in a five-star property at less than what you would pay for a three-star accommodation in summer,” he said.Internationally, fares have declined to a decade’s low, with return fares to UK and Europe at Rs 52,000, down from Rs 65,000-Rs 75,000, and to the US at Rs 70,000 against Rs 1.25 lakh. Yet, there are no takers, because of the novel coronavirus and uncertainty over how long the problem will last.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74586558,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-259658,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/virus-spooks-domestic-flyers-airlines-forced-to-slash-fares/articleshow/74585092.cms

KOLKATA: Cops are looking to provide all-round security to women in the city, going beyond conventional norms.

“We are planning a multi-pronged approach. We will not only train young girls in unarmed combat but also make them confident about travelling in the city safely. We will go to schools and explain to students about good and bad touch and cyber crime against women,” said Anuj Sharma, commissioner of police. On Wednesday, Kolkata Police unveiled their new initiative, ‘Respect Women’.

As part of it, cops will hold awareness workshops in schools on gender equality and other issues. The initiative was inaugurated by Sharma at the closing ceremony of the third round of Tejashwini — the self-defence training programme for women— at Kolkata Police Athletic Club.

Also present at the event were actor-MP Mimi Chakraborty, actors Abhishek Bachchan and Chitrangada Singh and film-maker Sujoy Ghosh.
