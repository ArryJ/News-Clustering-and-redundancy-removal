Women desperately need magnesium since it’s essential for nerve function and can help enormously with calming anxiety and headaches that affect so many women.Importance and deficiency: Needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body, its many functions include supporting heart health, nerve function and building immunity. It also helps regulate our blood glucose, and thus important for those dealing with insulin resistance and diabetes. Since it acts as a muscle relaxant, it helps relieve muscle cramps and regulates blood pressure. A breakthrough research talked about its role in mental health and mood disorders, like depression, anxiety, insomnia and chronic stress.Sources: Many types of nuts like almonds, cashews, and seeds of watermelon are rich in magnesium. Cutting down on refined sugar and processed foods and instead, incorporating whole grains and cereals is a vital step in upping the magnesium levels in the body.

3,['8/03/2020'],Bengaluru pooh-poohs plastic ban; racks up Rs 2 crore fine,"Challenges in enforcement

Target manufacturers, say activists

‘Know the harm plastic is doing to the world’

List of banned items

Plastic bags of all microns

NWPP or non-woven polypropylene bags (also called fibre, and many believe to be cloth)

Compostable bags or biodegradable or oxo-biodegradable bags. These compost only under specified conditions in industrial composters.

Plastic/thermocol cutlery including bowls, plates, straws, cups, etc.

Plastic sheets and ribbons on flower bouquets

Shiny foil gift paper

BBMP’s biggest plastic ban offenders

Plastic items, especially those below a certain micron weight that are usually for a single use, have been at the top of the city’s hit list of banned items for a while. Yet year-after-year, Bengaluru continues to violate the ban with impunity, with latest figures from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagare Palike ( BBMP ) pointing to a whopping `2.03 crore and counting collected in fines for the current financial year. This, say officials, is the highest ever figure since 2015. “We have collected `2.03 crore as of January this year, and are looking at a much higher figure for the financial year, given that there have already been 500 recorded cases of violation in February,” says Dr Ravikumar, special commissioner projects (BBMP).Although awareness camps have helped spread the word about items on the banned list that citizens, both vendors and users, should avoid, enforcement continues to be a challenge in various pockets of the city. “There are challenges in enforcing a zero-tolerance approach to single-use plastic and the outskirts of Bengaluru remain a challenge. Our enforcement officials can do much better and we are trying to get there,” says Ravikumar.The problem, says Odette Katrak, co-founder Beautiful Bengaluru, is BBMP’s misguided focus. “Yes there is enforcement of the ban, yet there isn’t visible or consistent focus on targetted manufacturers and wholesalers, which would wipe out 90% of the problem,” she says. Ravikumar agrees and adds, “Most of these manufacturers operate outside city limits, so we need to work in tandem with other stakeholders to take strict action against the manufacturers.”The only way to get people to say no to plastic products, is to consistently tell them about the harm each of these items is doing to the environment. “People should have clear knowledge about the banned products that are circulating in the market and the environmental damage their production and use causes. And if you thought that the solution is to replace a plastic bag with a supposedly compostable/ biodegradable or oxo-biodegradable bag, well you are mistaken. These are also not environmentally-friendly and you should say no to these bags,” she sums up.Bengaluru south zone - Rs 52 lakhWest zone - Rs 15 lakhEast zone - Rs 19 lakhBommanahalli Zone - Rs 70 lakhDasarahalli - Rs 7 lakhMahadevpura -Rs 23 lakhYelahanka - Rs 9 LakhRajarajeshwari Nagar - Rs 7.5 lakh",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-pooh-poohs-plastic-ban-racks-up-rs-2-crore-fine/articleshow/74526265.cms

Titled Ye hai STREE , the song is composed by Sowmya in collaboration with music producer Jim Sathya. Artistes like Shreya Ghoshal, Mahalakshmi Iyer, Aditya Narayan, Neha Kakkar, Shaan, Vishal Dadlani and Shankar Mahadevan have lent their voice to this new project, along with Sowmya. “Getting so many popular names to work on one track together has not been easy, but I am glad to have received a positive response from each one of them. The idea is to show unity in gender equality,” says Sowmya.So, what inspired the singer to come up with this concept? “I always wanted to dedicate a song to the idea of men and women celebrating gender equality together. And this dream is finally seeing the light of day,” she explains, adding, “We had a tight schedule for this particular track and the process took about 20 days to complete, including the mixing and the recording of the track.” The song’s lyrics have been penned by Sowmya’s best friend of 30 years, Vickie Bhattacharya.The video is kept simple, featuring frames of the various artistes singing the number. “I want the audience to concentrate more on the song, rather than the video. So, I kept it as minimal as possible,” says the singer. Flautist Ashwith Srinivasan, who has worked with the likes of AR Rahman, is also part of this project, along with sound engineer Praveen Murlidhar.

He has cast actors Sudharani and Bhoomi Shetty as the faces of the two short films. “While one film is about inclusivity, the other tackles gender perceptions. Sudharani’s short film shows her at her residence, handing over a traditional bagina at the end of a puja to one of her guests, who, as it turns out, is a transgender, implying that International Women's Day becomes inclusive. The other short film showcases two siblings (brother and sister) playing ludo . When there is a procession on their street, both of them want to go out and dance.

9,['8/03/2020'],Women who dare,"A woman’s life is a litany of rules: be a lady, be the nurturer, be everything anyone wants her to be – but herself. But each moment, there’s a woman cocking a snook at patriarchy. She breaks free and dares to dare. And just like women – daring comes in different sizes. For some it’s a short haircut, for others, it’s coming out. For a few it’s saying no to a toxic relationship. A short dress, a red lipstick, a late-night stroll – daring is anything that makes you step out of your comfort zone. It’s Meghan Markle refusing Royalty, it’s Jennifer Lopez wearing ‘that’ dress at 50, it’s Greta Thunberg choosing to stay out of school. Closer home, it’s the women of Shaheen Bagh. It’s Mary Kom, who refuses to go quietly in to the night. It’s grand dame Rekha who lives by her rules. It’s the woman sitting next to you in the Metro who steps out to work even though her in-laws object. The woman driving a cab. It’s the girl posting about body stereotypes. And it’s you, who is reading this, because inside all of us there’s a quiet revolution resting. All it takes is one moment, a small step for a woman – but a giant leap for womankind.This issue celebrates women who have challenged norms in their own little way and are now inspiring others to just break free and say “Why not?” Because the only thing that stops you is ‘you’.“I have seen that a strong woman is often seen as “the bad woman” in India (PIC: INSTAGRAM@MASABAGUPTA)I am a regular woman with a mind of my own. I have a problem with the word – “strong” or “bold” or “daring”, which are media constructs. I have seen that a strong woman is often seen as “the bad woman” in India. I have always been called that but in reality, I am vulnerable and honest. So much so that thanks to this tag, I always landed vampish or single woman roles! I had to ask directors for ordinary, gareeb woman roles (laughs).I am often asked how I managed to be a single parent (to Masaba) at that time. People always ask: “Yeh kaise kiya?” But I tell them that in India, there are so many poor women who are forced to be single mothers. The only difference was that I did it by choice. It was tough and I wanted to do it. But I’d like to point out that it’s one thing to live an independent and free life, it’s another to have a misplaced notion of “independence”. Women have to consider all aspects before taking a decision – especially one that involves family.“A lot still needs to change in the way society looks at a woman”Last time, I had written a longish blog for an online portal celebrating women and their success. A lot of women commented, “Every day should be women’s day”. I will simply say, if this day is supposed to mark a change, let’s consider it. A lot still needs to change in the way society looks at a woman. A lot of issues need to be sorted. There is no problem in dedicating a day to mark the beginning of this change. Today, I would want all women to take this pledge: Don’t wait for the police or the government to come and save you. I know we show it in films all the time, but that is not how it happens in reality. You have to be your own hero, be responsible for your own safety.I have been raising my voice in my own way for years; especially, since I have acquired the status of being a celebrity. I would like to urge other celebs to come forward and do the same. It hasn’t been a rosy road for me. I was once told to slash my remuneration because an actor’s market value had come down. I was thrown out midway from another film because the producer said his previous film bombed and he couldn’t change the hero or cut his pay! But all this comes with the territory. Is this going to alter the way I am or the way I think? No. Frankly, as women in business, you just have to be thick-skinned.Nowadays, I have realised that I have to FIGHT – fight to be on the track, fight to be in a relationship, fight to survive. [In June 2014, The Athletic Federation of India disqualified Chand for hyperandrogenism. She fought the case and won]. If higher testosterone levels occur naturally, then it is wrong for authorities to tell athletes to bring down their hormonal levels. Also, why are there different tests for athletes? There are no rules for men. There has to be a balance somewhere. If there is not, I will raise my voice. When I started out, I would go about my business and leave it to God. But I think once we have made up our mind that enough is enough, no force can stop us. We (women) need to find that spirit.PIC: INSTAGRAM@THERICHACHADHAI have an aversion towards these so called “smart” coinages like ‘power women’, ‘strong women’. These words mean nothing. Being a woman is synonymous with being powerful. So, why give it another adjective? I have done many things which typically don’t fall in my comfort zone because I was born to take up challenges. But when I did that stand-up act towards the later half of 2019 – that was really pushing myself. Did I regret it? Hell, no! In today’s day and age, all that matters is how you make yourself heard. The only way to deal with everyday sexism is to speak up – and support women who speak up.Women dare to do things differently every day. A dare can be a challenge to do small things in a different way. It’s not just the big things. In my life, I have done quite a lot of ‘daring’ things – like going to auditions at universities at age 14. I was scared yet determined. Then packing up and moving to India to pursue a career here after just one visit and one TV show. How do you dare? Well, you go with the gut feeling. Women in every generation have their own dares. If it scares the hell out of you but also excites you then you should do it. Not blindly or foolishly. Keep your wits. But you have only this life. You live in your own skin. No one can live your life for you. So you might as well jump!“The concept of gender role division is alien to me. It was never defined in my house that a man will do this and the woman will do that”The biggest lesson I have learnt is that of equality. My parents have instilled in us the strong fundamental belief that girls can achieve anything. It (our being girls) makes zero difference to them and it shouldn’t make any difference to anyone in the world. There were a lot of people who used to tell my father back then: “You have two girls, no one to carry forward your lineage.” And my answer to them was – I will always be a Mirza because it is something that has been given to me by my parents. And my child will take my surname along with my husband’s name. As my sister and I grew older, we had the freedom to make our decisions. Our parents trusted us enough to give us that independence and respect it. There is no point giving someone the freedom to decide and then telling him/her “Sorry it doesn’t work that way”.This concept of role division according to gender is alien to me. It was never defined in my house that a man will do this and the woman will do that. My mother was a businesswoman and an equally good homemaker. She never said she wanted to sacrifice her career for raising kids. The same is the case between Shoaib and me. We do whatever comes to us naturally. For instance, I have no interest in cooking while he is a good cook. And we are both not judged for it.PIC: ENRIC GALCERANThe most daring step I took in my life was opening my covered face in front of a big gathering. I let them see my disfigured face and kill their curiosity. I can’t say it was expected from me by society, because as a girl, who lost her face or so-called “beauty”, it was no longer part of my identity. But it was my father’s wish that I start to live life again – so I did it. In my case, daring comes with a tag of “survivor”. Survivors are never expected to be strong women behind the scene. You are expected to live life on the sympathies of others. There are challenges every woman faces in her own way. There’s always been a fight for gender equality. But after surviving something, it makes this fight even broader and ongoing. Inequality exists in so many ways. The huge pay gap in every industry is the first. And being questioned or overlooked on work done by women. Being daring means many things depending on a woman’s socio-economic background. But there’s been a change. We play many roles, some are expected and accepted, some are not, yet. Women need to keep raising their voices. It’s TIME!My role models: Michelle Obama, Gloria Steinem, Ellen DeGeneres, Sushma Swaraj, Sanna Marin (Finland Prime Minister) & Mahua Moitra to name a few.Being daring for a woman, in my opinion, means creating your space and standing up for yourself. Amidst all responsibilities, following our passion is extremely important and liberating. I think it’s time we get done with this thought process where a woman has to put her career at stake. I recently tweeted to the sports minister Kiren Rijiju, explaining to him that poker is a skill-based game and should be respected as a mind game sport, a game that requires a lot of training, dedication and some exceptional skills. That was daring for me. Anyone who speaks her mind and heart is trolled irrespective of the platform; I feel that the trolling women face is done by spineless keyboard warriors who have never left their basements. And this is a metaphor for their ignorance. Being worried about people’s perception is not going to lead anywhere.PIC: ASHUTOSH TRIPATHITo have my own ideas and sticking to them despite people’s gendered expectations about what I should do with life. There is still a lot of bias and stereotypes that work against women and other genders. Professionally, there is a commitment towards diversity in representation. But it is not working in most places because real engagement with gender issues is lacking. You can’t just say you are pro-inclusivity, you have to do the work for it. There have always been fearless femmes. Personally, I look up to women scientists I’ve been interviewing who have defied the odds and trans people and gender non binary people who are challenging patriarchies to change the narratives. Women are being censured and their perspective erased. Example: Why else would a movie inspired by ISRO women sending a spacecraft to Mars need a male hero?“When it comes to women, empowerment is seen as a favour bestowed on them when it is actually every woman’s right”Since childhood, I’ve been very inquisitive. Not in the “miss nosy parker” kind of way, but by asking tough questions. As a teenager, I questioned why I was not allowed in the kitchen during my period? Why were boys allowed to wear shorts and I wasn’t? Why could I not expose my stomach in a crop top, but could in a saree? As a young adult, I was curious to know: why I could not stay single? Why it was not a good idea to run a business of my own? Why I had to decide my job profile based on my in-laws or husband’s choices? Why did I have to keep quiet about domestic violence? Why was I being forced to have a baby at the time when I wanted to build my career?Today, as a woman entrepreneur for nearly a decade, I can proudly say that through it all, I have dared to be free of social and religious norms. The starting point of this attitude was when I realised it was my human right to live a life of my choice. The outcome of my courage on the professional front has helped me build my business. Being daring for a woman has not changed much over the centuries. Till date, in many parts of the world, a woman has to only try to claim her basic human rights to be seen as ‘daring’. Even in modern society, any woman who challenges regressive social norms, makes her own decisions and does not accept second-class treatment continues to be called daring. To add to it, a woman also faces either bouquets or brickbats depending on how she chooses to be daring. For instance, Mary Kom is considered daring in the positive sense for excelling in a ‘masculine’ sport. The label of being “a daring woman” is society’s stamp on women for breaking away from gender norms. But the truth is being daring for anyone is to set goals and achieve them without giving up.“My greatest lesson has been this, find another woman who needs some confidence to do something she dreams of, throw love at her, believe in her and watch her shine. Dare to love someone till they have no choice but to succeed”I think the most important thing for any woman is having the courage to believe in herself. Women grow up with less confidence than they should due to social conditioning, unattainable standards of beauty and an unhealthy dose of patriarchy. It takes the courage to push yourself forward, even when you don’t entirely believe in yourself, or when you are afraid you will fail. Being a daring woman doesn’t mean you have to scale mountains. It means giving yourself a chance when you don’t think you have or deserve one. I think my most daring moment came when I decided to up and move to Mumbai in 2000 with nothing to my name – hardly any money in the bank and probably one friend in the city. I suffered (and still suffer) from crippling stage fright, adult acne and the fear of rejection. Overcoming that has taught me that if you work hard with your heart in the right place, you are bound to succeed.In the world of business, both in India and globally, people are often thought to be on the backend, with an entertainer representing it on the frontlines. Breaking that trend, and being called India’s Model CEO by Forbes was my most daring move. It was unconventional because while being daring in their professional lives, businesswomen often tend to compromise to fit the perceived mould of a working woman. This can be suppressing, because men are not expected to be uni-dimensional. Women like Amal Clooney, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other brave women who are on frontlines defending human rights inspire me. Social media is an instrumental platform in helping more women speak up and make themselves heard on women rights, gender equality and more. As long as one believes that a woman should be valued for her intelligence, her personality and her work, the positives will always outweigh the negatives.Back in grade 4, there was a boy “Gaurav”. He used to touch my legs inappropriately. The incident continued for some days. He used to follow me. I couldn’t understand who to talk to, how to say what was happening. One day, I gathered all my courage and slapped him. The next day, I was really scared to go to school, but I was surprised to see him hiding from me. He was afraid to face me. That day, I realised that we should not let go of things which are not right. We should stand and fight it, and once you do that the fear in you, just goes away. I am a better driver than my husband, but many people still think women can’t drive. Being a pilot, I have heard a lot of people remarking: “Women can’t even drive a car properly, how can they fly a plane?” Stereotypes such as these are what we need to break.My role models: Kangana Ranaut and my mother.My decision to become a full-time freelance illustrator, in March 2018, scared the living day lights out of me. That was my most daring move. I come from a family where I was always given the freedom to pursue anything I wished to. Unfortunately, not a lot of Indian households follow that. It can be very difficult to break free from something that you’ve always been told to do.My role model: Sudha Murthy – in a world where everyone is trying to stand out, it is rare to find people like her.As told to Nupur Amarnath, Nona Walia, Deebashree Mohanty, Haimanti Mukherjee",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74508976,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-201110/74508976.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/women-who-dare/articleshow/74508785.cms

Check.But as you modern day women take your first work trip of the year, your healthy habits don’t always travel with you.One study revealed that 44% people are more prone to unhealthy eating while travelling for work. Another completely different survey discovered that the same number of business travellers gained weight during their trips. Not a coincidence then. Travel, by definition, is disruptive. But even with its inherent complications, staying healthy is very doable. And for those who think that a small break from your regular routine doesn’t matter, think about how long it will take you to get back on track on your return. In this two-part series, we will first address common mistakes that women work travellers often make:Breakfast is the most important meal of the day because it’s the first bit of fuel your body gets, and eating it on time is equally crucial. Several studies have shown that your body burns more at 8 am than 8 pm – following the power of circadian rhythm of the body helps you burn more. Breakfast does not have to be a big deal: a quick idli and sambhar can be that jumpstart for your metabolism.Many forget to drink water on their work trips, causing dehydration. Do note that your brain is 73% water, and it takes only 2% dehydration to affect attention, memory and other cognitive functions... all important for your work trip. You also wind up eating more than you usually would. This is because the thirst and hunger centres of the brain are located very close together, and often you may wind up eating when what you actually need is water.TRIP AS wellness breakA work trip simply means you are working remotely. It may be a break from your regular surroundings, but it’s still an office on wheels, not a recreational break. If you start a trip with that belief, you may be more successful in finishing it with your health goals intact.With more and more business hotels offering gyms, yoga sessions and exercise options, travellers simply don’t have the excuse to not work out. Even 15-20 minutes of exercise can make a difference. In the next part, I’ll be outlining nutritional strategies for work trips that have proven to be successful, and how you can have your cake, and work it off too. You’d be surprised at how little it takes to stay on track.Who wants to be left out when the boss is drinking? Nothing is more professionally isolating than being ‘that’ person who is nursing a glass of beer while everyone else seems to be having the time of their lives. Don’t fall for this trap. Pace yourself. You need a clear head anyway.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74509844,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-159876/74509844.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/diet/travel-diet-for-women/articleshow/74509807.cms
11,['8/03/2020'],Would you like your kids to be more Fido-friendly?,"The friendship of a dog is beautiful and unconditional. Teaching your kid to be pet friendly goes a long way in teaching them compassion and respect for other living creatures. Growing up with dogs in the family is the best way to get children accustomed to them, but with busy schedules and more independent living, all of us may not have that option. Fear of dogs when it comes to kids can stem from various factors – inexperience or ignorance, maybe a previous bad experience, or sometimes, even from a parent who is fearful of dogs. Here are a couple of things to keep in mind when you’re trying to get a child to stop being fearful of our furry friends.Early exposure to dogs can result in children growing up with fond memories of animals and these impressions tend to last. You can start as early as when your child is a year old and just beginning to get his/her bearings in life.Begin by introducing the child to a friendly adult dog that is well socialised with children, and hence, knows how to be calm around them. This means no jumping on kids or play biting or any behaviours that might scare an already apprehensive child. While puppies are smaller and super cute, they are still in the learning phase, and might be a bit nippy sometimes. This can actually end up frightening the child more – a reason why an adult dog is always preferable.Involve the dog in an activity your kid enjoys. If he/she likes going to the park they can meet there, if he/she plays a sport the dog can watch them there, or if they go for an evening drive or stroll the dog can tag along. This way the child associates having the dog around for all fun activities and then looks forward to meeting the dog.When you’re introducing your child to a dog, don’t force any interactions. If your kid is so afraid that s/he won’t go near a dog then the first couple of times s/he may just watch the dog, or toss a toy without necessarily going near him/her. He or she can even interact with the dog just by walking along side, or reading while sitting in the same room. There’s no need for any physical contact if your child isn’t comfortable. You can ease your child into petting the dog at a later stageDog introductions can start as early as when children are a year old. Early exposure to dogs resulting in positive experiences will ensure that those kids grow up with fond memories that will last a lifetime.Tanya PatelThe writer is a Mumbai-based dog trainer and animal behaviouristAre you a proud pet parent?

12,['8/03/2020'],Stories of Sita and Greta Thunberg to come alive on stage in Bengaluru,"On International Women’s Day today, Bengaluru gets to witness two plays on inspirational women. While the first is about goddess Sita , the other revolves around young Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg . The plays, titled Ramayana and Greta, are being staged at Ranga Shankara.Playwright and director Prasanna says that he chose these two characters for a particular reason. “We aim to give give a new meaning to feminism because today’s world has become extremely masculine, angry and arrogant. Just take a look at our current political and financial state, or even the way society functions,” says Prasanna, adding, “The reason we chose Sita and Greta is because both are referred to as daughters of the earth. Sita, according to the Ramayana, is called a daughter of the earth, and Greta is the contemporary daughter trying to protect the earth. They share a common concern, even though they are separated by time. While the subject is serious, the plays will address these issues with a touch of humour.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74526165,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-117145/74526165.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/theatre/stories-of-sita-and-greta-thunberg-to-come-alive-on-stage-in-bengaluru/articleshow/74526165.cms
13,['8/03/2020'],Sashaying along in style,"In a biopic of the designer Yves Saint Laurent, there’s a scene where the titular character is toiling in the atelier of Christian Dior. There’s a model who is not too happy with her dress and Saint Laurent simply walks over to her and wraps a long sash around her to “give her a waist”. She is happy with the way the sash changes the look of her dress. And that, my friends, is the power of the sash.The power of the simple sash was in full force when FLOTUS Melania Trump walked out of Air Force One wearing a white crème crepe jumpsuit designed by Atelier Caito for Herve Pierre. The clincher — or shall we say cincher — was a green silk sash tied at the waist. The eye-catching sash was apparently cut out of an ancient Indian textile with zari. “We used the border which was the most interesting piece we could use as it was a vintage piece,” informs the designer’s official Instagram post when they posted the design of the dress. This was a soft diplomatic move on the FLOTUS’ part as a nod to traditional weaves.The First Lady’s style choices have always been deployed as a powerful political tool to engage with the host country on diplomatic visits. Previously, Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton too chose many Indian designers to wear over the course of their visits. But it’s the sash that got the people talking. Always considered more ceremonial than the belt, to put it simply a sash is definitely more sassy and Trump’s take on it will create a new wave of styling possibilities. Sashes traditionally form part of formal military attire and most of the European royal families wear sashes as a part of their royal (and/or military) regalia. But designers have been rethinking them time and again. Raf Simons in his stint with Dior used a light pink chiffon sash asymmetrically on a black strapless midi dress and another on a backless gown. In 2014, Roksanda Ilincic designed a jumpsuit with a waist sash.Rosie Assoulin is known for well-done sash-ery. Her designs have sashes on tops, dresses, gowns and pants – and done so consummately that they feel organic to the clothes as if a sash was only stopping its high-fashion potential.Just like Trump, who built interest in an otherwise stark outfit, a sash can help create a visual anchor to a look. A good sash tied well can create volume on top and slimness on bottom, or vice versa. The best part is that unlike a belt with its notches, a sash is one size fits all. Just like a belt, a sash is all about placing it right to create a flattering silhouette and owning the look. For instance, sareesta Ashwini Narayan uses sashes as belts to create interesting drapes that seem gown-inspired and cocktail-ready.The sash can be styled as an obi-belt which has been uber popular of late on the runways and outside. The thick sash, obi-belt look can create an elongated waist that is flattering for most body types. To give extra sass to sash, tie it with a bow. This look translates well with pants, skirts and plain dresses – anything that is already non-fussy. It’s a good alternative to the ubiquitous belt and looks great as you sashay down.Wide-legged pants look tailormade for a sash or wear it vintage-style with a bow at the back with summer dresses(From L to R)1. Wear it like Margot Robbie who wore an ostrich feather as a sash top2. Go like Kajol with a sash belt over a skirt3. Try Melania Trump’s style and pep up a plain outfit with a traditional sash4. Shilpa Shetty ties her monochrome belt as a sash(From L to R)5. Sareefluencer Ashwini Narayan wears an ikat sash over a saree6. Try Kriti Sanon’s style of wearing a long sash train witha dress7. Actor Joanne Tucker wears a gown with a sashA sash is a decorative length of cloth worn as a broad belt or over the shoulder, often for ceremonial or other formal occasions. A sash can be a belt but a belt cannot be a sash. A sash is more unstructured and even a scarf can double up as one. It’s worn on the shoulder too.A belt is a band worn around the waist to hold clothing to one’s body (usually pants), hold weapons (such as a gun or sword), or serve as a decorative piece of clothing. It usually has a buckle or a hook. While belts have become an everyday accessory, the sash is considered mostly ceremonial",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74525161,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-502981/74525161.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/buzz/sashaying-along-in-style/articleshow/74525161.cms
14,['8/03/2020'],Bengaluru pooh-poohs plastic ban; racks up Rs 2 crore fine,"Plastic bags of all microns

NWPP or non-woven polypropylene bags (also called fibre, and many believe to be cloth)

Compostable bags or biodegradable or oxo-biodegradable bags. These compost only under specified conditions in industrial composters.

Plastic/thermocol cutlery including bowls, plates, straws, cups, etc.

Plastic sheets and ribbons on flower bouquets

Shiny foil gift paper

Plastic items, especially those below a certain micron weight that are usually for a single use, have been at the top of the city’s hit list of banned items for a while. Yet year-after-year, Bengaluru continues to violate the ban with impunity, with latest figures from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagare Palike (BBMP) pointing to a whopping `2.03 crore and counting collected in fines for the current financial year. This, say officials, is the highest ever figure since 2015. “We have collected `2.03 crore as of January this year, and are looking at a much higher figure for the financial year, given that there have already been 500 recorded cases of violation in February,” says Dr Ravikumar, special commissioner projects (BBMP).Although awareness camps have helped spread the word about items on the banned list that citizens, both vendors and users, should avoid, enforcement continues to be a challenge in various pockets of the city. “There are challenges in enforcing a zero-tolerance approach to single-use plastic and the outskirts of Bengaluru remain a challenge. Our enforcement officials can do much better and we are trying to get there,” says Ravikumar.The problem, says Odette Katrak, co-founder Beautiful Bengaluru, is BBMP’s misguided focus. “Yes there is enforcement of the ban, yet there isn’t visible or consistent focus on targetted manufacturers and wholesalers, which would wipe out 90% of the problem,” she says. Ravikumar agrees and adds, “Most of these manufacturers operate outside city limits, so we need to work in tandem with other stakeholders to take strict action against the manufacturers.”The only way to get people to say no to plastic products, is to consistently tell them about the harm each of these items is doing to the environment. “People should have clear knowledge about the banned products that are circulating in the market and the environmental damage their production and use causes. And if you thought that the solution is to replace a plastic bag with a supposedly compostable/ biodegradable or oxo-biodegradable bag, well you are mistaken. These are also not environmentally-friendly and you should say no to these bags,” she sums up.Bengaluru south zone - Rs 52 lakhWest zone - Rs 15 lakhEast zone - Rs 19 lakhBommanahalli Zone - Rs 70 lakhDasarahalli - Rs 7 lakhMahadevpura -Rs 23 lakhYelahanka - Rs 9 LakhRajarajeshwari Nagar - Rs 7.5 lakh",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74526241,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-253679/74526241.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/bengaluru-pooh-poohs-plastic-ban-racks-up-rs-2-crore-fine/articleshow/74526241.cms
15,['8/03/2020'],Bengaluru sets its date to revisit the tales of the queens of India,"That gender stereotyping is deep-seated in history is no secret, so much so that even the fearless queens, who made a mark in our glorious past, were counted only after the kings. The ranis receiving the kind of gratitude bestowed on the rajas was a rare thing even then. Storyteller Vikram Sridhar ’s much-talked-about performance-session, Ranis of India , puts the spotlight on the heroic tales of those long-forgotten queens of our country.

This International Women’s Day, Vikram is bringing as many as 30 such unheard stories to the audience. “This storytelling session is an attempt to have relook the information that we have about the ranis of our country, and add our own perspective to it. The aim is not just to revisit, but also question our understanding of the queens. There was a reason queens used to sit next to the kings — because, they were equally powerful,” he says.

One of the stories is that of Rani Abbakka Chowta, who was the first Tuluva queen of Ullal, in coastal Karnataka. She fought the Portuguese in the latter half of the 16th Century. “No one had expected her to take up the challenge, but she did and won the battle too,” says Vikram, whose research on this subject went on for nearly four years. Then there was the little-known ‘Pepper Queen’, also known as Rani Channa Bhairadevi, who was popular for her fierceness and patriotism. The session also music and sound effects, with other theatrical elements. “With these stories from across the nation, I am trying to change our perspective on what we knew about the Indian queens until now,” Vikram signs off.

I think it was his boy-next-door look which worked. His words, both on screen and off screen, are always quite inspiring. He always behaves like an elder brother whenever I interact with him and often advices to turn bad situations in our favour. Ours is a family which has been into farming for several generations. Though I wasn’t keen on pursuing it, it was Kaththi which made me close to agriculture. Now, I am a proud farmer.I met him for the first time during the shoot of Sivakasi. But it was in Pollachi, during the shoot of Velayudham, that I got a chance to take a photo with him. There was a huge crowd waiting in queue to click pictures with him. When I was behind just three or four people, the camera stopped working. I used to have a penchant for photography then; I owned a studio at Theni. I asked if my camera could be used for taking pictures. I was glad that around 300 fans could click photos with my camera. I went there to meet Thalapathy for a minute, but ended up spending more than an hour! When the photo shoot was almost done, he agreed to click one more photo with me. He had noticed that the photo shoot with fans had gone well because of my camera.Watching his films frequently and traveling to other places when his movies did not release in Theni have always been the norm. Among his films, I think it’s Theri which I have watched the maximum number of times in the theatre… close to 150 times. I have even watched Sura more than 100 times. Burning camphor on palm is a practice I did thrice during the FDFS of his films. It was for Sarkar that I did the last time. My birthday, too, fell on the same day. But somehow, Thalapathy saw the photo in Facebook and warned me not to do it. In fact, he was very angry and told me to refrain from doing such practices to make him happy.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74526907,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-569882/74526907.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/fan-moment-im-a-proud-farmer-now-because-kaththi-got-me-close-to-agriculture-says-theni-pandi/articleshow/74526907.cms

After trying to get his career going for many years, it is now, in his 25th year in the film industry that the actor has reached a stage where he is in demand. We spoke to him about what the landmark means to him and his upcoming projects...“I have been waging battles throughout my career. It was the role of Victor in Yennai Arindhal that finally lit the spark of my career,” begins Arun and adds, “When we went as a family to watch the preview of the film, after the show, Ajith was the first one who came to me and said, ‘People, will call you Victor after seeing the movie’. My father (veteran actor Vijayakumar) gave me a tight, one-minute hug after watching the film. After that, I have been able to establish myself as an actor, working with many good directors and picking good stories.”I always believe in a good story and in the coming days, you will see me experimenting with different genres.”Talking about his upcoming movies, he says, “My next release is Sinam, a cop story with Haridas fame GNR Kumaravelan. It will be a socially responsible movie that will not be preachy. It will deal with a contemporary problem faced by women in society.” The actor is also playing an interesting role in Moodar Koodam Naveen’s Agni Siragugal along with Vijay Antony. “The film will be an action-packed entertainer,” he says and adds, “A major portion of the film is shot in European countries and Russia.” He has also teamed up with his Kuttram 23 director Arivazhagan for an action thriller, which has gone on floors recently.But the film that his fans are extremely curious about is Boxer , directed by Vivek, especially after its first look went viral on social media. “I am playing a character with three shades in the movie — one is that of an MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) boxer, and I will have to weigh around 85kg for that; I am also playing a lightweight boxer, for which I need me to weigh around 70kg; the third one is a more interesting shade and will surprise people. We have paused shoot on the film for now as it requires a change in my physique. It will be one of the big-budget films in my career. Since it needs more time and money, we have decided to go slow and steady with it,” reveals the actor.Arun also states that he misses working on films with the rustic flavour of the southern districts like Madurai. “It has been a long time since Manja Velu and Malai Malai, which were released a decade ago.

What a crazy, wild game it turned out to be. Lucian Goian’s own goal and Mourtada Fall ’s towering header gave a 2-0 advantage to the hosts inside the first 20 minutes. Goa needed just another one to complete the Miracle of Fatorda, but it were Chennaiyin who silenced the crowd in the second half with goals from Lallianzuala Chhangte (52nd minute) and Nerijus Valskis (59).

It seemed all over with some fans leaving the stadium despite half an hour left on the clock. Goa now needed four more to go through. Edu Bedia (81) and Fall (83) raised hopes of another magical comeback, but Chennaiyin survived the fierce onslaught for a deserving place in the title clash.

Goa, who finished as League winners, will now watch the final at Fatorda, from television sets at home. They would wonder what went wrong for them, and it all goes back to those 25 second half minutes in Chennai when they conceded four goals. Here too, there were defensive errors; goalkeeper Mohammad Nawaz pushing the ball away into the path of Chhangte and the defence taking a nap when Valskis headed home Rafael Crivellaro’s cornerkick.

The two away goals were gold for Chennaiyin. Despite the loss in the second leg, nobody will grudge them of a place in the final. Since picking up just one point from their first four games and six from the first seven, Owen Coyle’s side have looked the fiercest.

Goa started well with waves of attack. The return of Hugo Boumous and Brandon Fernandes from injuries was a timely boost, but Boumous couldn’t last beyond the first 20 minutes. Edu replaced him and kept up the momentum, although without their most in-form and unpredictable player, Goa were left with a mountain to climb.

Goa’s first two goals came from set-pieces. Jackichand Singh’s cross was turned into his own goal by Goian and Fall rose high to head Brandon’s well-measured freekick. It seemed a dream start.

Then early in the second half, Jackichand missed his footing from handshaking distance. That proved costly as Chennaiyin grabbed the lifeline with two away goals in seven minutes.

Goa did show the stomach for a fight. Fall moved up and his physical presence saw him create one for Edu and score himself. The crowd were up on their feet for the last 10 minutes. There was nervous excitement. But after a 1-4 defeat in the first leg, the League winners had always left themselves with too much to do in the end.

23,['8/03/2020'],"Men, how about celebrating this Women’s Day by watching 'Thappad'?","""Subtle, nuanced, impactful and a movie that has made both women and men cry,” is how Anubhav Sinha ’s ' Thappad ' is being defined by acclaimed directors and the audience. It not only talks about domestic violence but also the gender roles and stereotypes we have normalised in our society. The film, which stars Taapsee Pannu in the lead, questions the societal conditioning that makes people blind to the unfairness behind the ‘ sirf ek thappad’. So men, on Women’s Day today, why not move beyond the cliched long social media posts and pictures with the women in your lives, and actually thank them by watching a film that will make you value them more? “On Women’s Day, everyone should do one thing they feel will take us towards gender equality – and getting rid of stereotypes and conditioning will surely be a step in that direction. It will be great if this Women’s Day, men take the women in their lives along to watch the film. It will help them see their relationship in a newer, better light and reduce the gender gap,” says Taapsee. Anubhav adds, “We need to realise how our minds are conditioned to not know what went behind our packed lunch boxes, besides the obvious, of course. We were not conditioned to feel thankful about those million small things everyday. A movie can’t wake us up to all those, but 'Thappad' gently nudged people in that direction.” Appreciating the effort of the entire cast and crew of the movie, producer Bhushan Kumar says, “'Thappad' is a very important film in today’s time. Anubhav showed our audience a reflection of the society we live in and started a conversation that can bring about change. We need the support of our audiences in helping this film’s message reach everywhere, leading to a reform in our society.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74526633,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-262269/74526633.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/men-how-about-celebrating-this-womens-day-by-watching-thappad/articleshow/74526284.cms

25,['8/03/2020'],Musician Karan Kulkarni lashes out at Tanishk Bagchi,"Music composer Karan Kulkarni is upset with Tanishk Bagchi after the latter recently said that the background score of ' Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan ' had parts of his compositions and songs.Karan says, “Tanishk may have composed the songs for the film, but the background score was created by me. I have always believed in and worked on original music and none of my works have had remixes or borrowed parts. I am known in the advertising industry for my unique sound. For someone to point a finger and claim that my work is his, must take a great deal of insecurity. I thought this used to happen back in the day, but for it to still exist, really surprises me. I never got to hear the songs of 'Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan' before its release. So, how would I have used them in my music? I have videos to prove that we have done it all ourselves.”Karan, who has composed songs and done the background score for films like 'Shahid', 'Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota', ' Tumhari Sulu ' and others, further says, “As a musician, you generally try to promote and encourage other musicians and support a healthy ecosystem. After all, it is an art form. If composers start fighting between themselves and start accusing each other, then I don’t think that’s a healthy system for us to be in. I don’t have anything to say against Tanishk, but why is he trying to accuse me? This is not something that I would do to another musician unless it was true.”When we spoke to Tanishk about this, he said, “Karan is a good musician and I am not blaming him for anything. Using parts of songs as background score is common. I feel that when you do a full album, if the background music also comes to the music director , then it becomes easier for him to set the vibe of the entire film. But again, I am not accusing anyone. My idea is clear regarding this; when you have songs in the film, why not compose for the entire film with background score, themes, teasers, trailers and end credits? Generally, themes are made from the main songs.”“Have all the love and respect for your work @tanishkbagchi originals+remixes. And am sure you will do well as a background music director too, but don’t discount the original work @karankulkarni has put in for SMZS. Using some riffs in the background music helps create a cohesive sound for the film (sic).”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74525774,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-77484/74525774.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/music/news/musician-karan-kulkarni-lashes-out-at-tanishk-bagchi/articleshow/74525774.cms

27,['8/03/2020'],"Peppy, non-preachy and cool: Bollywood anthems for the strong women achievers","Be it an event dedicated to women empowerment or a women sports team winning laurels, there are some Bollywood songs that remain a constant at these celebrations. From ' Dhaakad ' to 'Badal Pe Paon Hain', these songs have become ‘women anthems’. On International Women’s Day, the creators of these tracks tell us that they aren’t surprised by the fact that these songs emerged as “forever favourites” of people across age groups, irrespective of their gender. One reason for their popularity, they say, is that these tracks aren’t preachy – instead, they are cool, peppy and relatable.'Highway’s' Patakha Guddi remains a favourite with the young audience. Sung by Nooran Sisters, the song is a hit even at fashion events and is one of the most played songs at Sufi nights across restaurants. In an interview, the two sisters said that out of all the songs they have sung, Patakha Guddi will always be their favourite.Raftaar says that out of all the songs that he has sung, Dhaakad is the one he is most proud to be associated with. He says that it is the kind of song he always wanted to do. What makes Dhaakad special is that it doesn’t try to give a message and simply talks about “every woman who is an achiever in her own way.” Raftaar tells us, “We always hear about what one should or shouldn’t do, but I’ve never followed any rulebook. The best part about Dhaakad is that it doesn’t preach, and it boosts the morale of anyone who hears it. The song is about women who don’t have to prove to anyone that they are equal. It feels good to see that Dhaakad became the song that makes every woman proud.”A film that gave a new definition to women empowerment, 'Chak De! India' had not just one, but two amazing songs – Badal Pe Paon Hain and Ek Hockey Doongi Rakh Ke. Salim-Sulaiman, who composed the songs, say that it was challenging to compose tracks for women who were not stars or popular faces, but strong characters who represented girls from every walk of life. “The filmmaker wanted a rock and roll song and we didn’t have any reference to create it. We wanted the music to reflect the spirit of these young girls who were working hard to realise their dreams. I think what made Badal Pe Paon popular was that it had hope, it signifies the journey of these girls – they come from small towns and villages and get a chance to fly for the first time. The song had a message that resonated with every girl,” says Salim, adding that his other all-time favourite ‘women anthem’ is Salaam India from Mary Kom. “It is my favourite because I find it very inspiring,” he adds.‘ Muh tod de’, ‘ halkat’, ‘ muhfat’ – it was the lyrics of Aali Re that impressed Sonu Kakkar when she was offered the song. “What makes this song popular is its spirit and energy. When Amit Trivedi approached me with this song, I was impressed with its peppy lyrics, as it says a lot about the women of today. It has an attitude. I was told that since this song is about strong, modern women, sing it with full josh. That’s what made Aali Re special. I was repeatedly reminded k i khul ke gaao. The song resonates with women of all age groups because it has a cool vibe. I think it was one of my best works because I enjoyed singing it,” she shares.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74526848,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-291567/74526848.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/peppy-non-preachy-and-cool-bollywood-anthems-for-the-strong-women-achievers/articleshow/74526767.cms

Women learning karate at Green Park Stadium (BCCL/ AS Rathor)

Age is just a number and that what some elderly ladies of Kanpur are proving. In the age of 60s and 70s, when most of the women prefer leading a relaxed life and give a miss to outdoor activities, these grannies and mums from Kanpur are learning the art of self-defense. The idea of learning karate at this age is not just to maintain their physical strength and fitness, they in fact feel that learning martial art will also help them in their safety.65-year-old homemaker Rajshree Shah is a more confident woman now as she has joined a karate class at the Green Park Stadium , recently. “I was really surprised when I saw many women older than me learning karate in the stadium. Seeing them I also decided to join the classes so that I could also learn the martial art. Though I have joined the karate classes recently, after attending the classes I feel that my confidence level has improved in comparison to earlier. What’s interesting is that the karate classes are not only improving my fitness level but it is also helping me gain my confidence level, which I lost because of growing age.”Rajshree Shah is not the only elderly woman who is learning karate in Green Park Stadium, in fact 72-year-old Asha Singh is also doing the same. She feels that learning karate will surely provide her with the strength to safeguard herself from any crime. “The biggest lesson this karate class has given me is that now I have firmly started believing in theory of apni suraksha apne haanth. Many times I come across news article where criminals have targeted elderly people. Kai baar old age log chain snatching jaise crime ka bhi shikar ho jaate hain. But after learning some smart karate techniques in the classes I feel that I can save myself against such crimes. I have noticed that the routine practice of karate has improved my response timing. Also, earlier I used to panic in emergencies but now I stay cool and respond as per the need of the moment,” says Asha.Women learning karate at Green Park Stadium (BCCL/ AS Rathor)Manju Srivastava, a 55-year-old homemaker is also attending the karate classes regularly, because she feels that with help of the martial art, skills and proper training she can easily handle predators who target the elderly. “If you are properly trained and know the correct technique then you can easily handle a young person who is attacking you. The best thing about these karate classes is that the trainers train you with proper combat skill. The trainers tell you how can easily get out of the grip of the attacker. They also tell us about the vital spots of the human body.”With constant training 63-year-old Tara Singh has turned a pro when it comes to disarming or overpowering an attackers. She says, “Though I am learning karate quite late in life but after starting to learn it I realised that it was very much required. After attending the classes for few days, I have noticed that my physical strength has improved and what’s impressive about the karate classes is that the instructors not only train us about martial art skills in fact they also share the information about various safety mobile applications. They tell us that how in an emergency situation with a single click on the app we can get in touch with the police and how they can monitor our location. I feel that the training in totality is good enough to deal with any emergency situation.”Women learning karate at Green Park Stadium (BCCL/ AS Rathor)And training these grandmoms is Vijay Kumar who has represented India nationally and internationally in various karate championships and is now an international referee. Vijay feels that these martial art classes will surely benefit the elderly women of Kanpur. “While travelling abroad I noticed that a lot of elderly women learn martial art. It not just keeps them fit in fact it also adds to their confidence level. Initially, I designed this karate class for women from 6 to 90 years of age. But what surprised me that a lot of women from the age group of 55 years to 90 years joined the classes. Till now there are a hundred plus women who have joined the classes and more will be joining us soon,” says Vijay Kumar.",kanpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74527692,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-388447,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kanpur-grannies-and-mums-go-for-some-age-defying-action/articleshow/74527679.cms

TRAVELLING SOLO IS EDUCATIONAL

Anjuri Tandon enjoying a breathtaking view in Jamaica (BCCL)

Travelling solo while being a female can be daunting and challenging for a few. Yet, these days more and more women are trying to adventure out alone, even going overseas and exploring new destinations. Solo travel for women has gained such momentum that a lot of travel portals across the country are organising exclusive women-centric trips and tours. In fact, more than half of the solo backpackers on domestic overnight trips are actually women, according to a survey. One of the major reasons for this trend is, women becoming more independent and economically empowered.As these vagabonds travel alone they realise how rewarding and enriching the experience is. On International Women’s Day, we got in touch with a few of these fearless ladies and asked them to share their experience.Raghavi Agarwal, a recent graduate, who has travelled to several countries alone and almost half of India, when asked about her solo travels said, “Over the last couple of years, after spending days and nights with people from all over the world, I have realised that the one person I need to spend the most amount of time with is myself. The journey from who am I to who I am is an overriding journey. Travel has been a very rewarding experience for me.” Ask the young lady the downside of travelling alone and she promptly relies “None.”When asked about why travel solo, Raghavi said, “Travelling solo has somehow made me a better decision maker and the only reassurance I need is of myself.”“My solo travel experiences made me realise that there are no experiences good or bad. My experiences individually occupy the deepest corners of my heart and will always stay unique. My most special place was Egypt, however.” Adding further she said, “It’s not that I do not have my share of unpleasant experiences, I just choose to grow from them instead of letting them define me.”Ishna Agarwal, an interior designer in Lucknow said, “Every girl should travel solo atleast once in her life. ‘A girl travelling alone’ mentality is a bygone era. You are a different person, your choices and wishes are also different from others. The world is an amazing place and once you take that leap, you won’t regret it. The peace and quiet you attain from solo travel is to another level. It is as exhilarating as it gets.”Ishna Agarwal in Windermere , UK (BCCL)When asked about whether the thought of travelling all alone the first time scared her or not, she said, “My first solo travel was to Turkey. As you move outside of your comfort zone, what was once the unknown and frightening, becomes your new normal. You become fiercely independent.” Adding further Ishna said, “The best part about being a solo backpacker is that I don’t have to depend on anyone for anything at all. It’s my and only my decision. If I wander alone I can start today, in fact right now, but if I have to travel with someone, I’d have to wait till they’re ready.”Falah Jalali, a master’s student and another fearless female traveller said, “Travelling solo builds self-confidence. To be able to rely on yourself is liberating. When you have nobody to depend on or find solutions to problems, it makes you feel powerful and boosts self-esteem. I have travelled international and domestic, solo. It was definitely a growing experience, considering how you come across people of different cultures and nationalities.” Adding further she said, “We have this fear of unfamiliar places and unknown people. But after taking trips alone I realised that most people will actually step up to help you than try to hustle you. It has helped me see how kind people all around the world really are. Despite the fact that I really enjoy a solo journey, I, however, prefer travelling with friends not just because of the safety aspect, but also because it’s always nice to have someone to click pictures of you,” she said while laughing.Falah Jalali relaxing at Chelsea park in Manhattan (BCCL)Ankini Saran another Lucknowite and a homemaker, while talking to us said, “I think every girl should travel alone once. It is a very fulfilling experience. It helps one understand oneself so much better. You feel self-sufficient. All decisions rest on you, you can be as instinctive as you want. Do whatever that takes your fancy. Also, one of the major perks of being a solo female traveller is getting plenty of help from the locals and sometimes even free rides.” Ankini further mentioned, “When you’re travelling all alone, you get the luxury of making decisions solely by yourself and with time, I’d say you even become a better decision maker. However daunting and scary it might seem, it allows you time for self-growth which I believe is imperative.”(L) Anjuri Tandon in Kingston (R) Ankini Saran having a gala time in Bikaner (BCCL)“I have been an introvert from the time I can remember. I was too shy to talk to strangers. Travelling, Especially solo, increased my confidence exponentially. It made me open up and helped me grow as an individual” said Deepika Chaturvedi , a self-employed single mother and a Lucknowite. Deepika further added, “When you travel with people, they tend to not respect your time and for me punctuality is essential. Also, when you’re a lady and travelling solo, you might even get lucky enough to enjoy a couple of perks. Recently, I visited The Pilibhit Tiger Reserve. It was a memorable experience. Since I was the one lady travelling solo, I was given special treatment. Meaning, I was assisted by a forest guard, given special protection and all. It was great.” Adding further she said, “Travelling alone is a lot more exploratory and fun but as a female travelling solo in the country, I make sure that when I travel alone, it should be during the day and avoid night journeys.”Deepika Chaturvedi at Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (BCCL)Anjuri Tandon, a fashion student, while talking about her solo travel said, “Being a solo female backpacker is rather educational.

You tend to become more adjusting and get to know yourself better.”Anjuri Tandon enjoying a breathtaking view in Jamaica (BCCL)Recalling one of her solo trips she said, “Without a lot of planning, I decided to travel to Jamaica alone once. It was an experience of a lifetime. I stayed in a hostel, knew absolutely no one. It was a strange land with stranger people. I was on a strict budget that I had exceeded (obviously) and the latter? I ended up befriending new people who became friends for a lifetime. That trip to Jamaica sort of changed me as a person. It made me realise that it’s not always about partying, chilling or going to clubs but enjoying the various aspects of life. Cherishing whatever little you already have.

, Shah tells

Shobita Dhar

why we are suddenly experiencing a spate of infectious respiratory illnesses

In your book Pandemic published in 2016, you had warned of a coronavirus infection, similar to the one we are battling now. How did you predict such a threat?

In an interview you said that in the past 50 years, 300 new pathogens have emerged. What’s behind this spurt?

The crisis seems to be ebbing in China but this week several people in India have tested positive for coronavirus. How alarmed should we be?

How do you think this outbreak is going to end? Will warmer temperatures help control it?

In an inter-connected globalised world, how can countries check such an outbreak?

With the arrival of cholera in Haiti in 2010 and the scares about avian influenza and MRSA , it seemed obvious to me that the microbes were staging a comeback. I wanted to figure out how a microbe turns into a pandemic-causing pathogen. To do it, I studied the history of one of our most successful pandemic-causing pathogens — cholera, a pathogen that has caused not just one pandemic but seven, with an eighth one brewing in the wings. We think of cholera as a poor person’s disease, and that is true today, but when cholera first emerged — when it was a novel pathogen like today’s coronavirus — it infected the most advanced cities of its day, from New York and London to Paris.Next, I visited places where novel pathogens were emerging today: the wet markets and factory farms of south China, where I learned about the ecology of avian influenza; international business hubs in Hong Kong, where SARS took flight; the surgical wards of Delhi, where new forms of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens have emerged and spread around the world; the villages and shantytowns of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, where cholera lurks in puddles and drinking waters; the backwoods of New York state and the state fairs of Maryland , where new tick-borne diseases and novel influenza viruses swirl. Many experts in emerging infectious diseases understood that the risk of a new pandemic was rising. The number of novel pathogens was one indicator, among others.About 60% of these new pathogens originate in the bodies of animals. People and animals are coming into novel, intimate contact. That happens when animals move into new places, which they are doing because of climate change, and also when people destroy and invade wildlife habitat, which we are doing with our expanding towns, cities, and industrial activities. When we cut down the forests that the bats live in, they don’t just go away — they come and live in the trees in our backyards and farms. Through hunting, trading, and recreational activities, the probability that humans encounter bats rises — as do opportunities for microbes in their bodies to spill over into ours. We need to protect wildlife habitat so that animal microbes stay in their bodies. To do that, we need to reduce our massive and growing footprint across the planet.Undoubtedly there will be more cases. There are many more transmission opportunities for pathogens in places where there is dense crowding, poor hygiene, and underlying disease. That said, India has a relatively young population, and younger people are less likely to get seriously ill or die from this virus compared to older people. It seems possible that the greater danger may be not from coronavirus itself but from the various disruptions the efforts to contain it may cause. Like, interruptions in medical supplies or panicked reactions that result in scapegoating and xenophobia. Populations and policymakers should make preparations for it, as with any threat.Warm weather does reduce transmission of other respiratory pathogens but whether novel coronavirus will be the same is still unclear. If it does subside seasonally, it may resurge again in the fall, like seasonal influenza. Alternatively, it might just continue to spread through global populations until it finally collapses on its own— or is stopped by containment measures or a vaccine. At the moment, only China’s containment measures seemed to have been effective, and in that case only in slowing down the global spread, not stopping it. A vaccine is 12-18 months away.It’s true that trade and travel increase the risk of pathogens spreading between populations and across continents. Experts can actually predict where a contagion will hit next, simply by measuring the number of direct flights between infected and uninfected cities. But at the same time, our interconnectedness also enhances our defences against these threats. It means we can quickly send experts to the site of outbreaks, and quickly raise awareness about threats and share and distribute innovative strategies and novel technologies. Rather than close borders and ban travel, we should strengthen our health systems and improve the health status of the most vulnerable.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74529921,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-138999,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/when-we-cut-down-forests-that-bats-live-in-they-come-to-our-backyards-says-us-journalist-sonia-shah/articleshow/74529928.cms
32,['8/03/2020'],When laddoos go luxe,"In 2017, pastry chef Girish Nayak set out to learn the art of mithai making from traditional halwais across the country. It wasn’t easy to convince them to share trade secrets though. In Kolkata, a soan papdi halwai insisted that he stand outside his workshop and watch through the window for over two hours before allowing him inside.“At first, most mithaiwalas I approached would treat me like a kitchen hand and were extremely guarded,” Nayak, 34, recalls. It took a little time and persuasion but he was finally allowed to watch them at work. Nayak used the experience to bring his own spin to traditional mithai for a new venture called the Bombay Sweet Shop. His creations include drunken motichoor spiked with rum and dark chocolate, a ghevar tart which pairs a coffee rasgulla with vanilla mascarpone cream and honeycomb and kaapi pak, filter coffee-flavoured Mysore pak.While Bengal’s famous mishti shops churn out their own innovative takes on rosogollas and sandesh, they’re joined by a bunch of young chefs keen to experiment with exotic ingredients, international flavours and French pastry-making techniques.Delhi-based pastry chef Neha Lakhani co-founded artisanal mithai brand Arq with another French-trained chef Akshay Dhopatkar after being inspired by the country’s iconic bakeries such as Laduree and La Maison du Chocolat. “Everyone is chasing the perfect glaze of French pastry and working on chocolate, cookies and pastries. Why isn’t anyone trying to create a Laduree for mithai? We wanted to go back to our roots, do something from India but in an international manner,” says Neha.The duo has created novel desi takes on western desserts: dark Belgian chocolate truffles encased within besan laddoos, or a Mathura ka peda with a gooey caramel-filled centre. The focus is on organic ingredients and natural flavours, zero plastic packaging and using 70% less sugar than commercial sweets.Others are also tackling this perception of mithai being too sweet and heavy. “Mithai is a wonderful aspect of our food culture but I felt it had gotten lost along the way with excessive sugar, colour, milk powder. When you’re offered a laddoo at a wedding, you instinctively break it in half because you know it is going to be a burst of sweetness,” says Sid Mathur, founder of Delhi-based Khoya which offers a range of healthy options such as a brown sugar besan laddoo and fig barfi.Yash Bhanage, partner, Bombay Sweet Shop, says the change is because taste buds are becoming more cosmopolitan and contemporary as more Indians travel abroad. “During our initial research, we found that mithai is always eaten by older people while the younger generation prefers western desserts — that’s something we want to change.”While purists may turn up their nose at these reinventions, India is no stranger to experiments with mithai. Bengali sweetmakers have readily absorbed foreign influences from the Portuguese, British and French. “The Portuguese brought in the use of fresh cheese or chenna, which was considered taboo earlier because it was made from spoilt milk,” says food historian Pritha Sen. “Chhena sweets evolved to chenna toast with a layer of cream on top to resemble buttered toast, egg sandesh which was made to look like a scotch egg and jalbhara sandesh, which was an imitation of European liqueur chocolates.” There has been another revival in the last 15 years. “A new generation of sweetmakers have gone abroad to culinary schools and introduced the next round of innovations,” she says. “For instance, Kolkata’s Balaram Mullick sweets started the baked rosogolla, gur souffle and makha sandesh cake.”One of the chefs to first experiment with traditional sweets was Manish Mehrotra of Indian Accent who created desserts such as warm doda burfi treacle tart and vanilla ice cream and badam halwa pie with cranberries and chinni malai ice cream. But the gourmet mithaiwalas are a more recent phenomenon.Last year, Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef and restaurateur Rachel Goenka’s book titled Adventures with Mithai featured 50 recipes inspired by sweets from around the country, including mohan bhog cream eclairs and amrakhand mousse with besan laddoo towers. “Mithai is associated with Indian celebrations but I wanted to convert them into contemporary desserts,” says Goenka, who developed the recipes over seven years.The mithai bug has bitten even a luxury hotel like Roseate which started an outlet in its Delhi property in 2019. “We hope to do for mithai what macrons have done for the French dessert industry,” says executive director Ankur Bhatia . Last year, even the Bikanerwala group roped in Paris-trained pastry chef Sahil Mehta to create a new line of fusion mithai desserts for their new Delhi-based gourmet brand Saugaat, including a coconut laddoo filled with sour passion fruit gel, and khoya barfi infused with lemongrass.Most gourmet mithais come at a price tag of around Rs 100-150 per piece and are often ordered for celebrity weddings and functions. Delhi-based Gur Chini supplied 800 boxes of its famous pista and gold varq laddoo (priced at Rs 1,000 a piece) to Akash Ambani’s wedding, while Gurugram’s Berfila claims their chana barfi with chocolate is a favourite with Anushka Sharma.Despite the premium pricing, these experiments seem to be hitting the sweet spot.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74530295,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-153729,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/when-laddoos-go-luxe/articleshow/74530286.cms
33,['8/03/2020'],"Jaishankar hits back at UN rights panel, says it’s blind to Pakistan terror","S Jaishankar

NEW DELHI: Foreign minister S Jaishankar on Saturday strongly rebutted UN high commissioner for human rights Michelle Bachelet ’s criticism of Indian decisions on J&K and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, saying the body has been wrong before and is surprisingly blind to the role of cross-border terrorism.

“The UNHRC skirts around cross-border terrorism as if it has nothing to do with the country next door. Please understand where they are coming from, look at UNHRC’s record, how they handled the Kashmir issue in the past,” the minister said, pushing back at the UN body’s criticism of the abrogation of J&K’s special status and its plans to present itself as an amicus curiae in the Supreme Court in the CAA case.

Jaishankar’s remarks are in line with the Indian response to critical comments by various foreign organisations such as the European Union or committees of the US Congress that fail to mention the role of Pakistan in promoting and supporting terrorism in Kashmir while calling for restoration of “normalcy” in the newly formed Union territory.

In his speech at the ET Global Business Summit, the minister also defended the CAA, saying it is intended to reduce the number of stateless people, a measure that should be appreciated. “Everybody, when they look at citizenship, has a context and a criterion. Show me a country in the world which says everybody in the world is welcome. Nobody says that,” the minister said.

He pointed to the law’s specific purpose and said, “We have tried to reduce the number of stateless people through this legislation... We have done it in a way that we do not create a bigger problem for ourselves.” The law, opposed by Muslim groups, activists, opposition parties like Congress, Left and Trinamool, provides a path to Indian nationality for Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsis and Jains from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who fled in the face of religious persecution.

Looking at Indian foreign policy in the current context, Jaishankar told the assembled business elite that India’s rise being inextricably linked to the rise of Indian industry, the government would back them fully. Trying to dispel a notion that the BJP government is not business-friendly, he asserted, “Brand India has many facets for the world. And ‘business India’ is one of its most important. Your success is part of our success and as you go out in the world, count on us; we are there for you.”

Dwelling on the two key aspects that define modern global politics, he identified connectivity and technology as the drivers. “Connectivity today is the new great game. It shapes choices and builds linkages that could well determine the architecture of the order in making. India’s views on connectivity were made clear in 2017 and have been reiterated in greater detail since. In that sense, we have been the pioneering voice of this emerging conversation. In essence, the world in our view is best served by connectivity that is transparently debated, collaboratively envisaged, is commercially viable, financially sustainable, environmentally friendly and has local participation.”

Technology, he said, has strategic facets, which makes it essential to Indian foreign policy. “Technology has always been the driver of global politics and never more so than now... this has created its own issues of data protection and data security. But from the vantage point of foreign policy, there are some aspects that need greater deliberation as a national approach. The first is to appreciate that by its very nature, technologies are strategic, whether in its capability or in its consequences... How we fare in the domains of education, digitisation, skills and startups will determine our relevance and standing.”

34,['8/03/2020'],"SBI Yes Bank News: SBI chief: Willing to invest up to Rs 10,000 crore to ‘reconstruct’ Yes Bank","MUMBAI: State Bank of India chairman Rajnish Kumar said on Saturday that he sees Rs 10,000 crore as the outer limit for the bank’s investment in the troubled Yes Bank .

Side-stepping a direct response on whether LIC would be investing alongside SBI, Kumar said, “Many investors — domestic and international — have shown interest in the reconstruction of Yes Bank ... There are 2-3 good names.”

While acknowledging, at a media interaction, that the Rs 50,000 limit on cash withdrawals “will be an inconvenience for a few days”, Kumar assured Yes Bank depositors their money was not at risk.

Asked about how much SBI is willing to commit to reconstruct Yes Bank, Kumar said that if the bank goes solo and picks up the entire 49% it’s allowed to by the RBI under the draft scheme, its immediate investment, on the basis of the current capital base, would be Rs 2,450 crore; if Yes Bank needs Rs 20,000 crore and the authorised capital is accordingly raised, then SBI’s investment would have been around Rs 10,000 crore. “Our minimum commitment is for 26%, with a three-year lock-in, which will be around Rs 5,200 crore,” Kumar said. “Anything above that, up to 49%, will depend on the interest of other investors and the capital requirement of the bank.”

The SBI chairman defended the decision to rescue a private sector bank saying that there was a risk of contagion if it failed. He pointed out that even in “temples of capitalism”, governments had to come out with rescue packages in the form of a $2-trillion troubled asset purchase in the US and £50-billion bank recapitalisation in the UK.

Asked if Yes Bank’s troubles hadn’t damaged the brand, Kumar said, “We must clearly distinguish... Yes Bank is an entity, Rana Kapoor is an individual. If an individual has done something wrong, he will pay the price for that. Why should the enterprise suffer?”

As to whether its investment in Yes Bank might adversely impact SBI’s finances, he said, “We have done our maths. There will be a very marginal impact on our capital adequacy. We have a policy of maintaining our capital adequacy ratio at half a percentage about the statutory requirement. This will not change,” said Kumar.

On the possibility of a conflict of interest between the two banks, Kumar said, “Once a new board and CEO is in place in Yes Bank, SBI would maintain an arm’s-length relationship and convey its expectations through the new board.”

NEW DELHI: The government on Saturday revoked within hours the 48-hour telecast ban it had imposed on Media One and Asianet News, two Malayalam language channels, for “biased” reporting of the Delhi riots, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi “expressed concern” over the turn of events.

While Asianet News came back on air around 1.30am on Saturday, Media One resumed transmission at 9.40am. The government order had banned the telecast of the two channels from 7.30pm on March 6.

The Friday order banned the telecast of Media One for allegedly deliberately focusing on vandalism by CAA supporters. Its coverage, the order said, “questions RSS and alleges Delhi Police inaction”, and appeared to be “critical towards Delhi Police and RSS”. Asianet News, on the other hand, came under government fire because it “highlighted the attack on places of worship and was leaning towards a particular community”.

After widespread criticism and an outcry from the journalistic community and opposition, I&B minister Prakash Javadekar said he had the order revoked soon after he learned of it and after PM Modi also “expressed concern over the course of action”. Javadekar also said he will launch an inquiry into how such an order was issued and question the officers concerned of the I&B ministry.

“Two Kerala channels were banned for 48 hours. We immediately found out what actually happened and, therefore, we immediately restored the channels ... one of the channel owners talked to me and by night, Asianet was on. By morning, Media One was also on. Our basic thought process is that press freedom is absolutely essential in a democratic set-up and that is the commitment of the Modi government because we fought [against] the Emergency in which press freedom was muzzled,” Javadekar said.

The I&B minister also said he will go into details of the incident and take essential steps “if there is any wrongdoing”. “But let me also tell you that everybody accepts that media must exercise responsible freedom,” he said.

Conventionally, government orders are uploaded on the ministry’s website. In this instance, however, the last order of the ministry was uploaded on March 5. Sources also told TOI that the order was not served on both channels formally, but only conveyed to them through the uplinking agencies.

On Saturday, the News Broadcasters’ Association condemned the ministry’s decision. While NBA president Rajat Sharma appreciated the concern shown by the PM, he added that NBA was “shocked to learn that a decision like this was taken without the knowledge of the I&B minister”.

“NBA demands that the minister should institute an inquiry as to how the order prohibiting the news channels from broadcasting was issued without his approval. NBA would like the inquiry report to be shared with it,” Sharma said in a statement. He demanded all complaints relating to broadcast of news be referred to the News Broadcasting Standards Authority to “avoid recurrence of similar incidents in future”.

Criticising the government for its decision, senior Congress functionary P Chidambaram said the reasons cited to impose the ban, and the act of banning channels, were both “atrocious”. CPM chief Sitaram Yechury also condemned the action as “undemocratic and authoritarian”.

36,['8/03/2020'],"Searches continue, Yes Bank founder questioned over loan to scam-hit DHFL","MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate, which continued its searches at Rana Kapoor ’s Samudra Mahal residence in Worli on Saturday, is investigating whether Doit Urban Ventures, a dummy company controlled by the Yes Bank founder and two of his daughters, received Rs 600 crore as kickbacks from the scam-hit Dewan Housing Financial Corporation Ltd (DHFL) for loans worth Rs 4,450 crore granted by the bank.

ED officials stated that Yes Bank had provided a loan of Rs 3,750 crore to DHFL and another loan of Rs 750 crore to RKW Developers, a firm controlled by DHFL. When they defaulted on payment, Yes Bank did not initiate action, and the ED suspects Kapoor and two of his daughters (he has three), who are directors with Doit Urban Ventures, allegedly received kickbacks from DHFL.

The ED suspects that this amount of Rs 4,450 crore is part of the Rs 13,000 crore allegedly siphoned off by DHFL through 79 dummy companies, with Doit Urban Ventures being one of them.

ED officials, who had begun questioning Kapoor late on Friday evening, continued their interrogation till morning and around 11am on Saturday, took him to the agency’s regional office in Ballard Estate for further questioning, which was still on at the time of going to press. ED officials also searched the premises of his three daughters in Mumbai and Delhi and Yes Bank headquarters at Prabhadevi.

The statements of the daughters would be recorded and financial transactions of the Kapoor family examined, officials said.

DHFL former CMD Kapil Wadhawan is also one of the promoters of RKW Developers. The ED had in January arrested Wadhawan in another money laundering case it is investigating against the late drug smuggler Iqbal Mirchi . Wadhawan is currently out on bail.

During its probe into the Mirchi case, the ED found DHFL had allegedly siphoned off around Rs 13,000 crore through dummy companies and over one lakh fictitious accounts.

ED officials said that the state-owned Utter Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) had allegedly invested Rs 4,100 crore of its employees’ provident fund money in DHFL without taking the required approval. The agency suspects that DHFL allegedly laundered this money too through fictitious transactions. The ED has registered a separate money laundering case against DHFL and UPPCL employees.

Yes Bank was placed under a moratorium on Thursday and its board superseded, with the Reserve Bank of India capping deposit withdrawals at the bank at Rs 50,000 for every account.

37,['8/03/2020'],"House panel with TMC, BSP MPs validates EVMs","NEW DELHI: Electronic voting machines (EVM), the credibility of which was questioned by many political parties until as recently as 2019 Lok Sabha polls with some even demanding a return to the ballot paper system, have now received validation from a parliamentary panel which also comprised members of these very parties.

The department-related committee on personnel, public grievances, law and justice, in its report on demands for grants for 2020-21 passed unanimously and placed in the Rajya Sabha on Friday, praised the EVMs for eliminating invalid votes as well as delays and errors associated with counting ballot papers. So much so, it recommended that EC impress upon the state commissions to use EVMs and VVPATs available with ECI for paperless election to even local bodies for ease of the electors.

No Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha MP from any opposition party represented on the committee submitted any dissent note against the observations or recommendations made in the report.

The panel chaired by BJP MP Bhupendra Yadav and comprising MPs from parties such as Trinamool Congress and BSP that had earlier demanded a return to ballot paper, observed that EVMs had “not only simplified the election process, but also quickened the pace of counting and ensured convenience for the voters”.

The report said voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) to the EVM had strengthened the voters’ trust and transparency of the electoral process. “The Committee also observes that the Supreme Court has also upheld the election conducted by EVM and VVPAT by dismissing a petition requesting for return to ballot paper system,” it added.

The parliamentary panel underlined EC’s “unequivocal” view that EVMs are tamper-proof and integrity of electoral process is well preserved with its use, accompanied with VVPATs, in the participatory democracy. “Booth-capturing and casting of invalid votes have become a thing of the past with the aforesaid digital revolution,” it added.

The committee also recommended linkage of Aadhaar number with voter I-card, as sought by EC in a proposal sent to the law ministry last year, saying it would eliminate incidence of multiple entries in electoral rolls.

While pointing out that elections to Panchayati Raj institutions and municipal bodies were still held through ballot paper, the committee stated that the advancement of technology in election process needed to percolate to local bodies. “The Committee is of the view that election to local bodies should also be held through electronic voting machine accompanied by VVPAT,” the panel said in its report.

ECI prototype of EVMs and VVPATs are currently used only for Lok Sabha and assembly elections.

38,['8/03/2020'],BPCL Sale: Bids sought for BPCL in biggest selloff ever,"NEW DELHI: The government on Saturday put on sale its entire 52.98% stake in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), allowing foreign and domestic private entities with a net worth of $10 billion to bid for acquiring India’s second-largest state-run oil refiner-retailer but barred other state-run companies from participating.

This will be the first sale of government stake in a profitable public sector company through bidding since 2003 when the NDA-1 government under PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee sold fuel retailer IBP. In yet another first, the sale will be through e-bidding, so far used for auctioning natural resources.

Privatisation of BPCL will also transform the world’s fastest-growing fuel market, dominated by state-run entities, through competition and introduction of disruptive technologies. The Centre is expected to raise more than is Rs 46,300 crore from the sale based on current market price of the company stock. The valuation of BPCL had spiked soon after talks of its privatisation began. The successful bidder will also have to make an open offer to other shareholders for acquiring another 26% at the winning price.

The bidding will happen in two stages. In the first stage, qualified bidders will put in their expression of interest by May 2 and will then be asked to put in financial bids in the second stage. The company’s stake in subsidiary Numaligarh Refinery Ltd will be sold separately to state-run oil companies to retain its public sector character because it was set up as part of the Assam accord .

According to DIPAM notification, companies can bid in consortium but the lead member must hold 40% in the grouping and others must have a minimum net worth of $1 billion. Changes in the composition of consortium have been allowed within 45 days but the lead member has to remain the same.

BPCL will give buyers access to 14% of India’s oil refining capacity and nearly a fourth of the fuel retail market. It has 15,177 petrol pumps, 6,011 LPG distributors, 51 LPG bottling plants and a 40-50 jet fuelling terminals. The company accounts for 21% of petroleum products sold in the country by volume as of March.

BPCL operates four refineries in Mumbai ( Maharashtra ), Kochi (Kerala), Bina (MP) and Numaligarh (Assam) with a combined capacity of 38.3 million tonnes per annum, which is 15% of India’s total refining capacity of 249.4 million tonnes.

Along with Air India, BPCL is expected to be the centrepiece of the government’s strategic sales drive and officials have expressed confidence of wrapping up the transaction in the new financial year that begins in April. The government has set an ambitious target of raising Rs 2.1 lakh crore from asset sales in state-run companies.

This is the largest disinvestment by the Narendra Modi government. In 2018-19, the Modi government had undertaken strategic sales in four companies, which included HSCC (India) Ltd, Dredging Corporation of India Ltd , National Projects Constructions Corporation Ltd and the PFC-REC deal, which helped raise nearly Rs 15,000 crore.

Since assuming power, the Modi administration had promised to move swiftly on strategic sales in state-run companies but the plan did not go ahead and in its second stint, there has been renewed focus to accelerate such sales to generate much-needed cash for the government.

This seems to be the message from a cross section of women on the eve of International Women’s Day on Saturday.

Chandrakanta Khan, a social activist and mother of two, says decision-making in family affairs, including the education of children, remains in the hands of the male folk, even though they hardly take any active responsibility in child care or looking after daily household chores.

“There is too much gender disparity in Bihar, even within the families. It is the result of a deep-rooted patriarchal mindset that despite education and improved life-style, the one (male) who provides daily bread and butter for the family, wants to rule. Men don’t want to take responsibility of child care, but it is they who decide which school or college the child will go to or suggest a profession for him or her,” says Chandrakanta, a JNU alumna.

The United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, also known as UN Women, has set the theme for this year’s International Women’s Day as “EachforEqual” or “I am Generation Equality: Realizing Women’s Rights”.

Given the UN Women’s ambitious theme for this year, even women entrepreneurs and top business executives feel that family and society do not allow a lot of women, especially those who are married, to venture out on their own.

Priya Aditya, chief executive officer (CEO) of a private firm, agrees with activist Chandrakanta on men folk’s reluctance to share responsibilities. “Married women are overwhelmed with household chores and child care, thus they find it difficult to do something on their own. Such a situation could be avoided if men folks share the load of household responsibilities, especially child care,” says Priya.

However, Dr Barna Ganguli, assistant professor at Centre for Economic Policy and Public Finance at the Patna-based Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI), feels that initiatives taken by the state government for women empowerment are praiseworthy, but admits that gender parity, is still a distant dream in Bihar.

Citing the success of government schemes, Ganguly highlights the overall enrollment of girls in government schools in Bihar, which has increased more than that of boys as per the economic survey for 2019-20 fiscal. “Enrolment of girls has risen by 1.8% from 2013-14 to 2017-18 as compared to 1.7% for boys in the same period,” she says, adding, “Similarly, average life expectancy at birth for females in Bihar (2011-15) stood at 68.4 years against 68.3 years for males.”

However, gender disparity is still visible at the ground level, when we see husbands of female mukhiyas being the front faces, says Ganguli.

On women entrepreneurs, Dr Ganguli says, “In a survey of food- processing industry in Bihar conducted in 2016-17 having a sample size of 100, we could find only 15 female entrepreneurs. Also, most of them were associated with micro and small scale units and not holding higher designations. Moreover, they were doing the work after doing the household chores.”

Shambhavi N Singh, chief operating officer of Young Bihar Movement, seconded Dr Ganguli on women in business. “People in Bihar are still not ready to accept a female boss giving them instructions. The various initiatives of the government aimed at women’s empowerment are welcome moves but the government never looks at their execution on the ground level. Our society must accept that women can lead, if not rule,” she says.

Social activist Sudha Varghese says the ground reality is very different from the targets of government welfare schemes for women. “They do not necessarily benefit all women. Especially Dalits, Mahadalits, widows and minorities must be given due support to eradicate the largescale discrimination against them,” she adds.

Sudha concludes: “On the eve of women’s day, we all, as society, should ask ourselves whether women are getting the respect, safety and empowerment among other social objectives. Moreover, women’s day should not be confined to only one day its fundamental objectives should be pursued all year round.”

40,['8/03/2020'],‘Women empowerment is a slogan for electoral politics’,"A single mother, Prashanti Tiwari fought a legal battle against sexual harassment at workplace. She shared her experience with TOI’s Sheezan Nezami on the eve of International Women’s Day. Excerpts:

This Women’s day theme is #EachforEqual with a message to make gender equal world. What will you say?

A theme is nothing more than that. Behind the message of ‘Individual Collectivism’ manifested in #EachforEqual is a dark reality of the struggle of half the world for right to dignity, equality and equity which often get ignored or ridiculed.

People and policymakers talk about women empowerment. What is the reality?

As a survivor of sexual assault and harassment, I have experienced that the political system and the ruling elites have reduced this issue to mere electoral politics with catchy slogans and empty assurances.

How difficult it is for a woman to go against patriarchal system?

For a woman, speaking out is more dreadful than the crime itself. I was labelled and branded as a dirty woman, a liar and what not. The entire society isolates you. During the struggle, I lost everything — job, self-dignity and savings. But I take pride that after long criminal investigation, the accused was found guilty. Women should speak out and be prepared mentally and emotionally to face the challenges.

You supported #MeToo movement. But some men said it was a tool used by women to get popular or harass their bosses?

It’s a shame on those who believe that women do this for fame or to harass men. Naming the perpetrator or speaking out against the crime is the beginning of more assaults and the impact is more painful, destroying and everlasting than the act itself. Women literally lose everything in the process. No woman will ever do this for fame or for any other purpose. We have to start believing in women.

Can you tell something about ‘We Matter’?

It is an alternative media platform to provide safe space to those women and girls who want to speak out against the atrocities on them. Recently, we did a story on a bar dancer and the violence she faced. It was not told anywhere.

You are working for women who are suppressed and mistreated, physically as well as sexually. What is common among them, especially when it comes to support from family and friends?

These women received same treatment from the institutions, systems, family and friends. The initial reaction is to assign a purpose for speaking out. Its only the self-belief, conviction and perseverance that help and keep them motivated. One has to be prepared emotionally, mentally, physically and financially for the struggle. Only proper preparation helps.

What will be your suggestions to women who suffer atrocities silently?

Remaining silent means injustice to several other women and girls who remain vulnerable to such crimes. Don’t be shy or afraid. Don’t hide your name or face. It’s the accused who needs to hide his name or face. By revealing your identity, you already win half the battle. The perpetrator does not want this to happen because he is afraid that if the victim reveals her identity people would identify him too.

Any suggestion for men?

Believe Women!

41,['8/03/2020'],Doctors’ strike hits OPD services in Bihar hospitals,"PATNA: Doctors paralysed outpatient department (OPD) in the government hospitals across the state on Saturday as they remained on a 12-hour strike till 8pm in protest against the murder of Dr Priyaranjan Kumar Priyadarshi in Nalanda district on Thursday. The strike was called by Indian Medical Association (Bihar Chapter), Bihar Health Services Association, Junior Doctor’s Association and Contract Doctor’s Association.

The doctors demanded Rs5 crore compensation and government job to a family member of the deceased besides immediate arrest of the mastermind behind the murder. They also demanded armed security guards at all the public health institutes and for superintendents and principals of medical colleges and hospitals.

The deceased was the son in-law of the sister of former Harnaut MLA Sunil Kumar. Miscreants had pumped six bullets into his body near village Nijay under Rahui police station when he was on way to Gokulpur Math APHC where he was posted.

IMA (Bihar) president Dr Bimal Kumar Karak said police claimed to have arrested a few suspects. “But we want the arrest of the mastermind behind the murder,” he said. Dr Karak said they will decide their future course of action after Holi. “It is the first murder of a doctor during chief minister Nitish Kumar’s regime,” he added.

Doctors remained on strike in the government and some private hospitals in Nalanda, Darbhanga, Khagaria, Motihari, Gaya, Sitamarhi and other parts of the state.

Health services remained paralysed in Nalanda for the third consecutive day. State IMA official Dr Sunil Kumar said doctors attended to emergency patients only, that too wearing black badges. He said the doctors would go on indefinite strike if their demands were not fulfilled within the next 48 hours. However, Biharsharif SDM Janardhan Aggarwal said the deceased was on contract and under the existing provisions, his family members don’t qualify for employment on compassionate grounds. He, however, said their demands had been forwarded to the authorities concerned.

A shocking video had surfaced on Friday in which Dr Priyadarshi was seen bleeding profusely and crying for help while several people surrounding him were busy filming him through their mobile phones. The doctor succumbed to his injuries when police took him to hospital.

Except for emergency service, both OPD and surgery remained paralysed in Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital. More than 500 people from across the district and Indo-Nepal border returned without medical help on Saturday.

Almost all the private clinics were closed and government hospitals did not function properly in Sitamarhi. However, doctors attended indoor patients and those seeking emergency help.

In Khagaria, secretary of the district unit of IMA, Dr Prem Kumar, submitted a memorandum to DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh with their demands.

IMA East Champaran unit president Dr Shushil Kumar Sinha said even private doctors had supported the strike.

In Gaya, OPD functioning remained paralysed at 24 primary health centres, two subdivisional hospitals, district hospital and Prabhawati Women Hospital (commonly known as Lady Elgin Hospital). Some of the private clinics also remained shut. Civil surgeon Dr BK Singh admitted that the strike was total in the district.

According to secretary of Gaya health services association, the government doctors did not attend outdoor duty. Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College Hospital superintendent Dr Vijay Krishna Prasad, however, said the strike was partial as OPDs functioned normally in the morning. Some disruption was caused after 11am, he said.

43,['8/03/2020'],Woman Inc: Confident entrepreneurs chart new territories,"Ahmedabad: The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) report for India point at the rise of new women entrepreneurs – out of total registered ventures, it was 6.4% in 2013 which rose to 8.7% in 2018-19.Dr Sunil Shukla, director of EDII and lead author of the report for India, said that entrepreneurship as perceived opportunity for women has increased from 32% in 2013 to 44.4% in 2018-19. “Women believed that successful entrepreneurs have high status in society. On the other hand, fear of failure was found to be a significant entry barrier,” he said.A study yet to be published by IIM-Ahmedabad’s CIIE.CO pointed at 10% women entrepreneurs in India compared to 36% in the US. The study threw light on women entrepreneurs’ own perceptions and experiences to understand why some ventures work and some don’t. The report quoted a respondent saying, ‘We are always working on building an aura. I cannot talk to them the way I am talking to you. I need them to take me seriously.’Another respondent mentioned, ‘When your business is taking so much time from you and you have kids and household to look after, there’s this whole guilt trip of whether we are doing okay, as we are constantly in battle with time.’Supriya Sharma, partner, Insights, CIIE.CO, who co-authored the report, said that for many women, it’s a process from denying to defying. “Entrepreneurs often try to balance claims to legitimacy (factors such as male validation, marriage and education) and challenging norms (being upfront and taking on ‘male tasks’)” she said.A Shero’s JourneyNidhi Anarkat | Co-founder & CEO, EmpowerEDA computer engineer born and brought up in Ahmedabad, Nidhi worked for a city-based education venture before going to Harvard University and pursuing technology, innovation and education (TIE). “I found the scope in training college youths for interviews and group discussions and also training them for higher education exams such as CAT,” she said. Nidhi said that her decision to branch out as an edupreneur was supported by her family – full of chartered accountants – with her idea of pedagogy. Her venture is incubated at CIIE.CO at IIM-Ahmedabad. “The interplay of factors such as societal biases, one’s own expectations and governance structure create issues for women entrepreneurs. But a lot is happening positively in this space. I would also add that women’s representation should not be tokenism – it should be the way for her to realize her own potential,” she said.Menka Gurnani | Founder & director, Hidaa Life ScienceAfter a master's course in microbiology and medical lab technology, Gurnani worked as a senior research associate with a pharma giant in Ahmedabad for nearly a decade before deciding to venture out in uncharted territory – promoting vegan vitamin D. “About 80% of the population is deficit in the vitamin and if one is a vegetarian, there are fewer options. Thus, we developed a technology so that the vitamin can be incorporated into staple food such as roti, curry and salad for fast distribution,” she said. She mentions that the pressure for success is there. “We have to prove ourselves time and again – if a man’s venture fails, people would attribute it to business risk but in women’s cases, it’s often ‘we told you so.’ I am glad about the rise in women entrepreneurs’ numbers, but I believe nurturing the women entrepreneurs is the only sustainable way to propel our economy,” added Gurnani.Nikita Tiwari | Founder & director, NEERX TechnovationA chance meeting with Prof Anil Gupta propelled Nikita, a B.Tech from NIT Raipur, to develop a technological solution for farmers of India. Thus, her flagship product ‘Smart Sensor for Hydrology & Land Application’ took shape which got validated by ISRO. The device measures electrical conductivity, moisture, salinity and temperature of a piece of land at low power. Winner of multiple awards, the venture is incubated at EDII. “My family wanted me to become an IAS officer. But when I did not even sit for placement, they asked me about it. They backed my decision to start my venture,” she said. “Often, when we go for business meets or interact with farmers, they don’t talk to me directly, thinking that I might not be acquainted with the technical aspects. More women entrepreneurs would surely change this scenario with current policies supporting innovation and one’s own confidence in what one does,” said Nikita.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-inc-confident-entrepreneurs-chart-new-territories/articleshow/74532833.cms
44,['8/03/2020'],Four held in Nalanda doctor murder case,"Representative Image

BIHARSHARIF/PATNA: The Nalanda police on Saturday claimed to have solved the mystery Dr Priyaranjan Priyadarshi’s murder by arresting four people, including alleged mastermind Karan Saxena. They were arrested from Nosra village under Noorsarai police station in Nalanda district.

The special investigation team (SIT) led by DSP (law & order) Sanjay Kumar took Saxena (25) into custody. Saxena, stated to be the cousin of the slain doctor, was not on good terms with the deceased.

Nalanda SP Nilesh Kumar said raids were on to nab other criminals involved in the crime. “We have solved the case and arrested the assailants on the basis of scientific evidences gathered during investigation,” he told this newspaper over phone.

The SP said the country-made pistol used in the crime and a bloodstained shirt of one of the shooters were also seized. The bloodstains collected from the spot will be matched with those found on the cloth seized in the state forensic science laboratory, he said.

An investigating officer said Saxena was angry with Dr Priyadarshi after the latter asked him to look for a job as the deceased was unhappy over his connections with people with shady character. “Saxena felt humiliated and decided to kill him on Thursday,” he said.

The officer revealed that two shooters from Patna were also roped in for the crime. “We are in touch with our counterparts in Patna to nab the two assailants, who were at large,” he said.

Police said one bottle of liquor was also seized from the possession of the arrested persons. An FSL team from Patna had earlier visited the spot and collected samples of bloodstains and fingerprints.

Dr Priyadarshi was attacked by motorbike-borne criminals near Nijay village under Rahui police station when he was going on his motorbike to Gokulpur Math APHC where he was posted.

47,['8/03/2020'],Delhi riots’ Munger link: Shahrukh pistol traced to illegal weapon hub,"Shahrukh pointed the pistol at a policeman during riots on Feb 24

PATNA: Munger has once again hogged the limelight following the seizure of a 7.65 bore country-made pistol from the house of Mohammad Shahrukh @ Shahrukh Pathan on Saturday. He was arrested on Tuesday for pointing the pistol on the police personnel and opening fire during riots in Jaffarabad-Maujpur area of northeast Delhi on February 24. The pistol was made in Munger.

ACP, Delhi Police crime branch, Ajit Kumar Singla said over phone that Shahrukh had purchased weapon from a worker in his factory about two years ago. He used to flaunt the pistol among the people of his locality, Singla added. “The investigating officers are trying to trace the man who had helped Shahrukh in procuring the illegal weapon. His arrest will help the police establish Shahrukh’s connections with illegal arms dealers operating in the national capital and also in Munger district,” he said.

The 7.65 bore pistols made in Munger are in demand across the country for its good quality and low price. DIG, Munger range, Manu Maharaaj said the pistols made in Munger are favourites of sharpshooters or contract killers. He, however, said illegal arms manufacturers of Munger region have of late changed their modus operandi due to mounting police pressure and intensive raids. “Now most of the gun runners in the district are engaged in assembling the parts of the weapon and selling in the market,” he said.

According to police sources, the weapons are being manufactured in Malda and some other parts of West Bengal and subsequently supplied to Munger. Even the workers engaged in illegal gun factories in Munger have shifted to West Bengal where they are paid a hefty sum for their job, a senior police officer said.

If DIG Maharaaj is to be believed, Munger-made weapons — right from deshi katta (country-made), carbine to AK-47 assault rifle — were supplied to Delhi, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha and Jharkhand. Over a dozen arms dealers from those states have been arrested from Munger in the past, he said.

Notably, more than 20 AK-47 semi-automatic weapons stolen from the central ordnance depot at Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh were recovered from Munger district in 2018. The case was later handed over to the NIA for investigation following its wide ramifications and involvement of interstate gangs.

48,['8/03/2020'],Yes Bank customers seek ATM services on holidays,"The ATMs that were operational saw long queues and machines were drained of cash soon.

MUMBAI: For the second day after Yes Bank ’s collapse, angry, helpless depositors queued up to withdraw whatever sums were possible from their branches.

The ATMs that were operational saw long queues and machines were drained of cash soon. Yes Bank customers could use only their own bank ATMs. Several customers were forced to withdraw cash on Saturday because the bank ’s netbanking, debit cards and credit cards did not work.

There were also many who panicked and decided to withdraw funds fearing the bank’s resolution would take time.

Some called the Enforcement Directorate (ED) action against promoter Rana Kapoor and his daughters “too little too late” and demanded to know if the proposed resuscitation by SBI would be swift enough to help recover their money.

The withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 was inadequate for most people.

Some complained they were unable to access salaries for household expenses or for the festival of Holi that comes up on March 10. They recalled how PMC Bank had collapsed just ahead of Diwali 2019.

Roy Sequeira, an account holder from Parel, said, “Yes Bank administrators need to get their ATMs and online banking services up and running. That will bring a measure of relief. At present, we can only withdraw money from branches. Bank branches will be closed on Sunday, followed by another holiday for Holi on Tuesday. So the queues will lengthen on Monday. Already it takes two hours in line after getting a token so one can imagine how waiting time will increase next week.”

As days wear on, there is the omnipresent fear that consumers in distress, especially elderly pensioners, could suffer health ailments as they wait long hours in queue.

“Everywhere, one can see silver haired people braving the heat to visit bank branches. This is a disaster in the making,” said Shami Sidhu of Mulund.

At the Sunil Niwas branch in Four Bungalows, Andheri, nearby store owners had been alert enough to withdraw their money as reports emerged about Yes Bank's failing fortunes.

“We had been reading about the bank’s rising nonperforming assets (NPAs), so we knew this bank will not last long,” said the owner of a drapery shop. “So the few of us who have accounts there removed most of our money. I still own a current account though.”

His neighbouring store selling white goods depo-sits its employees’ salary in another large private sector bank.

“Yes Bank was the fourth largest private bank in the country so what hope do the rest have,” said a staffer.

Another shopkeeper said, “If you keep money at home you face notebandi (demonetisation). If you keep it in banks, then you get bankbandi (bank closure).”

49,['8/03/2020'],Bihar: Chirag takes a dig at Nitish over ‘poor’ law and order,"Chirag Paswan

PATNA: Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Chirag Paswan on Saturday took a dig at CM Nitish Kumar over alleged rise in crime in the state. LJP is an ally of the ruling NDA in the state.

“Law and order situation in the state has deteriorated to a great extent when compared to the first term of the NDA rule. There is an urgent need to control crime,” Chirag told reporters here.

Chirag, who is on his ‘ Bihar first , Bihari First Yatra ’, said Nitish came to power in 2005 due to poor law and order in the state. “However, the law and order situation in the state is no better today,” he said.

The LJP national president, however, added that he was not pointing fingers at the government. “People who matter in the government should improve their style of functioning in the larger interests of the masses. I have taken a pledge to make Bihar and its people first in the country and my statement should be construed in that perspective only,” he said.

The Jamui MP had earlier expressed concern over non-functioning of ‘Dial 100’ in most districts, except Patna. “There is no use of Dial 100 in many districts. People have been left to fend for themselves while the police officers are least bothered about their grievances,” Chirag had said.

Chirag had also offered his “moral support” to the 3.67 lakh striking contractual teachers. The sub-inspector aspirants, who are on warpath in support of their demands, had also got support from Chirag.

However, Chirag’s remarks didn’t go down well with JD(U), which advised the LJP leader to follow the ‘gathbandhan dharma’ before making any statement. Shrawan Kumar, a senior JD(U) leader and ministerial colleague of Nitish, said, “Gathbandhan ki partiyon ko pahle samiksha karni chahiye tabhi koi statement dena chahiye.”

Referring to Chirag’s statement that LJP is not a part of the government in the state, Kumar said LJP leader Pashupati Kumar Paras was a minister in the Nitish Kumar government before he was elected as MP from Hajipur Lok Sabha constituency.

51,['8/03/2020'],Rabindra Bharati University VC promised not to quit: Partha Chatterjee,"Students protest against RBU VC’s resignation on campus on Saturday

KOLKATA: Rabindra Bharati University students turned out in large numbers at the BT Road campus on Saturday to request vice-chancellor Sabyasachi Basu Roy Chaudhury to withdraw his resignation. The VC, who went to the university around 11.30am, met the waiting students and told them he would “think over” his decision and take a call.

At a programme in his constituency on Saturday, education minister Partha Chatterjee announced there would be an inquiry committee formed to look into the incident where, within hours of celebrations, photos were uploaded on Facebook and other platforms of girls and boys with cuss words written on their bodies. The committee will determine the lapses and find out how there was a larger turnout than the number of passes issued by the university.

On campus, Basu Roy Chaudhury listened patiently as the students — mostly from the political science department — pleaded that the university’s functioning will be hampered if the VC leaves. They also argued that it was unfortunate that the VC resigned over an issue in which outsiders were involved. “It is unfortunate since we shall lose out on attending the important classes which are taken by the VC,” said one of the students. Basu Roy Chaudhury argued that he could take classes despite not remaining in chair. The students, however, refused to listen to his reasoning. “We need him as an administrator who runs the university flawlessly. It will be a great loss for us. Please reconsider and withdraw the resignation,” another student said.

The VC said, This is an institution which is associated with the name of Rabindranath Tagore and which is run based on the ideology and principles of Tagore. If any such incident takes place on campus, then, as the head of the institute, it is my duty to take the onus. Thus, I resigned.”

Sources said Chatterjee had sent an email to the VC, saying his resignation had not been accepted. The minister asked him to continue in office.

At the programme, Chatterjee said he had spoken with Basu Roy Chaudhury. “This is social malice. Why should the VC take responsibility alone?” he asked, adding, “I’ve told him that he should not take the incident personally. He has given me his word to continue in his chair. From now on, those organizing Basanta Utsav should ensure they are in control of the event. I’m happy that irrespective of political parties, the incident has been condemned. The VC has only discharged his responsibilities.”

The police have formed a special team to collect all possible evidence in the incident. In the afternoon, a police contingent from Lalbazar visited the campus to collect CCTV footage and relevant documents. “We are taking help of RBU authorities in collecting CCTV footage and are collecting all details possible from students too. I wish more students come forward and record their statements,” said an officer.

KOLKATA: The only woman in the world to have won the Nobel Prize twice and the only person to win it for two sciences, Marie Curie was celebrated with a special 500 Franc note released by France in 1994. This note replaced the 500 Franc Pascal and was the last 500 Franc banknote before the Euro was introduced. This note can be found in the collection of Anindya Kar, a collector of rare currencies in the city. He has displayed a series of such rare notes from across the world, which celebrate women achievers, at his residence on the occasion of International Women’s Day on Sunday.

Another note on display is the Swedish Krona Selma Lagerlof special edition note released in 1997 to celebrate Selma Lagerlof. She was the first woman to win the Nobel in literature, in 1909. The 20 Krona note remained in circulation till 2006. In the UK, Queen Elizabeth appears on one side of notes while the reverse has traditionally had men. The one exception was Jane Austen, who was featured on a circulating 10 GBP released in 2017. This, too, finds a place in Kar’s display along with another 10 GBP note issued by Bank of Scotland in 2015 when Queen Elizabeth II was declared the longest serving monarch of the world.

A dependent territory of New Zealand, Tokelau, had issued a sterling silver coin in 2017 on the 20th death anniversary of Princess Diana as part of a mintage of 1961 coins. “Tokelau had minted the coin as a mark of respect for the charitable work that the princess did throughout her life,” explained Kar.

Among rare Indian currencies in Kar’s collection, there is a limited edition Rs 100 coin that was released to honour Mother Teresa after she won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979.

Though he mainly collects currencies, Kar also has some rare documents in his possession, one of which he has displayed in his “women’s day collection” — a high school examination certificate issued by East Bengal Secondary Education Board, Dacca, in 1949. What makes it uncommon is that the date of birth of the examinee, a girl, is suppressed because the norm was never to announce a woman’s age in public.

53,['8/03/2020'],Four more VCs asked not to take any policy decision,"PATNA: Governor-cum-chancellor Phagu Chuahan has debarred four more vice-chancellors from taking any policy decision.

According to the notification issued from Raj Bhavan on Friday, the VCs of Patna University (PU), Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University (KSDSU), Lalit Narain Mithila University (LNMU) and Bhupendra Narayan Mandal University (BNMU) have been asked neither to take any policy decision nor to initiate any work relating to appointment and transfer of teaching or non-teaching employees. They have also been requested to avoid initiation of any new project having financial implications. However, in special circumstances, they may initiate any such work with the prior permission of the chancellor.

Earlier, on November 19 last year, the chancellor had asked the acting VCs of Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU), B R Ambedkar Bihar University (BRABU) and Nalanda Open University (NOU) not to take any policy decision and engage themselves only in day-to-day routine work. As things stand today, Jay Prakash University (JPU), Chhapra, is also being administered by an acting VC following the completion of three-year-term by Harikesh Singh. Magadh University VC Rajendra Prasad has the additional charge of JPU.

Academics feel that allowing the universities to function under “powerless” VCs for a long period and delay in appointment of regular VCs adversely affect their performance. They point out that the panels of names recommended by the search committees for appointment of VCs of B R A Bihar and Nalanda Open universities were submitted to the chancellor more than one and a half months ago. It is learnt that the mandatory consultation between the chancellor and the chief minister for finalizing the appointments has not materialized so far.

The chancellor’s secretariat has already advertised the posts of VCs in TMBU, LNMU and JPU. The last date for receipt of online applications for these coveted offices ended on November 30. While TMBU and JPU are going without a regular VC for the past few months, the term of present incumbent in LNMU is likely to expire shortly.

The VCs of PU, BNMU and KSDSU will be completing their terms in the last week of April or the first week of May, but advertisements for appointment on their posts have not been made till date. In the meantime, the offices of pro-VCs in some universities are also likely to fall vacant. The chancellor’s secretariat is reportedly in the process of advertising all these posts of VCs and Pro-VCs soon, said sources.

Varanasi: A joint team of UP STF and forest officials rescued a pangolin and arrested five wildlife smugglers, along with two licensed weapons and an SUV , from Chitaipur area of Lanka police station on Friday night.

STF’s Varanasi field unit in-charge Vinod Singh said they were tipped off by Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, Delhi. “The joint team cordoned off Chitaipur and intercepted the SUV (registration number UP65 BY 7007). The pangolin was found in a gunny bag inside the vehicle,” Singh said.

The arrested quintet have been identified as Arun Kumar Singh and Prabhat Singh of Varanasi, Bhuvanendra Vishwakarma and Deepak Chawdhary of Mirzapur and Vimalesh of Chandauli. A licensed rifle and a pistol, and live cartridges were found on them.

“The five were taken into custody by forest officials, who produced them in court today (Saturday) and also applied for their remand for further interrogation in the case,” the STF officer said.

This was the second major wildlife haul by STF since April 2018, when its local unit had nabbed 10 smugglers with a rare pangolin from a hotel in Sigra. The interstate gang was busy finalising a deal when it was busted. Those arrested hailed from Sonbhadra, Varanasi and Bihar. They had caught the animal from the forests of Pannuganj in Sonbhadra district.

Found in 14 states of India, the vulnerable nocturnal mammal is increasingly becoming a victim of wildlife crime for its meat that is considered a delicacy in countries like China and Vietnam, and scales that are used in traditional Chinese medicines.

There are eight species of pangolins found across the two continents of Asia and Africa. All are protected under national and international laws, and two are named as critically endangered on the IUCN red list.

PATNA: In a shocking incident, a man surrendered in Phulwarisharif police station half an hour after killing his wife at Bramhapur village on Saturday morning.

The confession of Mohammad Junaid (30) shocked the policemen. Junaid is a native of Gulistan locality, but used to live at his wife’s residence in Bramhapur. A police team rushed to Bramhapur and found his wife’s body lying in a pool of blood on a bed.

Phulwarisharif police station SHO Rafique-ur-Rahman said the woman was identified as Azmati Khatoon, aged around 40 years. “Junaid had slit her throat with a scissor. A stab wound was also visible on the throat. The scissor was seized from the bedside,” he said.

Rahman said Junaid alleged that she was having illicit relations with several persons and he used to oppose it. When she did not mend her ways, he finally killed her.

“Junaid was Azmati’s fourth husband. Her first husband Mohammad Shamshad had died a few years ago. Azmati had a 20-year-old son from him. Then she married one Mohammad Kayoom and again one Sanjay Gandhi, from whom she had an eight-year-old son. Sanjay had left her almost three years ago,” he said.

The SHO said Junaid had married Azmati hardly a month ago after being with her in live-in relationship. “She had once lodged complaint in women helpline that Junaid was not marrying her even after having relation with her. Preliminary investigation indicated that Junaid married her under pressure and killed to get rid of her,” the SHO said.

He said Azmati’s elder sister Akbari Khatoon had reached the police station to lodge an FIR against Junaid, alleging that he used to extort money from her. “Further investigation is on. The body was handed over to the family after postmortem,” the SHO added.

The 400th locomotive was a WAG-9HC one meant for goods trains. We wanted to dedicate the event to women and the locomotive was flagged off by them as well,” a CLW official said.

Eastern Railway (ER) will also be celebrating Women’s Day on Sunday evening by running a suburban train from Sealdah with an all-woman crew. The travelling ticket examiners will also be women and there will be a motorwoman and guard. This train to Ranaghat will be flagged off by S S Gehlot, additional general manager, ER.

Explaining the abnormally high number of pensioners, he said besides the superannuated employees of the MU headquarters, 19 constituent and one government-funded minority college of the university, MU pension liability includes of those employees of Patliputra University and Veer Kunwar Singh University, who retired from service before March 2018 and September 1992 respectively. Both Patliputra University and Veer Kunwar Singh University were carved out of MU.

Hailing the government order for implementing the revised payscale and releasing arrears for 11 months, Postgraduate Teachers Association secretary Bharat Bhushan said this is for the first time that the revised scale has been released without any agitation.

In the past, the university employees had to resort to agitations to get their due. Such gestures add to the motivation level of the employees, he said.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has placed the bank under 30-day moratorium and capped withdrawal limit at Rs50,000.

Police personnel were deployed at Yes Bank branches across the city to manage the panicked account holders, who rushed to withdraw the money. They also complained that its ATMs had run out of money.

Amit Kumar, an entrepreneur and resident of Rajendra Nagar, was standing in a long queue at its Exhibition Road branch. Amit said he needed Rs3 lakh for his business but can’t withdraw more than Rs50,000. “I can’t even take loan from the bank. All my savings are in this account. It’s the festive season, I have to give salary and bonus to my employees,” he said.

Binay Kumar, who runs a printing press at Bhikhna Pahadi, said, “We have to buy paper, ink and other materials to print schoolbooks for the new academic session. Besides, I also need money for transportation. If the bank failed to solve the problem, the business class would suffer.”

Suraj Gupta of Kadamkuan was waiting for his turn at the Boring Canal Road branch. He said, “The new academic session would begin from April first week. Before that we have to pay the school fees, buy new books and other related items. Besides, I need money to run the household. I tried to transfer the money online, but it was not working.”

Sarfaraz said he couldn’t withdraw a single penny of the last month’s salary. “For last couple of days, I have been trying to withdraw the money but due to heavy rush, the bank runs out of cash. Same is the situation of ATMs. I have to make payment of credit card and rent,” he complained.

Rishikesh Sinha, a builder and resident of Bhootnath Road said his daughter Shikha is to get married this month. “I have been in the queue since 8am, but could not get a single penny. I need money to book the ceremonial hall, food and shopping and get wedding cards printed. My wife’s account is also in the same bank. It’s a worrying situation for us,” he said.

The bank officials, on the other hand, claimed they were giving preference to people in dire need of money like medical emergencies, marriage related expenses and education.

“The recent unanimous adoption of the resolution by the state assembly on use of NPR questionnaire in its 2010 format was confusing. In its letter sent to the Centre, the state government has not said that it will not implement NPR and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Bihar,” Dipnakar said.

He added that NPR, NRC and other aspects were discussed at the two-day meeting of the party’s state committee that concluded on Saturday. The CPI (ML) will now hold its three-day state conference at Gaya from April 18.

“The Gaya conference will be preceded by three-week intense block-level campaign for broader social unity from March 23 (death anniversary of Bhagat Singh) to April 14 (birth anniversary day of Dr B R Ambedkar). In between, the party will also launch a ‘yatra’ from Siwan on March 31 that will cover all the 38 districts,” Dipankar said.

66,['8/03/2020'],Duo’s mini hearts in space to test zero-gravity effect,"Kolkata: Two women from Kolkata settled in the US are partnering up to send “artificial mini-hearts” to space to understand how zero gravity affects the function of the heart. Munmun Chattopadhyay of Texas Tech University Health Sciences Centre and Binita Joddar from the University of Texas in El Paso were awarded $256,892 and $259,350 by the US-based National Science Foundation (NSF) for the three-year project.

The biomedical research scientists are working to create the less-than-1mm-thick tissue structures, called “cardiac organoids”, using human stem cells and 3D bioprinting. “We are making tiny artificial hearts by using 3D bio-printed hydrogel-base scaffolds with heart cells inserted in it. We will send these to space at the ISS National Lab,” Chattopadhyay told TOI on Friday.

The project is one of the only five research proposals by NSF and ISS National Lab in 2019 as part of the organizations’ second collaboration on tissue-engineering research. Chattopadhyay, an assistant professor in TTUHSC, El Paso’s Centre of Emphasis in Diabetes and Metabolism, said, “By exposing the organoids to the near-weightless environment of the orbiting space station, we hope to gain a better understanding of a health condition known as cardiac atrophy, which is a reduction and weakening of heart issue. Cardiac atrophy often affects astronauts who spend long periods of time in microgravity.”

Joddar, assistant professor in the UTEP College of Engineering, leads research in the university’s Inspired Materials and Stem Cell-Based Tissue Engineering Laboratory. “A weakened heart muscle has difficulty pumping blood and can lead to problems like fainting, irregular heartbeat, heart valve problems and even heart failure. Cardiac atrophy is also associated with chronic disease,” she explained.

The first year of the project, which began last September, focuses on research design where Joddar has used 3D printing to fabricate the organoids by coupling cardiac cells to mimic heart tissue. The second year will have them preparing the payload for a rocket launch and space mission. In the third year, they will analyze data from the experiment.

67,['8/03/2020'],"International Women’s Day: Women, don’t bury fears, speak up about old traumas","Picture for representational purpose only.

In the middle of a meeting, 26-year-old marketing executive Jeena (name changed) was assailed by a violent, unwelcome memory of her being sexually abused by a relative in her teens. She closed her eyes. It wasn’t the first time that had happened.

Around 10 years ago, Jeena’s relative had repeatedly sexually abused her for two years and threatened to harm her family if she informed anyone of it. Jeena had since been getting flashbacks, coupled with nightmares and disturbed sleep. At 21, she confided in her mother about it—her father was too strict. And the advice she got was also to keep it to herself because, in this case, no one would believe her and it would affect her chances of getting married.

Not only was she forced to relive the trauma over and over again, causing her immense internal distress—her family met the relative at family gatherings—but she found it difficult to trust people, especially men, leading to tumultuous relationships. Now engaged, she had a difficult relationship with her fiancé, both interpersonally and sexually. Still suffering from bouts of anxiety, she wanted to call it off but, emboldened by the #MeToo movement, decided to seek help.

Fear is part of our in-built ‘fight or flight’ warning system that allows us to take action at the right time. When the storm passes, fear lifts and life moves on. But not for everyone. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition marked by constantly reliving the fear of a traumatic incident—sometimes with other resultant mental health conditions—long after the incident has passed.

Prevalence in women

Women are twice more prone to PTSD as compared to men.

The lifetime prevalence is 5-6% in men, and 10-12% in women (Olff M, 2017; Charak et al, 2014). Women experience more sexual and domestic violence.

Statistically, one in every five women has experienced sexual assault or rape (Smith S et al; 2015).

Treatment

Early recognition as well as psychotherapy and medication are found to be extremely beneficial. Counselling the family is also important.

Jeena was eventually treated with both medication and psychotherapy. Her mother was also counselled, and Jeena was encouraged to share her experience with both her father and fiancé. Their family cut ties with the relative. Jeena restored her relationships, married her fiancé and is now a happy mother of a one-year-old. And all because she gathered courage to speak up. One small step changed her life. And that’s pretty much all it takes.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava has asked the force not to hesitate in acting on their own, though within the ambit of law , if there are no directions from the top in situations warranting prompt action.

While addressing the personnel from northern range of Delhi Police on Saturday, Shrivastava urged the cops to discharge their duties fearlessly, fairly, promptly and professionally.

In a bid to boost the morale of the police force, the top cop suggested creation of a proper support system for lower subordinates. “The motto of the police force is to treat every citizen of Delhi without discrimination. Sense of security among general public and helpful attitude is the need of the hour,” he said.

Shrivastava stressed on the need to revamp and restructure the beat system, referring to it as the most important tool of policing. He also discussed the steps to be taken to curb street crime and to mount surveillance on habitual offenders, as well as budding criminals.

The chief stressed on the need to deal with adequate compassion in cases of crime against women and children.

While addressing a gathering of over 1,000 personnel, Shrivastava asserted that it was on every policeman to work towards maintaining the high-esteem and image of Delhi Police.

Shrivastava recently took over as the city’s police chief in the aftermath of the riots in northeast Delhi. He was earlier the anti-terror unit chief of Delhi for three years before proceeding on deputation to Central Reserve Police Force in 2015.

After Delhi Police came under fire for being unable to quell the riots, Shrivastava was handpicked by the Union home minister and the National Security Advisor to control the situation that has since returned to normalcy.

Known for his ability to lead from the front, Shrivastava has also been instrumental in fighting terror in Kashmir during his stint with the CRPF.

PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday inaugurated the medical services at the newly built Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur Medical College and Hospital in Madhepura , developed at the cost of Rs781 crore. He said admission to the medical college will begin soon after getting permission from the Medical Council of India (MCI).

The CM also inaugurated 2502 schemes and laid foundation for 2161 projects worth Rs340 crore in the district through remote system from the dais. He said the medical college was proposed in 2005 and its foundation was laid in June 2013. “Today I am having immense pleasure in inaugurating it,” he said.

While addressing the gathering, Nitish hit out at the opposition saying few people were simply giving baseless statements for vote bank and they were not concerned for development. “I do not work for vote bank politics. Serving people is my dharma. If people of Bihar give me another opportunity to serve them, we will provide water for irrigation in all agricultural fields,” he said.

Expressing his love for Madhepura, Nitish said: “I have deep association with Madhepura and due respect for Singeshwar Sthan since beginning.”

He also said uninterrupted power supply had been ensured in the medical college and precautions were taken to avoid any short-circuit. He even announced to install a statue of Karpoori Thakur on the medical college premises before August so that an official programme could be organized on the birth anniversary of the noted socialist leader.

Nitish thanked the vice-chancellor of Bhupendra Narayan Mandal University and others associated with it for providing 25 acres of land to set up the medical college and hospital.

He even instructed officials present there to ensure that all the schemes for which foundations were laid on Saturday get started on time.

KOLKATA: Days after a surrogate mother was arrested for taking money from a Rashbehari-based couple and got an abortion, the New Alipore police has charged accused Kashmeera Mollah of taking help of a quack doctor and spending Rs 4,000 for killing the foetus.

The cops are also taking legal advice to file a separate case against the quack, OT assistant Gopal Malik, who has a six-room nursing home near Mandirbazar in Diamond Harbour and claimed to have carried out over 15,000 operations in the past eight years. His aide Azizul Rahaman Piyada had taken Kashmeera to him.

“In her two weeks of police custody, Kashmeera stuck to her statement that she fell and miscarried. She claimed she threw the dead foetus in the river. We established that she had been admitted at Diamond Harbour Government Hospital on January 17. Kashmeera then gave birth to a stillborn,” said an officer.

The cops were planning to file a charge sheet, but a sentence on Kashmeera’s admission slip — that said “she came with a dead child in her womb without profuse bleeding” — suggested she either took a synthetic steroid or had a quack kill the foetus.

“’We seized various questionable drugs and sealed Malik’s hospital. We have added Section 315 IPC against all three for homicidal miscarriage. Kashmeera is already in jail custody and the other two are in police custody till March 16,” said an officer.

71,['8/03/2020'],"For last 14 years, city breathing most toxic air","Nagpur: Post 2006, citizens have been breathing toxic air, with the deadliest pollutant Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) surpassing the national permissible limit.

This has come to the fore in the city’ action plan to control air pollution. Data for the annual average of RSPM reveals that the pollutant was within the safe limit till 2006 at all the monitoring locations — North Ambazari Road, MIDC office Hingna Road, Government Polytechnic College (Sadar) and Civil Lines.

However, since 2007-2008, the pollutant’s levels have consistently been more than the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) limit of 100 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm). High levels of RSPM can cause asthma, respiratory ailments and lung cancer. According to some studies, long-time exposure to it can also lead to mortality and morbidity.

At the industrial area in Hingna Road, the pollutant’s levels were 51 and 40 mpcm in 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 respectively. In 2007-2008, the concentration shot up to 160 mpcm and have stayed above 100 mpcm since then.

RSPM levels showed an upward trend at North Ambazari Road and Sadar too. In Civil Lines which is one of the greenest areas in the city, the pollutant’s levels have managed to stay below 100 mpcm.

According to experts, the toxicity in air is much worse in other areas where monitoring is not being done. “The general perception that Nagpur is not polluted is wrong. Nearly 26% of the pollution is coming from coal-fired power plants in and around the city. Apart from this, vehicular emissions and industrial pollution continue to be major contributors across the city,” said Leena Buddhe, of NGO Centre for Sustainable Development.

The city’s development too is coming at the cost of clean air. Said founder of NGO Green Vigil Foundation Kaustav Chatterjee, “Post 2006, the city has witnessed a tremendous rise in construction activities, be it roads, houses, flyovers or Metro. This has been one of the main reasons behind high RSPM levels.”

The action plan for Nagpur suggests various mitigation measures to curb pollution emitted from vehicles, road construction, industries, burning of waste and other sources. “Though the measures are on paper, serious implementation is not in place. There is an absence of deadlines, timely reviews, accountability and coordination between different agencies,” added Buddhe.

Pointing out that trees play an important role in controlling particulate matter, Chatterjee said, “Air pollution is on the higher side because the city is significantly losing its green cover.”

To reduce pollution load, the plan also suggests greening of open areas, gardens, community places, schools and housing societies. It also stresses upon creating green buffers along traffic corridors.

The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has sought Neeri’s expertise for preparing action plans for the 18 non-attainment cities of the state including Nagpur. These cities have consistently witnessed deteriorating air quality when compared to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

The clean air action plan for Nagpur has been approved by the Central Pollution Control Board subject to some compliances in a specific format.

72,['8/03/2020'],BJD makes names of its RS nominees public,"Bhubaneswar: Putting speculations to rest, BJD president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Saturday named a woman from the backward community, a minority face, an Oxford and Harvard alumni and a labour union leader as the party’s candidates for the Rajya Sabha elections scheduled on March 26.

He named Mamata Mahanta, Munna Khan, Sujeet Kumar and Subash Singh as candidates. All the four are believed to have been rewarded for their loyalty towards the party while Naveen has also taken into account regional representation while choosing candidates, said political observers.

While Khan is from southern region (Nabarangpur), Mamata hails from North Odisha (Mayurbhanj). Singh and Kumar represent coastal (Cuttack) and western region (Kalahandi) respectively. As expected, candidates defeated in the 2019 elections have not been nominated.

Selection of Khan, a minority face for the upper house, is believed to be Naveen’s well-thought out strategy after his party was dubbed as anti-Muslim for supporting the citizenship amendment legislation in Parliament. Days after the citizenship bill was passed in Parliament, a Muslim delegation met Naveen in December expressing apprehensions about the law. A rally was also organized in the city against the citizenship law and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) following which Naveen announced that his party would not support NRC.

A film star-turned-politician, Khan is associated with the regional party since its inception. Khan was recently appointed as advisor of the SC/ST development and minority affairs department. “I have been associated with the Biju Pariwar even before BJD was formed. I have performed the duties assigned to me by the leader and never crossed any limit,” said Khan.

With a MBA degree from the Oxford University and masters in public administration from Harvard University, Kumar had a key role in shaping the party’s strategy over the years. He was looking after the BJD organisation in Kalahandi and Nuapada districts during the last election. He was posted as advisor, special development councils, in the rank of chief secretary after BJD formed the government for the fifth time in 2019.

With his government’s focus on backward communities, Naveen chose Mamata, a grassroot BJD worker for the Rajya Sabha berth. She belongs to the Kudumi community. “Our chief minister has always emphasized on empowerment of women. I will continue to work for welfare of rural women,” Mamata said.

Similarly, Singh is a popular labour union leader. He had joined BJD before 2014 general election and played a significant role in garnering support from various trade unions for BJD. Heading the Odisha Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board since 2014, Singh resigned from the post following his nomination to the upper house.

All the four leaders, who met Naveen at his residence here, said they will file nomination papers on March 11. Though BJD is set to win three seats, no party in the assembly has the absolute majority to win the fourth seat as a candidate requires support of at least 30 MLAs to win. “We will see what has to be done,” said Naveen, when asked as to how they will manage numbers for the fourth seat.

The BJP with 23 MLAs in the assembly is yet to take a call whether the party will field a candidate while Congress with only nine MLAs does not have the requisite number to field a candidate. If Congress abstains from voting and BJD manages to get support of the lone independent candidate, it will favour the party in case BJP fields a candidate.

HOWRAH: A 19-year-old Bangabasi College student died after he was pushed out of the Malda Intercity Express on Friday evening after getting inadvertently caught in a fight between two hawkers. He was on his way home in Birbhum.

Subhrojyti Pal fell from the running train between Bally and Uttarpara stations around 4pm on Friday. The two hawkers — Chandan Kundu and Makhan Roy — were arrested by railway police from Bandel station. They were sent to 14 days judicial custody.

According to railway police, Pal — a first-year science student and a resident of Ujjirpur village under Nalhati police station in Birbhum — was returning home from his hostel for the long Dol-Holi weekend.

According to witnesses, the hawkers’ quarrel began when the train crossed Belur station. They argued over the right to peddle wares in the compartment first. In no time, the altercation turned into a brawl. “The duo initially began fighting near the vestibule and gradually moved towards the door. In the melee, Roy suddenly pushed Kundu who fell on Pal. The 19-year-old was standing by the door. The force with which Kundu fell on him propelled Pal out of the compartment. He was rushed to Uttarpara state general hospital where he was declared ‘brought dead’.

Pal’s family said he had scored 85% in the higher secondary examination and was preparing for medical joint entrance examination. “We have arrested the hawker duo and registered a case of ‘culpable homicide not amounting to murder’ against them. Once the family comes to us, we shall ask them to lodge a formal complaint,” Howrah SRP K Kannan said.

SAMBALPUR: Sambalpur Police on Saturday arrested five persons for allegedly threatening district public relations and information officer ( Dipro ), Hemant Nayak, and forcing him to leave his workplace on February 28.

The men arrested include Nayak’s driver Debanand Ranbida (57) and storekeeper at the Dipro’s office, Aswini Malakar (also 57). Police did not reveal the names of the other three persons arrested. All five were arrested under sections 341, 294, 385, 506, 507, 120-B of the IPC and 25/27 of the Arms Act.

Nayak, who was asked to leave Sambalpur at gunpoint by three miscreants who forced entry into his car as it left the local railway station on February 28, had initially not lodged a police complaint. He had informed the district collector, who had forwarded the message to the local SP.

Police formed three teams to inquire into the matter. While two teams worked in Sambalpur, the third was sent to Bhubaneswar to contact Nayak. The Dipro finally filed an FIR with Sambalpur Police on Thursday, following which a case was registered by Khetrajpur Police here.

Sambalpur SP Kanwar Vishal Singh said preliminary investigation showed that Nayak had had a spat with his driver, who hatched a conspiracy with storekeeper Aswini Malakar to teach his boss a lesson.

On being contacted, Nayak said, “I have already written to my higher officials that I will not go to Sambalpur.”

78,['8/03/2020'],Fabric collages and godhadis stitch a revival of fortunes for Anandwan women,"Nagpur: When social media made sending greetings easy and cheap, the greeting card entity run by over 20 women at Anandwan — philanthropist Baba Amte’s Maharogi Sewa Samiti (MSS) in Warora — became outdated making them jobless. There were no buyers for 1.5 lakh greeting cards they had created.

Depressed when these women were not ready to explore any other vocation, social entrepreneur & CEO of MSS Dr Sheetal Amte-Karajgi came out with an idea of few products which would be environmentally sustainable, made out of waste and still become unique.

The social entrepreneur recalled when top cricketer’s daughter wore her dress twice, it was a big news on social media. Some people badly trolled her. “I was intrigued. I was taught to use the dress until it is unwearable and then send it for making ‘godhadis’ (quilt),” Dr Amte says.

“We started making fabric collages and ‘godhadis’. The most important part of this idea was to bring back dignity to the artists in terms of more profit per piece, job security, emotional connect as well as a regular access to market,” she added.

Though a doctor, Dr Amte’s DNA is that of an artist. She used all her skills to motivate these women to create fabric collages and godhadis out of environmental waste. As the group of women lost their job, they had a lot of insecurity about sustainability of their job.

“I made them a promise that soon these collages will be honoured and proudly owned by most of the dignitaries of India and the world. However, we didn’t have a market that time. I knew we were taking a big risk but entrepreneurship is all about seeing opportunities in dark and creating new markets,” Dr Amte said.

Fortunately, the same social media, which was bane for greeting cards unit, turned out to be a boon. The first order of 50 fabric collages was bought by Nagpur’s Dr Devendra Khandait from Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for distribution across the world leaders. Today, around 40 women are at work and 100 more will be roped in soon.

Each collage bears the name and signature of the artist. Within 60 days, perfection was achieved in terms of process and marketing. In the last 5 months, these women have sold over 700 collages out of which at least 500 are proudly owned by VVIPs, district collectors and many CEOs apart from various world leaders.

“We are now overbooked and fabric collages have made a revenue of almost Rs10 lakhs which is a dream come true. Same thing happened with godhadis, which are stitched by layering saris or ‘lugadas’ (a traditional wear) together,” she says.

Godhadi requires minimum production efforts, minimizing value chain losses and earn more benefits along with emotional connect. People remember their childhood godhadis vividly as that serves as an umbilical cord between their mother and themselves, especially when mothers have stitched them using grandmothers’ saris.

These women are also making and exploring the space for many other products like live tree sculptures, sculptures from environmental waste, hospital sleepers out of discarded tyres and making fabric on scrapped rapier looms and dying with environmentally-friendly processes.

The last six months were eventful for these women. They created and sold products worth Rs20 lakhs. A successful Kala Ghoda exhibition was also organized. The MSS has united 42 top Maharashtrian film artists and fraternity to create change for future. It released many video blogs with news channels as reference content for new generation and connected a whole lot of followers for our ideas through social media.

“Suddenly, from nowhere, we are international. It just took a larger vision to penetrate across all the barriers and making the artisans part of this collective dream. Once they were convinced that we are treating them with dignity and respect, they all became proud partners of the vision,” said a delighted Dr Amte.

MAHE, which is home to thousands of foreign, NRI students and staff, has asked them to stay indoors for at least two weeks, and also undergo health checkups. “These strict measures are taken to prevent a Covid-19 outbreak on campus. We are keeping a vigil on whoever has visited foreign countries,” said Dr H S Ballal , pro-chancellor, MAHE.

Manipal, which is also known as a student town, is home to more than 15,000 students and staff, and has over 3,000 foreign and NRI students.

Ballal said that precautionary measures are being taken, not to create panic, but following guidelines of the World Health Organisation. “Recently two of our staff who visited Italy were quarantined after their return to Manipal, for about two weeks. We have also asked other staff or students who visit foreign countries not report to office or class for a few days, and seek medical help if they suffer from any symptoms of Covid-19.”

The institution has requested students not to gather in large numbers within the campus. Ballal expressed that the biggest challenge will be on Holi, which is an important festival for students from north India. The campus gets soaked in myriad hues as scores of students celebrate Holi at Manipal Greens and the MIT Campus. “Since celebrations cannot be avoided, we have asked students to take utmost precautions. Meanwhile, the management is also keeping a close watch.”

MAHE, apart from having regular foreign students, also has foreign student who visit the campus on short student exchange programmes or for project work. Ballal said that foreign students visiting campus for short periods are requested to be screened. “The holidays season is yet to commence for students. We will come up with a fresh advisory before they return to campus,” added Ballal.

10-bed isolation ward

District health officer Dr Sudhir Chandra Suda told STOI that the district administration asked Kasturba Hospital Manipal to reserve a 10-bed isolation ward. “The MAHE management in Manipal has been asked to keep a vigil on foreign students coming to campus,” he added.

CHENNAI: Airlines have begun feeling the pinch of Covid-19 threat with international and domestic check-ins falling significantly, making the Chennai airport terminal look empty during the morning peak hours.

An airport official said flights are going almost 50% empty on international routes as people are not traveling to international destinations in southeast Asia and the Middle East.

Passengers are reporting wearing masks while airline staff too have been told to take precautions while checking-in passengers.

In the past three days, domestic flights too are not getting good patronage. Flights from Chennai to Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata — the three busiest routes from the city — have witnessed a dip in passenger load.

“Check-ins have began reducing in the past few days after news spread on more people suspected of contracting the Covid-19 infection. Peak hours are seeing less passengers on domestic routes as well. People are not traveling unless it’s essential,” said an airline staff.

Jeshma C who flew to Thiruvananthapuram said, “The flight was not full. There were around 20 seats empty on the plane which had around 120 seats. There was thermal checking on arrival in Kerala.” Similarly, flights to the Middle East witnessed poor patronage. A pilot who flies to Middle East destinations from Chennai said, “Loads have come down considerably. People don’t want to fly. But flights on Singapore route from Trichy have good load factor. People who need to fly are traveling.” It may take time for the impact to be felt on domestic routes, he added.

However, airlines are not getting the number of passengers they usually get in March. “The Covid-19 threat is likely to turn worse in the coming days as people are hesitant to be in a closed environment on a flight. Aircraft are being fumigated as a precaution,” said an airport official.

Meanwhile, fares have dipped since bookings have come down. Air fares are in the range of Rs 2,100 to Rs 2,600 for travel in the next few days to Mumbai. Usually, fares touch Rs 5,000 for a week’s advance booking. On the Delhi route, the fare band is from Rs 4,000 to Rs 4,800 and to Kolkata it’s Rs 2,000 to Rs 6,800. On the Kolkata route, where fare is always more than Rs 5,000, tickets are selling at Rs 2,700 for mid next week.

Airlines are forced to fly as they cannot cancel scheduled flights. A few airlines have cancelled some flights at the end of March to cut losses.

AHMEDABAD: American chef Alice Waters famously wrote, ‘Knowing where your food comes from can change your life.’ Kamala , a cafe-cum-nutrition training centre run by SEWA, is no run-off-the-‘meal’ place. The first thing you notice is the blackboard informing patrons that the vegetables and grains/cereals used have arrived fresh from farms of their women farmers from places such as Boriyavi and Bamanva in Anand district.

You will not be served potatoes and refined flour here as a rule. Kamala would rather serve you whole grains, especially highly nutritious locally cultivated millets includiing ragi, jowar, bajri. The concept which has been replicated in five districts of Gujarat is all set to go national with Sewa readying to start a Kamala run by women in Uttar Pradesh.

Reema Nanavaty, executive director of SEWA, said that seeds of Kamala were sown by Prof Kamala Chowdhry, one of the founders of IIM Ahmedabad, who donated the land near CEE in Bodakdev. “The idea was to create a space where the self-employed women can realize their potential. The land today has the place which is much more than an eatery or café for us philosophically. We just know it as Kamala as homage to her,” she said.

The place had humble beginnings with providing tiffins to the office-goers nearby in 2018, said Uma Swaminathan Iyer, managing director of Kamala. “The women would visit the commercial buildings nearby and provide them coupons. As the lunch options became popular, we also started a seating arrangement which expanded in past two years. We now serve wholesome snacks too,” she said.

The USP of the venture lies in its core policies – to use only enriching ingredients, sourced from quality women producers and minimal use of oil. The venture today employs 75 women in Ahmedabad and 425 other women in Anand, Sabarkantha, Patan, Surendranagar and Mehsana districts where similar units have been set up in past one year.

The bustling kitchen is staffed with women from Ahmedabad and nearby areas who, in many cases, are sole breadwinners for their families.

Neha, 27, working at the Kamala kitchen, said she got employment when she needed it the most. “I am mother to a young child with little support system. My husband, working as a daily wager, doesn’t get regular earnings and thus I work here full time,” she said, with tears in her eyes and a smile on her lips as she prepared curry of the day. “Thankfully, Kamala understands me as a woman worker and allows me to bring my child to work.”

Kamala members said that the spot is now utilized for social gatherings and small parties. “Patrons come here primarily to explore new Gujarati dishes and old ones prepared the traditional way. We make about seven different types of beans, smaller and sweeter brinjals known as ‘ravaiya’ and also white pumpkin available in a few parts of central Gujarat. Some of the flavours come from the ingredients we grow right on the plot,” said Iyer.

Incidentally, the notification left out Puducherry side of the lake.Located 12km from Puducherry, the inter-state lake was notified as a bird sanctuary in 2008 and 2014 by the Puducherry and Tamil Nadu governments respectively. The Bombay Natural History Society, a member of Birdlife International, has designated Ousteri as an Important Bird Area (IBA) of India. More than 20,000 birds belonging to 40 migratory species inhabit in the lake during winter. “The lake has also been identified as a heritage site by International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, ranking it among the most important wetlands of Asia,” a notification issued by the ministry said. The Asian Wetland Bureau has declared Ousteri as one of the 115 significant wetlands in Asia.Migratory birds moving from North Asia, Africa and Europe to Point Calimere fly along Ousteri corridor during winter. The notification said the state government should prepare a zonal master plan in consultation with the local people. Forests, horticulture and agriculture park and open spaces earmarked for recreational purposes in the zone should not be used for major commercial, residential or industrial activities. A monitoring committee-led by Villupuram district collector will monitor the compliance of the notification.Ousteri Neeratharaa Kootamaippu president D Ramamoorthy welcomed the Union government’s decision but felt the move was too late and not adequate. “The Centre has declared certain areas around Ousteri Lake in Tamil Nadu as eco-sensitive zones. The lake is equally spread in Puducherry (390 hectares) and Tamil Nadu (410 hectares). We cannot protect a water body by declaring only a section of the area surrounding the lake as eco-sensitive and letting the other part (in Puducherry) be exploited. It will not serve the purpose,” Ramamoorthy said.Poothurai, Perambai and Kadaperikuppam villages in Vanur Taluk in Villupuram district of Tamil Nadu fall under the eco-sensitive zone.Environmentalists pointed out that the competent authority in Puducherry has not made any concrete effort to prevent dumping of industrial and hospital waste material into the lake. “The effort to preserve the lake must be from all stakeholders, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry governments and the Centre.

84,['8/03/2020'],"In pvt hosps, they are struggling to get the work-life balance right","Nagpur: When you think of a private multispecialty hospital, the images that come to mind are that of an attractive multi-storey, air-conditioned structure with state-of-the-art infrastructure. And running the show are well-dressed nurses, a sincere cleanliness staff, ever-smiling receptionists, clerks, accountants, assistants, attendants, technicians and doctors. Generally, a chunk of the staff comprises women.

In other words, India’s health care industry is powered by women. More than 76% of hospital employees, 77% of people who work in doctors’ clinics and more than 88% of health workers in India are women. Sadly, this backbone of the industry is struggling to maintain the right work-life balance.

An analytical study on private multispecialty hospitals in Nagpur shows that more than 78% of women find maintaining work-life balance the biggest challenge. These include doctors, nurses, technical staff, admin and customer care staff in ten leading private hospitals.

The study was done by management graduate Nishant Dhodre, who was awarded PhD by Nagpur University on the subject in 2019. The study is full of alarming observations which need to be addressed by the health care industry and no better occasion than International Women’s Day to address the issue for a new start.

“More and more women have started taking up jobs to ease the increasing financial pressure on their families. In India, working women account for 15% of the total female urban population. The health care industry works 24X7. As workers are under a lot of pressure due to the workload, I chose women working in hospitals as the subject of my study,” said Dhodre.

His study focused on the work-life balance of women employees in ten leading private multispecialty hospitals in Nagpur, which is emerging as the health care hub of Central India.

Dhodre did his research between 2015 and 2017 under the guidance of Prof Rajiv Ashtikar, chairman of board of studies, commerce and management of RTMNU.

“Women play multiple roles, be it at work or at home. They experience a lot of work-related stress and at times, even depression and anxiety which affects their productivity and family life. Married women are unable to maintain a proper work-life balance compared to the ones who are unmarried,” Dhondre said.

According to the study, the major work-related factors affecting women employees are long work hours, less salary, no recreational or cultural activities, no flexible work options and shortage of staff.

85,['8/03/2020'],A weaver’s daughter who fought social stigma to spin success story,"Mahazabi (R) with Saba

Varanasi: Mahazabi, a 24-year-old girl from a weaver family, fought against all odds with sheer grit and determination to bring out her family from penury and social orthodoxy.

Her family slipped into abject poverty after the death of her father, Mohammad Yahiya, in 2001. With the meagre earning of Rs 100 a day by cutting sarees, the family of 10 could barely manage something to eat. Mahazabi, who resides in Muslim-dominated Saraiyya locality, had to struggle on social and economic fronts.

As girls in her society are not allowed to study and go out for job, she decided to cross every hurdle coming her way.

She not only studied and got a job in a private hospital but also inspired her younger sister Saba to follow suit.

Mahazabi has eight siblings, six sisters and two brothers. Besides, she had nine step-siblings from the first wife of her father.

After Yahiya’s death, Mahazabi’s step-mother and their children distanced themselves from them.

“They took us as a burden on them and asked my mother to fend for herself. I was just five-year-old when my father expired. As we did not get support from Badi Ammi (step-mother), my mother took up saree cutting work for a living. But, with her meagre-earning we had to skip meals,” said Mahazabi. “There was no question of education for us in such a situation,” she added.

Since 2015, she has working at the front office of a private hospital in Mehmoorganj area. “It was not easy for me to work. I was not only discouraged but also rebuked by my step-siblings. Taking up a job is considered a bad thing in our society,” she said.

She thanked Dr Subodh Kumar Singh, a plastic surgeon, who gave her job after coming to know about her misery. While in job, she did her graduation and post-graduation as private candidate and is planning to pursue PhD.

“I wanted to prove that girls are not inferior to boys in any way,” she said.

Three of her elder sisters are married, while her two brothers are into weaving.

Inspired by Mahazabi, her younger sister Saba also decided to study and earn for the family. While pursuing graduation, she is working in the same hospital as a nutritional counselor since 2017.

“Times are changing and people’s outlook is also no longer the same. Those who once discouraged me from going out for job are now seeking suggestions from me,” she said. “Her determination and fighting spirit not only improved the financial status of her family but also brought a transformation in the outlook of people around her,” Dr Singh said.

HUBBALLI: Applicants to the post of gazetted probationers for the 2017-18 batch of the Karnataka Public Service Commission ( KPSC ), notified recently, can heave a sigh of relief as Aadhaar will now be accepted as an eligible identify proof.

The move comes days after TOI reported (February 27) on the plight of job aspirants who were in a fix as KPSC refused to accept Aadhaar as identity proof despite it being widely acknowledged as one. In its earlier notification, KPSC considered only voter identity card, passport, PAN card and driving license as proof of identification.

G Sathyavathi, secretary, KPSC, said: “We assumed the candidates would have documents like voter identity card, passport, PAN card and driving license. However, we learnt it isn’t so after the TOI report. As we cannot make Aadhaar mandatory for recruitment, we checked the legal implications and accepted it in the ‘other’ section. We have gathered that many candidates have successfully applied for the post online after allowing Aadhaar.”

Welcoming the move, KPSC aspirants Sanjeevini Niduvani, Ambarish Bannikoppa, and Santosh Naikwadi said they would have lost the opportunity if Aadhaar was not accepted. “We hail from urban areas and do not have other documents allowed by the KPSC. But we had obtained Aadhaar card from our high school days as it was required for scholarship,” they said.

90,['8/03/2020'],Corona outbreak: 7 Italian tourists untraceable in city,"Varanasi: The health department is yet to locate the whereabouts of seven Italian tourists, who left for Varanasi from Mirzapur on Friday, even as three more positive cases of coronavirus were reported from the country on Saturday. However, Mirzapur district administration claimed that the Varanasi health department had been intimated about their departure.

“We had received a telephonic intimation, not written, from Mirzapur chief medical officer Dr O P Tiwari on Friday, but we are yet to receive any information about their arrival in the city,” Varanasi CMO Dr V B Singh told TOI on Saturday.

However, Mirzapur district magistrate Sushil Kumar Patel said the Varanasi CMO was informed again on Saturday regarding the movement of Italian tourists.

Seven Italian tourists, who arrived at Mirzapur on Thursday, sent the local administration into a tizzy in view of the coronavirus scare. With more than 100 casualties due to the virus, Italy is one of the high-prevalence countries after China. As soon as the staff at the hotel where they checked in on Thursday came to know about their nationality, they informed the local administration and health officials. A team of doctors then rushed to the hotel and all the seven Italians were examined. However, no symptom of coronavirus was detected in them.

The Italian group arrived Delhi on February 25, and reached Mirzapur after visiting Khajuraho, Chitrakoot and Prayagraj. As per protocol, those who come in contact with the infected persons or have arrived from the affected place are kept in isolation for 14 days.

Inspector, government railway police, Varanasi Junction, Ashok Dubey said all the coaches of 75116 Prayagraj-Ghazipur Demu train were packed with students returning from Prayagraj. Before reaching the platform, the train stopped at outer of Varanasi Junction on Friday midnight. Meantime, two groups of students clashed over a dispute in the train. After jumping from the coach, some students hurled a crude bomb on the train, Dubey said.

He said the bomb was of very low intensity, but it damaged a mirror window. The glass splinters of the damaged window hit four people, who were rushed to divisional hospital. Dubey said an FIR against unidentified persons has been lodged and the injured have been sent home after treatment. Apart from examining CCTV footages of yard area, other sources are being utilised to identify the accused, he said.

GRP inspector, Ghazipur City station, Udit Raj said a massive checking drive was carried out at platforms and trains in view of a heavy rush of passengers due to Holi. Before the GRP and RPF personnel could reach the spot, the accused managed to escape.

92,['8/03/2020'],"Businessman, family members robbed at knifepoint at home","Nagpur: A city businessman and his family members were allegedly robbed and tied at knifepoint by three masked miscreants, in the early hours of Friday at their house in Buddha Nagar. The accused fled the spot after the elder son of the businessman jumped from the first floor of their building and asked for help.

According to Pachpaoli police, a total of five persons were involved in the crime, and three of them attacked the house of Pradip Bhambani, 48. Cops have registered a case of robbery and arrested four of the accused — one of whom was found sleeping in a locked house in the locality by a woman, a few hours after the incident.

The accused have been identified as Rockson Peter, Deepak Sontake, Chetan Gwalbanshi, Ajay Masram and Raju.

According to sources, Raju, a relative of the businessman, had come to know of a rumour that the latter had received Rs2 crores for selling his garment shop in Vaishali Nagar. Raju then planned the robbery, along with Ajay.

Police said that it is not clear whether Pradip has actually sold his shop. It is learnt that there was not much cash at his house, so the accused took Rs2,000 from the businessman’s pocket.

According to the cops, Pradip was sleeping at his home when he heard some noise outside his door. He woke up and opened the door, when the three masked men grabbed him. The accused pushed Pradip inside the house by covering his mouth, so he could not scream for help. They pinned him on the bed and tied his hands and legs.

The accused used a tape to shut Pradip’s mouth. Meanwhile, his other family members also woke up.

The accused tried to tie them up with a rope, when his elder son jumped from the balcony of the house and raised an alarm. Soon, the neighbours started gathering and the accused fled the spot.

While two accused fled from the front of the house, one of them went through the back. He later jumped to a locked house behind Pradip’s home, and hid in a toilet.

On Friday morning, when a woman who lives in the locked house came to clean it, she found the miscreant sleeping inside the toilet. She immediately raised an alarm and the neighbours gathered at the spot.

After around 45 minutes, Pachpaoli police reached the spot and took the accused in custody. The accused was earlier claiming that he was drunk and went to the house, and it was only after strict questioning that he allegedly confessed to robbing the house.

Police have now launched a search operation to nab the rest of the accused.

Mundhe is trying to gather the current exact amount of pending bills and liabilities of the cash-strapped Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC).

This came to fore after Mundhe issued a show cause notice to superintending engineer (public works) Manoj Talewar on Friday. Talewar was allegedly delaying submitting data of pending bills. Mundhe had directed heads of all departments to submit data by March 5 afternoon.

As per the notice, Talewar also kept revising the data of pending bills. He had also not submitted the data in the expected manner.

After Mundhe’s reply, urban development minister Eknath Shinde will submit it in the state legislature. It will be read out when speaker Nana Patole will allow the calling attention motion. The budget session resumes on Wednesday.

The NMC has not made public various types of violations in its finance system. After the general body demanded it, Mundhe on February 20 had pointed out brazen violations in the NMC. The NMC had spent Rs 150.82 crore deducted from the salaries of employees for general provident fund (GPF) and defined contribution pension scheme (DCPS) for clearing bills of contractors.

The amount is yet to be deposited in GPF and DCPS accounts. Pending bills are over Rs800 crore and future liabilities stand at over Rs2,000 crore.

94,['8/03/2020'],Goa schools to get new advisory on coronavirus precautions,"Representative image

PANAJI: With over 30 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country, schools in Goa will be issued fresh instructions on the precautionary measures to be taken for students to prevent coronavirus infections. While the directorate of education (DoE) had already issued directives on the virus in February, the new instructions are necessitated following an order to all states by the Union human resource development ministry.

“We will issue the necessary instructions to schools. Some instructions have already been issued,” said education director Vandana Rao.

Meanwhile, some city schools are already advising students to carry sanitisers with them and reviewing plans for outings like picnics, to keep students safe.

In its earlier advisory, the DoE had said that “washing hands and sneezing into elbows is the best practice” to keep infection at bay.

The February advisory was more focused on busting myths related to Covid-19 and said that misinformation and racism are more dangerous than any virus. Students were told not to fall prey to panic over the virus, or to engage in ‘rude’ and ‘insensitive’ jokes which may be racist.

“The panic and hysteria... is fuelled by racism and xenophobia, not evidence or practicality,” stated the note issued to schools.

Clarifying the ‘myth’ that “coronavirus is the most dangerous virus on earth”, the advisory countered it with the ‘fact’ that “common flu kills 60 times more people annually than coronavirus”.

The circular also asked schools to inform students that they should not believe everything they read online about the virus because it may not necessarily be factually correct. “Check for references and look for evidence, not ideology,” the advisory said.

“Only 2% cases have reported deaths, and most of these deaths are associated with weaker immune systems (e.g. old age),” stated the advisory, clarifying that being diagnosed with coronavirus does not mean that death due to it is inevitable.

A nationwide alert on the spread of the disease and PM Narendra Modi’s advisory against mass gatherings for the festivities have contributed to the uncertainty. “Till now, we have sold only 20% of our stock. Other years, we would have sold at least 70% by now. Reports of nCoV cases in other parts of the country and the PM’s tweet are influencing people,” said Bapi Pal, a shopkeeper at Gariahat.The dip in sales has apparebtly also got to do with people’s wariness to handle anything Chinese, the epicentre of the outbreak being Wuhan in central China. Though shopkeepers are explain to customers that the water guns and other accessories were either from previous year’s stock or of Indian make, customers are sceptical about buying anything other than aabir. Aguntika Ghosh from Ganguly Bagan is unsure whether to buy even herbal gulaal or not. “They might as well be Chinese products being packaged differently and marketed this Holi,” she said.Vicky Shaw, a shopkeeper in Jadubabu Bazaar, said, “I don’t know what I will do with the leftover stock.” Sushil Golcha, a wholesale herbal aabir dealer in Burrabazar, said, “People are getting scared for no reason.”Ankit Raj Pathak, a student from Behala, has decided not to join the celebrations as he does not want to come in contact with large groups. “We have to safeguard ourselves.

96,['8/03/2020'],NU admin flayed for concealing Yes Bank data,"Nagpur: The Nagpur University administration on Saturday came under attack from members during the Senate meeting for no mention of Rs191crore parked with Yes Bank in its audit report 2018-19.

Several other ambiguities also came to the fore in the audit report. The report, a copy of which is with TOI, did mention the university’s FDs of more than Rs700 crore in nationalized banks but has kept the FDs in “scheduled bank” column empty.

The report has also a wrong mention of date regarding opening and closing balance. It has produced the audit report of 2018-19 but in the “investment” column it is mentioned the date of April 1, 2017, instead of 2018-19. Finance and accounts officer (FAO) Raju Hiwase, however, admitted the date error in the audit report.

RBI has barred Yes Bank customers from withdrawing more than Rs50,000 in one go due to the bank’s crisis. Now, the NU online transaction have also stopped as the gateway is not functioning.

Hiwase said the transaction have been suspended by the university to prevent any further follow of funds into the account. “The NU is accepting payments in the form of demand drafts (DDs) from colleges and students till an alternative arrangement is made,” he said.

On June 20, 2016, the NU had tied up with Yes Bank primarily to facilitate online receipts from students while HDFC was chosen for receiving fee from colleges.

The move had drawn objections from several quarters as no tenders were floated as mandated by the finance code of the state government before signing any pact with private entities.

In several letters to the government and university in 2017, academician Dr Vedprakash Mishra had opposed the move of transferring funds to Yes Bank. He had also accused the NU administration of receiving favours.

The NU, however, had defended its decision to go ahead with the pacts on the sole ground that the two private banks will not be charging any commission for these online transactions.

On Friday, Hiwase reluctantly placed on record the fact that Rs191crore was deposited in Yes Bank after members made intense demand. He failed to give a plausible reason for the issues raised by Senate members Jagdish Joshi and backed by members Vishnu Changde and Manmohan Bajpai.

Vice chancellor S P Kane said a committee will be formed and asked to submit a report within a month.

Bajpai said the NU has already formed several committees without any result.

Kane informed the house that the decision to tie up with the private banks was placed before the management council which approved it then.

97,['8/03/2020'],Youth arrested for snatching Pondy minister’s cellphone,"Puducherry: Police on Friday arrested a 21-year-old man on charges of snatching a mobile phone from a minister in Puducherry. The arrested was identified as Bala of Moolakulam. Police seized the bike he used to commit the crime.

Police have launched a hunt for his accomplice involved in the crime. Police had recovered the mobile phone snatched from agriculture minister R Kamalakannan. The snatcher sold the mobile phone for Rs 3,000 to a shopkeeper at Villianur.

Senior superintendent of police (law and order) Rahul Alwal said the arrested youth confessed to the crime. Inquiries revealed that he and his aide used to snatch or steal mobile phones from people in and around Puducherry and sell the gadgets at a relatively cheaper price to unsuspecting people.

The SSP appealed to people to come forward and lodge complaints of snatching with police. “If the police refuse to register a complaint, people can call 100,” he said.

Kamalakannan, who hails from Karaikal, reached Puducherry on March 2. He was staying at the guesthouse allotted to him near the fire station in Puducherry. Known for his simplicity, the minister usually moves around the town on his bike or on foot without any security detail.

He left the guesthouse for a walk on March 2, took a stroll on beach road and was walking towards the guesthouse when he got a call on his mobile. He answered the call and was talking on the phone while strolling towards the guesthouse.

When he crossed the fire station within the former white town, two men in a motorcycle zipped past him and the pillion snatched the phone from him.

The minister, who was caught unaware, could not note down the registration number of the bike. The Android phone cost Rs 18,000. He lodged a complaint with police and alerted the service provider to block the number.

State finance minister Ajit Pawar made the announcements in his budget speech on Friday.

Prafulla Pawar, registrar, SPPU, said, “We welcome the allocation of funds for the hostel on our campus. It would help the university in enhancing the inclusivity in higher education.”

The SPPU students sought speedy funds allocation for the hostel. Kuldeep Ambekar, a student, said, “Pune being an education and IT hub, many students come here either to study or to work. Living in the city is expensive and so a hostel exclusively for students from backward classes will help those coming from outside, especially rural areas, to pursue higher education without worrying about finding a cheap accommodation.”

At present, there are 18 hostels on the university campus. About 1,700 men and 1,500 women stay in them.

SPPU senate member Bageshree Manthalkar, also associated with an NGO working for women’s rights, said, “A lot of women come to Pune because the institutes in the city have hostels. But many parents are reluctant to send their daughters to Pune for jobs because they feel it is not safe. Living with strangers in a rented flat is not something many parents like. So, many qualified women lose their right to work.”

She said if there are working women’s hostels run by the government, more parents will send their daughters because people tend to believe the government will arrange security. “A hostel for working women from backward classes will be of help. There is a need for working women’s hostels for women from all categories,” added Manthalkar.

PUNE: With all six revenue divisions in the state set to have independent women's commission as announced in the state budget, complaints from women would be heard and addressed in a better manner, Yashomati Thakur, women and child development minister, told TOI on Saturday.

Women from across the state would no longer need to travel to Mumbai to raise their issues with the state women's commission, she said. “There will be receiving offices. We will have offices and staff at the six revenue divisions as part of the state women’s commission,’’ she said. The six revenue divisions are Mumbai, Pune, Nashik , Aurangabad, Nagpur and Amravati.

This year, Rs2,000 crore has been allotted for the women and child department in the state. She said that she would ensure that the allocations are allotted and the amount spent as per the schedule, especially with regards to the implementation of the Manodhairya scheme.

The state economic survey report released ahead of the budget session had highlighted several issues, including reduction in beneficiary and fund utilisation from Rs80crore in 2018-19 to Rs30 crore in 2019-20.

The Economic Survey of Maharashtra 2019-20 tabled on Thursday stated that while there were 1,153 beneficiaries of the Manodhairya scheme in the previous year, the number of beneficiaries fell to 462 till October 2019. In a report tabled in Parliament by woman and child development minister Smriti Irani, the state figured among the lowest in utlisation of funds.

The Manodhairya scheme underwent a series of revisions in December 2017. Besides the clause on the recovery of the compensation sum, some additional documents needed to be submitted to avail of the scheme, including the victim’s statement recorded before the magistrate. According to the data from the Office of the Commissioner of Women and Child Development and Deputy Commissioner, Planning, Divisional Commissionerate, the state incurred an expenditure of Rs 7.85 crore under the Manodhairya scheme in 2018-19, while it shelled out Rs 3.44 crore till October 2019.

The second time around, the three-storey structure had to be emptied because Chundee, the tunnel boring machine (TBM) building this tunnel, hit an aquifer on August 31, and water flooded the tunnel, causing large-scale subsidence that had buildings collapsing one after theother. Though the 120-year-old house on Shyakrapara Lane didn’t come crashing down, extensive cracks appeared on walls. To ensure their safety, 12 occupants of the house were put up in a central Kolkata hotel for 70 days.All of them had returned home but they were again sent to the same hotel with Rosy, their labrador, as the second TBM, Urvi, started digging the east-bound tunnel. The TBM is likely to graze a corner of the house, which sits in the gap between the two underground tunnels, which are being built at a distance of 6 metres to 8 metres of each other under the serpentine lanes of Bowbazar.Engineers of ITD ITD-Cementation, company contracted to build the last leg of the Metro tunnels from Esplanade to Sealdah, are not taking any chance. “We have been told our building falls on the second TBM’s route as well. So we are back to the hotel for the third time,” said 75-year-old Gora Chand Dutta on Friday. The evacuation notice issued by Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation, implementing agency of East-West Metro, said they could return home on Wednesday. But the Duttas are keeping their fingers crossed as “homecoming” of most other evacuees had been deferred by over a week owing to slow tunnelling, especially in the cave-in zone that begins at Gour De Lane where many buildings developed cracks. The damage on Shykrapara Lane, where TBM Urvi has now entered, was much more.After six months, tunnelling resumed on February 18 following a High Court order. The TBM has burrowed under over 10 rickety houses. Its next stop is Durga Pituri Lane, the epicentre of the subsidence.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74535592,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-743121,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2-shyakrapara-lane-evacuated-third-time-to-facilitate-e-w-tunnelling/articleshow/74532247.cms

We need to spend four to five hours daily in surgery and follow-up works. A supportive family that understands my profession make matters comfortable,” said 40-year-old Sowmya, who is an assistant professor in department of cardiovascular and thoracic surgery department, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology ( SCTIMST ).

On the eve of International Women’s Day, the cardiac surgeon, who has an experience of 13 years in the medical field, shared with TOI the challenges and inspiration behind her successful career.

It has been three years since Sowmya, a recipient of Francis Fontan Prize from European Association for Cardio Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) in 2013, joined SCTIMST. Last year alone, she had performed 212 surgeries at the institute, where an average of 600 surgeries are conducted annually in the entire spectrum of congenital heart diseases of biventricular and univentricular physiology. The surgeon operates on a wide range of neonatal, infant, paediatric and adult congenital disorders.

The doctor shared the inspiration behind choosing specialisation in paediatric cardiac surgery. “My father Venkataraman wanted to become a cardiac surgeon, but he ended with a job in bank. Taking inspiration from my father, I decided to become a cardiac surgeon when I was in Class IX. Besides that, I like to work with children,” said Sowmya whose husband is a doctor based in Qatar.

Sowmya said the profession has its share of challenges as well. Handling kids with congenital heart diseases and explaining the condition to their parents is a difficult task which has to been dealt carefully, she said.

“It is usually the mothers who come to us seeking help and we explain the treatment procedure with care. Lack of coordination in primary care from paediatricians and obstetrician is also a challenge. Awareness need to be created for treatment for children with congenital heart diseases,” added Thiruvananthapuram native Sowmya, who lives here with his mother and two kids.

Aparna got the opportunity to talk to PM Modi on Saturday when he interacted with beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana and JAK store owners of country through video conference in a bid to create awareness about generic medicines on ‘Jan Aushadhi Diwas’.

Aparna, who belongs to Chowk area of PM’s constituency, was asked to share her experience. She said: “Whenever PM Modi speaks or interacts with someone it seems that the person is talking to the head of his or her family. I spoke about my initiatives considering him as a guardian and got praise and encouragement from him.” Aparna, who also runs an NGO, said: “For last 18 months, I have been running eight JAKs in different areas of Varanasi and one at Robertsganj in Sonbhadra district. Mostly women and specially-abled people are engaged at these JAKs.”

“My initiative was praised by the PM probably because it matched with the objective of the scheme which provides a good source of self-employment with sustainable and regular earnings,” she said. “Apart from operating these centres, my focus is on creating groups of volunteers, known as Jan Aushadhi Mitras, for the publicity of PM’s flagship scheme. Volunteers visit villages to encourage women to prepare list of medicines they want and purchase it from JAKs whenever they visit the city,” said Aparna.

“We have succeeded in creating awareness, especially about female hygiene as four lakh sanitary pads are sold from my stores every month,” she said.

110,['8/03/2020'],NGOs seek better rehab for trafficked,"Vijayawada: The NGOs working on rehabilitation of human trafficking victims found fault with governments in their failure to lend a helping hand to the victims.

Though there have been many laws to provide rehabilitation and financial support, they have remained on paper as very few were getting compensation, said representatives of various NGOs.

In a round table conference held by HELP and Vimukti NGOs with women organisations and women wings of political parties on the eve of International Women’s Day, the NGOs appealed to the government to implement the laws to help trafficking victims to lead a normal life.

Sk Haseena, convener, Vimukti, said the women who were rescued from human trafficking rackets were subjected to societal as well as governmental discrimination. “Not even one per cent of the victims are getting financial support from the government that start their lives afresh. The respective governments have failed in this regard despite having supporting laws,” she said.

Akkineni Vanaja, women’s wing secretary, CPI, said the party supported the cause of rehabilitating the trafficked victims.

Sunkara Padmasri, general secretary, Congress, said governments should listen to the NGOs while formulating the laws. Representatives of CPM, social workers and lawyers participated in the conference. There has been a steep rise in the number of trafficking incidents in the state, with girls being most vulnerable.

PANAJI: All ecological issues go beyond politics as far as the survival of humanity is concerned, said state finance secretary Daulat Hawaldar on Saturday while speaking on the Mhadei issue.

“When you’re confronted with ecological issues, can you depend on the government?” he said.

“Scientists, sociologists and environmentalists say ‘no’ because we cannot depend on the government for ecological issues,” he said, adding, “the way out is through people’s movement”.

“All general stakeholders have to come out on the road. It’s only a mass movement of the people that can arrest these kinds of ecological disasters,” he said.

Hawaldar cited the example of slavery and the racial discrimination that existed during the colonial era, until they were abolished after the freedom struggle.

“Till that time, there were mass movements. Things started changing thereafter and the colonial powers felt they won’t be able to hold it for long. Then liberation followed,” he said.

He also said that there is a way forward through art and culture. “If someone comes and sings a song on Mhadei, there is art and aesthetics in that. Last week, there was a folk dance procession in Mapusa during a protest march against the Mhadei verdict. That made an impact. Any communication made aesthetically and has a base in art and culture unites the society,” he said.

“Mhadei issue has an added advantage. Society gets united when such kind of agitations begin. Goa is strong in mythological and cultural practices… any movement to be successful has to go in the direction of a poet. Without poetry, we won’t be able to achieve a change in the behaviour of people,” he added.

Prayagraj: For total transparency in matriculation and intermediate results, the state examination board has decided to have ‘eyes’ and ‘ears’ across centres where answer sheets of Class X and Class XII examinees will be evaluated.

Taking electronic vigil a level up from mere district-wise exam hall monitoring from a centralised control room, the UPSEB is installing voice recorder-equipped CCTV cameras across evaluation centres in the state.

While secondary exams ended on March 3, the last intermediate paper was on Friday (March 6). Now, around 3.57 crore answer sheets will have to be scrutinised by approximately 1.5 lakh evaluators. The process is expected to begin from March 15-16 and completed in 10 days flat, i,e. by March 26.

The initial plan was to begin the evaluation process from March 12, but the state board decided to keep a buffer of a few days to ensure safe transportation of answer sheets after Holi. The number of evaluators have been increased to meet the 10-day deadline. Last year, UBSEB evaluation was completed in 15 days.

State exam board secretary Neena Srivastava has written to all district inspectors of schools (DIOS), asking them to provide information regarding presence of strong rooms and availability of voice recorder-equipped CCTV cameras in each hall where evaluation will take place at every centre.

The letter, dated March 2, has instructed the inspectors to furnish information on priority basis. “We are determined to ensure fair evaluation as ordered by the government. If anomalies come to the fore, respective district school inspectors will be held responsible,” Srivastava said.

The examiners won’t be allowed to keep smartphones in their possession at the time of evaluation, she added.

The first DLitt belongs to former HoD of NU’s PG English department RN Roy.

Hailing from Kalmeshwar, Bhelkar started his work life as a quality controller inspector with WCL. His passion for literature and quest for searching the link between science and literature compelled him to quit and take up academics.

In 1985, Bhelkar started working as an English teacher. He did his PhD on British science fiction — fantasy and reality. He is a bilingual writer and has published books in Marathi and English.

Following a 15-year post-doctoral research, Bhelkar produced two 300-plus-page volumes of treatise on Gramgeeta — the book written by Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj after whom the NU has been named.

In an interview with TOI, Bhelkar talks on his DLitt. Excerpts ...

Q. Why are your interests so diverse — from science fiction to literary works?

A. The multidisciplinary approach, (multi-voices) and secular vision of Gramgeeta cast a spell on me as a researcher to embark on the Herculean task of translation and criticism. It keeps pace with the native spirit, national and cosmic ramifications. It coordinates, conjunctures fissures and celebrates unity in diversity, which is the need of the hour in the Indian and global context.

Q. Tell us about your work on the Magnum Opus Gramgeeta vis-à-vis your study?

A. I submitted Volume I in February 2014. After submission, I worked on the treatise Volume I and Vol II for polishing the translated text and enriching the comparative cultural criticism. In the translation, I encountered the problem of untranslatability where the word specific to native soil or culture specific or dialect are transported from source language (SL) to targeted language (TL) as an equivalence can’t be found. Footnotes for words like ‘Tumbadi’ (Folk musical instrument), ‘Upanayan’ (a ritual for the twice born ceremony) are given.

Q. Why did you make two volumes?

A. Vol I became source text for Vol II — Comparative cultural criticism, taking into account Indian devotional poetry and ‘The Divine Comedy’ by Italian poet Dante. Vol I comprises 4,673 couplets and 41 Cantos. Vol II focuses on tradition and reality. It cuts across the terrains of translation studies, comparative studies, cultural and post-colonial studies (subaltern studies). It is a cultural product of comparative criticism. Translation is a creative act as the 20th century approaches. In translation, an attempt is made to retain the import of content with the consciousness of style and technique, and aesthetic facet. The cognisance of semiotic, semantic and aesthetic perspectives are taken to provide new original in TLT from SLT. In Vol II, the objective of this research endeavour is to analyse and interpret the translated text in the light of tradition and reality. Analysis and interpretation cut across sociology, philosophy, economics, history, environment science and thus explorative approach is multidisciplinary. In four sections of Vol II, the focus is on Indus Culture, Vedic age and post-colonial reality, Towards Cosmic Vision, Utopia and its Practicality, Mass Culture and Society.

Q. Was Gramgeeta way ahead of its time?

A. The measures which are suggested for rural restructure, social restructure, erosion of values, micro-finance operations, spiritual orientation, environmental consciousness are still relevant. Gramgeeta, being Utopia, its Utopian measures still have pragmatic base and practicability.

Q. What kind of issues are chronicled in the Gramgeeta?

A. In the treatise, a comparison has been made from the stand point of approaches to culture from Victorian poet Matthew Arnold to modernist TS Eliot, critics Raymond William, Homi Bhabha, American critics Fredick Jameson and Gerald Graff, British researchers Richard Hoggart and Stuart Hall. Gramgeeta anticipates tradition to the extent which is benevolent to human society but deviates from the orthodox tradition to counter it. As a new historicism, Gramgeeta is a counter discourse to the orthodox tradition of religion, cultural politics and the Macaulean concept of education. It has displaced marginal, oppressed, peripheral, wretched, subalterns to the centre of the text and thus Gramgeeta ‘de-constructs’ the traditional construct in the Derridian sense with post-modernist stance.

Q. How is Macaulean concept countered?

A. In his speech in the British parliament on February 2, 1835, Macaulay said that if the Indians think that all that is foreign and English is good and great than their own, they will lose their self-esteem, their native culture and they will become what we want them to, a truly dominated nation. Gramgeeta counters the Macaulean concept of education, stressing on skill orientation, retaining of the native culture and restoration of ethical values. Therefore, in the post-colonial era, there is Afro-American literature, Caribbean literature, Indian literature and Canadian literature because of consciousness of their native identities and voices.

Q. Is Gramgeeta a religious text?

A. It has the content of religion and spiritual but it is not strictly a religious text. It encompasses social, political, economical, ethical, scientific and environmental facets and it is secular in approach, irrespective of caste, creed, cults, sects and religion. It epitomizes freedom, equality, justice and unity. It imbibes the humanitarian spirit and focuses on inner potential and human action.

Q. Does it show a way of life?

A. Gramgeeta is an alternative model to the Gandhian ideology. Gramgeeta stresses on self-reliance of villagers, use of mass communication means, collective pray, impetus to cottage industries, micro-finance schemes, empowerment of gram sabha and aversion to superstitions. Though he was at Sewagram for a month during Gandhi’s stay and has respect for his mission, the saint alleged that he was not a disciple of Gandhi and provided an alternative model for rural restructure and social design.

Q. You seemed to have taken philosophy beyond national barriers?

A. Former president of India Dr Rajendra Prasad has conferred the title of ‘Rashtrasant’ on Tukdoji but taking into consideration the expanse of his missionary work, he has crossed national contours and his vision of life has cosmic ramifications. From these perspectives, his thoughts and actions are constructive and benevolent in the parlance of religious fundamentalism and aggressive nationalism in the global scenario.

Mangaluru: Upset with Railway Board ’s decision to cancel Bengaluru-Karwar overnight express to introduce new Yeshwantpur-Karwar Express , train activists are mulling to file a contempt plea before the Karnataka high court against the railways . Move by the board to cancel trains 16513-14/16523-24 Bengaluru-Karwar express via Kunigal/ Mysuru, that were operated as combined services with Bengaluru-Kannur overnight express, has riled the activists.

The board ordered the cancellation of these trains while announcing a dedicated train between Bengaluru and Karwar bypassing Mangaluru region via Padil bypass. “This is contravention of high court order of 2012 that directed the railways to extend Bengaluru-Mangaluru-Kannur overnight express to Karwar,” said Vivek Nayak from Kundapura Railu Prayanikara Hitarakshana Vedike.

Advocate Shankar Bhat and other like-minded people had filed a public interest writ petition before the high court after the board decided to extend Bengaluru-Mangaluru overnight express to Kannur, ignoring Inter Railway Timetable Committee’s recommendation in 2009 to do so to Karwar. After this, South Western Railway decided to bifurcate the train at Mangaluru Central and run a portion each to Kannur and Karwar from November 1, 2012.

People again moved the high court when SWR did not introduce a direct train to Karwar after Bengaluru-Hassan new line was opened in 2017. Following a PIL from Sanjay Revankar from Kadwad, SWR decided to operate existing Bengaluru-Kannur/Karwar overnight express four days via Kunigal and three days via the old route (Mysuru). Train activists Gautham Shetty of Bengaluru and S Yogendra Swamy of Mysuru too had slammed this move.

Gautham said the board violated its policy of consulting users before cancelling the existing trains. Swamy from Mysuru Grahaka Parishat said the move has deprived connectivity to commuters from Mandya, Mysuru and Ramanagara to the coast, violating the railway’s policy of not cancelling services without providing an alternative.

All-woman crew operates the inaugural run

Chief minister B S Yediyurappa flagged off the Yeshwantpur-Karwar-Vasco-Da-Gama train AT Yeshwantpur railway station in the presence of Union minister of state of railways Suresh Angadi and Udupi-Chikkamagaluru MP Shobha Karandlaje.

The inaugural train from Yeshwantpur was operated by an all-woman crew — locopilot Bala Shivaparvathi, assistant locopilot Abhirami VS and lady guard Richa Mani Tripathi — to commemorate International Women’s Day.

BHUBANESWAR: The state government on Saturday asked the urban local bodies (ULBs) to spread awareness about coronavirus at Aahaar centres by putting up messages at the entrances.

The centres, which offer highly subsidized rice and dalma meals, are visited by thousands of people daily. “Awareness messages may be placed in all Aahaar centres since they see high footfall in an enclosed space. However, nothing beyond the advisory/guidelines issued by health and family welfare department should be exhibited,” says the advisory issued by the housing and urban development department secretary G Mathivathanan to municipal commissioners and executive officers of municipalities and notified area councils

The ULBs have also been asked to install public announcement system in garbage transporting vehicles to increase awareness. “Audio system fitted in garbage collection vehicles can be used to disseminate information on coronavirus,” the notice says.

The government has decided to take the help of swachh sathis (cleanliness partners) and swachh supervisors to spread hygiene-related awareness. The Biju Yuva Vahini, youth volunteers of the ruling party, have been asked to assist the ULBs in this.

Prayagraj: For the 1.39 lakh shiksha mitras working in state’s government primary schools, the festival of Holi might be one without any joy. Reason: they haven’t been paid any honorariums or dues since January 2020.

Although the state government had sanctioned the funds to pay their dues on Friday, the process might take three to four days before the money is credited to their bank accounts. As banks remain shut for the next three days on account of it being a Sunday and then Holi, shiksha mitras might not get their due share any time soon.

“Earlier, shiksha mitras used to get paid by the seventh of every month. However, since the past two months, we have not received any money. Holi is just three days away and the banks would re-open only after Holi. The delay will mar our celebrations,” said secretary of UP Prathmik Shikshamitra Sangh Kaushal Kumar Singh. Of the 1.62 lakh shiksha mitras working in UP schools, 1.39 lakh have been hired under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. The remaining 23,000 have been hired by the state basic education department directly.

Basic shiksha adhikari (Prayagraj) Sanjay Kumar Kushwaha said that the shiksha mitras would now be paid only after Holi. “We haven’t yet received any funds and it would take some time to complete all formalities. Now, that the banks are closed till Holi, they would ony be paid after the festival.”

Appointed as part of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, shiksha mitras suffered a huge set back on July 25, 2017 when their regularisation against vacant posts of assistant teachers was quashed by the Supreme Court. The apex court had upheld an earlier order of the Allahabad high court delivered in this regard.

Almost overnight, our monthly earnings came down to mere Rs 10,000, almost one-fourth of what we were earning as assistant teachers,” said a shiksha mitra in city.

PUDUCHERRY: Police on Friday busted a prostitution racket at a beauty parlour in the town limits and arrested a husband and wife duo in connection with it.

Police also arrested a ‘client’, who was at the parlour during the raid. They rescued four women from Tamil Nadu and a girl from Puducherry who had been forced into flesh trade by the couple.

The Mudaliarpet police, on receiving a tip that prostitution was rampant at the beauty parlour on 100 Feet Road near the regional transport office, swung into action and raided the parlour. They found that a couple identified as K Jayachandran, 41, and his wife J Vanishree, 43, were running a prostitution racket under the guise of a beauty parlour.

They also found that the couple had forced four women and a 16-year-old girl into prostitution and rescued them. The team caught a client red-handed during the raid. The arrested was identified as Saravanan, 27, of Tindivanam.

Police booked the couple under Sections 370 (buying or disposing of any person as a slave), 370A (exploitation of a trafficked person) and 376 (punishment for rape) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 12 (punishment for sexual harassment) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and Sections 3 (punishment for keeping a brothel or allowing premises to be used as a brothel), 4 (punishment for living on the earnings of prostitution), 5 (procuring, inducing or taking a person for the sake of prostitution) and 7 (prostitution in or in the vicinity of public places) of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act.

HYDERABAD: A private school teacher, who was arrested on Friday night for allegedly raping 11 students, might have violated the girls under the influence of alcohol. Police has found that the accused used to consume liquor on school premises.

Wanaparthy police said the 26-year-old accused used to take special classes for some students after school hours. He used to select a girl among them, take her to another room and commit the crime. Before that, he used to consume alcohol, at times on the school premises, police sources said.

The accused victimised his students, who were either from the school where he worked or those who took tuitions from him since 2018, the sources added.

The sexual abuse would have continued unabated had the families of two girls not lodged complaints. They too were reluctant to approach police, fearing stigma attached to the abuse. Despite some village elders intervening, the families of remaining nine survivors refused to lodge complaints, police said.

The accused had lured the victims assuring them help during exams, leak questions or get them admission in Gurukul school. “By making false promises to the children, who are of tender age, he abused them. He would also make them swear that they will not disclose it to anyone. If they inform someone, he used to threaten them that he will not help them in exams,’’ Wanaparthy deputy superintendent of police Kiran Kumar said.

Until police nabbed the teacher, his aunt, at whose house he used to stay, was unaware about his misdeeds and that some of the offences were committed at her house.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

He lost his job, family, home and a persistent infection in the bones of his leg gave him a limp. He was forced to beg on the streets. On Saturday, after 27 long years, Kanojia felt like a new man as he walked confidently around a hospital corridor, his leg having healed following a series of medical procedures. The 52-year-old said he was finally ready to turn the page.Kanojia was only 25 when the blasts rocked the city. He worked as a guard at a jewellery trading shop at Zaveri Bazaar then. “I was seated at the shop entrance when people began to gather on the road outside. There was talk of smoke emanating from the Bombay Stock Exchange building. Suddenly, there was a deafening sound and I blanked out,” said Kanojia. He woke up days later at Nair Hospital to find his leg hanging in a splint. He had suffered a massive crush injury and multiple fractures to his left leg and his face was lacerated. “I was horrified to find a sea of injured people around me. There were at least three patients on every bed. No government representative visited me at the hospital and I never got a single rupee as compensation,” he said. During the two months Kanojia spent at the hospital, doctors tried to fix his fractures with metal implants in his leg.Kanojia went back to Zaveri Bazaar to work but his employer had replaced him. Meanwhile, infection set into the bone of his leg and he had to be re-hospitalized. Orthopaedic surgeon Dr R H Chauhan took out the metal implants and put an external fixator in his leg to heal the bones and remove infection.As time passed, the infection crept in again and led to pus formation in his leg. “Once pus started oozing from the wound, there was a foul smell. I used to live with my cousins in a chawl as I wasn’t married. They drove me out complaining that the hideous sight and smell of my wound disturbed their children. I drifted, lived on pavements and waited outside eateries for someone to offer me food. Some days I went hungry.”A few months ago, he landed at Bhatia Hospital with the hope his leg could still be treated. But he had no money to even get an X-ray. After inquiring into his case, the hospital decided to treat him at no cost. “Kanojia had a non-healing wound on his leg and exposed dead bone with chronic osteomyelitis. His leg had significant shortening,” said his treating doctor, Shailesh Ranade. “We removed necrotic tissues multiple times and opted for Negative Pressure Wound Therapy to control infection. The hurdle was the therapy machine needs electricity and Kanojia had no access to it on the streets. So, we kept him at the hospital, feeding him a high protein diet and antibiotics. We used a Dermal Regeneration Matrix, which allows one to grow own lower layer of skin. The grafts have been accepted and his wounds have healed,” said Dr Ranade. With special footwear to correct shortening of his leg, Kanojia walks with confidence. “I’m determined to not spend the rest of my life on the street. I have already quit smoking. I will start looking for a job.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74533610,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-181312,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/27-yrs-on-festering-leg-wound-of-1993-blast-victim-heals/articleshow/74531608.cms

BIJNOR: Forest authorities here are searching for a tusker they suspect killed a four-year-old tigress three days ago in Amangarh Tiger Reserve ATR) , a buffer zone of Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand.

The foresters believe that the elephant is wounded and may be in pain and, therefore, dangerous. They aim to capture it, treat its wounds and let it go.

Forest officials found the mutilated carcass of a tigress in ATR’s Jaspur close to Gurjjar gate on the banks of river Baneli on Thursday evening.

Divisional forest officer M Semmaran said the elephant may have picked up the tigress with its trunk, dashing the big cat on the ground and breaking its spinal chord. “There was a deep wound on its chest. There were internal wounds also.” It may have bled to death, he added.

“We are trying to trace the tusker. Our staff had spotted one roaming about in the same area some days ago.”

A team of Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Bareilly reached Bijnor on Friday and carried out a post-mortem of the carcass.

129,['8/03/2020'],Meerut Development Authority to give four huge land parcels for RRTS project,"Representative Image

MEERUT: Buoyed by ready availability of funds from both Centre and state, the country's first-ever Delhi-Meerut Rapid Rail Transit System (RRTS) project is now knocking at Meerut’s door for developing yards and other infrastructure.

Meerut Development Authority (MDA) is drafting the final plan to hand over four huge land parcels from its land bank for facilitating work for the Rs 30, 274-crore ambitious project.

At present, work is in full swing in the Duhai-Sahibabad priority sector. The NCRTC ( National Capital Region Transport Corporation ) is the nodal agency entrusted with the task of developing the mammoth project.

Speaking with TOI, MDA vice-chairperson Rajesh Kumar Pandey said, “We have four land parcels situated on the outskirts of the city on Delhi Road. The NCRTC wishes to buy three of them and take the fourth one on lease. The process is on.”

All four land parcels demanded by NCRTC are located at Rithani, a village bordering Ghaziabad district.

Giving details, chief town planner Ishtiyaq Ahmad, who is also the nodal officer for RRTS project in Meerut, said, “The NCRTC is interested in buying land parcels for setting up a power station, a railway yard, etc. Besides it also wants a 40,000 sq metre plot for using it as a casting yard. This one will be given on a five-year lease.”

The Uttar Pradesh government marked Rs 900 crore in its annual budget tabled recently in the legislative assembly for the ambitious Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut rapid rail corridor, which, once completed, will reduce the travel time between the national capital and Meerut to just one hour.

The recent budgetary boost for the project comes soon after the Union government proposed Rs 2,487 crore for it in its Union budget.

Already in full swing, the 82-km-long Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) is expected to be thrown open to public by 2025.

The RRTS corridor will originate from Sarai Kale Khan bus station in Delhi and Modipuram in Meerut district will be the last stop. In the first phase, the Meerut-Ghaziabad-Delhi corridor will be completed at a cost of Rs 30,274 crore by 2025.

The NCRTC, the implementing agency of RRTS, is a joint venture of the Centre (50%) and the state governments of Haryana (12.5%), NCT Delhi (12.5%), Uttar Pradesh (12.5%) and Rajasthan (12.5%).

It is mandated to design, construct, finance, operate and maintain RRTS in the NCR and works under the administrative control of the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs.

131,['8/03/2020'],MP govt cancels leave of health staff to battle Covid-19,"BHOPAL: The Madhya Pradesh health department has cancelled all leaves in a pre-emptive measure to contain spread of Covid-19 in the state. As of Saturday, around 40 people across the state were under hospital quarantine and another 150 in ‘community surveillance’ at home, say health department sources. No one has tested positive for the virus so far.“The situation is being monitored closely. There has been no positive case of COVID-19 in Madhya Pradesh,” said a senior health department official. Around 36 districts of MP are monitoring suspected patients as they remain in home or hospital for 14-28 days of quarantine.State government officials said they could follow through on the Centre’s directive to suspend biometric attendance in view of the coronavirus threat. Almost all government departments use the Aadhaar-based system. It is learnt that the most common method of transmission of the virus seems to be through infected surfaces. Therefore, it is desirable to avoid touching surfaces that might have been touched by someone infected, said a Union government directive on Friday.Apprehensions over medicine supplyA recent LANCET report estimates Indian pharmaceutical companies procure almost 70% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for their medicines from China, the world's leading producer and exporter of APIs by volume. As factories in China are closed to try to stem the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, pharmaceutical companies and the Indian Government are becoming concerned over the vulnerability of the Indian pharmaceutical supply chain.MP medical suppliers association, representative, Lalit Jain said, “We are appealed to all the sellers and retailers not to hoard and keep the supply lines open so inflated cost can be avoided.”India supplies low-cost generic drugs to millions of people, both within and outside the country. “There is a spurt in demand of masks. However, it is not like Delhi where things like hand sanitizers have run off,” said Adtiya, a pharmacist. “Medical supplies for now is maintained. There are rumours about short supply of essentials salts and reagents, but we have not seen any shortage.”Homeopathy clinic dispenses free ‘med’In a bid to sensitize people over COVID-19 and ‘improve immunity’, a homeopathy outlet in Budwara area will distribute free ‘medication’. “Union ministry of Ayush is proposing the preventive and prophylactic simple remedies, that may be useful for improving immunity,” said Mohammed Zaki, owner of a pharmacy.

Nagpur: With ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and municipal commissioner at loggerheads over stoppage of development works and financial crisis given over Rs900 crore liabilities, opposition in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation Congress has demanded that mayor Sandip Joshi issue a white paper on the civic body’s finances.

In view of the acrimonious ties between Joshi and municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe, Praful Gudadhe while addressing a press conference here on Saturday, said the tussle between the mayor and the civic chief over NMC’s poor financial status should not hamper city’s development works.

“We are told that the new municipal commissioner is against development of the city as being propagating by the ruling BJP in the NMC. But we want to know about the BJP’s claim to have carried out Rs80,000 crore development works in the last five years and about the works has Mundhe stopped,” he said.

“So a white paper on the NMC’s finances along with liabilities should be tabled in the general body meeting,” he demanded.

He also demanded an inquiry into agreement of Orange City Water and works carried out from state government’s special funds. “Barring Metro Rail, there is no sign of makeover of the city through development works,” he pointed out.

“Like general body, mayor, standing committee chairman and commissioner have special powers in the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act,” he said.

According to Gudadhe, as BJP is ruling the NMC since 13 years, they allegedly empowered the standing committee chairman for allocation of funds in the general body meeting and as a result, many Congress corporators were denied any financial provisions for development work in their constituencies.

Gudadhe distanced himself from the statement of leader of opposition in the NMC and senior Congress corporator Tanaji Wanve, who on Friday, termed Mundhe as “dictator and that he be made administrator of entire nation”. Gudadhe said it was his personal statement and nothing to do with Congress corporators.

Though Gudadhe refused to comment over calling attention motion by four Shiv Sena MLAs from Mumbai to dissolve NMC, without naming city Congress president and MLA Vikas Thakre and power minister Nitin Raut, he said that the city MLAs should have raised the issue of financial position of the NMC in the budget session of state legislature.

To a query, the senior Congress corporator said during Devendra Fadnavis led state government, there were four municipal commissioners from 2014 to 2019. “Municipal commissioners, who do not listen to the ruling party in the NMC, have been transferred,” he said.

Police arrested him on late Friday evening.

Police said that the incident occurred at around 2.38 am on Saturday when a team from Govind Nagar police station along with the accused Rashid had gone to recover the weapon hidden by him after committing the crime in the Gujaini area of the city.

The criminal, who sustained bullet wounds in one of his legs, was admitted to Lala Lajpat Rai hospital in police custody.

The Congress contended that there was “neither internet nor printer in the House in Gairsain.”

In reply, the state government said it was “moving towards a paperless secretariat and e-cabinet was part of this move.” The issue was raised in the House by Congress lawmaker from Kedarnath Manoj Rawat , who said that in the absence of a hard copy, it was not possible to discuss the budget at length. “You have given us pen drives but the area lacks internet and printers. What happened last year is happening this year too. The government is reluctant (to entertain) discussion on the budget,” Rawat added.

However, few residents raised objections when SCB ward member Lokanatham began delivering a speech about development works taken up in the locality during his five-year tenure.“The purpose of the meeting, which was convened by SCB officials, was to discuss about the ban on single-use plastics, the kind of harm they cause to the environment and also create awareness on coronavirus. But the speech went on a different track. So, few residents and shopkeepers raised objections and decided to boycott the meeting, which led to tension in the area,” said Manoj, one of the residents who attended the meeting.“People need to be educated about the harmful effects of plastic usage. But instead of doing that, the ward member only talked about his achievements from the podium,” said another resident.The residents also said that there was a shortage of surgical masks in localities under Secunderabad Cantonment. “However, the ward member did not even mention this issue. This irked the people further, which led to an argument with the ward member. The argument went on for about 15 minutes, after which the officials attending the meeting left the venue,” added Manoj.When TOI contacted Parusuram, the person heading the campaign on single-use plastic ban in SCB, he said, “We have completed the campaign on the ban on single-use plastic.

138,['8/03/2020'],"Uttarakhand: CM, BJP MLAs skip House proceedings, only one minister present","Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat

DEHRADUN: Barely a few days after the announcement of Gairsain as the summer capital, nearly two dozen legislators, including chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat , skipped the House proceedings on Saturday.

Only one minister — out of the total of eight in the state cabinet — was present in the House on the day when the discussion on annual budget for 2020-21 began. Opposition Congress, which had a full participation of 11 MLAs, launched a scathing attack on the ruling party saying, “It looks like the BJP legislators could not brave the tough weather conditions and migrated to the plains.”

Currently, the state has six cabinet ministers – Satpal Maharaj , Madan Kaushik, Arvind Pandey, Yashpal Arya , Harak Singh Rawat and Subodh Uniyal . Besides, there are two ministers of state Rekha Arya and Dhan Singh Rawat. While CM Rawat and some BJP legislators left Gairsain on Friday, others returned on Saturday morning.

Congress state chief and Chakrata MLA Pritam Singh said, “This shows the seriousness of the BJP government towards Gairsain. They were quick to take credit and fulfilled the formalities by announcing it as summer capital. The absence of BJP MLAs shows they are not interested in development of Gairsain or hosting assembly session here.”

Singh asserted that the Congress has stuck to its stand and the presence of all 11 MLAs reflects “our commitment towards the people of Gairsain and entire Uttarakhand”. “Discussion on budget is extremely important but they did not care to participate in a matter which is directly related to the future of all Uttarakhand residents,” Singh added. Urban development minister and state government spokesperson Madan Kaushik said, “The legislators need to attend the House proceedings, but since they had some important work, they have left for their respective areas.”

139,['8/03/2020'],Arms export target set at $5 billion in next 5 years: Rajnath Singh,"Rajnath Singh

NEW DELHI: Making a strong pitch for increased private sector participation in the defence production sector, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday said the government had set an arms export target of $5 billion in the next five years and aims to double the turnover of the domestic aerospace industry by 2024.

“In our envisaged defence production policy, we have clearly spelt out our goal to achieve a turnover of $26 billion in aerospace, defence goods and services by 2025, involving an additional investment of nearly $10 billion and creating employment for nearly 2-3 million people,” said Singh, speaking at the ET-GBS here.

“This will have huge implications for India’s endeavours to promote R&D, innovation and its efforts to secure a place in global supply chains,” he said, adding the government had taken a slew of structural reforms to create increased synergy between the public sector and private industry to overcome the challenges of private investment in defence.

Assuring the private sector of “all possible support”, Singh said the defence production has been identified as a key sector to realise the government’s vision of making India a $5 trillion economy by 2024.

The government’s intention is not just limited to ushering in reforms but also to act as an incubator, catalyst and facilitator for promoting investments and achieving self-reliance in defence manufacturing. “We understand defence R&D in the private sector will take time to establish itself. To give a boost to this process, we have opened opportunities through DRDO with a zero fee for transfer of technology (ToT), free access to over 450 patents, access to test facilities and an upfront funding of up to Rs 10 crore. More than 900 licensing agreements for ToT have been signed with industries,” he said.

The government is providing opportunities to the private sector to manufacture fighter aircraft, helicopters, tanks and submarines through the “Strategic Partnership” model, which will allow private companies to grow in stature and become global giants in the coming years, he said..

141,['8/03/2020'],Congress seeks committee on increased circle rates in Uttarakhand,"Picture for representational purpose only.

DEHRADUN: Leader of opposition Indira Hridayesh on Saturday raised the issue of increased circle rates in the state assembly and claimed that there were several irregularities in the process. The veteran Congress legislator said that she had examples where the circle rate at some locations was increased by 300 per cent to 600 per cent. Hridayesh sought the formation of a committee to find the anomalies and make the amendments.

Replying to the matter, urban development minister Madan Kaushik said that overall only 5 per cent circle rate has been increased in the state and the number of registries has also gone up this year.

Raising the issue, Hridayesh said, “Registry is an important form of revenue for the state but since the circle rates have been raised and circle rate has gone higher than market rate, no registry is taking place and as a result, it is causing a loss to the state exchequer.” She claimed that only those people who had got their agreement done earlier were getting registry done and people were reluctant for fresh registry. “Many people have approached me. People are protesting for past few months. I would like to request the House for the formation of a committee to remove all discrepancies,” the Congress MLA from Haldwani added.In his reply, minister Kaushik said that all due process were followed before the circle rates were increased. “We did an aerial survey of areas. A committee was formed and the decision was taken after following all the due process,” he said.

Supporting his point, Kaushik said that 1 to 5 per cent circle rate was increased for 23.8 per cent land, 6 to 10 per cent for 37 per cent land, 11 to 15 per cent circle rate increase on 8 per cent land, 20 per cent rise on 6 per cent land and 21 to 25 per cent on 2 per cent land. “If we check the facts, the overall circle rate increase in the entire state is 5 per cent,” he added.

The minister pointed out that 20,785 registry were done between January 13 and March 6, last year. “During the corresponding period this year, 32,811 registry were done, which is a 6 per cent increase in the number,” he added.

Kaushik further said that earlier there were areas where one side of road was expensive than the other side of the same road. “We have removed all such discrepancies to ensure justice is done to everyone. If a legislator brings any anomaly, we will get it checked and act within a period of 15 days,” said Kaushik.

BHUBANESWAR: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Saturday said the state government is trying to sort out the issue relating to deposit of Rs 545 crore of Puri Jagannath temple in the crisis-hit Yes Bank. “We are trying to sort it out,” was his crisp reply to a question.

Shree Jagannath Temple Administration chief administrator Krishan Kumar said they will take up the issue with the Centre to withdraw the money. The temple administration has already moved the RBI over the issue, said an official source.

BJP and Congress expressed grave concern over parking of temple fund in the private bank. Congress legislature party leader Narasingha Mishra said, “Odisha people want to know whether money of Jagannath temple fund is secure in crisis-ridden Yes Bank. Chief minister should clear the air over this issue. But unfortunately he did not clarify that the money is safe and secure. He just said we are trying to sort it out. That is his usual answer and it shows that he did not attach importance to the matter.”

Mishra requested Naveen to immediately give his statement on the issue and tell people that the fund in the bank is secure.

BJP national vice-president Baijayant Panda tweeted, “Looking at Yes Bank’s mounting troubles, better managed temple trusts like Tirupati moved their funds out last year. Earlier this year, the Odisha government announced it would do the same for the Jagannath temple trust ’s Rs 545 crore, but didn’t.”

Shree Jagannath Sena, a local social organisation, led by its convener Priyadarshan Patnaik, on Saturday lodged a complaint with Puri vigilance division and demanded a probe to know why the temple fund was deposited in the private bank.

On Friday, law minister Pratap Jena had told reporters here that the deposits of Jagannath temple in Yes Bank are safe. “Two fixed deposits, totalling Rs 545 crore, will mature on March 16 and March 29, and subsequently be deposited in nationalised banks through a tendering process,” he had added.

BHOPAL: BJP, facing allegations of trying to poach Congress MLAs, is now trying to keep its flock together ahead of the crucial budget session.

The party has initiated several steps and is keeping an eye on its MLAs through its district party units. A BJP delegation led by leader of opposition (LoP) Gopal Bhargav on Saturday submitted a memorandum to Governor Lalji Tandon alleging that the Congress government is targeting party leaders.

The memorandum handed over by the LOP to the governor stated “It is to apprise you that ever since Congress government was constituted in MP, BJP leaders are targeted for political motive. Government machinery is being misused for hitting businesses of BJP leaders to terrorize them. There is a serious threat to security of BJP MLAs due to which they are feeling insecure. Government aircraft and helicopters are also misused for the purpose. It is to request you to direct the government not to indulge in such practice.”

Narottam, Shera on same flight: Senior BJP leader and MLA Narottam Mishra returned with independent MLA from Burhanpur Surendra Singh ‘Shera Bhaiya’ from New Delhi on Saturday. Shera was allegedly taken to Bengaluru by BJP and he returned with Mishra in the same flight. Mishra said, “I and Shera were in the same flight like other co-passengers. None of us is prohibited from taking the same flight. We met home minister Amit Shah at a wedding in Delhi. There was no separate meet.” Asked about alleged poaching bid by BJP, Mishra said none of the MLAs has said so.

Pathak reiterates threat to life: “I am with BJP and remain with BJP whether Congress kills me and my family,” said BJP MLA Sanjay Pathak while talking to reporters at the state BJP headquarters on Saturday.

Umaria district administration removed encroachment from a resort owned by Pathak in Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve. It comes two days after his mines were closed. “Action against me and my relatives by the government will continue in days to come. It is pressure tactics to force me to join Congress, which I will not come what may. I did not meet any senior Congress leader.” Sanjay Pathak also alleged that he was chased from Bhopal airport on Thursday. He alleged it was a bid to abduct or kill him and he somehow saved himself. When asked why he did not lodge n FIR, he said he would consult his senior party leaders first.

Police targeting my family, alleges Bhadoria: “I will not surrender to police atrocities on my family,” said BJP MLA Arvind Bhadoria, adding, “My brother was called at the police station and harassed. Kamal Nath government has stooped down to the lowest level of politics. We are sure that the people of the state are watching it all and would give a befitting reply when the time comes.” Bhadoria is BJP MLA from Ater constituency in Bhind district.

147,['8/03/2020'],Contractor booked for cutting down 27 trees,"Pune: The Swargate police on Friday booked a contractor — appointed to cut the branches of trees on the premises of the MSRTC depot on Shankarsheth Road — for completely chopping down 27 trees on February 29.

The action was taken after a Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) official, Vijay Krishna Redekar (51) of Wadgaon Budruk, lodged a complaint with the police.

“MSRTC had sought permission from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) authorities to cut the branches of the trees on the premises of the depot about three months ago. PMC officials granted permission to MSRTC officials to cut the branches of old trees,” senior police inspector Bramhanand Naikwadi said.

After a meeting between MSRTC and PMC officials, the state transport body appointed a contractor to cut the branches. “MSRTC officials said they explained to the contractor that only the branches must be cut and that he should refrain from chopping the trees,” Naikwadi said.

However, on February 29, when MSRTC officials were not present at the depot, the contractor chopped down all the trees and transported the wood to an as-yet-unascertained location without any prior information, Naikwadi said.

“We have invoked the provisions of Forest Act against the contractor and also invoked the charges of theft under Indian Penal Code,” he said.

Empowered by the Maharashtra (Urban Areas), Protection Preservation Of Trees Act, 1975, the PMC’s tree authority regulates the felling of trees and provides for planting of an adequate number of new trees in the same area. The municipal commissioner is the president of the tree authority, which can comprise between five and 15 members.

PANAJI: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday announced that the party will undertake a three-month organisation building exercise after the zilla panchayat elections in Goa. AAP has constituted a 25-member committee headed by Valmiki Naik to galvanise the party in each of the 1,640 booths in the state.

“Over the next two years, the party has dedicated itself to contest the next assembly elections in 2022 and as part of that, we are announcing a three-month-long party rebuilding exercise, ‘Mission Nirman’, that will start after the ZP elections,” said state in-charge and AAP Delhi MLA Atishi Marlena.

The exercise will be executed in three phases. In the first phase, volunteer meetings will be carried out in each taluka. In the second phase, from April 1 to 15, the committee will conduct volunteer meetings in all the 40 assembly constituencies.

“From April 15 to May 15, meetings will be carried out in all the 1,640 booths that exist across Goa. After May 15, there will be a booth-level karyakarta sammelan where two volunteers from every booth will be picked to attend the sammelan,” said the newly-elected MLA.

AAP also criticised the BJP for not doing enough in the Supreme Court to highlight Goa’s concerns about water being diverted from the Mhadei river basin. “You have Karnataka where there is a BJP government, you have a BJP government at the Centre and you have BJP here. So why is the BJP leadership of Goa not standing up for the rights of Goa?” asked Atishi.

151,['8/03/2020'],Avoid personal cars for going to Pune airport: Authorities,"PUNE: The next time you fly out of the city, better hail a taxi or an autorickshaw for going to the airport.With no parking solution in sight amid the ongoing construction work of the multilevel parking facility at parking number-1, airport director Kuldeep Singh has appealed to flyers to avoid bringing personal vehicles to the Lohegaon facility. He said passengers, for at least a year, should opt for public transport or carpooling while coming to the airport.“We are in a fix over parking at present and the hassles will increase in the future. We have not been able to come up with a solution. So, we are requesting people not to use personal vehicles for coming to the airport. It is an appeal to accept our request until the multilevel car parking facility is ready. If at all flyers come to the airport in their personal vehicles, the four-wheelers should go out of the airport area immediately after dropping the passengers,” Singh said.He said the construction of the multilevel car parking facility was in progress in parking number-1, drastically reducing the area to park vehicles. He also admitted that efforts to look for an alternative plot near the airport for parking had proven futile.“No private plot or land belonging to the defence authorities is available,” he said.In January, former airport director Ajay Kumar had said a private land next to the parking number-1 would be available for parking purposes. Later, the airport authorities clarified that the landowner had not agreed to provide the plot.The construction of the multilevel car parking facility was initiated in January this year at the parking number-1. The work would continue for around two years.Ravi Suresh Jain, the director of Pebbles Infratech, the company developing the facility, said they got possession of more than 50% of the parking number-1 for the construction work. “By the next week, we hope to get full possession of the plot. The new facility will be coming up on 90,000sqft. As far as alternative parking space is concerned, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) are in talks with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC),” Jain told TOI.A source in the airport said, “Once the full possession of parking number-1 is given, where will people park their cars? The parking number-2 has been changed into a pickup and drop point. Illegal parking along roads near the airport will not be allowed.”Calls, text messages and WhatsApp message to Pune MP Girish Bapat and Wadgaonsheri MLA Sunil Tingre went unanswered. Bapat is the chairman of the Pune Airport Advisory Committee. Tingre is its vice-chairman.“How airport authorities cannot have a solution to this, and how is it possible for every traveller to come to the airport in public transport? Why was the permission for the construction of the multilevel parking given without arranging for an alternative parking area?” Sanjay Dixit, a frequent flyer, wondered.Aviation analyst and expert Dhairyashil Vandekar found the request weird. “It is absurd on the part of the AAI to even suggest the passengers as to how they should travel to the airport. The situation is fallout of the failure of the AAI to plan and execute the multilevel parking project professionally. With a little more effort and planning, this issue could have been taken care of,” he said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74533419,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-273310,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/avoid-personal-cars-for-going-to-airport-authorities/articleshow/74532303.cms

PANAJI: With the process to withdraw nominations complete and 32 candidates backing out, 203 candidates remain in the running for the zilla panchayat elections which will be held on March 22. BJP is contesting the elections in 41 seats while Congress is fielding candidates in 38 seats— 21 in North Goa and 17 in South Goa.

Learning from its past experiences, Congress seems to have taken precautions against losing their candidates to the BJP. State party president Girish Chodankar said, “There is a lot of pressure on our candidates; we had to take some of them away and keep them with us for protection.”

MGP, which has an informal pact with the Congress, will fight the elections in 17 seats. AAP and NCP have put up candidates in 21 and 6 constituencies, respectively. Except for MGP’s Arambol candidate, all the other candidates who pulled out were independent candidates.

Meanwhile, in a boost for BJP, the saffron party managed to convince four of its rebel members who were contesting the ZP elections as independents, to withdraw their candidature.

Independent candidates mainly from Anjuna, Siolim, Penha de Franca, Socorro and Colvale constituencies have withdrawn their nominations, quite a few of them women. As per information obtained from the returning officers, in Anjuna constituency, independent candidate Lata Vishwajeet Parab has withdrawn her nomination, in Siolim, Pallavi Pradeep Dhabolkar has backed out.

Rakhi Salgaonkar and Roshani Sharachandra Naik have withdrawn their nominations in Penha de Franca . In Socorro, Gauri Sachin Volvoikar has withdrawn her nomination.

Chodankar said that in the elections, 80% of Goa’s voting population will vote and voice their sentiments regarding the BJP government’s functioning.

There were no withdrawal of nominations in four constituencies namely Calangute, Reis Magos, Aldona and Sirsaim.

As many as 10 candidates are in the fray for the zilla panchayat election in the Sattari taluka, which comprises three constituencies. Seventeen will contest from Bicholim taluka.

This Holi colour uses natural ingredients like flowers. The traditional method of making gulaal (colours) has been dying out for the past many years. The colours, which are being sold under Green Holi Initiative, are now available for purchase at Masala Chowk in Jaipur. They are available in four colours in packets of 250gm, 500gm and one kg.

An official informed, the bright red flower of Butea monosperma (also known as Dhak, Kesu, or Palash), which paints the Udaipur city red every spring is used to prepare these colours. A forest official said, “The leaves and flowers were used by the local people for a very long time — while the leaves were used to make plates, the flowers were used for making powdered Holi colours and dyes.”

Forest officials believe this would also help to conserve the species as one finds Dhak only at a few places. Butea monosperma also has medicinal uses, which have been validated. “Extract of the plant possesses significant astringent, aphrodisiac, anthelmintic, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-diabetic and anti-asthmatic properties,” said a forest official.

His eyes were glued to the 40 feet canvas, on which the spirit of Pune came to life. Calligraphy artist Achyut Palav captured the colour and spice of the queen of Deccan to inaugurate the Amstrad Times Celebrate Pune festival on Saturday.

The festival is powered by Phoenix Marketcity, co-sponsored by Sankla Buildcoon with the Pune Municipal Corporation as a partner.

The foot tapping beats of an all-women team of drummers and the agility of Mallakhamb players provided a backdrop to Palav’s calligraphy demo. Municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad got things rolling with the first stroke of the brush, by painting the outline of the Shaniwarwada rampart. And then it was Palav’s team that worked in tandem to give a linear backdrop depicting the iconic landmarks of the city, including Shaniwarwada, Phule Mandai, SPPU’s main building and the Sinhagad fort complete with Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Palav chose the vibrant orange to draw the first letter ‘P’ of Pune. The brushes and rollers dipped in a rainbow of colours glided smoothly to paint ‘Pune’ in English and Devnagari script. As a riot of colours erupted on the canvas, passers-by could not help but pause and admire in awe.

Earlier, renowned actor Prashant Damle declared the festival open. He lauded The Times of India for putting its might behind a cultural fest.

Damle, a veteran who has performed over 12,300 shows spanning 36,000 hours spent on stage to present 35 plays, said such festivals gave a solid platform to present different art forms. He also appreciated the municipal commissioner’s decision to clean and improve all auditoriums owned by the civic body.

Gaikwad said the civic body would partner with Times Group for any such cultural initiative. He said when social and cultural activities takes centre stage in a city, politics takes a back seat. “I am willing to spend Rs10 crore every year to encourage such activities and I am hoping to use the many municipal gardens to stage live music shows,” he said.

The function was also attended by chief procurement officer of Amstrad Sanjay Mane, chairman and managing director of Sankla Buildcoon Subhash Sankla, Jaideep Vadulekar of Phoenix Marketcity and Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol.

The Amstrad Times Celebrate Pune had an early start with an old city food walk. Over 30 participants explored the traditional eating joints under the guidance of Jayesh Paranjape. After a trip through the heritage structure of Phule market, the foodies relished breakfast at four locations. Puneri misal and shira, sabudana khichadi and a variety of laddoos, thalipeeth, dadpe pohe and mango mastani were on the menu.

After a tote bag painting workshop by Kala Kollective, it was time for the play ‘Devbabhali’. Music lovers formed a beeline to Balgandharva Rangmandir to listen to Pune’s own classical vocalist Rahul Deshpande.

MUMBAI: In a bid to map the city’s actual waste collection from every area—what time it was collected from a particular society, is it being segregated into wet and dry and, if treated, what kind of treatment is used—the BMC will place QR code stickers outside every gated community.

The pilot project is expected to take off from the BMC’s T-Ward , which includes Mulund , as it is smaller than the others with just 2,000 formal complexes and around 50 little slum colonies.

While the BMC collects 7,000 metric tonne of garbage daily, from T-Ward alone it gathers 135MT a day; on some days, it rises to 165 MT.

In case of civic wards such as K-West, which includes parts of Andheri such as Lokandwala, Versova and Juhu, the daily garbage collection exceeds 400MT.

A BMC official said from next week, they will visit housing societies to paste QR code stickers and also educate residents about the initiative. “One of main aims for the initiative is to track the kind of waste that comes out of every area and also ensure 100% collection. Currently, no adequate mapping is done to measure the garbage coming from every area and whether there has been an increase or decrease in the kind of waste. This app will help track it. Besides, we would be able to ascertain if a society taking a rebate over its property tax is not giving out its waste to collection trucks. In case the QR code is not scanned, we will understand garbage has not been collected,” said the official.

The BMC has also prepared a dashboard on which all data scanned through the QR code will be reflected. Uploading information on the portal will be a pre-requisite for residential societies to be eligible for rebate for property tax. TOI has a copy of the circular issued by the solid waste management department on March 6. It states: “In the meeting held on 4-3-3020 the monitoring committee appointed by the honorable High Court has expressed its displeasure about the poor progress on registration and data uploading in the app.”

PUNE: Four persons were arrested and their three accomplices were booked for damaging four vehicles, including an SUV, parked in Dhayari in the early hours of Friday.

A car owner, Bhairavnath Patil (39) of Jijainagar in Dhayari, lodged a complaint with the Sinhagad Road police. The police said the suspects damaged the vehicles to terrorize residents.

The FIR stated that the suspects reached the spot with sticks and sharp weapons. They smashed the windshields and windows of the vehicles parked on the road and hurled abuses at people, following which they fled.

The four arrested persons are Sahil Bashir Shaikh (19), Saifal Aajumal Hussain (19), Siddharth Sonba Pokale (20) and Gorakh Om Gorakh Patil (19), all residents of Dhayari. Their three accomplices have been booked.

An officer from the Sinhagad Road police said a few days ago, during a procession, one of the residents’ vehicle brushed against the vehicle of one of the arrested persons. The suspects wanted revenge as the motorist did not stop after the incident, the officer said.

The police said the arrested youths had some old animosity with the youths from Jijainagar.

The initiative for the gym was conceived by Farzana Begum, a certified functional strength trainer from the city, to give women the space to work out without inhibitions. The gym, which will be a women exclusive functional and crossfit gym, will also cater to women from underprivileged sections, female cancer patients and survivors by providing them with free classes.

“The idea for an all-women’s gym happened in 2017 after doing my first fitness certification. It was not a common sight to see a gym that catered to only women, except dance fitness or aerobics or yoga. It was then I decided that I would open a women’s functional gym — for Women and by a woman. This will also help women from underprivileged sections understand the importance of healthy living, of which they are otherwise deprived,” said Farzana.

A cancer survivor, Farzana added, “And it’s only a female trainer who can help them combat these hormonal changes through the right diet plan, workouts and mental health. Also, there are several myths associated with lifting weights. My aim is to let women experience strength and functional training to break the myths and cater to the holistic needs of a woman.”

“Every woman has the right to stay fit and healthy and what better way than starting their fitness journey in a women’s gym,” Farzana said. A free master class of an international workout animal flow by founder-director of IFAA certification, Kez Klein will be organised.

HYDERABAD: In one of the bigger cash hauls in recent times, income tax sleuths in Hyderabad unearthed Rs 10.5 crore from the premises of Sri Chaitanya Educational Institutions . Of this, around Rs 3 crore cash was stashed in one of the girls’ hostels of the group in Vijayawada. Searches that started on March 4 concluded on Friday in Hyderabad, Vijayawada and Mumbai.

Simultaneous searches were also conducted on the premises of industrialist Lingamaneni Ramesh , a close aide of former Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu.

Sources said Lingamaneni had not met I-T sleuths during the searches. He was searched as investigators found that he took loans from Sri Chaitanya.

The sleuths also seized documents from the premises of the Mumbai-based Varsity Education Management Private Limited , which is a decade-old company. Searches were conducted at the residences and offices of the directors Boppana Sushmasri, B Seema and Yalamanchili Sridhar and other key persons of the company.

PUNE: A Swiggy delivery executive was arrested on Saturday on the charge of flashing a 21-year-old woman on January 24, when he had gone to her house to deliver a food parcel.

The Deccan Gymkhana police have also booked the officials of the online food ordering and delivery platform for their “failure” to respond to the woman’s complaints.

The complainant, a law student, had lodged a first information report (FIR) with the Deccan Gymkhana police on Friday.

Senior inspector Deepak Lagad of the Deccan Gymkhana police said, “We arrested the delivery executive, Murlidhar Sambhaji Gaikwad (40) of Indiranagar in Bibvewadi, and also booked four Swiggy officials after the FIR was lodged.”

On Saturday, TOI contacted the Swiggy officials, who said the Bengaluru head office of the company would only comment on the FIR.

The police tracked down the food delivery executive on Saturday after receiving his contact number from the woman.

According to the FIR, the food delivery executive had reached her third-floor flat at 9.48pm on January 24. After handing over the parcel to her, he asked for a glass of water.

When the woman emerged from her kitchen with water, she found him standing at the door with his pants down, the FIR stated. Shocked over the sight, the woman screamed loudly, following which the delivery executive ran down the stairs, the FIR stated.

Unnerved by the incident, the woman shot an email to the Swiggy customer care and to other officials of the company. However, even after waiting for over a month, she did not receive any response from the company.

“The company should have taken legal action against the delivery executive. Since the officials attempted to suppress facts, we have booked them as well,” senior inspector Lagad said.

He said the police would carry out further investigation to ascertain as to why the company did not take action against the delivery executive, arrested on Saturday.

The mercury dip has also caused an expected surge in upper respiratory tract infections as well as cold and cough, doctors said.On Saturday as well, maximum temperatures remained below normal, with Shivajinagar recording 31.8°C, around 2.9° below normal, and Lohegaon staying at 32.6°C, around 2.4° below normal.Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune, told TOI the sheer number of western disturbances over northwest India lately had been bringing in cool spells over many parts of the country. “Temperatures rise while the western disturbance approaches northwest India but fall soon after its passage. This has also led to snow and rainfall over northern parts of the country. The result has been that cold northwesterly winds have been flowing over parts of the country, including north Maharashtra, along with westerly winds from the Arabian sea, causing temperatures to fall here,” he said.Kashyapi said due to the wind discontinuity between Konkan and Madhya Maharashtra, Pune city and the district were also witnessing partly cloudy skies. “This, along with the northwesterly and westerly wind flow, is likely to keep temperatures on the milder side in the city and district this weekend,” he said.The average number of western disturbances over northwest India during January and February each is about five to six, but this year, almost 20 have affected that region during the two months.An IMD official said, “Temperatures are still quite high in the state, enough to check Covid-19 spread. Even though it is still being debated, it is thought that very low temperatures are conducive to the spread of this virus. However, since the average temperature in Maharashtra is around 24-25°C, there could be little chance of the contagion spread here.”Doctors in the city said the mercury dip had caused a rise in infections. Arati Shahade, a consultant physician, said, “We have seen a surge in upper respiratory tract infections. The fall in temperature during early mornings and a rise in temperature during the noons have been responsible for this.

171,['8/03/2020'],"NU junks PET negative marking, cap on guides","Nagpur: In a much-needed respite to hundreds of aspirants and research guides, a special committee comprising Senate members and NU authorities recommended major changes including abolishing negative marking in PhD entrance test (PET) and the place of research and guide being the same.

The committee led by principal Rajendra Bhoyar tabled its report during the Senate meeting on Saturday. The house accepted the report as it is and paved way for the formulation of a new PhD direction for the upcoming session.

Leave aside cracking the entrance, pursuing research from NU had become too tough in recent years.

In a series of reports since 2017, TOI had highlighted problems faced by scholars and supervisors, and the plummeting registrations of scholars.

While aspirants had cried foul regarding negative marking and type of questions in PET I, many teachers faced the risk of remaining without a research student under him/her in entire career span due to the draconian norm introduced under the then Pro-VC Pramod Yeole. He had citied latest UGC regulations to defend his decision of making PhD tougher in NU.

After implementation of the hike in negative marking in 2017-18, just 63 had cleared the PET-II in that year and 81 candidates qualified in 2018-19. In both exams, the NU had received over 4,000 applications each time.

Bhoyar said the committee found that UGC norms were wrongly interpreted in framing the NU’s PhD directives. “There is no binding on having the research supervisor from place of research. The panel has recommended that teachers can register students from other colleges too. It was an unwanted restriction,” he said.

Bhoyar said there was also the cap on fixing 50 research enrolments for NU PG departments and 30 for colleges has been revised. “It will be based on the strength of teachers in a particular college,” he said.

The committee has also suggested creation of a question bank and subject-wise syllabus for PET. “A committee member revealed that the question papers were unsolvable for even the teachers,” said Bhoyar.

The unbridled powers of RRC too have been clipped now. The committee took note of arbitrary decision of rejection research proposal. Now on, the RRC will have to give fair chance to aspirants to remove deficiency before taking a decision on approval or rejection.

The provision which was unanimously consented by all lawmakers is the increase in compensation from Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 8 lakh for the families of the deceased lawyers below 45 years of age. The provision also raised controversy over a mistake pointed out by the leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria which created an uproar in the assembly. He said, “Is it not a mockery that the increased compensation shown in the proposal is Rs 7 lakh and in the copy of the bill the amount shown is Rs 8 lakh. Until the bill is corrected, we will not let the bill to pass through the house.”

Responding to the allegation, parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal said earlier the Bar Council of India, Rajasthan, proposed the compensation of Rs 7 lakh, but later it was made Rs 8 lakh considering the rising cost and inflation. Unconvinced by the reply, Kataria staged walkout with all the opposition MLAs. The provision of a lifetime membership fee raised to Rs 1 lakh was also opposed by lawmakers Sanyam Lodha, Vasudev Devnani and Kataria.

Lodha said the advocates welfare fund has a reserve of Rs 121 crore and adding Rs 6 crore every year as interest. “Its annual spending is not more than Rs 3 crore. I find it absurd that membership fees have been shot up despite having a huge corpus fund,” Lodha said. Dhariwal clarified that the amount is optional and lawyers can continue to deposit fees annually also. He welcomed the suggestion given by the lawmakers that lawyers’ protection bill and provision for a stipend for new advocates should be brought in the assembly.

Most of the lawmakers who spoke on the bill seeking amendment asked the state government to consult the Bar Council of Rajasthan. “I would like to say all lawmakers that we have repeatedly consulted BCI, Rajasthan, into account and amendments are based on their suggestions,” Dhariwal said.

PUNE: The Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI), the nodal travel and tourism association in the country, has dubbed the spread of Covid-19 as the worst catastrophe the tourism industry has ever faced, with travellers dropping travel plans due to virus fears.

Jyoti Mayal, president, TAAI, told TOI that business has virtually come to a standstill after the spread of Covid-19. “Many jobs are at stake and it will be difficult for the industry to survive as more than 50% of the annual business is conducted during April–July every year,” she said.

Mayal said that the association was finding ways to ease the situation for travellers and appealed to the government to release a circular to airlines to grant waivers on rescheduling charges and cancellations on “compassionate” grounds.

“With the Covid-19 scare all over the globe, travellers are panicking and cancelling their trips. Tourism boards in many countries have released travel advisories, while events are being cancelled, flights curtailed, and tourist attractions shut. Corporates are also putting their travel plans on hold,” said Mayal.

She added that there have been many cancellations/disruptions in flights worldwide and even the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has requested aviation regulators for an immediate suspension of rules governing airport slots. “Further, the IATA has demanded flexibility for airlines to adjust their schedules, keeping in mind the global crisis. Only a few airlines operating from India as well as other airlines globally are waiving off the charges. Travel agents are trying their best to help customers by offering credit notes for a later date travel or help them get refunds on cancelled flights. But most airlines, hotels, luxury trains etc are not offering refunds,” she added.

Another TAAI source said, “Travellers need to be patient. In the approaching holiday season, outbound travel can be replaced with domestic. Health and life of customers is of utmost importance, but the uncertainty of the situation being faced by travel agents is genuine and customers need to understand the same.”

Meanwhile, travel app ixigo has announced a full refund for all flight bookings to China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Spain, Singapore, South Korea and Japan. The policy is applicable on both one-way and return bookings for travel dates up to March 31, 2020.

Aloke Bajpai, co-founder and chief executive officer, ixigo, said, “In the context of this global emergency, we have rolled out a policy to help travellers who wish to cancel or postpone their trips. We are providing a no-questions asked full refund on the countries most impacted by Covid-19, irrespective of the airline’s own policy in this regard. We will continue to monitor the situation and extend the waiver, if the need arises.”

177,['8/03/2020'],"Toilets in 3,928 anganwadis not built despite sanctioning of funds: CAG","Jaipur: Even as the Centre accorded a sanction of Rs 4.71 crore for the construction of toilets in 3,928 anganwadi centres (Rs 12,000 each for AWC running in government buildings) during 2017-18, construction was not started by the state government, revealed the 2017-18 CAG report tabled in the assembly.

According to the report, of the 61,121 functional AWCs in the state (as on March 2018), toilet facility was available only in 29,410 (48.12%) and drinking water in 47,358 AWCs (77.48%).

“On being pointed out in October 2018, the state government (December 2018) stated that proposals for construction of toilet and drinking water facilities were not received from the districts. Therefore, funds could not be allotted to them. Further, the funds sanction will be revalidated by the Centre and thereafter funds would be disbursed into the PD accounts of the respective Zila Parishads,” the report states.

“The fact still remains that despite availability of sufficient funds, essential facility of toilets was not provided to the beneficiaries at AWCs,” it added.

23.30 lakh malnourished kids deprived of nutrition: CAG

The CAG report also revealed that 23.30 lakh malnourished children (6-60 months old) were deprived of additional supplementary nutrition from 2015-18, though mandated under National Food Security Act - 2013.

The CAG report also revealed that from 2015 to 2018, there was a shortfall of 35.24% and 41.32% in coverage of targeted eligible beneficiaries for supplementary nutrition and pre-school education, respectively.

The state government stated, as per orders issued by the Centre, the department is providing supplementary nutrition to children (6-72 months), severely malnourished children, pregnant women and lactating mothers. It also stated that the ICDS financial norms and nutrition standards have not been changed by the Centre to comply with NFSA rules and hence malnourished children were not provided additional supplementary nutrition.

“The reply is not tenable because the department did not make any efforts to provide additional supplementary nutrition to malnourished children and get the norms changed by the Centre,” the CAG report added.

178,['8/03/2020'],"Mission Zero Tolerance kicks off, police fine 1,300 errant motorists","Pune: The traffic police took action against 1,300 motorists as a part of their Mission Zero Tolerance initiative on Friday.

The action was taken in areas under the jurisdiction of the Warje, Sinhagad Road, Bharati Vidyapeeth, Kondhwa, Hadapsar, Mundhwa and Airport traffic divisions. The special drive is aimed at reducing the number of fatalities on the stretch between Chandni Chowk and Kharadi bypass.

Two assistant commissioners of police, five inspectors, 14 sub-inspectors and 103 police personnel were deployed for the drive.

“The drive covered areas like Chandni Chowk, Mohammadwadi, Undri, Pisoli, Khadi Machine Chowk, Handewadi, Phursungi, Mantarwadi, Hadapsar, Solapur Highway and Kharadi bypass,” additional commissioner of police Sanjay Shinde said.

“The deployed personnel tried to increase the speed of traffic movement, checked all traffic signals, took action to prevent congestion and act against violators. Action was taken against 1,309 offenders. The initiative will continue until fatalities can be brought down,” Shinde said, adding, “Since January this year, we have already recorded 17 fatal accidents in the limits of Kondhwa, Wanowrie, Mundhwa and Hadapsar police stations.”

Shinde said the highest number of challans was issued for parking violations, followed by signal jumping, helmetless riding and for not carrying a licence.

While residents of these areas welcomed the action, they also drew attention towards the poor road infrastructure. Traffic officials too said the road infrastructure must be improved to further the aim of the drive. Traffic police and civic officials inspected bottlenecks in Mohammadwadi, Undri and other areas on Friday.

Group Captain Vijay Agarwal (retired), who lives Undri Chowk on Saswad Road, said the road has been a work in progress for a long time. “Completed stretches are good, but the others are in a shambles. Share autorickshaws and vans stop in the middle of the road to pick up and drop passengers, hawkers eat into the carriageway, while potholes dot the entire stretch. It is becoming increasingly difficult to commute in the area,” Agarwal said.

“The road from Undri chowk to Pisoli has gone from bad to worse,” A K Arya, a Pisoli resident, said. “It’s unbelievable that parts of the stretch have been opened for two-way traffic — there is no space. Repair works do start, but are left unfinished. And this is a problem at several spots. Commuters are having a very difficult time. Authorities should focus on improving the roads near Undri chowk and onwards to Pisoli,” Arya added.

179,['8/03/2020'],"International Women's Day: Gender no bar, women conductors crack the all-men code","Fayza, 25, says she has learnt to ignore people and do her job.

LUCKNOW: As UPSRTC driver Jagdish Yadav (54) revs up the bus engine at Lucknow’s Awadh Depot on a warm March morning, it seems conductor Fayza Farooqui won’t be in for a sunny start to the day. Minutes before the bus leaves for Prayagraj, an angry passenger snaps at her complaining about someone grabbing his seat. With her soft voice, Fayza (25) gets the job done without the force of personality that male conductors use to broker peace in such situations.

She is one of the 20 women conductors, who are a part of the 200 strong male-dominated workforce at the depot.

While Fayza is assigned duties on regular buses too, she was working aboard one of the Pink buses – a service with women conductors – for the day.

This TOI reporter travelled on the said bus to find out how women conductors were changing a profession, which has been ruled by men for years.

Starting 8am, she works 12-hour shifts. When asked if she is scared while travelling with strangers, she says, “You get used to it. There are many safety features in this bus, so help is always close.”

But what about unruly passengers? “Passengers often get agitated when the bus doesn’t halt where they want. You learn to ignore people and do your job.”

“For instance, disabled passengers often insist on claiming a seat reserved for them even if the bus is packed. If we ask them to board the next bus, they snap at us. Once, one of them even shouted at me: tumhare baap ki bus hai kya (does the bus belong to your father?).”

Fayza got her father’s job after he died last year. With a mother and a teen brother at home, the sociology postgraduate is the breadwinner of the family.

By the time the bus reached Lucknow’s outskirts, there were around 35 men and 10 women on board.

As the bus zips past districts, Fayza settles into a routine – checking and selling tickets and enjoying a few laughs with Jagdish.

Is it difficult for a woman to work in a male-dominated field? The Lucknow native doesn’t think so.

Jagdish agrees. “Your gender doesn’t matter. If you don’t have the right attitude, you won’t last here,” he says while eating when the bus stops at a restaurant.

Talking about if there should be women bus drivers too, Fayza thinks it’s about time; but Jagdish isn ’t as convinced.

“I don’t think women can be good bus drivers. Driving a bus full of passengers is different than driving a car or an aircraft. You have to be cautious while driving, as you have no clue about the next road,” he says.

The bus lacked a few promised facilities like a security guard and was ferrying several unaccompanied men. As per rules for Pink service, men are can board the bus, only if they are accompanied by women relatives.

Passengers seemed to be happy about having more women staffers on board. Shikha, one of the travellers, says, “Despite being outnumbered by male passengers, I feel safer with a woman conductor.”

As someone who unknowingly inspires confidence among passengers with her presence, Fayza is not too keen on continuing with her job. “I want a promotion, so that I land a desk job.”

180,['8/03/2020'],Under-construction FC Road smart footpath stretch tricky to tread on,"(Counterwise from top) Pedestrians

Pune: Pedestrians rarely had it easy on FC Road and the ongoing ‘Smart’ footpath work has only added to their woes, forcing them to jostle for space while manoeuvring around the under-construction stretches with a little margin for error.

The situation has worsened in the last three months, pedestrians said, while narrating their daily ordeal of skipping and hopping over the debris like a classic textbook act, on the right-side stretch from Good Luck Chowk towards Vaishali.

A visiting professor from South Carolina, Savita, was awed by the sure-footedness of the commuters. “They seem to be climbing ridges and clamouring over mounds with surprising ease,” she said.

“On the same note, in the US, places under construction are barricaded to avoid any accident. There are several pipes lying on different stretches on FC Road. I could see a digger/excavator in operation in the middle of the road fashioned for commuters to walk on. People casually walked past as lumps of soil were being dumped too close to them,” Savita said.

Exposing the authorities’ inefficiency, few barricades placed at irregular distances from each other meekly try to create a barrier between the dug-up portions and the carriageway on the road. Once the issue was taken up with PMC officials, they increased the number of barricades around a particularly risky stretch.

“One has to battle oncoming one-way traffic on certain stretches, while bearing the brunt of relentless two-wheeler riders. I mostly walk on the footpath wherever it is possible, but on certain stretches, I have to stumble through freshly dug up trench-like dirt roads as well, which is extremely unsafe,” Deepa Dubey, a working professional and a daily visitor to FC Road, said.

PMC’s executive engineer Dinkar Gojare, the Smart Footpath project in-charge on FC Road, said, “There have been some difficulties in managing the work on the road. We have tried to streamline traffic and allow pedestrians more space by removing double and angular parking. The carriageway’s width of 10.5 metres has been maintained. The Shivajinagar and Deccan police divisions have helped us remove two-wheelers parked on the footpaths.”

On the safety issues related to pedestrians, he said, “The number of barricades will be increased with immediate effect. I have coordinated with my team for necessary action related to the safety of vehicular traffic as well as pedestrians.”

Gojare said there was a plan in the works to create two zebra crossings on the stretch, which would be elevated with a subtle slope as per official guidelines, with blinkers at the base of the slope to make it safer for pedestrians. “The work on this stretch should be completed in two weeks,” he added.

Rahul Shah, a working professional with his office on FC Road, said, “Construction is a momentary issue. Hawkers and customers blocking the viable stretches of the footpath do not help the situation. When there is no space to walk, people are left with no option but to indulge in jaywalking.”

Vijay Kumar, who works at Sunil Medical Store, witnessed two elderly persons falling on the dug-up stretch while manoeuvring their way using unsteady makeshift ramps.

When contacted, sub-inspector Ramesh Bhote of the Deccan traffic division said, “The work has definitely hit movement of vehicles on the stretch. But we are always on our toes to check illegal parking or wrong-side driving. Two-wheelers parked on footpaths are towed away and wrong-side drivers are issued challans. We have also brought down the frequency of roadside hawkers.”

Business on the stretch has also been hit according to shopowners. “The customer footfall has obviously declined. Makeshift ramps should be provided so that people can reach the shops, through the ongoing construction work. We have put a step-up ramp of our own near the elevated partitions being constructed on the footpath to help customers,” Mohammad Kapasi , a Hyper Store employee, said.

Ganesh Aston of Flavour Street, a small eatery, said, “We get a lot of online orders. Delivery executives find it difficult to park their two-wheelers due to the ongoing work. This hampers their delivery schedule slightly.”

Chief minister Nitish Kumar expressed grief over the accident and directed the officials concerned to immediately pay the ex gratia of Rs4 lakh to each bereaved family.

Kanti circle officer (CO) Ravindra Kumar Bharti said the bodies were handed over to the family members after postmortem. They were coming from Basti in UP where they worked as daily wagers, he said. “The injured are undergoing treatment at SKMCH. Process has begun to pay the ex gratia amount to the next of kin of each of the deceased,” Bharti added.

The festival, jointly organised by the state tourism department and Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam (GMVN) at Ganga Resort in Muni Ki Reti, received an overwhelmingly positive response from visitors who came to the event from different parts of the country as well as the world.

“Uttarakhand government certainly deserves applause for this festival and we hope that the event is held like this every year.

On Saturday, Patanjali CEO Acharya Balkrishna held a session on Ayurveda and Yogini Usha Mata gave ‘Iyengar yoga’ lessons to the visitors. Later in the day, the visitors also enjoyed singer Anuradha Paudwal’s soulful performance. State tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said, “The International Yog Festival has received an extremely positive response from the public and we will certainly hold an even bigger event next year. Our prime focus is to spread yoga knowledge through our government tourism centres all across the world."" Juan Jose Cortez Rojas, ambassador, Bolivia, KK Singhal, vice chairman of GMVN and other dignitaries were also present at the festival venue on Saturday.

Iva Ashish Shrivastava, MD of GMVN, told TOI, Participants were pleased with the initiative which really motivates us to take this event to another level. Our attempt is to promote yoga as a healthy lifestyle practice and fortunately we have been able to send this message out wide."" The visitors also hailed the succesful conduct of the event. “It is commendable how the organisers managed to continue the festival smoothly despite erratic weather conditions in the past one week,” said Leo Martin , 48, who came to the festival from Spain.

“Government is making efforts for promotion of digital payments and enabling convenient digital payment modes throughout the country. Ministry of electronics and IT is collaborating with all the stakeholders for promotion of digital payments. BBPS is a system conceptualised by the Reserve Bank of India and driven by National Payments Corporation of India,” director of education Vandana Rao has told schools.

The circular issued on March 5 states that BBPS is the simplest method for all billers for enabling digital payments.

“It is therefore enjoined upon all the heads of unaided primary, middle, secondary and higher secondary schools to expedite efforts for on-boarding onto BBPS,” Rao has said.

Expanding the scope of BBPS, RBI had late last year allowed the interoperable platform to accept all repetitive bill payments, which includes school fees, insurance premiums and municipal taxes.

186,['8/03/2020'],"Pune police arrest three, seize eight firearms","The seized firearms

PUNE: The crime branch of the city police on Friday arrested three criminals and recovered eight high-quality firearms from them.

The arrests were part of an ongoing drive, which started after Pune commissioner of police (CP) K Venkatesham and joint CP Ravindra Shisve told the crime branch to identify criminals in possession of firearms and sharp weapons.

As a part of the drive, the crime branch recovered 41 firearms and 86 bullets in 2019 and 14 weapons so far this year.

The trio — Rohan Subhash Chavan (33) of Somwar Peth, Chandrashekar Ramdas Waghel (30) from Mukundnagar and Parvez Iqbal Patwekar (25) from Guruwar Peth — were arrested after police received a tip-off while making routine enquiries in this regard.

“Six pistols and two revolvers, as well as 14 rounds, were recovered from them,” DCP Bachchan Singh said.

Singh said the suspects procured the weapons from an arms dealer in Madhya Pradesh and planned to sell them here and surrounding districts.

“We are coordinating with the Madhya Pradesh police department and will bust the gang involved in the manufacture and sale of firearms,” Singh added.

FIRs have been lodged against the trio under the Arms Act. They have been remanded in police custody till March 11.

“Chavan has been booked in 24 cases since 2011. The Madhya Pradesh police had arrested him for possessing eight firearms in 2016. He got friendly with arms dealers while he was lodged at Sendwa jail there. After he was released on bail, he lay low till 2018. Be purchased the weapons from an arms dealer during two visits to attend court hearings there last November and this January,” inspector Bagwan said.

“Waghel had a case of attempted murder lodged against him with the Yerawada police in 2014. Chavan had given one pistol to Waghel. Chavan had purchased the weapons for Rs10,000-Rs 15,000. The superior quality firearms would fetch anywhere between Rs 20,000 and Rs 25,000 in the local market,” Bagwan added.

VISAKHAPATNAM: A minor dalit girl succumbed to burn injuries on Saturday after battling for life for 40 days while undergoing treatment at a hospital in the city.

The girl, Ampolu Bhuvaneswari, was torched by unknown persons on January 28 at her home town, Rajam , in Srikakulam district.

Sankara Rao and Lakshmi, the parents of the victim, said AP Women’s Commission chairperson Vasireddy Padma had visited the hospital and promised to take action against culprits.

The girl had received third degree burns and initially was admitted to RIMS and later to GIMS in Srikakulam before shifted to a private hospital in Visakhapatnam.

According to sources, in her dying declaration, the girl said that unknown persons poured petrol and torched her. She then slipped into an unconscious state. Later, she named a boy, her senior in school and two other persons.

Srikakulam SP Ammi Reddy said they have collected CCTV footage in which the accused boy’s movement was not traced in the vicinity of the incident spot. There was no eyewitness or circumstantial evidence against the boy, he said.

The girl is one among the 100 students sponsored by a corporate group to provide better education in Rajam. She is a seventh-class student at a missionary school.

Sources said the girl had presented a wristwatch to an 8th class student of her school on his birthday on January 28. The boy reported it to the class teacher and handed over the watch to him. The teacher called the girl’s mother and sent her home around 2.45 pm. She received burns around 5 pm.

189,['8/03/2020'],6 Eflu students detained near Mecca Masjid,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: ‘Are you not Indians?’ ‘Why are you scared to give your details?’ ‘You cannot come and collect funds without our permission’ ‘Will you come here again to collect funds?’ These are some of the questions the English and Foreign Languages University (Eflu) students said they were asked by the police after they were detained from Mecca Masjid area near Charminar on Friday.

Equipped with a collection box, charts reading slogans and a letter from the student union, six Eflu students said they went to Charminar at around 12:30pm to collect funds for Delhi riot victims . “While two of our friends went in the masjid to offer namaz, we were discussing whether or not to take the collection box inside and collect money after prayers. We did not even display the charts we were carrying. The police approached us and said that we cannot take the collection box inside the masjid. They snatched the letter from one of the students and dragged him to the police station,” said a female student, who was among the four students who were detained.

“It was scary to see our friend being dragged by police. Three of us just followed them silently,” she said and added that they were not even allowed to call a lawyer.

“When we refused to share our details in absence of our lawyer, the police asked why are we scared of sharing our details and are we not Indians or have we done something illegal,” the student said.

“When we refused to hand over our mobile phones, we were forced to switch them off. They threatened us of using other techniques if we don’t share details,” said a student.

They said the police told them that Charminar is a sensitive area and no one can collect funds in that area without seeking their permission. The police dropped them at the Eflu campus in their van after about an hour and a half, said the students.

Legal experts, meanwhile, said the police cannot pick up students or anyone for collecting funds. “What do they mean by sensitive area? If they are talking about the area being dominated by Muslims, then that should not be a problem as students were collecting funds for Delhi riot victims,” said Balakista Reddy, registrar, NALSAR University .

Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar told TOI that the students were detained under Section 151 (Arrest to prevent the commission of cognizable offences) of CrPC and later let off. “None of these students are from Telangana or regular visitors to that place. Some persons raised questions about their presence, and they visited during the prayer time. Considering the prevailing sensitive situation, they were detained and later released,” the commissioner said.

He said that the alleged government interference is in violation of the principles enshrined in the Constitution.

“A hereditary trustee is someone who safeguards the traditions associated with the temple. The fate of 105 temples has been put at stake and the fundamental right of religion has been violated by the government. More important is the incentive, the 9,000 acre land bank,” Raju said, while speaking to STOI.

With regard his removal from Mansas, he said, “This is a complete violation of by-laws of the trust. This move by the government smacks of political vindictiveness, with the incentive being the land bank of both the trusts.”

Raju said that he will consider all options to challenge the government.

192,['8/03/2020'],Piyush Goyal: US trade deal to push India's exports,"NEW DELHI: Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal On Saturday said a trade deal with the United States will help push more exports but made it clear that the government will not rush into any such agreement.

“Negotiations with the US are to India's advantage because we have a trade surplus (with the US)... it opens up more opportunity for our exports in a big way,” Goyal said at the Economic Times Global Business Summit here.

He sought to allay fears over the impact of coronavirus and said the government is looking to fill gaps in the global value chain through exports, while looking to alternative sources to import goods.

The minister also said trade negotiations were complex and did not want to put a time-line to concluding the talks that had initially begun as a deal to remove some of the bilateral irritants. Goyal said instead of just a short term engagement, he believed, India should look at a larger engagement with the US as it offered a huge potential for many of products such as textiles, gem and jewellery, chemicals, medicine and pharmaceuticals.

At the same time, he said, India does not want to rush with any trade negotiations, which are very “complex”, as the government did not want to repeat the mistakes of getting into free trade agreements like the ones that were signed between 2009 and 2011 in what was a reference to the trade pacts with Asean, Japan and South Korea .

He said unlike other governments, the Modi administration opted against signing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade pact, as it would have hurt the Indian domestic industry.

194,['8/03/2020'],"Police crack four house thefts, 1 held","Pune: The Kondhwa police claimed to have solved four cases of house break-ins by arresting a history-sheeter in Undri on February 27.

“We have recovered booty worth Rs9 lakh from the possession of Nazim Islam Ansari (35) of Yerawada. He is a criminal on police records,” sub-inspector of the Kondhwa police Santosh Shinde said.

The officer said Ansari was arrested while he was fleeing the crime scene after stealing cash and ornaments, collectively valued at Rs8.66 lakh, from an apartment in Vidyaniketan Housing Society in Undri on February 27. “He was handed over to us by the residents of the society. They nabbed him minutes after Ansari committed the burglary. His two accomplices are still absconding. Our search is on,” Shinde said.

The officer said a probe revealed Ansari’s involvement in three other burglaries — two in Kondhwa and one in Yerawada. “These three burglaries took place between 2019-2020. So far, we have recovered booty worth Rs9 lakh from him,” Shinde said.

The officer said they have recovered ornaments and cash, collectively valued at Rs7.19 lakh, stolen from the housing society in Undri. “Besides, we have also recovered valuables worth Rs1.8 lakh stolen during the previous three burglaries,” he added.

195,['8/03/2020'],"Snakes in homes to missing spectacles, all in a day’s work for Goa police","Representative image

PANAJI: On Tuesday morning, a ‘missing’ complaint landed on the desk of police personnel in Mapusa. It raised eyebrows as the complainant was not looking a person or a pet. The complainant sought help for his missing spectacles, to be located “along with its case”.

Being a tourist destination, Goa has its downside for police as well. They frequently receive complaints of missing rent-a-cars which tourists have not returned to the owners.

When it comes to thefts being reported, Goa’s police have seen it all—from metal water meters and public signboards being stolen as scrap to owners forgetting where they’ve parked their bikes. Some citizens think even a misplaced cellphone is a job for the police. And, of course, things will never get dull when they get a call reporting snakes in the house.

“Complainants report their bikes missing and when we set out to investigate, it turns out the vehicle was found as the owner had only forgotten where it was parked. But the complainants do not bother informing us once they find the bike. Also, such complaints are common with some brands of mopeds where the key works on all bikes of the model and someone else rides off thinking it is their own bike. Similarly, they report smartphones missing only to discover later that the device has a dead battery at home itself,” said a police official.

While control rooms have been set up for newly-launched single emergency number 112 across the country, citizens do not hesitate to call up for the slightest of reasons. “Many citizens are not aware what exactly the number is for and call up complaining that they did not receive water supply or are experiencing a power cut,” said an official.

Officials said that in jurisdictions where college campuses are located, violations of the IT Act are common, caused by disputes between friends turned foes.

“Students exchange personal information over messaging apps, but later discover the information was shared on social media or with other friends. It is the most common complaint where college campuses are located,” said an official.

Disputes between neighbours where both sides claim assault are also very common where a compromise is struck once the case reaches the courts, said an officer.

“In many cases, we discover later during investigation that it was only a verbal dual, but assault was claimed to strengthen the case. Very often when the case reaches the courts, the parties decide to strike a compromise. We, however, have to go through the entire process of investigation in the meantime,” said one personnel.

“From snakes spotted in the backyard, there is no end to the odd complaints we receive. But we have to send our personnel to the spot to inquire. We have to register some of these complaints if they fall within the ambit of the law and have to take it through the entire legal process,” said a senior official from South Goa.

196,['8/03/2020'],No clarity on GVMC polls till HC verdict on village merger,"Visakhapatnam: Even after the state election commission (SEC) released the schedule for local body polls on Saturday, including municipal elections, uncertainty continues for the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) as a case on the merger of five villages under Bheemili mandal into the GVMC is still pending for disposal with the high court .

The next hearing is likely to be on March 10 but as per the official schedule announced by the SEC on Saturday, the election notification for the municipal polls will be issued on March 9.

The GVMC has completed its groundwork, including preparing voter lists, notifying polling stations and a preliminary finalisation of the venues for counting and other purposes. Ward-wise reservations were finalised on Saturday but the civic body’s future course of action will depend on the court’s judgement.

Speaking to STOI, N Yellaji of Kapuluppada village, one of the petitioners, said they filed a case in the high court about two months ago over the recent merger of five villages in Bheemili mandal. “We want these villages remain as panchayats instead of bringing them into the fold of the civic body. After we first approached the court from Kapuluppada, people from the remaining four villages have also got on board. We expect the next hearing this Tuesday,” said Yellaji.

The high court recently disposed two other petitions, filed by the district president of the Telugu Nadu Students Federation Visakhapatnam Pranav Gopal, related to alleged inaccuracies in the ward delimitation exercise conducted by the GVMC after the number of wards was increased to 98. Speaking to STOI, Gopal said he would file a fresh petition in the high court on March 9.

The district administration and GVMC officials are hopeful of a favourable judgement and conducting the elections as per the schedule. Court cases have delayed GVMC elections in the past and the civic body has functioned without an elected council since February 2012.

It also stated beneficiaries were deprived of free drugs as all the essential drugs were not available.

The report also stated that, out of 319 beds in the four departments of pediatrics, surgery, orthopaedics and ophthalmology, oxygen line was provided to only 38 beds (only 11.91%). The report also states the number of OPD and IPD patients increased by 57.06% and 143.33% during 2012-2017. However, during this period, the number of beds increased only by 58.03% which was not commensurate with the growth of IPD patients.

The CAG report further stated that the hospital’s recource management was weak as operation theatres (OTs), Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and wards suffered from many infrastructural deficiencies and shortages of medical officers and nursing staff.

“Due to insufficient resources, various important hospital services like number of OPD days in a week, consultation time per patient and diagnostic services suffered,” CAG report stated in its conclusion.

“The hsopital was not following the legal/regulatory requirements regarding management of bio-medical waste, patient safety and hospital safety. Thus, mismanagement of resources of the hospital coupled with weakness in planning and monitoring resulted in deficiencies in the services being provided to the beneficiaries,” it added.

The report states that test check of records revealed that against the requisition of type of medicines included in Essential Drug List (EDL), 13.43 to 37.89 per cent drugs were not available for a period of more than four months during 2013-18.

The CAG reports says, “the data revelas there was a gradual increase in number of outdoor patients enrolled during 2013-17, but the percentage of beneficiaries decreased. As a result, over the years, about 21% of the registered patients failed to receive the requisite treatment/drugs prescribed.”

It further stated, scrutiny of records and information provided for 33 wards revealed that clinical demonstration rooms were not provided in 24 wards (72.73%), examination and treatment rooms were not provided in 19 wards (57.58%), resident doctors and student duty room were not provided in eight wards (24.24%) and ward pantry was not provided in 22 wards (66.67%). Further, there was high bed ocupancy ratio in two out of three pediatric wards, it added.

It was also noticed that bed occupancy ratio of these wards 104% in 2016, 113% in 2017 and 117% in 2018.

201,['8/03/2020'],One house got burgled every second day in city,"Vadodara: If the crime statistics presented in the assembly are anything to go by, Sanskarinagari seems to be the burglars’ favourite playground.

On an average, the city reported one house break-in every day in 2018 and 2019 with a total of 716 burglaries committed in the past two years. If that be so, then then burglars were targeting one house every second day during this period.

The state government tabled the crime figures in the state from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019. According to the figures, the city saw 158 cases of loot in two years while 87 murders were reported in the district in the same period. Seventy-eight cases of attempt to murder were also registered in the city and in district areas in the last two years.

In 2018 and 2019, 699 suicides were registered in city as well as rural areas.

The number of kidnappings remained almost the same with 167 cases registered in 2018 while in 2019, 160 complaints had been filed. Making a mockery out of Vadodara’s title of being a ‘safe city’, city saw 158 cases of loot in the past two years.

Known to be a communally sensitive city, Vadodara also witnessed 215 incidents of rioting in 2018 and 2019.

However, city police commissioner Anupam Singh Gahlaut, however, said, that crime per se has gone down in most sections in the city in these two years. “The number of loots have decreased significantly as we have managed to crack down on chain snatching gangs. We have arrested a gang that was involved in 22 cases of chain snatching,” he said.

Talking to TOI, the top cop said that to arrest burglaries, cops have begun detaining thieves under Prevention of Anti-Social Act (PASA). “This kept the burglars’ gangs behind bars,” said Gahlaut, adding that separate teams consisting of two police sub-inspectors and 10 constables have also been formed for patrolling at nights. “These teams keep a check on Sikhligar gangs that are mostly involved in burglaries. We also check vehicles at 57 different locations in the city,” Gahlaut added.

Nearly 139 rape complaints were filed in the city and district areas in 2018 and 2019 apart from 15 cases of dacoity in the same period. Over 1,945 theft cases were also registered in the city between 2018 and 2019.

Yavatmal: Farm activists of Yavatmal, in memory of the first farmer, Sahebrao Karpe, who committed suicide along with his family on March 19, 1986, will observe a one-day fast at Chilgavhan village on March 19. This is the fourth consecutive years when the activists, Amar Habib, Santosh Arsod, Manish Jadhav, Deepti Raut and others, will sit on the fast to draw attention of the state goverment towards the pathetic condition of farmers in the district.

The extreme step of Sahebrao had left the entire country shell-shocked as the deceased farmer had written a long letter addressesd to the then state government narrating the sad state of affairs in which the farmers of the district were forced to live. So far, over 3.5 lakh farmers have committed suicide across the country.

The fast is aimed at expressing solidarity with farmer community in the country. The activists have appealed to all sections of society across the country to join the fast irrespective of their caste, creed, sex and their political allegiance.

“Despite the appeal of the deceased Sahebrao to the state government, there is very little work being done by the government so far to help the debt-ridden farmers who are sinking day-by-day into the agrarian financial crisis. Consequently, the suicide spree is still in a progressive trend,” the activists said.

“Unless the government shows its will to bring a radical change in the existing agricultural policy and the MSP norms, the condition of the farmers will never be changed,"" said Manish Jadhav, a farm activists, here on Saturday.

204,['8/03/2020'],What makes UP’s first and only woman mahant a progressive people’s leader,"Mahant Devyagiri celebrates Holi with devotee.

Donning an orange turban and a maroon robe, she performs the aarti to ‘Goddess Gomti’ at the Gomti Riverfront. As she settles on a bench after that, devotees huddle around her with plates full of Holi colours. They joyfully smear her toes with colours and pose for a photograph. All this while, her face glows with a calming smile and her eyes radiate tranquillity.

The austere journey of the 43-year-old Mahant Devyagiri , a native of Barabanki who now looks after the famous Mankameshwar temple in Lucknow, can be traced back to January 10, 2002, when she became a saint and started living in the precincts of the temple. Notwithstanding the sneers of several caretakers and visitors, Devyagiri continued to stay there and go about her routine. On September 9, 2008, when her Guru — the previous mahant — passed away, she took over as the mahant of one of the oldest Shiva temples in Lucknow, becoming the first and only woman in Uttar Pradesh to acquire this position.

The pathology student-turned-mahant continued with many more ‘firsts’ as she took up some very progressive initiatives.

“Earlier, women were too shy to come to the temple owing to the frequent visits of naked Naga Babas. But when I took over, more women mustered courage to enter the temple,” she says.

Devyagiri also worked towards eliminating the stigma attached to menstruation.

“The women can now even enter the sanctum sanctorum of the temple during their period,” she adds. This is a striking change in the history of Mankameshwar Temple brought about by Devyagiri.

She has been holding discussions with the worshippers on female foeticide. “You always want a lady gynecologist for your child’s delivery. You want lady teachers to teach your children. Then why would you dislike a female child?” she asks.

Referring to the iftaar she organised in 2018, Devyagiri says, “ There are many Muslim followers of the temple. A Muslim group has been organising bhandaras every year for visitors. With an intention to reinforce the ‘ ganga-jamuni tehzeeb ’ of Lucknow, I organised a roza iftaar at the Gomti Riverfront.”

She recalled that her gesture received a barrage of criticisms from her associates and other orthodox Hindus. The opposition stooped down to a level where abuses were hurled on her on social media. “I stood my ground and went ahead with the roza iftaar, which was attended by more than a thousand Muslims”, she says.

Devyagiri started a cleanliness drive in 2008 wherein every Tuesday when the temple organised bhandara, she along with other temple caretakers, collected the garbage at the venue.

Another initiative of Devyagiri was cleaning the Gomti banks. “I took the initiative to clean the river banks and in 2012, appealed to the government to make the place accessible for those who want to offer prayers to Goddess Gomti,” she says.

After the Gomti Riverfront was constructed, Devyagiri began organising Gomti aarti every purnima.

Inspite of the earlier discomfort of the people when Devyagiri took the reigns of the temple, she has not only been accepted but also loved and revered by society over the years.

205,['8/03/2020'],"Rs 77 lakh stolen from Nashik ATMs in 2 yrs, only Rs 18,300 recovered so far","Nashik: In the past two years, burglars have been able to steal as much as Rs 77 lakh from ATMs located across Nashik district.

The bulk of the amount has been from ATM thefts in the urban areas.

And what’s even more troubling is the fact that the police have been able to retrieve just Rs 18,300 of the Rs 77 lakh stolen. This amount was recovered from two burglars who had broken open an ATM in Manmad in March, 2018, and had stolen Rs 29,000. Burglars involved in all other cases are still at large.

Most burglars who committed these crimes are also at large. Only two thieves, inv

According to the data provided by city and rural police, there have been 19 incidents of off-site ATMs being targetted over the past two years. Of these 19 attempts, five were successful and the burglars were able to make away with Rs 77 lakh. The other 14 cases were unsuccessful attempts in which burglars failed to cut open the ATMs or make away with the machines entirely by uprooting them from the kiosks. Of the five successful thefts, three occurred in Nashik city and two in Nashik rural.

The uprooting of ATMs from kiosks — using ropes tied to large SUVs — has been particularly worrisome to police.

Both city police commissioner Vishwas Nangare-Patil and Nashik rural SP Arti Singh have blamed banks for what they said were lax security protocols at off-site ATMs.

“These off-site machines, devoid of any security guards, have become soft targets. Despite repeated requests from us, the banks are yet to take this issue seriously,” said both the IPS officers.

There are a total of 353 ATMs in rural Nashik; 261 do not have security guards. In the city, there are 270 ATMs and 145 lack physical security.

Sources from within the police department said almost all banks that operate in the region have outsourced the management of the ATMs to private firms — everything from the handling of cash to surveillance of kiosks is today done by private security agencies. The private firms get the cash back from insurance firms since the money in the ATMs is insured.

In August last year, after thefts at two city ATMs on the same night, both the deputy police commissioners of the city wrote to the insurance firms urging them to deny claims filed by private security companies as they had not provided adequate security at ATMs. This was the first time the police had shot off such a letter.

Officials said the letter was aimed to drive home the point that banks and private operators need to boost security at the ATMs.

“We have increased patrols in the areas that have off-site ATMs. Beat marshals have been able to foil robberies on two occasions. But the police can’t be everywhere. Banks have to be proactive,” said Nangare-Patil.

According to Singh, the Nashik rural jurisdiction covers a large area. It has been a challenge to keep up vigil at all off-site ATMs, she said.

“But we have stepped up our vigil; there has been a drop in the number of such crimes. However, banks are yet to comply with our requests for security guards at off-site ATMs,” she said.

MODUS OPERANDI

Police said many gangs are actively involved in ATM thefts

The machines are almost always cut open using gas cutters. Many of the machines have been simply uprooted from their foundations and loaded onto trucks.

“In a majority of the cases, crooks cover their faces and then cut off CCTV cables. A machine is then removed after tying it to a vehicle, which pulls it off its foundation,” a police official said.

Police sources said it is very difficult to track down the culprits

“Their phone numbers remain unknown. The CCTV footage, in most cases, is not available. A breakthrough in such cases is very rare,” a police officer said. Officials added that many of these crimes were reported by customers or people out on morning walks.

Box

Nashik police commissioner Vishwas Nangare-Patil has written to state police to allow authorities to issue notices under section 144 of the CrPC to bankers and financial institutions if they have been found to have ignored security measures such as alarm systems, CCTVs and security guards at the ATM kiosks.

207,['8/03/2020'],FIRs against doctors on ‘misread’ reports wrong: High court of Bombay at Goa,"Representative image

PANAJI: In a judgment that encapsulates the medical fraternity from FIRs filed on the basis of ‘misconstrued’ reports, the high court of Bombay at Goa held that lack of enthusiasm by a doctor in taking timely cognisance and close observation of the condition of a patient cannot be a ground for slapping the charge of negligence.

TheHC quashed the chargesheet and the process issued by Goa Children’s court against Annely D’Lima, a lecturer in paediatrics at GMC .

The allegation against the doctor was that she, other doctors and nurses were negligent in the treatment of a newborn that resulted in auto-amputation of the child's right forearm. It was alleged that the doctor failed to give a drug to the child for treating gangrene. On the basis of a GMC inquiry report that mentioned lack of enthusiasm and failure to give a particular drug to the patients, police had registered the FIR .

Arun Bras de Sa, counsel for the petitioner, argued that the report clearly rules out the commission of any cognisable offence by the petitioner.

A division bench comprising justices M S Sonak and Nutan D Sardessai observed, “We are of the opinion that the investigating officer, misconstrued the report of the inquiry committee of February 9, 2012 and such misconstruction resulted in registration of FIR.”

Upon consideration of the report in its entirety, it would have been evident that no case of any cognisable offence has been made out against the petitioner so as to warrant the registration of FIR”.

De Sa said that the report of the inquiry committee should have been read in its entirety. It clearly rules out the commission of any cognisable offence by the petitioner, or for that matter, the other doctors and nurses.

The chargesheet was filed against 13 persons, including doctors and nurses.

He pointed out that the drug Vasodilator Pentoxyphyline was not at all available in the inventory of the GMC on the relevant date and besides there is sufficient literature which indicates that Pentoxyphyline was only an experimental drug at that stage, which was yet to get approval from the department of Food & Drugs Administration (FDA).

De Sa submits that in these circumstances no fault can be attributed to the petitioner in not administering such drug to the baby.

“On the aspect of admission of the Vasodilator Pentoxyphyline, there is reference to the petitioner and it is stated that the petitioner, as a consultant, had no experience of its use and this injection was not given. According to us, this can hardly be regarded as any negligence on the part of the petitioner,” the court noted.

Referring to the comment of lack of enthusiasm, the court noted that on the basis of the aforesaid comments it can hardly be said that any case of offence, much less offence for which the petitioner has been charged was made out against the petitioner.

The court noted that petitioner, cannot be said to have conducted herself in any negligent manner when it came to the treatment of the baby.

“We are of the opinion that the investigating officer, misconstrued the report of the inquiry committee dated February 09, 2012 and such misconstruction resulted in registration of the FIR,” the court observed.

VADODARA: Excessive use of elevator in a residential building in Manjalpur here resulted in a brawl between two neighbours.

Pravinchandra Vaghela, a committee member of the building, who asked his neighbour to cough up more money, lodged a complaint of criminal intimidation and under The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against him for allegedly abusing and trying to attack the complainant.

According to Vaghela, his neighbour Hitesh Shah, who lives on the eighth floor of Kshama Heights, indulges in excessive use of elevator on Thursday evening as many people visit his place. Vaghela told police that Shah is a follower of Sai Baba due to which people visit his house for prayers. Vaghela and other committee members had asked Shah several times to ask his guests to take staircases or conduct prayer sessions at another location. Police said too much use of elevator was resulting in high maintenance cost and electricity bill for the building.

On Thursday too, several people visited Shah’s house due to which the elevator was used multiple times by his guests. Vaghela told police that when he went to talk to Shah, his son Vishesh used abusive language and tried to attack him with a wooden stick. While Vaghela managed to escape the attack, the father-son duo used casteist slur for him in front of other neighbours and threatened him of dire consequences.

Due to such behaviour, Vaghela held meeting with residents of the building and approached police on Friday.

This is the second consecutive affidavit from Lokesh Kumar that was rejected by the high court. The court also sought a fresh affidavit with concrete details of his action plan on the issue, by March 29.

The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice Abhishek Reddy, which converted a TOI report on the plight of the people into a PIL, has been monitoring the case. Colonel Sitarama Raju, a resident of JJ colony, had brought the news to bench’s notice.

The bench turned critical towards the commissioner as he had informed the bench in his latest affidavit about his proposal to shift the dumpyard to one of the three identified alternative sites, but failed to show any progress in the direction.

The commissioner spoke about identification of 152 acres at Pyaranagar village in Gummadidala mandal to set up of a garbage treatment and disposal facility. Though the land was handed over to GHMC, things could not move forward due to lack of approach roads. The approach roads can be laid only if the forest department hands over 2 acres of land to GHMC. Though a proposal was sent to principal chief conservator of forests in September 2019, the approval from forest wing has not yet arrived. The bench noted that the commissioner had not indicated any timeline for the approval .

The second site spread in 42 acres was identified at Khanapur in Talakondapalli mandal. But authorities have not handed over this land. Therefore, it is unclear when GHMC would gain possession of land, the bench said.

The commissioner spoke about a third site spanning 150 acre at Lakdaram in Patancheru mandal. GHMC had requested Sanga Reddy district collector in June 2018 for the said land. The request was rejected because the land had been allotted to Rajiv Swagruha corporation.

The bench noted that the GHMC commissioner was claiming to search for a new site without indicating a timeframe for the same. “Mere identification of sites is meaningless when none of them are workable,” the bench added. The case was posted to March 31.

Vadodara: The district administration of Chhota Udepur is gearing up to prevent any spread of COVID-19 infection during the annual Ger fair in Kawant taluka.

The fair which is usually held three days after Holi, celebrates harvest where men and women from the community dressed in tribal attires dance and play different musical instruments.

For all such tourists, a special booth for health screening will be put up before Kawant’s entry point. District administration officials said that the foreign tourists’ screening is done at the airport but as people gather in large number at the fair, they are leaving no chance so every foreign tourist coming to the fair will be screened before entering Kawant.

An isolation ward has already been made at Chhota Udepur general hospital and in coming days similar ward will be made at community health centre in Kawant.

Besides foreign tourists, the fair draws members of Rathwa community from as far off as Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh and neighbouring districts of Godhra and Dahod.

217,['8/03/2020'],6 booked for helping Aapli Bus conductors pocket fares,"Nagpur: The Nagpur city police has booked six persons for running a racket to pocket fares of Aapli Bus in connivance with the conductors. New Kamptee police booked them under sections 341, 120 B (2) and 506 of the IPC only after municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe spoke to city police commissioner BK Upadhayay regarding non-cooperation from the city police to tackle attack on Aapli Bus checkers and conductors.

It was for the first time since the NMC took over city bus operations in March 2017 and after over two dozens of attacks on Aapli Bus checkers and conductors, that anyone has been booked under sections of IPC.

Confirming this, a senior official from DIMTS — the programme manager of Aapli Bus — told TOI that since January 2019, as many as 17 checkers have sustained serious injuries in the attack by anti-social elements. “Checkers were attacked either when they were chasing Aapli Bus or were cross-checking passengers and number of tickets issued during operation of city buses,” the official said.

On March 3 at around 6am, a flying squad of checkers’ team comprising N Prajapati, Bharat Chavan and Rahul Yeole were on duty on Kamptee road route where misappropriation of bus fares are more. After the team left DIMTS office, they noticed a motorcycle-borne youth following their vehicle. The motorist also tried to block them on Sitabuldi-Kamptee bus.

Soon, the team went to New Kamptee police station and filed a complaint. The police on Saturday booked six persons including Prem Mishra, Bilal Mohammed, Munna and three others for helping conductors in pocketing bus fares on this particular route. Though police booked them but no arrests have been made so far.

These six miscreants in connivance with conductors used to run a racket to pocket bus fares. They kept track of the location of these squads and update the location of checkers on WhatsApp group of conductors. The nexus of some ex-checkers with conductors also came to fore as they shared real-time locations of the flying squads.

On an average, six squads work in two shifts — from 6am to 2pm and 2pm to 10pm. The ‘without ticket’ cases increase during peak hours. But due to leakage of flying squads’ locations, the authorities could not nab the corrupt conductors.

218,['8/03/2020'],"Tamil Nadu: Once a murder convict, she rebuilds broken dreams","Revathi works in her oil crushing unit at Kaluthaipali village near Andhiyur in Erode district

KALUTHAIPALI (ERODE): From an orphaned girl trying to find a living as a housemaid in a big city to a murder convict trying to negotiate life after more than a decade behind bars, Revathi Anburaj reveals what it takes to rebuild your life. When the world is observing Women’s Day, she vehemently asks , “How would I celebrate when I was denied justice?”

At the age of 17, Revathi was found guilty of a murder by a sessions court in Bengaluru, which sentenced her to life imprisonment. “The court did not consider my age when I had committed the crime. Justice is not for the poor,” she says.

Born in Chennai, Revathi lost her parents in a road accident when she was a 10-month-old baby. Her grandmother Valar took care of her till the age of five. Later, she was shuttling between many houses doing menial jobs for food and shelter.

When she turned 13, a person in Bengaluru hired her as a maid servant in 2003. With dreams of a better life, she travelled to Bengaluru. “But, the person who hired me, was trying to sell me to a prostitution ring,” Revathi said. After sensing his motive, she tried to escape. The person blocked me and in the altercation he stabbed me 16 times. “In an attempt to escape, I grabbed the knife and slit his throat,” she said. The man died on the spot.

The incident took place on November 15, 2003, and she was hospitalised for 13 days. On November 28, she was lodged at a borstal in Bengaluru. “The trial went on for three years and I was awarded life term in 2006,” she said. The prison officials later shifted her to the Parappana Agrahara prison after she turned 18 years. Revethi lamented that the court did not consider her statement that the murder happened in her bid to protect herself.

In 2008, a group of 35 male prisoners from Mysuru prison had planned to stage a drama for which they sought women prisoners to do women characters. A total of 12 women including Revathi joined the team. Karnataka-based drama artiste Hulugappa Kattimani trained the inmates to perform the play.

During the time Revathi met U A Anburaj, 41, a life-term convict and co-artist in the team in Mysuru prison and expressed her love for him in 2011. After obtaining permission from the prison officials, they got married on March 28, 2011. She gave birth to a baby girl in May 2015.

Meanwhile, Revathi was released from prison on January 26, 2016 considering her good conduct. Out of prison, the world seemed entirely different from what she had seen during her teenage. “I felt that I was a stranger in the world. I did not know what to do next,” she said.

As per her husband’s direction, she came to Kaluthaipali village near Andhiyur in Erode district and joined Anburaj’s family with her daughter. Anburaj was also released from jail on August 15, 2016.

The couple tried their best to get a job to run their family. “But, no one was ready to give us jobs because of our past,” she said. Later, we decided to start an oil press our own. “I had only Rs70,000 in my hand and the cost of the machinery was Rs3 lakh,” she said.

Finally, Anburaj started manufacturing the crushing machine on his own using available materials. He set up the machine with the money they had, started the unit in September 2017 and began producing sesame oil, ground-nut seed oil, coconut oil and castor oil. Initially, the villagers were hesitant to buy oil from them as Anburaj was once associated with forest brigand Veerappan.

Now, Revathi earns up to Rs12,000 a month. She hoped that soon the income would be doubled as many people have started buying oil from them because of its quality. She hopes to start more crushing oil units in the near future.

Surat: The work to expand terminal building at Surat airport may get further delayed by a few more months as the expert appraisal committee (EAC) of ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) has raised technical issues for grant of environment clearance (EC).

At the 49th meeting held in New Delhi on February 25 -minutes of the meeting (MOM) is with TOI- the EAC recommended additional terms of reference (ToR) to be submitted by AAI authorities for getting the EC approval for expansion of terminal building at Surat airport. The EAC observed that airport authorities have not submitted certified compliance report of earlier EC granted for the existing terminal building in 2007 and the certificate from chief wildlife warden regarding the unnotified Hazira bird sanctuary.

Airport authorities had said that the expansion project does not require wildlife clearance as there was no wildlife sanctuary within 10 kilometre radius of the project site and that the unnotified Hazira bird sanctuary was at a radius of 11.2 kilometre.

Sources said MoEFCC had granted EC for the existing terminal building with certain conditions to be fulfilled like the issuance of the certified compliance report on May 16, 2007. Even after the terminal building was constructed and made operational, local authorities failed to obtain certified compliance report for the project. The terminal building of Surat airport is being extended by AAI at a cost of Rs354 Crores. The existing terminal building on an area of 8,474 square metre will be extended by additional 17,046 square metre (excluding city side and air side kerb) to have a total area of 25, 520 square metre. The present capacity of the existing terminal building is for handling 500 peak hour passengers, but the traffic has crossed 4,000 passengers per day.

When contacted, airport director Aman Saini told TOI, “A consultant has been appointed for EC process and things are being looked after by him.”

An airport activist on condition of anonymity said, “Even after 10 years, airport authorities have failed to procure certified compliance report of EC granted for the existing terminal building. Now, the EC approval will be delayed for another two months.”

The headmaster had asked the girl’s parents to take her to a doctor after she complained of stomach ache last week. A doctor prescribed some medicines for stomach ache and the girl was staying at home for the last one week. “She told her parents that the teacher had touched her private parts. He had asked other students to leave the class before harassing her,” a police officer said.

Her parents confronted the HM and picked up a quarrel. They later approached the Vadavalli police, who detained the teacher. Based on the girl’s testimony, the Perur all women police arrested him. He will be remanded in judicial custody on Sunday.

This is the third case of sexual harassment by a teacher in the district in two months. Last month, a government schoolteacher in Annur was arrested for sexually harassing a 12-year-old girl student.

They said the business has fallen by 50% and that the chicken meat price has dropped to Rs 100 per kg from Rs 170 around a month ago. The price of live chicken has also come down to Rs 40 per kg from Rs 80.

M Kandasamy, president, Coimbatore District Broiler Merchants’ Association, said their business was not limited to the state but it also encompassed neighbouring states such as Kerala. “We usually sell around 45lakh kilos broiler chicken meat a month in Coimbatore district alone,” he said.

However, the sales have dropped over the past one month, largely due to the rumours on social media. Pointing out that such messages were being circulated on social media for more than a month, A Pushparaj, secretary, Tirupur District Broiler Chicken Merchants’ Association, said, “We tried tracking 10 such messages. People who had shared the messages said they didn’t know whether there was any truth in the content. They just forwarded them. This has severely affected the business.”

Broiler chicken farmers, merchants and other stakeholders from across the state met in the district on Saturday and discussed ways to tackle the situation. They said health minister C Vijayabaskar had informed that the coronavirus wouldn’t spread through broiler chicken. “We will now spread awareness through advertisements and messages that broiler chicken wouldn’t cause Covid-19.”

The board had set Saturday for the sentencing. No fresh date announced for the pronouncement.

According to the sources, the sentencing was deferred due to lack of time and fresh date is likely to be announced on the next working day.

Pehlu Khan (55), a dairy farmer from Nuh district of Haryana, his two sons and some others were intercepted and attacked by cow vigilantes near Behror on April 1, 2017. Pehlu succumbed to his injuries on April 4 in a private hospital in Alwar . Seven cases had been registered — one against Pehlu and his sons for transporting cattle and the other cases against the mob which lynched him. There were a total of nine accused in the case, including the two minors.

A chargesheet against five of the accused was submitted before the trial court on May 31, 2017 while the chargesheet against one more was submitted in January 2019. Another chargesheet was submitted in the matter in May 2019; this one named Pehlu and his two sons as well though the deceased’s name was later dropped.

The seventh person had claimed to be a minor but the JJB found him to be an adult. His trial is still underway in a Behror court.

On August 14, 2019, a trial court in Alwar had acquitted the six people accused of lynching Pehlu Khan while he and a few others were transporting cows from Jaipur. The acquittal had created a hue and cry following which the state government formed an SIT and decided to appeal the decision. The 84-page SIT report pointed out loopholes by each of the four investigating officers. The SIT report said all the six accused should also have been charged under IPC Sections 395 (dacoity), 147 (rioting) and 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), in addition to those dealing with murder, voluntarily causing hurt, wrongful restraint and damage to property.

According to members of the search committees — set up for this purpose — the appointments are expected to take at least a month, to be completed.

The nine universities awaiting new VCs are: Osmania University, Potti Sreeramulu Telugu University, Dr BR Ambedkar Open University, JNTU Hyderabad, Kakatiya University, Mahatma Gandhi University, Sathavahana University, Telangana University, and Palamuru University.

The search panel members said that the state had recently written to the varsities to nominate an executive council (EC) member, who will be part of the panel, and gave them time till March 10 to send in their nominees.

“Except for Potti Sreeramulu Telugu University, the other eight varsities were asked to send in their EC nominees by March 10,” said Tirupati Rao, former vice-chancellor of OU, who is part of Telugu University search committee. “Looks like there is some delay when it comes to appointing V-C for Telugu varsity,” he added.

The members who are part of the search committees also said that at this point in time, it was not clear whether or not Somesh Kumar, who was recently appointed as chief secretary of Telangana, will continue as the government nominee in the search committees.

“When Somesh Kumar was made part of all the nine committees as government nominee he was special chief secretary of the revenue department. Now, he is appointed as chief secretary of the state. Right now, it is not clear if the state is going to replace him in these committees,” said a member, adding that if the state wishes to replace him, it has to issue a fresh government order.

The members said that after the EC members are nominated, the individual committees might have their first meeting. “As of now, there is absolutely no communication from the state about the appointment of VC. I am not sure whether the process had started at their end,” said Appa Rao R, who is part of the Telangana University search committee.

The search committees consist of a state nominee, EC nominee, and a University Grants Commission nominee. The committees will screen all the applications and will shortlist three names. These names are forwarded to the governor of the state, who, in turn, appoints one of them as vice-chancellor of the varsity.

230,['8/03/2020'],Women fast catching up with men in all social indicators,"Jaipur: Gone are the days when women in Rajasthan occupied the lowest positions in all social parameters in the country.

The consistent efforts of all the stakeholders have made them on par with the other half. They are gradually increasing their number in the workforce contributing to the household incomes. Education department reports said that the share of women in schools — private and government, has shot up from 36.2% in 2017-18 to 37.8% in 2018-19 academic year. It is interesting to note that in the same period the total female teachers added were 22,185 while male teachers added were 5,996.

The positive development is directly related to the rise of females in school and higher education institutes. The All India Survey on Higher Education report says that for the first time, women have almost scored at par level with their male counterparts in the gross enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education.

The report pointed out that the GER in 2018-19 for female was 23% and male was 23.1%. The GER is calculated as the percentage of male and female populace in the age group of 18-23 enrolled in any higher education institutes. Interestingly, a decade ago the gap between male and female was above 5%.

Pradeep Borad, higher education commissioner, expressed confidence that in the next academic year girl students will surpass boys with a big margin in the gross enrolment ratio. “Measures like free education for girls in government colleges, the opening of only girls’ colleges, schemes like Devnarayan Scooty for girls in higher education to name a few are contributing in the rising enrolment ratio,” Borad said.

The increase of enrolment of girls is also a result of improving sex ratio in the state. In the last four years, the state has reported an increase of 19 more girls born against 1,000 boys as compared to 2015. The health department report said that in 2015-16, the sex ratio was 929, which shot up to 950 girls in 2018. Officials have stated that it has further improved in 2019.

Commenting on the trend, vice-principal of Maharani’s College Rashmi Jain, who is a sociologist, says, “The desert state is gradually emerging from its orthodox and patriarchy system. Over the years, it has made significant progress than many far advanced states.

Vadodara: Three women for the first time embarked on cycling expedition across three countries to spread the message of zero carbon footprint and women empowerment.

Travelling 2020 km, these enthusiasts covered Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore without any support vehicle. Their travel began on January 30 and ended on February 28. “It was for the first time that Indian women cycled these three countries without any support. We had started our journey from Bangkok and ended at Singapore,” said Pinal Parlekar, 29, who along with 52-year-old government officer Ajita Baburaj and 51-year-old Vandana Bhavsar, had embarked on this journey.

Parlekar, a masters in engineering from Gujarat Technological University, had earlier set the record of being the first ever woman who had covered all the seven state capitals of North East India on cycle.

“The women in these three countries embraced us with love and support. Some of them have started planning of taking up such cycling expedition and seeing the world differently,” said Ajita, who holds the Limca Book of World Record for cycling from Kullu to Khardugnla, world’s highest motorable pass at 18,380 feet.

At the age of 20 when Ajita had done her first mountaineering expedition she was left mesmerised by the gigantic Himalayas. “I found a new love adventure in cycling through which I could travel to see the world differently,” she said.

Panvel resident Vandana found the idea to travel and exploring the world with likeminded woman exciting.

“If you do not have any male co-participant, you will try to find out ways to overcome the difficulties that arise. And it is then that you just don’t convey the message of women empowerment but also set an example,” said Vandana, who has earlier been part of cycling expeditions from Panvel to Shirdi (300 km in 3 days), Panvel to Goa (600 km), Goa to Kanyakumari (1,200 km in 12 days) and Navapur to Mahabaleshwar (900 km) among others.

Hyderabad: Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu said that there is enough policy formulation in India, but a lack of effective implementation of these policies on ground. He was speaking at an interaction with the faculty members of Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) in the city on Saturday.

Calling for inclusive and sustainable approach to development, the Vice-President (VP) said, “A policy is as good as its implementation”.

Stressing on the need for the benefits of the government programmes to reach the last man, he said, “No person, community or region should be left behind”.

The VP also called for making optimum use of digital technologies in improving service delivery and controlling corruption.

With regard to his visit to ASCI, he said that he was on a ‘knowledge pilgrimage’ visiting several institutes across the country.

He said he would be acting as a bridge conveying research and new innovations being developed at various institutes across India to the government.

The Vice-President also said that many countries were looking to India for training and capacity building. He also said that administration is not merely confined to implementation but also encompasses management and governance.

Calling Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) as the need of the hour, the Vice President said PPP was crucial for India to develop.

ASCI chairman K Padmanabhaiah, who chaired the session, underlined the need of recognising ASCI as an institution of excellence.

Vadodara: In an era when children are hooked on to mobile phones, she manages to not just get their attention but also them laugh. She spells magic on the children who are left spellbound by her puppetry shows. Meet 77-year-old Kalpana Desai who has been entertaining and educating the children through her puppets since last 50 years.

And, she still carries the same vigour and humour when she walks in the room full of enthusiastic children, in India as well as the US, waiting for her to take the centre stage. “It all began in 1960s after I completed by BSc in home science and joined Baroda High School, Bagikhana as a music teacher. I used to sing and write songs too and I wanted children to see more rather than just reading or writing,” recalled Desai.

Desai began doing puppet shows in her school and soon her popularity rose in the city. She began doing such shows in other cities as well. “I began making my own puppets as per the stories I wrote and narrated to children. What I experienced is that the kids can learn a lot and can be educated about important issues from such puppet shows,” Desai told TOI.

She has made nearly 500 puppets from different material including cloth, plastic, clips and balls in last five decades. “I visit the US every year for meeting my daughter. There too I have done puppet shows in the schools and they began gifting me puppets. I nearly have 250 puppets gifted to me by some schools in the US,” Desai said.

After she retired from BHS Bagikhana in 2002, she worked for another school and later joined Shram Mandir. “I also do puppet shows for blind persons as well as hearing and speech impaired people. Over last few years, I have begun teaching children and grownups the skill of making puppets,” she added.

Desai stays at her house on the Ajwa Road with her husband who is leaving a retired life. Asked which of her stories is liked most by the children, Desai said, “A story of a deer and her seven fawns is a favourite among the kids. The fawns never listened to their mother so one day she disappeared to teach them a lesson. When the fawns get worried, the mother returns and tells them to always listen to her. The fawns apologize to their mother. This story teaches the kids to be disciplined.”

245,['8/03/2020'],Weavers demand inquiry into anti-dumping duty proposal,"Surat: Unhappy with the decision taken by Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) for imposing anti-dumping duty on imported nylon yarn, powerloom weavers have demanded vigilance inquiry by central government to protect the interests of the weaver community on Saturday.

In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, they have raised doubts on the final findings by DGRT in connection with levy of anti-dumping duty on imported nylon yarn. The weavers stated that import of nylon yarn was in the range of 10-15% from China of domestic production of nylon yarn in Surat and other centres in the country.

On March 4, DGTR had proposed anti-dumping duty in the range of Rs30 to Rs70 per kilogram on import of yarn from China, Taiwan, South Korea and Thailand to protect domestic yarn spinners. The decision was taken after a detailed investigation by DGTR regarding the injury to domestic spinners due to dumping of low-grade and cheap yarn in Indian market.

Pandesara Weavers’ Association president Ashish Gujarati said, “We have sought vigilance inquiry into the final findings by DGTR. Surat is the largest consumer of nylon filament yarn and the anti-dumping duty will only provide a platform to yarn spinners to form a cartel to increase yarn prices.”

Vimal Bokawala, a powerloom weaver who has demanded vigilance inquiry on behalf of weaver community, said, “It is only due to imported nylon yarn that prices of domestic spinners are well under control. If the anti-dumping duty is imposed, yarn prices will skyrocket, leaving weavers to either reduce production or shut the units.”

Federation of Indian Art Silk Weaving Industry chairman Bharat Gandhi said, “We demand fair play for weavers as well. Ultimately, they are the ones who manufacture the fabric. The government must take a lenient view on the present development.”

246,['8/03/2020'],Mumbai: Woman claims jewellery store swapped Rs 13 lakh diamond,"Picture for representational purpose only.

MUMBAI: A woman has lodged a police complaint, accusing a jeweller from Andheri and three of his staff of misappropriating a diamond worth Rs 13 lakh. Even as the store refuted the charge, officials of Oshiwara police station said they are looking for the store owner and three employees.

N Dwivedi had bought a gold ring with a 1.3 carat diamond set in it from Amsterdam. Last December, she got the diamond taken out before giving her ring for redesigning at Shilpi Jewellers at Lokhandwala Complex. When she got the ring and put the diamond in, it was too tight.

“The employee who had redesigned my ring had gone on long leave. I did not want anyone else to resize my ring. In mid-February, he resumed and convinced me to leave behind the ring along with the diamond this time. I trusted him,” Dwivedi said.

Two days later, when she went to collect her re-sized ring, there was no hallmark on it. “I refused to accept it without a hallmark. On looking closely, I found that the diamond was much smaller. I immediately realised that my 1.3 carat diamond was replaced with a smaller one and confronted the staff,” said Dwivedi.

At her insistence, the staff weighed the diamond. “The diamond I had purchased from Amsterdam had a laser mark but the one the store had given me weighed much lesser and had no laser mark. I was furious and demanded they return my diamond. The staffer then sent for the shop owner who offered me another diamond,” said Dwivedi.

When she refused the offer, the shop owner said he would personally check at the factory where diamonds were sent for work. He asked Dwivedi to check at the factory herself. But the workers denied having done anything wrong. “Thereafter, the owner kept asking me for more time. Eventually, he pretended he had lodged a complaint against his own staff and they were being questioned by the police. But I found this to be untrue when I checked with the police,” she said.

Dwivedi lodged an FIR. Her lawyer, Shreyansh Mithare, said, “The police have only applied section 406 of IPC for breach of trust. They must additionally apply section 420 of IPC for cheating.”

The objective of the mission is to develop the rural areas by providing facilities that are available in urban areas.

The panel led by Leena Bansod, the CEO of Nashik zilla parishad, held discussions with the various government bodies in the district on the developmental plans that will be carried out in the three areas under the rurban mission of the central government.

The three clusters in the district are Manwad in Nandgaon taluka, Dabhade in Malegaon taluka and Nirgude in Trimbakeshwar taluka.

These have been shortlisted on the criteria set by the central government.

Some of the different works that have been sanctioned in the current phase are the development of proper sanitation, providing clean drinking water.

The works will be carried out in the phases, the officer said. The development schemes will ensure that the residents of the villages will get 70 litre of water per head and at the same time solid waste management plans will also come up in these villages.

Besides the construction of schools and digitisation of anganwadis, the roads, drainages, street lights provision of LPG cylinders and connections, the formation of self-help groups for women and providing business and trading opportunities for them, and skill development among tribal communities are some of the important points that rurban scheme will focus on.

The officer said that the scheme was creating job opportunities in the rural areas, besides bringing development and taking measures for a cleaner and healthier environment. This will lead to fewer health issues and will bring down migration, the officer added.

248,['8/03/2020'],Govt gives go-ahead for work at Kondaveedu fort,"Guntur: After dilly-dallying for months, the state government has given the green signal to resume works on Kondaveedu fort in Guntur district.

Roads and buildings department has chalked out an action plan to take up works on the last stretch of road to connect the fort entrance with Rs 11.8 crore.

The officials inspected the fort area on Friday and directed the contractor to immediately launch the works. The 0.75km long road would pass through important historical temples and guest house on the ghat road.

Although the state government had completed the 5-km- long ghat road in the past, the small incomplete stretch of 0.75km is causing huge inconvenience to tourists as they are unable to reach the fort entrance. The officials noted that they were hopeful of completing the final leg of work within six months and get the entire ghat road ready for the movement of the vehicles.

The R&B department has completed another approach road for about 2.5 km in the valley of Kondaveedu fort to help tourists visit monuments on the hill fort by foot.

Meanwhile, finance minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy discussed the progress of developmental works at the fort with Kondaveedu Fort Development Society convener Kalli Sivareddy and Madya Vimochana Prachara Committee (MVPC) chairman V Lakshman Reddy in the secretariat on Friday.

He said that he has been closely monitoring the works with different departments and asked Sivareddy to update him about the progress from time to time.

Sivareddy explained that archaeological department had completed renovation of Sri Lakshminarasimha Swamy temple with a cost of Rs 46 lakh. He said that this temple was constructed by Reddy kings in the 13th century. He said that endowments department was gearing up to install idols in the temple.

He urged the finance minister to instruct the forest department to take up the proposed developmental works on the fort hill. He said that forest department has readied a detailed project report to take up different works with a cost of Rs 5 crore. He said that the forest department has also constructed seven arches as part of Nagaravanam project.

Ajay Kallam, principal advisor to the state government, will visit Kondaveedu fort on March 15 and take stock of progress of the development works.

250,['8/03/2020'],Hyderabad: ‘Muslims not opposed to citizenship for Hindus’,"Akbaruddin Owaisi

HYDERABAD: AIMIM floor leader in the assembly Akbaruddin Owaisi on Saturday tried to drive home the point that Muslims were not against citizenship being accorded to Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and Parsis as it was being projected in certain quarters.

“Let citizenship be given to all the Hindus coming from the entire world and not just from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. CAA , NRC and NPR are not just issues of Muslims but of the whole country,” he said.

He wanted a clear message sent across the country in the form of a resolution in the Telangana legislative assembly on what was wrong with CAA, in an obvious reference to Muslims being kept out of the Citizenship Amendment Act.

“These are issues concerning illiterates, poor and various sections of society from all religions. One of the objections of Muslims is that no closure has been given in CAA. There is no sunset clause in the Act,” Akbaruddin said during the motion of thanks to the governor’s address in the assembly.

He alleged that an ideology of hatred on religious lines was being imposed on the entire country. “This country does not run on anyone’s ideology but runs as per the Constitution. Anyone raising voice against their ideology is being branded an anti-national (desh ka gaddar).”

He further said, “People are told ‘goli maro inko’. I am standing here to save the Constitution. This country is being discriminated against by provocative speeches and violence. Neither me nor AIMIM will get intimidated by such forces as the Constitution provides us with rights and strength to protect democracy and stand up against them.”

Akbaruddin did not take the names of Prime Minister, Union home minister or BJP in his speech. However, in a veiled attack on the BJP-led government at the Centre, he said: “The rulers are not concerned about falling GDP or slumping economy. They are more concerned about CAA, NPR and NRC. In the governor’s address too, there was no mention of CAA, NPR or NRC.”

He congratulated chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for opposing CAA in Parliament.

The speaker asked him to stop his speech mid-way, saying that the House would discuss CAA separately.

251,['8/03/2020'],NID convocation finally held,"Ahmedabad: When the 40th convocation of National Institute of Design (NID) took place on the lawns of the institute on Saturday evening, it set several records — none of which will be flattering for India’s premier design institute.

It was for the first time that the convocation was postponed for a month, purportedly over the choice of the chief guest. In this case, it was the noted danseuse and activist Mallika Sarabhai, a known Modi critic, who had recently participated in anti-CAA protests in Ahmedabad.

On Saturday, an unprecedented number of students — more than 50 — of the institute publicly sported black armbands to show solidarity with the anti-CAA protesters. An unusually high number of students, 37, did not attend the event and received degrees in absentia. Most importantly, it was for the first time that the institute failed to get a chief guest for its convocation.

In all, 315 students of BDes and MDes courses from Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, and Bengaluru campuses of NID were conferred degrees.

Even as the authorities remained tight-lipped over the reason for the postponement of the convocation — originally scheduled on February 7 — speculation was rife that the move aimed to avoid protests against the CAA and the NRC.

“We are yet to know the reason for the postponement,” said a graduating student. “I was among the students who had come for the February event with my parents and had to go back. If they cancelled the event fearing anti-CAA protests, the purpose was defeated as a large number of students, including myself, wore black armbands.”

Another student said: “All educational institutes should have the space for dissent.”

Mallika Sarabhai, who was invited as the chief guest for the convocation in February, had released her speech on social media on Thursday night. In the speech, she criticized the policies that she said created fear and urged students to lead India to reason, compassion, and humaneness.

In response to media questions, she said that she had not been invited to the convocation on Saturday. “Whatever I had to say about the event, I already have in the post,” she said.

Meanwhile, NID’s decision to go ahead with the convocation, drawing a large number of people amid COVID concerns, invited criticism.

“The central government has issued an advisory against public gatherings. But I guess the institute might not have wanted a repeat of February,” said a parent attending the event. A few students were hoping to get an answer about the postponement. But speeches of director Praveen Nahar and governing council chairperson Jamshyd Godrej did not mention the event. The usual energy of the convocation was missing as cheers of students were heard only during the presentation of degrees.

252,['8/03/2020'],"Revamp over, parking lot at Qutub Minar offers much more","Construction of the minar begun towards the end of the 12th century by the first Mamluk sultan of Delhi

NEW DELHI: The parking lot at Qutub Minar complex, which was undergoing a revamp for quite sometime, made a comeback in its new avatar with a host of new facilities on Saturday. The whole thing was made operational in the presence of the director general of Archaeological Survey of India and other senior officials. However, the event was deliberately kept low-key because of the coronavirus scare, ASI officials informed.

Spread over a 10,000 square-metre area, the spruced up space has six booking counters that are operational, and will have four automated ticket vending machines in a week’s time.

“This integrated space will also offer cloak room facility, drinking water and rainwater harvesting. A cafeteria will also become operational shortly,” said an ASI official, adding that a tender to select a vendor for the cafeteria will be floated shortly. “The space, though, is ready,” the official stressed.

In the near future, touch-screen information kiosks with well-curated content will also come up here along with free WiFi, the official added.

While the work was on, visitors coming on their own transport to this Unesco world heritage site had a tough time negotiating the rush outside and the ill-organised parking slots inside. Vehicles would often have to queue up to get in or out. That’s set to end.

The place has also been done up to match the colour scheme of the Qutub complex.

Construction of the minar was begun towards the end of the 12th century by the first Mamluk sultan of Delhi, Qutbuddin Aybeg, and was finished by Sultan Shamsuddin Iltutmish, in the 13th century. In the 14th century, Sultan Ferozeshah Tughlaq added two more storeys to it.

HYDERABAD: Women need to play a more proactive role in mitigating climate change as they will face the brunt the most, said experts at a panel discussion on ‘impact of climate change on women’ hosted by the British Deputy High Commission.

The panel discussion, held to celebrate International Women’s Day, was hosted around the theme ‘Innovators and Inventors’.

It is women who are at the forefront of the battle against climate change, said Sridevasena Allamaraju, collector, Adilabad. “When we started a seed-balling project to promote growth of plants in the district, it was women who helped us make the balls, but men claimed the limelight,” she said.

Speaking about how women could determine water quality based on local knowledge, researcher, Shreya Chakraborty, said, “My experience in West Bengal showed, women can tell the quality of water based on the rice they cooked with it.

In terms of framing policy, Shreya said, “To make space for voices of women from rural and peri-urban spaces, we need to look beyond the arrogance of data centred science and give value to local knowledge.”

It’s an army of young women from India’s hinterland, some just out of their 10th standard, that wo’man’ the assembly lines of Foxconn, the third-party manufacturer for Xiaomi in India.

Foxconn has a dedicated 30-acre facility for Xiaomi phones at Sri City, where women from AP, Tamil Nadu and Odisha comprise nearly 90% of the total 15,000-odd workforce churning out a host of Xiaomi phone models, including high end ones like Redmi Note 8 Pro and .

And women are preferred for their quest for perfection and their nimble fingers that are best suited for such fine, precision jobs. Interestingly, nearly 99% of the Xiaomi phones sold in the country are Made in India.

She points out how working in a factory has transformed not just her life but that of her entire family. “After I got promoted to the role of key operator, my mother stopped working as a daily wager and my elder brother could go to college. I was also able to help him buy a laptop and bike for his work,” says a proud Chenchamma.

And it has also given her and the thousands of young women from underprivileged backgrounds a sense of purpose and financial independence. “No matter how the day is outside, the moment we step into the company, we leave all our troubles behind and work peacefully. This job has helped me gain respect in society as well as independence,” she adds.

For Kamala Kumari, mother of a 17-year-old boy whom she adopted from her sister, the job is a ticket to a more fulfilling life. “As a 10th grader, there were very few job opportunities. Before joining the factory, I would stitch clothes and work in fields for earning around Rs 3000, which barely helped me make ends meet. There were days when my family had absolutely nothing to eat. But now life has changed.”

A Xiaomi spokesperson said Xiaomi India employs nearly 30,000 people across all its manufacturing facilities at Sri City in AP, Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu of which more than 95% are women as part of the company’s emphasis on inclusion and gender diversity.

Due to incessant rain and stormy weather conditions last year, the school buildings were badly damaged which resulted in classroom walls and roofs leakage. Some schools also lost the roofs due to extensive monsoon last year.

“We have received Rs 5.8 crore from the government for the repair work in primary schools. The rest of the sanctioned amount is expected to come after six months,” ZP officials said.

The officials are positive that the work will be finished soon. “The funds would be used to repair roofs, doors, windows, flooring, walls, etc. of these schools. We have already started the work so that the students do not have to face issues during monsoon,” the officials said.

The officials would also look to complete major repair work by the end of the month. “The state government had given a deadline of three months for the repair work, which means that during the current academic year, all the primary ZP schools should undergo repairing work,” added the officials.

ZP officials had applied for the sanctioning of funds in August and received the government approval in December.

The education department allocated the funds for the respective schools according to their requirements while the construction department started the repair work as per the need of every school. “The repair work does not include the making of new slabs for the roofs. If the schools have a tin roof and it is dislodged (or broken), it will only be repaired,” the ZP officials told TOI.

258,['8/03/2020'],"Tamil Nadu: Face ID, thumb print for medical admission","The counselling process would be videographed this year

CHENNAI: The state selection committee will use technology assistance, including facial identification and thumb impression, to prevent impersonation during MBBS admissions this June, director of medical education Dr R Narayana Babu said. The state is also planning to videograph the entire counselling process, he said.

This year too, the directorate of public health will allow the sale of applications online, though counselling sessions will be held offline. “The screening process will be stringent this year. We want to take all precautions to avoid false nativity or impersonation. We are currently looking at the technology available for this,” Narayana Babu said. Discussions are also being held with technology companies for a tailor-made software, he said. “The aim is to identify fraud during counselling. If we don’t, we should be able to collect adequate evidence for the investigating agencies,” he said.

The state selection committee admits students to 85% of the seats in government medical colleges and seats under merit and management quota of self-financing colleges. It also admits students to category B institutions such as ESI Medical College Hospital in K K Nagar and IRT Medical College Hospital in Perundurai using the NEET rank list and by applying the 69% quota rule. The admission for the 15% all India quota is done by the Medical Counselling Committee for the Directorate General of Health Services.

In 2019, at least seven students from the state were found to have impersonated their NEET examination. Investigation agencies found that the photographs on the NEET admit card and thumb prints they had submitted to the National Testing Authority (NTA) from the examination hall did not match those of the students admitted in government medical college and deemed universities.

CB-CID police said these students had engaged impersonators, who appeared for NEET in centres outside Tamil Nadu , attended the medical counselling in the state and completed the admission process at the college. The state medical university is yet to register these students for the upcoming first year examinations in August-September.

The NTA has already sought more information from the students. “We will verify the thumb imprints during counselling. We have special software for facial identification as well. We have asked proof of address and other documents to prevent nativity frauds. All this should help us stop frauds during counselling,” he said.

The single-window counselling process will be videographed. The selection committee also plans to share images and data of the students given admit cards to the respective medical colleges, so that colleges can also carry out the verification process during admissions. “We are asking students to bring their latest photographs for the counselling. Last year, there was confusion as some students submitted photographs that were six years old. A private college sent us names of two students who looked very different from the photos they submitted as they had lost weight and changed hairstyle,” Narayana Babu said.

HYDERABAD: A real estate businessman in Rajendranagar was arrested for conning a builder. He had promised the builder to help him get land and development agreement to construct a high-rise apartment and had taken Rs 1.5 crore.

The accused was identified as P Prabhakar, a resident of Shaikpet, and managing partner in Ketrish Developer. Kiran Kumar Reddy, the builder, had met Prabhakar in 2017. Prabhakar claimed that he owned a 10,043 square yard plot in Uppal mandal.

When Reddy showed interest in starting a development project by building high-rise apartments, he paid Rs 1.5 crore to Prabhakar as goodwill interest. “Reddy has invested over Rs 10 crore in the project, including construction cost. However, Prabhakar did not sign the development agreement and kept delaying the matter. Around 60% of construction work has been completed,” said Rajendranagar inspector Suresh.

Recently, Reddy found out that the accused had already sold about 60 flats — by charging Rs 50 to Rs 70 lakh for each flat — without his knowledge. “When Reddy confronted Prabhakar, the latter, along with three of his associates, attacked him with iron rods. Reddy was dragged out of his car and chased. He was admitted to Osmania Hospital. This happened in November 2019,” said the inspector.

It was also found that Prabhakar was involved in two more similar cheating cases in KPHB colony and Abdullapurmet police limits.

Prabhakar was arrested from his house and sent to judicial remand on Friday. He was booked under various sections of IPC.

260,['8/03/2020'],Ace the race: Woman auto driver turned cabbie drives into male bastion,"Vennapusa Narayanamma

Bhaiya meter pe chaloge kya? is an oft-repeated refrain of city commuters. But when the auto driver is Vennapusa Narayanamma, many riders find themselves at a loss for words.

Thirty-eight-year-old Vennapusa Narayanamma, who has been driving an auto rickshaw for nearly 13 years now, is still a rare sight in Hyderabad. She’s is one of the few female auto drivers in the city and is now graduating to the role of a cabbie with Uber .

But her drive into a hitherto male bastion was not prompted by the need to break stereotypes but to give her children a better life. “I decided to enter into this profession in 2006 when I realized that we will not able to handle the education and other expenses of our children as they grow up. I joined as Uber as a driver partner a year ago and before that, I was an auto driver for almost 13 years,” said Narayanamma with a sense of pride.

And being in the driver’s seat does come with its share of challenges. Firstly, it’s a lonely road as the number of women taking up driving as a profession are still very few and far between due to the fear of safety, lack of encouragement from their peers and even societal norms, she points out.

“When I started working in this profession and even now a lot of people make fun of me. Some even go so far as to tell me on my face that this job is not for women. But I never pay attention to such comments and focus on working hard,” she adds.

And it was her passion for driving and the support of her family members, particularly her husband, that gave her the confidence to take the road less travelled. “My husband happily sits in my taxi or auto if we have to go somewhere,” she says with a smile, adding that driving was very liberating for her because the work hours are flexible enabling her to be her own boss.

Today, Pragati is a known face in her hub in Hyderabad, zipping around on her Activa as she goes about delivering packages. The biggest challenge that goes with her job is not just the fact that it is hectic and perceived as a not-so-safe job for women but also dealing with all kinds of customers.

263,['8/03/2020'],"Shattering stereotypes, this 56-year-old is the new face of entrepreneurs in Telangana","Kotla Jayamma

She is not a techie, nor an MBA grad and neither is she young. Fifty-six-year-old Kotla Jayamma is a farmer, mother of three and grandmother of four. At an age when men and women start planning their retirement, Jayamma, who has studied up to Class 7, is busy making plans to scale up her maiden venture – Arogyadayini – that too from her farm in Mahbubnagar.

The growing instances of people around her falling sick because of consuming sub-standard processed food started bothering her. Not one to sit and brood over a problem, she started growing millets and making cold pressed oil at her farm.

Though her initial experiments with making cold pressed oil failed, she was not one to give up. She went to Mysuru and got herself trained in the skill of extracting cold pressed oil in a couple of days.

Last year when women’s incubator WE Hub along with Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH of Germany, conducted a programme at her village to identify entrepreneurs, she participated and made it to their list of top entrepreneurs in the state. Since then, she has been closely engaging with WE-Hub to take her venture to the next level.

“I have two machines and each machine extracts close to 300-450 litres of oil in a month. This year I want to add another three machines,” she says, adding that Arogyadayini currently extracts coconut, groundnut and sesame cold pressed oils that are sold in only in glass bottles. For locals, she encourages them to bring their steel vessels.

Jayamma says that her mission is not only to manufacture pure and safe food products but generate employment in her village so that young men and women can earn a decent living staying closer to home instead of having to migrate to cities.

“I do not want children in my village to grow up without their parents…with only grandparent taking take of them in their initial years. A family must stay together and it is only possible if people have work here,” she says. Currently, Arogyadayini employs 10 people.

Jayamma wants women to be fearless and dream big. “If someone wants to learn the nitty-gritty of cold pressed oil manufacturing, I will hand hold them.”

Surat: Probably , he is the only man in the Diamond City to have kissed renowned actor Raj Kapoor on his cheek when he visited Surat and the person solely responsible for keeping the Parsi theatre alive at the age of 83.

“I wish I can make people smile till I turn 100 through my plays. There must be one or two persons in the audience who may be facing a tough time and if my play can bring smile on their faces it is an achievement for me,” said Yazdi Karanjia.

Neither the thespian nor members of his theatre group charge a single rupee for performance. They get their expenses sponsored by show organizer. Karanjia and his group have performed at multiple locations across the globe for free. Each member earns his or her livelihood by working in other fields.

Karanjia who mostly does comedy in Parsi Theatre in Gujarati language can make one laugh 10 times in a 10 minute chat. He thinks smile is all that one should have.

“Recently when I prayed to God for my long life I felt that the latter was not so pleased. But when I offered to make people laugh for a few more years, he smiled at me,” Karanjia said.

Karanjia, who has performed in hundreds of shows, recently got Padma Shri from Government of India for his contribution to the art. He will be felicitated in an event by actor Boman Irani on Sunday.

India had just attained Independence when Karanjia felt the allure of theatre at his father Naoshirwanji's school after he was offered the role of a girl in a play.

“After my performance, a woman came to the changing room and blessed me. She also said, 'Keep laughing and make others laugh.’ The woman told me that she laughed despite being in pain due to her husband's recent death. This touched my heart and I decided to do exactly what she told me.”

Once he completed graduation in commerce, Karanjia began to get multiple opportunities in theatre and he talked to his father. “My father agreed to allow me to follow my passion but took a promise that I will never charge a single rupee for my art. I am keeping that promise till now,” he said.

Karanjia learned swimming in Tapi river at the age of 42 from his friend and teacher Chimanlal Lapsiwala. He can pedal a bicycle several kilometres in one run even at this age. He has a coaching institute where he goes on his bicycle. He along with his wife and other members of family nurtures new talent in theatre. Karanjia expects affordable infrastructure for theatre artists in the city and sees bright future for the theatre. The veteran actor has a son and two daughters who are all married.

266,['8/03/2020'],Tainted Wardha deputy RTO gets Nagpur rural charge,"Nagpur: The state transport commissioner’s office has given Wardha deputy RTO Bajrang Kharmate additional charge of regional transport office Nagpur (rural) though he is facing departmental inquiry following allegations of corruption.

The development comes even as MLC Girish Vyas and Kamptee MLA Tekchand Sawarkar have submitted LAQ in the current budget session of state legislature over corruption in RTO.

After Nagpur rural RTO Shripad Wadekar opted for VRS, the transport commissioner gave the additional charge to Nagpur city RTO Dinkar Manwar. When Manwar refused to hold the additional charge citing workload, Kharmate was assigned to the post.

Sources said the Kharmate was given the additional charge ignoring two senior deputy RTOs of Nagpur rural which covers Nagpur rural, Bhandara, Gondia, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts.

The order appointing Kharmate was issued by additional secretary D Kadam. He has also sought information about status of inquiry initiated against Kharmate in the corruption case.

In December 2018, the then transport minister Diwakar Raote (who belongs to Shiv Sena) had initiated an inquiry and sent Kharmate, who was Wardha deputy RTO and holding the additional charge of Nagpur city RTO, back to Wardha following several complaints lodged by city Yuva Sena activists.

Nitin Tiwari, president of Yuva Sena, Shiv Sena’s youth wing, had alleged that Kharmate was taking bribe from truck owners to allow overloaded transport vehicles to ply under jurisdiction of Nagpur regional transport office which covers Nagpur city and Wardha district. TOI had reported this on several occasions.

Tiwari also submitted documentary evidence to Raote in a compact disc (CD) in support of his charges.

Kamptee MLA Tekchand Sawarkar through his LAQ has sought information whether the Nagpur RTO illegally accepted entry fee for allowing overloaded vehicles every month end. “It has come to fore in November 2019 in the inquiry report but why no action has been initiated so far? Despite this, controversial officer like Nayak Khan was transferred to Nagpur city,” he said. MLC Vyas too has submitted similar LAQ.

BENGALURU: Central Crime Branch (CCB) police have arrested five men for allegedly blackmailing self-proclaimed spiritual personality Vinay Guruji.

Police said Vinay’s manager Prasanth Kumar had filed a complaint on February 28 against five men who had threatened to defame the former by uploading fake videos on social media if they were not paid Rs 30 lakh.

The arrested are C Ravikumar, 48, of Banakshankari III Stage; L Muniraju alias Muni, 61, of Kengeri Satellite Town; H Murali, 34; S Manoj Kumar, 24; and R Manjunath, 40, residents of Andrahalli. While Murali and Manoj work with a website as assistants, the others are small-time realtors.

Police have recovered CDs and a pen drive containing videos from the accused. Investigations revealed the accused had visited Vinay at his ashram in Gowri Gadde last year. They got to know that politicians and influential people, including businessmen, often visited the spiritual guru to seek his blessings. They concluded such visits would translate into a huge fund flow, CCB sources said.

“Several videos of Vinay’s preachings were uploaded on social media. Murali and Manoj knew how to edit videos and synchronise them with other voices. They readied one such edited video where Vinay is seen making abusive comments. They forwarded it to his manager Prashanth and said it had been sent to a few local TV channels. The duo demanded Rs 30 lakh to delete the video and stop channels from airing it,” police said.

268,['8/03/2020'],Telangana: 6 errors in English paper stump Inter students,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: Intermediate second year students taking the English exam on Saturday were overwhelmed after they were handed out the question paper which had bloopers. Mistakes and typos were galore in about six to seven questions, leaving the students and teachers confused and clueless.

For instance, in one of the questions, the students were asked to use the phrase ‘turn to deaf year’ in a sentence when it should have been ‘turn a deaf ear.’ There is more to the error saga. In one question (No. 7), it was spelt ‘disipline’ instead of ‘discipline’. In another (No. 17), it was written ‘felicilation’ when it should have been ‘felicitation’. One question (No.5) in paper II amused the students a lot. “What was Peta-Lynn excited when she climbed into the truck,” was the question asked of the students instead of ‘why’. Another question (No. 14) lacked details and left students racking their brains.

“Some of the questions do not make any sense. Neither does any of the errors,” said Narender V, president of Telangana Recognized Junior Colleges Managements Association (TRJMA). He demanded that the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education (TSBIE) compensate the students by awarding grace marks for these abominable errors.

Reacting to the mess-up, principals and teachers said paper-setters and those working with printing question papers should be careful and ensure that question papers were error-free. “When the board is expecting students to write exams without grammatical errors and spelling mistakes, how could the board make such silly errors while preparing the question papers,” wondered G Satish, owner of a private junior college in the city. “How come the paper-setter did not know the difference between year and ear,” he sought to know.

KS Rama Rao, president, Telangana Government Junior Colleges Principals’ Association said the onus was on TSBIE. “The board should take full responsibility and grant grace marks for all the seven questions. It should also initiate action against the paper-setters and printers for their sheer negligence,” he said.

Meanwhile, commissioner and secretary, TSBIE, Syed Omer Jaleel said all those students who attempted question No. 14 would be awarded full marks as the required information was missing. He said the mistakes in the paper were unearthed just before the commencement and invigilators were alerted to orally correct these errors. “Question paper bundles were opened at 9 am. Until 9.30 am, the questions were verified by experts. Immediately, we alerted the invigilators and asked them to orally correct these errors,” said Jaleel.

HYDERABAD: As many as 16 medical shops in the city and its outskirts were sealed on Saturday for overcharging customers for masks as state drug control authorities continued their raids for the second day. Overall, 166 medical shops across the state were inspected by authorities. The hike in prices comes as a result of growing demand for N-95 masks following news of a 24-year-old software professional testing positive for Covid-19 earlier this week.

Earlier, authorities had asked medical shop owners to sell masks at MRP however many shops were found to be charging double the amount. Despite masks not falling under the category of drugs, it was decided during a multi-department meeting that shops would be sealed to check the rise in prices.

Medical shops, on their part, said that the rise in prices was due to an increased cost of procurement. They said that it was manufacturers and distributors who were profiting from this practice . “The cost of manufacturing masks has increased due to supply of raw material from Chine being cut. The rush to buy masks has led to many shopkeepers selling masks at higher prices,” health officials said.

Despite a general shortage of N-95 masks across the city, government hospitals treating suspected Covid-19 cases said they had sufficient stocks. “There is enough stock for patients. There is also no shortage of the 58 Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API)s which come from China,” said a senior drug control official.

274,['8/03/2020'],"Two days of rain damages Bareilly roads, causes traffic snarls at many city pockets","Bareilly: Two days of heavy rainfall in the city have left several roads severely damaged, with most of the prominent stretches caving in, making commuting dangerous for vehicle users.

The road connecting Shyamganj flyover to Stadium road, Choupla road, Kudeshiya flyover, City Station road, Civil Lines, among other prominent roads, have been severely affected, throwing traffic movement out of gear. Traffic in the affected areas as well as adjacent city pockets has come to a halt as significant road portions have been caved in due to heavy rainfall, waterlogging and constant movement of vehicles.

On Saturday, people were seen wading through waterlogged streets in parts of city. Almost all prominent city areas have been ridden with potholes, many of which have been posing accident risks for motorists. Local residents alleged that the situation is familiar after every rainfall and authorities concerning use temporary methods to fix the dilapidated roads which are later washed off easily.

TOI visited a few of the roads and found that while the vehicles continued to crawl on these roads, local authorities did not take up any measures to caution motorists of deep potholes by putting up signs regarding the damaged stretches.

The road connecting Shyamganj flyover with Stadium road has been severely damaged with one side of the road caving in. “The road has been waterlogged and one could not identify if there is any pothole in the road. At night, several four-wheelers were stuck in the area as a significant portion of the road caved-in. One has to ply on the damaged portion to cross the road and there is no option to escape it. Two-wheeler riders have been spotted losing balance several times,” said Tehseen, a local shopkeeper.

“It took me around an hour to reach Civil Lines from Rampur road as the road condition of Kudeshiya-Quila-Choupla-Chowki crossing is pathetic. Post rainfall, the stretch has become slushy due to the ongoing flyover construction near the main junction, while potholes have been widened, making it more dangerous to commute. The available portion of the road has become narrowed due to which, the entire stretch remains blocked, especially between 11am and 3pm. Thus, to avoid being caught in traffic, motorists are forced to take the longer route from Izzatnagar-Premnagar-Shyamganj route to reach Civil Lines,” said Prashant Singh, a commuter.

Officials, meanwhile, said that with flyover constructions underway, the existing road spaces have become narrow which has been resulting in frequent traffic snarls and the problem further aggravates as it rains. Speaking to TOI, Public Works Department executive engineer Harbansh Singh said, “We had sent a budget of Rs 120 crore for road repairing, widening and strengthening works in the division but repairs could not be taken up as funds were not received. Recently, we have got some amount and it is expected that road repairs will be taken up from April.”

Bareilly municipal commissioner Abhishek Anand said, “Work of repairing damaged city roads will be taken up shortly by various departments, including Bareilly nagar nigam, BDA, zila panchayat, among others.”

But Meena, who had just passed Class XI, insisted that they should instead purchase a cow. Now, Meena manages a modern ‘tabela’ that is home to 75 cows and buffaloes. The family not just owns a bike but also a tractor and a car!

Meena herself earns Rs one lakh a month just from 400 litres milk, most of which she pours daily at the Ode DCS, a registered society under Amul Dairy and the excess she sells at her own dairy.

“In the initial seven years, I had to struggle a lot. We had financial constraints. But I started from one cow to 15 and from then onwards there was no looking back. I kept on saving and re-investing in animal husbandry,” said 44-year-old Meena, a mother of two, who is proud to be financially independent.

Like her, 56-year-old Suvarna Patel, a resident of Shekhadi village, 35 km from Anand, too has fought several odds to become financially independent.

“After suffering paralytic attack, my husband has been bed-ridden for over a decade,” said Suvarna, who turned her fortunes from the bonus that she accumulated from pouring milk at the village level milk society.

This Patel family too had a cow and a buffalo. “From the bonus that I got by selling milk, I started increasing the number of cattle. Later, I took a ‘tabela’ on rent,” said Suvarna, who single-handedly scaled up the number of cattle to 32.

Suvarna had passed just class nine. But with her ‘desi’ business sense, she started earning Rs 3.75 lakh a month from the ‘tabela’ for which she hired a caretaker.

“Deducting all the expenses, I could save Rs 75,000 a month,” said Suvarna, who with her own savings not only got her two daughters – Archana and Alka married – but also helped her son Abhishek pursue MBA in hotel management from Brisbane, Australia.

Even as she now plans to wind up her tabela and settle with her son in Australia, this mother of three, is content with one of her daughters settled in London.

“Almost 100% in animal husbandry sector is managed by women. In certain families, the membership might have been registered in the name of a male member but actually, women are the ones who handle everything – right from taking care of the cattle to pouring milk at DCS,” said R S Sodhi, managing director of GCMMF.

276,['8/03/2020'],Periyar remark: Court reserves order on plea against Rajinikant,"Rajnikant

CHENNAI: A metropolitan magistrate court here on Saturday reserved its order on the plea moved by Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam (DVK) seeking to register FIR against actor Rajinikanth for his alleged derogatory speech against EVR Periyar. In its complaint, DVK submitted that during an anniversary event of a Tamil magazine on January 14, Rajinikanth said that at a rally in 1971 led by late Periyar, naked pictures of gods were taken out and a garland of sandals was put on the deities . The remark sparked a row and various political leaders of Tamil Nadu slammed Rajinikanth over his remark and demanded an apology. Members of DVK filed a complaint against the actor for allegedly making the remarksagainst their leader Periyar. As the city police failed to act on the complaint, the organisation approached the Madras high court seeking direction to police to register FIR and initiate appropriate action against Rajinikanth.

However, citing procedural lapse and failure to exploit other available avenues of remedy, the high court dismissed the plea as withdrawn. It also suggested that the organisation first approach the jurisdictional magistrate for relief.

In view of the same, the organisation moved the present plea before the magistrate. Admitting the plea on March 4, Rosyln Durai, metropolitan magistrate-II at Egmore, directed the city police to file a status report on the action taken on the petitioner’s complaint.

When the plea came up for hearing on Saturday, counsel for the petitioner submitted that the court need not wait for a report or a response from police as the plea has been filed under Section 156 (power of magistrate to order investigation on a compliant) of the CrPC. The court could pass orders at its discretion, the petitioner said. Recording the same, the magistrate reserved judgment.

277,['8/03/2020'],The Perennial Lieutenant,"Chennai: He was called ‘Perasiriyar’ (professor). But, more than teaching, he spent a major part of his life listening to the DMK leadership. Kalyanasundaram Anbazhagan , who died early on Saturday at 97, was the lieutenant who never tried to be commander.

Rarely a rebel, he was respected but never feared. That was probably the characteristic that ensured his longevity as No 2 in the party. Once he reconciled with the slot — after once dissenting against M Karunanidhi — he never complained of being passed over when the mantle changed hands.

After Anna’s death, when there was a struggle between V R Nedunchezhian and Karunanidhi for the top post, Anbazhagan initially refused to accept Karunanidhi as his leader, citing his own seniority. He was not unreasonable. On a poster announcing the Robinson Park meeting on September 18, 1949 to announce DMK’s formation, his name was second from the bottom of the list. The last was Karunanidhi’s. But, he accepted Karunanidhi, who had by then gained an upper hand, as leader.

Having been associated with Dravidian stalwarts E V R Periyar and C N Annadurai as a student activist, he made a name while pursuing post-graduation in Tamil at Annamalai University, in the company of Nedunchezhian and Era Chezhian. It was Karunanidhi who sought out Anbazhagan to speak at his Tamil Nadu Tamil Maanavar Peravai in Tiruvarur in 1942.

Anbazhagan was keen on entering politics soon after postgraduation, but prevailed upon by Periyar he became a reluctant lecturer at Pachaiyappa’s College before jumping into politics. Reluctance was a trait he carried on into politics.

Among the first 15 DMK members elected to the assembly in 1957, along with Anna and Karunanidhi, Anbazhagan lost the 1962 assembly election and became an MLC the same year. Elected MP from Thiruchengode in 1967, in 1971, he returned to the assembly to become minister for public health.

Discipline was something he practised more than he preached. ""He was a simple man who could speak on literature and politics with equal ease. He was an idealist, forthright in his belief and never scared of speaking his mind. He expressed his views, but firmly stood by the party’s decision,"" recalled MDMK general secretary Vaiko, who in 1964 as head of Tamil Mandram in Presidency College, invited Anbazhagan to the institution to speak on Thirukkural.

Always propagating the party line in public, Anbazhagan spoke his mind within the party. ""He called a spade a spade. He may have had differences of opinion with Kalaignar in 1967-69 and even earlier, but after he became party treasurer, the two leaders worked like twins, for almost 50 years,"" said Rajya Sabha member R S Bharathi who campaigned for Anbazhagan in the 1962 MLC election. ""The Kalaignar-Anbazhagan bond helped the party retain its identity when MGR left the party. It helped us retain our party symbol and flag when Vaiko left and filed a case. Whenever Kalaignar had a problem, Anbazhagan was the first person he asked for,"" said Bharathi.

The rapport made Anbazhagan a natural choice for general secretary when ‘Navalar’ Nedunchezhian quit the party in 1977. When the DMK came to power in 1989 after MGR’s death and the AIADMK’s split, Anbazhagan was made education minister, a portfolio he retained during 1996-2001.

When Karunanidhi’s movement and activities were slowing down, it was Anbazhagan who suggested that M K Stalin lead the party and be made working president — at the party’s general council in 2017. Stalin called him ‘Periyappa’; for others, Anbazhagan was always ‘Perasiriyar’.

279,['8/03/2020'],BS-VI vehicles rollout on track for next month in Delhi,"Automobile manufacturers have told EPCA that all car models have been verified and no delay is likely

NEW DELHI: While Delhi’s air is starting to clean up, owing to a rise in temperature and aided by sporadic spells of rain, the air quality is likely to get a further boost with the rollout of BS-VI vehicles from April 1, 2020 on track, the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) said.

In a review meeting held recently, EPCA checked the status of the roll-out with the transport departments of NCR cities, alongside the ministry of road transport and highways and vehicle manufacturer associations, stating that instructions had been issued to only register BS-VI vehicles from April 1, 2020. Experts, however, state preparations will need to be in place for upgrading the existing Pollution Under Control (PUC) and to carry out on-road testing to ensure the new vehicles meet the norms.

“A review meeting was held to ascertain the status of the roll-out and the fuel companies have told us that there will be no shortage in providing BS-VI fuel for these vehicles. SIAM and other automobile manufacturers were also present, stating that all car models have been verified and no delay is likely to occur in that regard,” said Sunita Narain, member of EPCA.

Narain said another meeting will be held once the roll-out begins to identify any problem areas in NCR. “As things stand, it appears everything will roll out just fine. If we find any problems after BS-VI vehicles are rolled out, a meeting can be held to fix that,” said Narain.

Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment said the present PUC regime will not be adequate once BS-VI is rolled out, stating that workshops were being held with different state transport departments. “BS-VI will require a different kind of focus on the ground and we need to ensure vehicles meet the on-road emission norms. For this, technologies like remote sensing and on-road diagnostic systems will need to be looked at. Our workshops are trying to focus on that,” she said.

Bhopal: It was one simple telephone call that changed the life of 72-year-old Chandra Rani Saxena for ever. Leaving aside academics, she plunged into theatre and is now going places to exhibit her creativity on stage. With degrees like BA, double MA, BEd, Chandra was all set to join PhD with a thesis on fishermen community, but after a call from Bharat Bhawan, she decided to take to the stage where her journey continues uninterrupted. Now in the world of theatre for almost 15 years, she is busy arranging for a passport preparing to leave for Singapore to take part in a prestigious project. In the meantime, she received many offers to act in movies, which she politely declined.

Life for Chandra has been full of struggle, grit and achievements. She said, “Padhai bahoot zaruri hai, warna sab bewakoof banayenge” (Education is very important, otherwise everyone will befool you).” Reflecting on her life, she said, “I was married just after clearing the tenth grade to late Mr Saxena, who retired as director of fisheries department in Bhopal. “Bahoot sharm aati thi bindi, choodiyan pehen ke college jane mein youngsters ke beech, par padhai toh karni thi. (I felt quite embarrassed going to college wearing bindi and bangles among youngsters, but I had to complete my education).”

She started her career with All India Radio and worked as an announcer for Vividh Bharti too, but it was theatre where she found her bearings. Going down the memory lane, she said, “I used to wear shirts and pants back in 70s, and a lot of young boys used to hit on her, but she always used to tell them, ‘No lift, no chance.”

Recalling her tryst with theatre, she said, “I have received several awards. I was also felicitated by the then chief minister Arjun Singh, and I still remember my last play ‘Skandagupta’, which I performed in Chandigarh where I bagged the best actor award for my role.”

Now, the 72-year-old lives in Apna Ghar, an old age home situated in Kolar road. She has two sons based in Bhopal, but she considers the old age home her ‘apna ghar’. Explaining her decision to stay at Apna Ghar, she said, “It is my decision to stay here and not with my children. I have struggled hard throughout my life to become independent, how can I depend on anyone now?”

Till now, it was used only to provide information to fishermen about the weather perils and catch information while in mid-sea. However, the improved communication device will now be two-ways, with fishermen being able to provide crucial information to security agencies on the coasts.

GEMINI is the mariner navigation and information device enabled through GAGAN and developed by Hyderabad-based Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS).

Talking to TOI, scientist at INCOIS, Nimit Kumar said: “The ocean is not used only for fishing, but for activities that may hurt our national security. Currently we have bandwidth limitation because we are using AAI satellite for the purpose. ISRO, meanwhile, is developing a satellite for us. So, when we get our own dedicated satellite we plan to provide two-way communication through this device in which the Indian boat can give distress signals to coast guard or navy. The security agency will also be able to verify about any boat that it’s Indian or not.”

According to INCOIS sources, this technology will provide digital identity to the Indian boats in the next few years. At present, the only identification mark for Indian boats is the national Tricolour, a system that has been prevalent for the last 200 years.

This digital identification will also put an end to false claims of Indian boats being captured in foreign waters, they said.

291,['8/03/2020'],Man shoots himself dead after killing2 businessmen over financial dispute,"Agra: A 42-year-old man allegedly shot himself dead after killing two men within a span of 17 hours in two separate areas in Aligarh. The accused reportedly killed himself after getting trapped in the house of his second victim on Saturday.

According to police, Mohd Salim Barni, who had been projecting himself as a lawyer in Allahabad high court, shot dead a businessman, Akram, who owned a readymade garment and shoe shop in the city under Civil Lines police jurisdiction, around 3:30 pm in lane number 2 on Friday after prayers. He then reportedly reached the house of another businessman, Swapnil Varshney, in Premier Nagar this morning around 7:30 am and shot him dead, too.

Police said the suspect had financial dispute with both the businessmen. The police added that when Barni tried to flee from Varshney’s house, the deceased’s father, Vinod, locked the automatic door of the house, trapping the suspect inside.

Unable to escape, the suspect shot himself dead, almost 17 hours after he committed the murder of Akram.

Civil Lines circle officer Anil Samaniya told TOI that preliminary probe had revealed that the suspect had a dispute of Rs 17 lakh with Varshney and Rs 5.5 lakh with Akram. He said that Barni had used a countrywide pistol for killing the duo and shooting himself. The circle officer said that while Barni had shot Akram in the head, he had pumped two bullets into Varshney’s chest.

The bodies of all the three deceased have been sent for postmortem, said the police.

The CO said that after Akram’s murder, Barni’s family was detained by the police last evening for questioning as his presence was recorded in the CCTV cameras installed in the area. Before the police could catch him, he committed second murder.

Police said, Barni had initially gone to Varshney’s shop last evening in Railway Station road, but he killed him at his house.

A case of murder has been registered and the police are trying to reconstruct the sequence of events to establish the suspect’s movements after he killed Akram.

The market price of one crate of eggs also declined from Rs 125 to Rs 95.“False rumours are being circulated in social media that coronavirus can be contracted by consuming chicken. Due to this, there has been a steep drop in the sale. Our profit margins have also dipped. Even after lowering the prices of chicken, there was no improvement in the sale figures,” said Asim Khan, Sultanpur-based poultry trader.A restaurant owner at Bijlighar crossing said that due to coronavirus scare , people have completely stopped ordering chicken dishes.“Very few customers are placing orders for chicken now. People are apprehensive of catching the virus. We have witnessed approximately 40 % decline in chicken culinary items in the last one week,” he said.When asked a resident why she stopped consuming chicken, she said, “I have always been a non-vegetarian. However, after reading reactions of celebs avoiding non-vegetarian food following the coronavirus scare, I have also decided to stop it for some time.”Meanwhile, health officials have rubbished the rumours, saying that there is no scientific evidence to show that coronavirus can be spread by eating chicken.“On the basis of rumours, people are wrongly linking coronavirus with swine flu. Majority of the people do not want to take a risk, therefore are abstaining from buying chicken and even eggs. Our teams are ensuring that standard food safety norms are followed in the sale of meat,” said Manoj Kumar Verma, designated office of food safety department said.Mukesh Kumar Vats, chief medical officer (CMO), Agra said, “COVID-19 is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. People can safely consume chicken and other non-vegetarian food, but only after boiling properly.”A Chemistry professor at Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Ajay Taneja, also opined, “Poultry products have not been found to be involved in the transmission of 2019-nCOV to humans so far in any report globally. Animals carry different types of viruses. Proper boiling of meat is very important.

The announcement was made during the 2020 Women’s Power Summit hosted by the FICCI Ladies Organization (FLO) to commemorate the International Women’s Day here on Saturday.

The initiative will be conducted in alliance with city-based Suguna Driving School, Nagaswarna Lakshminarayanaswamy of FLO said. “There is a huge demand for women cab drivers in the city. Many women passengers specifically ask for cabs with women drivers but as the city has a limited number of them, cab operators are in a fix,” she said.

The selected candidates will also be taught self-defence techniques as part of the six-month training. “We have selected the candidates and are in talks with cab operators to create job opportunities for them,” Lakshminarayanaswamy said. “Most of the companies prefer drivers who own cars. But as the candidates cannot afford to purchase vehicles, we plan to seek the assistance of industrialists and others to help them.”

The initiative will not only empower the candidates, but also help women passengers who frequently travel by cabs, she added.

The summit gave women from a diverse background a venue to share their thoughts, event chair Swathy Rohit said.

The CM said concessionaire L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad) Limited has been asked to complete the unfinished stretch of Corridor-II (JBS-Falaknuma) between MGBS and Falaknuma at the earliest.

“There were apprehensions by L&T on taking up work on the stretch as some people raised objections and even AIMIM had earlier sought change in its alignment. I assured them there will be no problem and asked them to start the work immediately,” the CM said, while replying to issues, raised by AIMIM floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi on Saturday. Earlier, Akbaruddin had sought a timeline for completion of the Metro in Old City.

KCR said he had assured the L&T officials that Akbaruddin Owaisi, Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi and MLAs of the Old City would stand with the Metro developers for completion of the project.

KCR said there was a need for another hospital near Chandrayangutta and the government had also issued orders to increase Basti Dawakhanas to 350 in the city. Refuting charges of water scarcity in areas on the other side of Musi, the CM said earlier the Old City used to get only 119 MGD water, now it has been getting 127 MGD a day.

298,['8/03/2020'],ED arrests Yes Bank promoter Rana Kapoor in DHFL money laundering case,"Rana Kapoor (file photo)

MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on early Sunday arrested Yes Bank promoter Rana Kapoor in a money laundering case related with Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd ( DHFL ) after 30 hours of questioning. They will produce him before a court around 11 am on Sunday.

The ED which continued its searches at Rana Kapoor’s Samudra Mahal residence in Worli on Saturday, is investigating whether Doit Urban Ventures, a dummy company controlled by the Yes Bank founder and two of his daughters, received Rs 600 crore as kickbacks from the scam-hit Dewan Housing Financial Corporation Ltd (DHFL) for loans worth Rs 4,450 crore granted by the bank.

ED officials stated that Yes Bank had provided a loan of Rs 3,750 crore to DHFL and another loan of Rs 750 crore to RKW Developers, a firm controlled by DHFL. When they defaulted on payment, Yes Bank did not initiate action, and the ED suspects Kapoor and two of his daughters (he has three), who are directors with Doit Urban Ventures, allegedly received kickbacks from DHFL.

The ED suspects that this amount of Rs 4,450 crore is part of the Rs 13,000 crore allegedly siphoned off by DHFL through 79 dummy companies, with Doit Urban Ventures being one of them.

ED officials, who had begun questioning Kapoor late on Friday evening, continued their interrogation till morning and around 11am on Saturday, took him to the agency’s regional office in Ballard Estate for further questioning after which they arrested him in the case around 3 am. ED officials also searched the premises of his three daughters in Mumbai and Delhi and Yes Bank headquarters at Prabhadevi.

The statements of the daughters would be recorded and financial transactions of the Kapoor family examined, officials said.

DHFL former CMD Kapil Wadhawan is also one of the promoters of RKW Developers. The ED had in January arrested Wadhawan in another money laundering case it is investigating against the late drug smuggler Iqbal Mirchi . Wadhawan is currently out on bail.

During its probe into the Mirchi case, the ED found DHFL had allegedly siphoned off around Rs 13,000 crore through dummy companies and over one lakh fictitious accounts.

ED officials said that the state-owned Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) had allegedly invested Rs 4,100 crore of its employees’ provident fund money in DHFL without taking the required approval. The agency suspects that DHFL allegedly laundered this money too through fictitious transactions. The ED has registered a separate money laundering case against DHFL and UPPCL employees.

Yes Bank was placed under a moratorium on Thursday and its board superseded, with the Reserve Bank of India capping deposit withdrawals at the bank at Rs 50,000 for every account.

299,['8/03/2020'],Karunanidhi’s ‘Perasiriyar’ was also his brother in arms,"Chennai: After Anna and Periyar, it is only Perasiriyar who has been with me to propagate Dravidian ideology. This bonding has been firm since 1944-45,"" M Karunanidhi had said at a public meeting a few years ago, referring to K Anbazhagan. His friend responded, saying, ""Karunandihi is not only a leader for Tamil Nadu, but for the entire Tamil world.""

The praise each lavished on the other has encapsulated the friendship between the two Dravidian stalwarts. Despite a few differences, it lasted till Karunanidhi’s death in August 2018. In December of the same year, Anbazhagan, despite his advanced age, was present at a function where Congress chief Sonia Gandhi unveiled the late DMK patriarch’s statue at Anna Arivalayam, the party headquarters in Chennai’s Teynampet. That was his last public appearance.

On Saturday, as leaders from far and wide and from across the political spectrum began sending condolences on Anbazhagan’s death, a video shared on a social media platform went viral. Shot during the last days of Karunanidhi at his Gopalapuram residence, it showed the former Tamil Nadu chief minister, struggling to speak coherently, asking his daughter Kanimozhi, clearly, about his ‘Perasiriyar’. His old friend, present in the throng, was shown raising a hand. As Karunanidhi acknowledges, the video fades.

Through the years, while DMK cadres have addressed him as ‘inamaana perasiriyar’, loosely translated as professor of Tamil race, Anbazhagan maintained, ""I am a human first. My name is Anbazhagan. I am Anna’s brother and a friend of Kalaignar (Karunanidhi)."" ""It is Dravidian ideology which brought Karunanidhi and Anbazhagan close to each other ... it kept them together,"" said Dravidian historian K Thirunavukkarasu. They were inseparable.

Anbazhagan, DMK spokesman Manuraj Shanmugasundaram said, had explained his more than seven decades long association with ‘Kalaignar’ Karunanidhi as one created by their mutual love for Tamil.

""The two met when Anbazhagan was a student of Annamalai University. He was sharing a stage with his mentor Anna at a public meeting where Karunanidhi was also present.""

People had come to hear Anna speak, but when his turn came, the DMK founder announced a student would address the gathering. ""Those present were impressed with the young man’s oratorical skill,"" said Shangmugasundaram.

So was Karunanidhi. ""... Both learned Dravidian ideology from Periyar and grassroots organisation skills from Anna.""

301,['8/03/2020'],Ahmedabad: ‘India needs more gender parity’,"Amitabh Kant

AHMEDABAD: Women can be key change makers to bring India closer to realizing its goal of a $5 trillion economy, according to Amitabh Kant, CEO, Niti Aayog.

Kant, delivering the 41st Vikram Sarabhai Memorial Lecture at the Ahmedabad Management Association, said gender parity in India is dismal. He said only 22% of women in India work, compared to the worldwide average of 48%.

“Reaching the world average would add over more than $700 billion to India’s economy. Thus, it is not possible to become a $5 trillion without women being equal partners in the country’ growth,” said Kant.

More women should be encouraged to take up power positions and become entrepreneurs.

Stressing the importance of startups, he said India has created the second best startup ecosystem in the world in three years.

“Startups are not merely disrupting systems, my belief is that many of them are actually finding solutions to the problems of India. So, if they are finding solutions for waste management, learning outcomes, health outcomes, they are not finding solutions for 1.3 billion people of India but for 7.5 billion people of the world,” said Kant.

One of the challenges faced by startups is that they often get into the sunset area of the industry, making it difficult for them to penetrate the global market. Sectors like electric mobility, data centres, artificial intelligence are some sunrise sectors where startups should invest and innovate, he said.

While India has a large domestic market, the real unit value comes from exports. India must have passion and commitment to penetrate global markets, especially the US markets, he said.

“It is necessary to penetrate America. Without America, it was not possible for Japan, Korea or China to become rich. That is where the real wealth is. It is important that Gujaratis, who gave a thumping welcome to US President Donald Trump recently, penetrate his country first. Without America, it will not be possible to create great wealth,” Kant said.

302,['8/03/2020'],Delhi: Riot of spring colours heralds end of winter,"The stately two-laned carriageways of Shantipath have margins of yellow and red

NEW DELHI: It’s not just the balmy days of spring that makes driving in central Delhi so pleasurable after the grating cold of winter. Everywhere you go, there’s colour of the natural sort that leaves you with a sense of well-being. In this season of renewal, the roads and the parks are lit up by flowers, by their incandescent blue, purple, pink, orange, white, yellow, maroon and red hues.

The stately two-laned carriageways of Shantipath have margins of yellow and red. Unlike in the past years when the road cleaving the diplomatic enclave was a riot of colours with various flower species chosen for the season, this year, New Delhi Municipal Council has gone for a limited palate with red and yellow coreopsis and linum, planted in wide swathes along the road and the central verge.

“We opted at the last-minute for these flowering plants instead of the multiple shades of petunia that we normally favoured. Petunias are restricted to hanging baskets this time,” said S Chellaiah, horticulture director, NDMC . “There was a mixed reaction to these changes initially, but after the plants started flowering, people have changed their opinion.”

Change of this sort has been NDMC’s agenda this year. At Talkatora Garden, the civic body shed the conventional garden architecture and decided instead on a trimmed carpet look on both sides of the ornamental fountains. “We planned in October last year to introduce new floral themes, use imported hybrid seeds and redevelop the fountains in the park,” revealed an NDMC official. Petunia has given place to salvia, verbena, tulip and pansy.

Chellaiah said, “We have given the plants a uniform size and shape. We planted them even along the walking tracks. The blooms started appearing from February-end, but we expect full flowering after a week because the weather has been uneven.”

At Nehru Park, a corner developed as a ‘valley of flower’ has become an attraction spot. Designed as a three-rimmed wheel with 21 spokes, different species makes up each distinct part of the overall composition. “Verbena, linum, pansy, dahlia, antirrhinum, aster, calendula, dianthus and other colourful flowers have made this place a selfie point for park visitors,” noted Chellaiah.

NDMC officials are also proud of their achievement at the AIIMS intersection. The public space there has been carved into multiple geometric shapes, not just with flower but seasonal foliage too. The carpet of mesembryanthemum (ice plant) is the biggest attraction there.

AHMEDABAD: A major controversy erupted on Saturday in the civic body’s headquarters in Danapith over 96 cows missing from the large AMC cattle pound in Danilimda. About a fortnight ago, based on complaints from a corporator and former mayor Amit Shah, municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra had instituted a vigilance inquiry to check the cattle pound records. During the check, the 96 cows were found missing. Sources in the cattle pound told TOI that several animals listed on the records were old and had died during the monsoon because of diseases. “There are 900 to 1,200 cattle at the Danilimda pound on an average day,” a senior AMC official said.

The issue snowballed into a political row after the opposition Congress demanded that Nehra accept a memorandum. When Nehra did not turn up, the protesters approached mayor Bijal Patel. When Patel called DyMC Arjav Shah to accept the memorandum, the former refused.

Irritated, Patel said: “I am the mayor, if the commissioner cannot be contacted, you (Shah) have to accept the memorandum. I am sending the group to the commissioner’s office lobby. Kindly take the memorandum.”

Despite the mayor’s instructions, drama continued for well over an hour with the protesters sitting outside Nehra’s office.

Shah did not turn up. Finally the memorandum was stuck outside Nehra’s office.

305,['8/03/2020'],All Indians have same DNA: Swamy,"Trichy: BJP Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy has said that the DNA of all Indians is of the same nature be they of different caste or religion. Addressing the 101st college day of National College in Trichy on Saturday, he said there was no proof of any difference between Dravidians and Aryans too.

Quoting a survey on genetics of Indians by reputed universities, he said, “All that they found is that Indians from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Jam Nagar in the west to Dibrugarh in the east all have the same DNA whether he is a scheduled caste or a Brahmin. Muslims and Hindus also have the same DNA.”

Swamy claimed that scientists had acknowledged Sanskrit to be the suitable language for coding in artificial intelligence(AI). “Storing knowledge in the computer and making robot is artificial intelligence. Scientists worked on it for years and finally published a journal that is not possible to store the knowledge in English because the computer gets confused. They came to the conclusion that the only language that is phonetically correct is Sanskrit in Devanagari,” he said adding that all languages including Tamil have Sanskrit words.

Swamy advised students to imbibe the four types of intelligence – cognitive, moral, emotional and spiritual. On the need for social intelligence, the BJP MP recalled the killing of Mahatma Gandhi by Nathuram Godse. “Godse’s killing of Mahatma Gandhi saying he was anti-Hindu actually strengthened the hands of those who were against the propagation of Hinduism. We all became very apologetic. So you have to develop social intelligence,” he said. College secretary K Raghunathan and principal R Sundararaman also spoke .

306,['8/03/2020'],Work on service roads of Periyar Nagar RoB drags on,"Trichy: One year since the Periyar Nagar Road over Bridge (RoB) at Thiruvanaikoil was opened for traffic, the authorities are yet to lay service roads for people to access the adjoining localities. It is said that resistance from a section of local people, who are upset over the delay in settling compensation for the acquired land, is delaying the work.

Sources said that a section of people, whose properties were acquired for the RoB, were not given compensation so far. They are opposing the progress of the service roads demanding immediate settlement. When contacted, a state highways department official said, “Compensation will be disbursed within this (March) month. We will complete the service roads before April 2020.”

Earlier, service roads were proposed on either end of Kumbakonathan Road arm. As a recent development, officials said that space crunch forced them to lay service road only on the left side of the Kumbakonathan Road arm. Currently, work on storm water drain is under way at the Thiruvanaikoil end of the RoB.

Though the bridge was proposed in 2011, the work started only in October 2016. After facing inordinate delays, the RoB was finally opened for traffic in June 2019 without service roads. Since then, residents of Mambalasalai, Thiruvanaikoil and Ganapathy Nagar are facing difficulties in reaching the other parts of the city without proper service roads.

Though the state highways department promised to complete the service roads before October 2019, it failed to meet the deadline. Another deadline, February 2020, set by the department was also missed. “The authorities should install safety mechanism to cordon off the pits on the road,” S Deivakumar, a resident of Thiruvanaikoil said.

308,['8/03/2020'],UP: Royal strongroom in Rampur is just empty,"The family members are now considering to start the process of retrieving valuables kept at the police treasur... Read More

RAMPUR/BAREILLY: The mysterious and much-talked about strong-room of the Khasbagh Palace in Rampur was finally opened on its seventh attempt on Saturday. But if members of the erstwhile royal family and the common people alike were expecting a concrete cave overflowing with treasures, they were in for both deep disappointment and utter surprise. There was absolutely nothing in there.

Days of preparations by teams of experts and officials ended in acute anti-climax. All it had were two large empty lockers -- eight feet high and four feet wide -- and three small lockers, four feet high and three feet wide, all of which were bereft of anything precious. They were found to be broken. Gas-cutters had been used. There were 11 trunks. These too were empty.

The shocking findings soon led to blame game among kin of the Rampur Nawab. One of them, Nawab Kazim Ali Khan, claimed that his aunt who last had the keys of the room till her death in 1993 ""replaced the items from there before her demise"" . A few others in the family alleged that the room was empty following a robbery in 1980.

Court appointed commissioner Saurabh Saxena said, “We were excited when we finally made it into the dark strong-room, but it turned out to be empty. This is a huge disappointment. All the lockers built by Chubb company and trunks had nothing in them. There is a small opening which was drilled by thieves who had entered it in 1980 on the roof.”

The room was built in 1930s by Nawab Raza Ali Khan who had acceded to India in 1949 and was survived by three wives, three sons and six daughters after his death in 1966. The government recognised the eldest of his three sons — Nawab Murtaza Ali Khan — as the sole inheritor as per the customary law. But this was challenged by his siblings, spawning a 47-year-long legal battle. In 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that the property would be divided among all family members, according to Muslim law. Apart from Khasbagh Palace which is spread across 450-acre, other properties to be divided among 18 claimants are the 200-acre Benazir Bagh Palace, Sarhari Kunda, Shahbad Bagh Palace and a private railway station -- all in Rampur.

Kazim Ali Khan, whose father Nawab Zulfiquar Ali Khan was the second son of Nawab Raza Ali Khan, said, “The strong-room used to house Basra pearls, trays filled with diamonds, emeralds, sapphires and rubies. It had a crown, carpets with stone-work, heirlooms and sword scabbards. However, we just found empty boxes of crown and necklace. Lockers in which jewelries were kept were blank and all shelves were empty.” Kazim is a former five-time MLA while his mother Begum Noor Bano is former Congress MP.

He added, “The key to the strong-room was with my aunt Begum Aftab Zamini, wife of Murtaza, till 1993 and we suspect that she shifted the items before her death. The missing jewels should be recovered from them and distributed among all the inheritors.”

Terming the allegations “disgusting”, Shehzadi Naghat Abedi, daughter of Murtaza, said, “We knew that nothing was left in the strong-room as thieves stole all valuables kept here. It was one of the biggest thefts of that time. However, as the other group was keen for this strong-room to be opened, we got it breached. The other party is in politics and they are making allegations to seek publicity.”

The family members are now considering to start the process of retrieving valuables kept at the police treasury (malkhana) for decades. After the theft in 1980, police had arrested a few accused and recovered gold alams (plates) and few other valuables and put them in the ‘malkhana’.

311,['8/03/2020'],Registration rush leaves RTA bursting at seams,"Applicants wait at a Road Transport Authority office in the city

HYDERABAD: Citizens applying for vehicle registration at Regional Transport Authority ( RTA ) offices across Greater Hyderabad region demanded that authorities set up additional counters to cater to the huge rush at the centres in the last few days.

The RTA’s are seeing a spurt in vehicle registrations as the deadline for the sales of BS-IV vehicles are round the corner.

As per the Supreme Court directive, new vehicles that have BS-IV engines cannot be registered after March 31.

Y Damodhar, a resident of Panjagutta said, “I was at Khairtabad RTO office from 11 am to 2.30 pm yesterday. There was just one counter to collect photographs of all the applicants. The authorities have not made any arrangements despite witnessing a rise in footfall.”

Another applicant Rajeev Jain said, “The RTO offices which used to stop registrations at 2 pm are now working up to 5 pm. Despite that, they are not able to handle the heavy rush. An entire day is wasted if we go to the RTO.”

During an inspection at Regional Transport Authority (RTA) office, Khairatabad, the newly appointed transport commissioner MRM Rao urged motorists to finish the process before the deadline, March 31.

Reiterating the Supreme court directive, Rao said even if the vehicle is purchased a few days before March 31, vehicles with BS-IV engines cannot be registered after March 31. He asked the motorists not to wait till the last day and get the registration done early.

“Nearly 60,000 to 1 lakh BS-IV vehicles are still pending for registration. In Khairtabad alone, nearly 1000 vehicles were registered on Friday. The only way to tackle this rush is by setting up additional counters,” said M Dayanand, general Secretary, Telangana Auto and Motor Welfare Association.

When contacted, C Ramesh, joint transport commissioner (IT) said, “We have extended the office hours to facilitate the registration of BS IV vehicles and tackle the rush. If required, we will also increase the counters in the all the offices.”

NEW DELHI: Renowned football commentator and former Delhi University professor Novy Kapadia has been diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder and has been confined to his home in west Delhi. In his ailing condition, he is also battling for his right to avail pension from the university where he worked for four decades. Kapadia is not alone — almost 300 other retired teaching and non-teaching staff of the university have been from running pillar to post to receive their pension.

Unlike in JNU, where pension was withheld as funds had not been disbursed by UGC, in DU it is stuck due to bureaucratic delay at the finance office and the other signing authorities of the institution. From the finance office, the file goes to the dean of colleges, pro vice-chancellor and the vice chancellor.

Gulshan Rai, who is over 70 years old, has been regularly making the rounds of DU for his wife, Kiran Rai, who was a political science teacher at Daulat Ram College. His wife retired in 2015. As she is 70 and cannot move around much, Rai has been going to get her file cleared.

“Last week, I saw over 500 files stuck at the university’s finance department. Since the previous finance officer retired, there has been no movement of files. It is hardly a 10-minute job but nobody is listening to us,” complained Rai.

Another former teacher, Dr Rajendra Gautam, who retired from the Hindi department two years ago, has also knocked several doors. “The pensioners are suffering a lot. We cannot fight any longer,” she said.

Taking up Kapadia’s case, the academic and executive council members have raised the issue with the vice-chancellor, Yogesh Tyagi, but there has been no redressal from that end either. “Kapadia is in need of the money right now for his treatment,. He is rightfully asking what is his and not a favour from the university,” said a teacher.

The VC did not respond to calls and messages. The finance officer could not be reached for comment on the matter.

The footfall of Indian tourists, though, has taken a beating.The number of visitors at Amber Fort and Jantar Mantar, which are generally considered as benchmarks by the tourism industry to infer a trend, show that more and more domestic tourists are skipping the monuments, while the foreign tourist visits have gone up in the past five days.On March 2, when the Italian tourist tested positive for the virus in the first report, the foreign footfalls stood at 1,222 at Amber fort and the same for domestic tourists was at 3,841.

It could be that the foreigners who had already come all the way spending so much of money did not like to miss out on visiting these monuments.

JAIPUR: At all major tourist destinations, including Jodhpur's Mehrangarh Fort and Bikaner’s Junagarh Fort, the health department has deployed teams for screening foreign tourists for Covid-19.

Moreover, foreign tourists will be screened not only at the international airport in Jaipur but also when they enter the state by buses, trains or by other means of road transport. The decision has been taken after two Italian tourists have tested positive for Covid-19 in Jaipur recently.

While giving impetus to screening of foreign tourists, the health department spotted an Italian group of two tourists who arrived in Bikaner on Saturday morning. They reached Delhi on February 24 and since then they have been travelling in Rajasthan. A team of Bikaner’s chief medical health officer spotted them at a hotel and conducted screening for Covid-19. They reached Udaipur from Delhi airport travelling in a cab. However, the health authorities claimed that they do not have any symptoms of influenza-like illness. They have plans to visit Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, and Jaipur.

“We have screened 350 foreign tourists on Saturday, who reached from different parts of the state, most them are from France, Germany and other European countries,” said a Bikaner’s health department official.

Strengthening screening for Covid-19 in the state, the health department issued orders to railways, transplant and roadways department to help in conducting screening of foreign tourists. The department has conducted more than 27,000 passengers travelled by international flights so far since January 28. Since a lot of tourists have been travelling by buses and private cabs and also by trains, the department has decided to take self-declaration from the passengers about their health and also they will be screened for Covid-19.

The 22-member Italian group had entered Rajasthan travelling by bus, which is why, they were not screened in the state. They had landed at Delhi’s airport from Italy on February 20. Two of them tested positive for Covid-19 in Jaipur, when the condition of one of those had deteriorated on February 28 in Jaipur.

322,['8/03/2020'],AAP’s Raghav Chadha blames BJP for Yes Bank crisis,"Raghav Chadha

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday slammed the BJP-led Central Government over the Yes Bank crisis , alleging that the “Centre brought Yes Bank to the brink of bankruptcy”. AAP MLA Raghav Chadha said that Yes Bank's loans grew manifold during the BJP government’s tenure. “Using the CAA, NRC and NPR issue, BJP is instigating riots in the country and diverting the attention of the people of the country from important issues. BJP does not want people to ask the Government about unemployment, banks failing and the slowdown in our economy,"" said Chadha.

BJP is neither pro-Hindu, nor pro-Muslim but “only pro its crony capitalist friends,” said Chadha. “Millions of people today are in danger of losing their life savings. People who had saved every paisa for a better future for their children, for better education, have seen their money disappear. The biggest reason behind the disappearance of savings is that Yes Bank gave loans of millions of crores to many big crony capitalists in the past five years and today they are not ready to return the money,” said Chadha.

Rubbishing Chadha’s allegations, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said AAP was using “communally worded” remarks on the Yes Bank issue. “After an assurance given by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to all depositors, it is very clear that all deposits, including that of Shri Jagannath Trust, are safe. Before making a hollow statement, Raghav Chadha should have kept this in mind,” said Kapoor.

Chadha claimed that when the BJP government came to power in 2014, the total credit given out by Yes Bank was only Rs 55,000 crore. This increased to Rs 2.4 lakh crore by 2019. He alleged that Rs 545 crore of Lord Jagannath Trust had “also been stolen by big capitalists during the tenure of BJP”.

""PMC Bank too had faced a similar fate. Of the total 51000 account holders of that bank, about 48000 account holders were Hindus, whose money was misappropriated by the BJP government. The double standard of the BJP has been exposed,” said Chadha.

He stated that RBI needs to pay only one lakh rupees to account holders when a bank goes bankrupt. “Even if an account holder has Rs 10 lakh deposited in a bank and the bank goes bust, according to RBI, the Government of India will pay a compensation of only one lakh rupees to that account holder. The customer will lose rest of the savings. People are going bankrupt in the country, they are losing trust in the banking system,” said Chadha.

This has put the corporation in a fix and affects the development of Thiruverumbur and adjacent localities as a few months back Srirangam residents had opposed setting up a borewell in their area to draw water for the Thiruverumbur water supply project fearing drop in the ground water table.

Official sources in the Trichy Corporation said that they will launch the civil work for STP at Keelakalkandarkottai soon, despite public resistance since their efforts to convince the protesting residents did not yield any result.

Back-to-back resistance within a month has disappointed the local body which is keen to implement the two projects for Thiruverumbur. “For Thiruverumbur water project, we have an alternative plan. However, a dedicated borewell for the project which is opposed by residents is the long-time solution. We will work on it,” an official source said.

“It is unfortunate to note that certain people are against a water project which could benefit fellow city residents. Elected representatives should pitch in and alleviate the fears of locals,” said S Panjabagesan, a resident of Thiruverumbur.

The shopkeepers demanded that this full-day restriction be lifted as it is adversely affecting their businesses. They want that the restriction should be for two hours in the morning and in the evening. Suresh Saini, president of the market association said, “The one-way was imposed on MI Road as the Metro construction was going on at Chandpole. At present, there is 12-hour one-way (9am to 9pm) on this road, which is severely affecting the business.”

The market association also demanded that traffic department should not allow car parking on MI Road for more than two hours. The parking at the road is free and many residents and shopkeepers of Walled City market park their vehicles at MI Road. “25% of the shops are shut down as there is no business, despite it being the city’s most prime road. Since there is no restriction on parking, people park their vehicles here the entire day and customers avoid coming here due to the absence of parking space,” he added.

The MI Road shops start from Ajmeri Gate up till Khasa Kothi, in which 400 shops are affected. The traders submitted memorandum to traffic department and Jaipur Municipal Corporation. An official source at traffic department said, changing the one-way system is not possible. “Lifting one-way from the area will disturb traffic in other areas,” said the source.

JAIPUR: City police on Saturday arrested four people with 27kg of marijuana from Gandhi Nagar railway station, Bajaj Nagar and Malviya Nagar .

They were supplying the banned substance from West Bengal to Rajasthan . The accused used long distance trains to transport marijuana.

The accused were identified as Lal Miyan, 34, Sukumar Sarkar, 40, Devgan Burman, 34 and Santosh Das, 40. While the former two were couriers and arrested from outside Gandhi Nagar railway station, the other two were receivers of the narcotics, arrested from Malviya Nagar and Bajaj Nagar. All are natives of West Bengal who had been staying in Jaipur for close to two decades.

“The accused had been in this profession for more than ten years and had set up base in posh colonies of Jaipur to avoid detection.

331,['8/03/2020'],"Delhi: Rain adds to riot woes, relief camp inmates struggle to stay upbeat","As rain drenched everything, around 800 camp cots were brought to the Eidgah camp around Friday midnight

NEW DELHI: The afternoon sun, though brief, was the most welcome sight for occupants of the relief camp at Mustafabad’s Eidgah on Saturday. When the skies cleared after two days of continuous rain, the children who had remained huddled inside their tents came out to play. Their smiles were the among the few good thing at the camp.

At the sprawling camp on Saturday, TOI saw drenched carpets, wet mattresses and complaints about the biting cold. The mattresses had been placed on cardboard sheets, but these proved no bulwark against the rainwater. Some respite came in the form of around 800 camp cots, which were brought around midnight on Friday. But there was no protection from the cold, even for the pregnant woman in her first trimester.

Shaheeda, who is taking shelter at the relief camp, sniffed and mumbled, “I caught a cold after the rains drenched the mattresses. The cardboards were of no help, but we had no alternative. I hope now that we have these cots, I will get better. The blankets we were given last night were thinner than those given to us today, so we will hopefully be warmer at night now.”

Dr Wasim Qamar, consultant at the medical tent, said, “Most of our patients are suffering from common cold and respiratory problems, some from hypertension. A few are tuberculosis patients and we have referred them to appropriate centres. After the rains, inmates have also developed fungal infection and itching.”

In a corner, some children happily clapped their hands at play, a welcome sight amid the general sense of weariness. A reading mela was under way, with volunteers helping kids to read stories and engage in fruitful activities. A guitarist performed for the youngsters, who hummed alongside.

Gulsher Khan, resident of Shiv Vihar Phase 10, rested on a folding bed. “The rain did not stop and the cardboard sheets for the mattresses got soaked. They brought the camp cots late at night,” Khan said. “With these beds, the nights have become better.” Khan lost his house in the riots and said he had nothing to return to. “I am waiting for the police to register a case and investigate who were behind the destruction of my house,” he added.

On another bed lay an 18-month-old girl. Her mother Khadija Khatoon, a resident of Shiv Vihar, recalled, “I took my children and ran up to the terrace when violence began, thinking this would keep us alive. However, a splinter hit my baby girl and she suffered a burn wound. I got it bandaged today to ward off the flies.” Asked when she would return home, she looked wan and replied, “In the current scenario, I don’t want to go back to Shiv Vihar. After the riots ended, my husband went and surveyed our house. I don’t want to go. Everyone is saying things will get better after Holi, so we are waiting and watching.”

While water seeped in and wet the mattresses laid on the ground, the tents are waterproof. However, with no walls, the inmates suffered the cold brought on by inclement weather. Despite all these deprivations, the inmates weren’t ungrateful for their good fortune in being alive and receiving government help to rebuild their lives.

337,['8/03/2020'],Coronavirus outbreak may promote India-made raw materials: Experts,"AURANGABAD: In wake of coronavirus outbreak in China, the industries in Aurangabad chiefly dependent on Chinese imports have taken a hit. However, the industry representatives say that the episode will promote India-made raw materials.According to president of Chamber of Marathwada Industries and Agriculture (CMIA) Giridhar Sanganeria, there are negatives and positives to the coronavirus outbreak. “The companies chiefly based in China or the ones that are dependent on Chinese imports like pharmaceuticals manufacturers who import bulk drugs from China are impacted. In addition, the exports are also down as containers are not coming,” Sanganeria said.He, however, said that with the virus outbreak, the industries have a chance to Indianise their raw material sourcing. “This is a big chance and our industries should jump forward to grab this opportunity,” the CMIA president said. He said that India is a self-sustained economy. “We have the ability to consume whatever we produce unlike China which only consumes 10 items of the 100 it manufactures,” Sanganeria stated.Meanwhile, the industry representatives are also worried that the virus outbreak may lead to further job cuts and increase in costs. According to president of Marathwada Association of Small Scale Industries and Agriculture (MASSIA) Dyandeo Rajale, due to the cessation in Chinese imports, there is a chance of slowdown in pharmaceutical and electronics industries in Marathwada.“The previously ordered stock is going to end and this will have multilayer impact on the industry. Apart from the hit to revenue, this would also eventually lead to slashing of manpower. If there is no raw material to manufacture, then the machines are also brought out of operation,” Rajale said.The Massia president said that the cost is also expected to rise as there will be a slowdown in production. The regional industrial bodies have advised the local industries to become self-sufficient in this situation.Sandeep Nagori of the Vibrant Business Group said that the next three months will be crucial for India to prove itself in the international market. “Earlier this week, I met with Bangladesh officials. The Vibrant Business Group is holding a meeting with a delegation from Greece and Germany on Sunday. The delegation will visit seven to eight factories and talk to us about procurements.

338,['8/03/2020'],Delhi riot victims see ray of hope as government starts verifying claims,"A team visited relief camps to learn from inmates if there was adequate supply of basic necessities

NEW DELHI: On-ground verification of the claims of the northeast Delhi riot victims began on Saturday. Led by six bureaucrats, the verification team will go through over 1,700 claims for compensation during the special two-day drive. This assessment of damage and promised recompense has given hope to people whose properties were damaged or burnt down during the communal frenzy.

Nabab Khan, 45, of Mustafabad recounted the horror of seeing his house ablaze and his family receiving threats to their lives. “I am satisfied that the verification process for financial assistance has started. I hadn’t imagined that the state government would extend such help to us to restart our life,” smiled Khan. Shahenshah, 45, of Ambika Vihar, whose residence was also damaged, similarly expressed optimism that with the government’s help, his family would resume normal life.

Other victims too appreciated these relief measures. Rajendra Srivastava of Shiv Vihar told TOI, “Fearing a risk to our lives, we left our house when rioting broke out. We returned later to find the doors had been broken down and the house burgled. We lost jewellery worth Rs 15 lakh meant for my daughter’s wedding,” said Srivastava. “I have filed the forms for compensation for the damage done to my house.”

People who have lost their homes are staying at Delhi government relief camps, where arrangements have been made for food, water, medicines, and other basic facilities. When rainfall caused flooding at the relief camp at Eidgah in Mustafabad these past two days, the government made around 800 camp cots available for the inmates. Provisions for reading and entertainment have also been made, especially to cater to the children.

“The people at the camps are satisfied with the arrangements and have appreciated the steps taken by Delhi government. Such measures have boosted their confidence and they are thinking of soon returning to their homes,” said a government official.

On Saturday, a government team visited the camps to learn from the inmates whether there was adequate supply of basic necessities. A source said, “The people expressed contentment and refuted as ‘misleading’ all messages being circulated that the conditions in the camps were not good.”

Delhi government has already given interim relief of Rs 2.2 crore to 29 families who lost their kin, 45 who suffered serious injuries and 209 people whose houses were damaged. The government wants quick disbursal of compensation and financial assistance to enable the riot-hit to get back on track as soon as possible.

“For those who are willing to go home, the state government has arranged cars for transport. People will have to go home for some time so that the officials can complete the paperwork for compensation claims in front of them,” an official explained.

He has directed district magistrate Nitish Kumar to suspend in-charge of the ‘nazarat’ and to set up an inquiry against two more officials deputed at the land acquisition office and ADM (finance) office, respectively, at that time.

Speaking with TOI, DM Kumar said a probe has been set up against all three employees and soon, a report in the matter would be sent to the government. He said the ADM (finance) has been instructed to probe the matter so that further disciplinary action can be initiated against the errant employees.

On February 26, the commissioner began his inspection by visiting the office of the nazarat, where he found the accounts register missing. The nazarat looks after the properties of the DM office. Upon questioning, nazarat in-charge Shivesh Gupta could not provide him details about earnings from various sources, including income from rents of shops along the collectorate’s boundary wall. The commissioner has directed the DM to suspend Gupta.

At the land acquisition office, Prasad found several irregularities when he examined the compensation records of the lands acquired from farmers for the proposed Sitarganj highway.

The commissioner then paid a visit to the office of ADM (finance), where he found that a plot related to a pond was sold to a private person after making changes in government records.

After coming across so many irregularities, Prasad ordered the DM to set up an inquiry against two clerks, Anil Kumar and Sherpal. Sherpal, who was at the ADM (finance) office earlier, has now been shifted to the disaster management office.

344,['8/03/2020'],Celebrating the extraordinary lives of ordinary women,"On International Women’s Day, TOI’s Khushboo Batta takes a glimpse at the extraordinary lives of ordinary women. These are the women who are around us, who inspire us and are actually us

Sweet dreams are made of this:

It was the year 1989 — the time when her batch mates were going gaga over one of the greatest hits of the time — ‘Maine Pyar Kiya’, she spent her time reading about Ram Jethmalani, one of the topmost lawyers in India. Political developments, too, kept her occupied.

She dreamt of seeing herself in a black robe, so she completed her graduation in law in 1992. Wait…1992— was also the year, when her father fixed her marriage.

Passionate to start her practice as a lawyer, 26-year-old Manju had already spent her cards on convincing her father to let her pursue law. Out of options, she agreed for the marriage.

Recalling the time how her father convinced her for the wedding, she said, imitating him, “I want you to study more Manju. But, you are growing old and it would be difficult to find a groom. We belong to a middle-class family beta, we have certain limits.” She smiles, realizing we are now in 2020 and 31 years have passed in the wink of an eye.

When asked whether she began her law practice after marriage, she said, “I tried, but soon got pregnant with my first son. Also, my husband’s family was not financially steady at that time.”

Few years passed, now she was a mother of three, with triple responsibilities and expenses. However, there was no spurt in the family income. Her husband owed a small snack shop near the bus stand. With increasing liabilities, she decided to help him in his business.

She started preparing munchies for the shop, luckily, it received a good response. Motivated, she expanded the menu. Soon, the shop got converted into a small restaurant. Now, she got her mother-in-law’s support as well.

The duo would experiment with the dishes, sometimes it worked and sometimes it was a miss. But, Manju developed a fondness for cooking. “May be I was not meant for the black robe, but I am definitely not letting go off my white coat,” she said.

Yes, she was playing on the front foot. In 2007, she opened a small catering business. More people were employed. Later, her sons also got involved in the business.

As the business started expanding, Manju roped in other women of her family. Today, she has catering tenders of various state and district-level sports academies across north and central India.

Impressed, we asked, if she still help the chefs in the kitchen. She said, “I am over 52 now. The energy is slowing down, but the passion remains intact. So, when there are too many catering orders, I am always ready with my apron.

“Also, I do not miss to follow major court judgments,” she sums it up with a smile.

The trust card

It was early 90s, India was on the verge of switching over from notepads and typewriters to computers. The transition fascinated her, so she completed her master’s course in computer applications in 1993. Her never-ending love for software had just begun.

Archana Lakhotiya started working as a software consultant. Soon, she got married, had kids, and priorities changed thick and fast. “I left the IT job as it required long hours and I wanted to give time to my children.”

But, as she believes women should not compromise their careers, she joined a school as a teacher. “I always believe a woman should never give up work. Even if it is a three-hour job, it does make a difference. Working not only broadens your vision but also helps you adapt to the changing times.”

Few years down the line, Archana’s husband wanted to start his own business, so he quit his job. Seeing his passion, Archana too wanted to contribute. And, then in 2008-2009, she left her teaching job. They together started a small plastic film unit in Mandideep.

Initially, it was little difficult, since it was a completely a new space. “But, gradually we learned”, recalls 50-year-old Archana.

Explaining how family support plays an important role in a woman’s life, she said, “It was a bit more challenging for me, because as a woman you have to look after your family and children. But, I always had my in-laws backing. They encouraged me to step out and explore the entrepreneur in me.

Today, she is heading a team of 15. “My husband and I divide the work. He manages production and promotion. And I take care of all the documentation work of the factory, including accounts, taxation and government formalities.” And, the life partners are now business partners as well.

When the going got tough, she got going

They say, the first child is the most loved one in the family…Well, it was true in her case, as Madhu herself said.

The first kid also means getting the best of everything. And that is why way back in 1962, when not all families preferred to send their daughters to school, parents of the then 5-year-old Madhu got her admitted to a convent academy. A new dress for every occasion no more surprised her, she chuckles, adding, “I was given the best always.”

Years went by, it was 1977 and time for college. Also, now Madhu was more than a first child of her parents — she was the elder sister for her six siblings. She started her graduation in arts. Within a few months, her marriage was fixed.

But, you were still studying, I asked! “I was not a single child. My father, who worked as bank manager that time, had six more kids, including five daughters. So, I could understand his responsibility and without much arguments said yes,” she recalled.

Moreover, the in-laws side was very well-settled and the groom promised her that she can pursue her studies after marriage, she added.

Her husband owned a garments showroom in the Old City Their house property stretched for hundreds of metres at Peer Gate locality. “See, I told you I always got the best,” she smiles, arranging the cushions on the sofa.

But, life is not always a bed roses. In 1984, the gas tragedy pricked her family. Her brother-in-law, who was her husband’s right-hand man and together managed the business and legal cases for him, fell ill. A few months later, he passed away.

For her husband, it was not just the right hand that he lost, but his heart, his will to work. The business suffered loss, a pending property case was reopened, which was also lost. Within years, the showroom had to be sold and her house, which was running along hundreds of metres, was reduced to a small plot.

“My hubby would not to talk to anyone, and isolated himself. It felt he lost the motivation to live,” Madhu said with a heavy voice.

I would try to make him understand, but he lost his interest in everything. Being a mother of three, I did not have any choice, but to step out of the house and take the reins of the family.

“I joined a school as a primary teacher in 1990 and took tuitions at home and simultaneously completed my studies. The income was not enough for our family of five. So I started a tailoring business. After teaching at school and tuitions, I would stitch clothes till late night. And that was my routine for the next 15-16 years,” she said, taking a deep breath.

“The earning was not handsome, but sufficient to pay for my children’s studies and marry my daughter,” she summed up with a sense of satisfaction.

345,['8/03/2020'],"HC commutes death sentence of man, who sodomised &amp; cannibalised six-year-old, to life term","Pilibhit: The Allahabad high court has commuted the death sentence of a 28-year-old Amaria resident, who had sodomised and cannibalised a six-year-old boy of his neighbourhood in 2017, to life term.

A division bench comprising Justices Pritinker Diwaker and Raj Beer Singh on Friday commuted Najeem Mian’s capital punishment — handed down by the additional sessions judge in Pilibhit on April 10, 2018 — on the ground that the convict was suffering from “non-organic psychosis” (a form of mental illness), prosecution lawyer Hemant Mishra told TOI.

On February 21, 2017, the convict kidnapped the boy, took him to an isolated place and sodomised him. Najeem Mian, then, severed and ate the boy’s body parts.

Following the crime, Amaria police arrested and booked Najeem under sections 377 (unnatural sex) and 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

Disposing of the case, the trial court handed down Najeem death sentence and slapped a financial penalty of Rs 25,000 on him for the offence punishable under section 302, rigorous imprisonment of 10 years and a fine of Rs 10,000 for the offence committed under section 377, and life imprisonment with a fine of Rs 10,000 for the offence punishable under the POCSO Act. In case of default of payments, the court ordered, Najeem would further undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years under section 302 and one year each under section 377 IPC and the POCSO Act.

In its 35-page order, the HC bench observed that there was no evidence on record to establish that the murder of the boy was pre-planned and pre-meditated as believed by the trial court, said Mishra.

Referring to an affidavit dated April 4, 2019, submitted by the Uttar Pradesh director general (medical and health) along with a medical report of a designated panel of medical officers in compliance with the HC order, the bench said the appellant was suffering from a mental illness called “unspecified non-organic psychosis”.

In September 2017, too, Najeem had undergone treatment at mental hospitals in Bareilly and Varanasi after government doctors at the Pilibhit district jail diagnosed him with mental sickness.

Taking Najeem’s medical reports in consideration, the bench commuted the capital punishment into the “life imprisonment till the end of his life without remission”, quoting a series of similar verdicts by the Supreme Court and high courts.

Mishra, meanwhile, said they would wait for the state government’s move — which was a respondent in the appeal filed before the HC. “If the government keeps mum, we will challenge the HC verdict in the apex court,” he added.

The nine-member assembly committee, formed after the northeast Delhi riots, is chaired by Aam Aadmi Party MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj . It was formed to check the spread of rumours and hate messages which often create ill-will and hatred among different communities.

Recently, the assembly committee had released an email address (DVSCommittee@delhi.gov.in) and a WhatsApp number (8950000946), urging people to report fake and incendiary messages which had the potential of triggering hatred or communal violence. All such messages, which are in violation of the IT Act and various sections of the Indian Penal Code, can put the guilty behind bars for up to three years.

The complaints received by the committee are under screening. One of the complaints is about a photoshoped image of the government advertisement regarding compensation. Some miscreant had inserted a text “only for Muslims” on the photoshopped image of the advertisement and circulated it on social media.

“After the legal experts’ opinion, the committee will forward the fake and incendiary messages to Delhi Police for lodging FIRs,” said Saurabh Bharadwaj.

A person may also be rewarded Rs 10,000 if an FIR gets registered on the basis of his/her complaint. Bharadwaj said fake and hate messages on social media were one of the biggest reasons behind flaring-up of communal violence.

The assembly panel recently held a peace meeting with religious heads and prominent people of northeast Delhi with an aim to ensure there is no repeat of violence during Holi next week.

348,['8/03/2020'],Coronavirus scare dampens Holi spirit of Dehradun markets,"DEHRADUN: The coronavirus scare seems to have dampened the Holi spirit in the markets of the state capital.Traders in most major markets in Doon say that the consumer rush is comparatively lower than earlier years attributing it to the coronavirus scare.Nafeez, who runs a shop in Paltan Bazaar , told TOI, “The demand of gulal and other Holi products has gone down considerably. People fear that the use of ‘made in China’ Holi products may lead to an outbreak of the fatal disease.”Another local trader told TOI, “It has been a week since we kept Holi stuff in our shop but only a few people have come to buy them so far. The rain spells and the fear of coronavirus have brought down our sales. Further, ongoing school examinations are also a major factor contributing to lower sales.”People fear that the use of made in China Holi products may lead to an outbreak of the fatal disease, say traders. Several social media posts which are being widely circulated state that “Chinese Holi goods are infected with the coronavirus”.“The markets do not have that much imported goods and this is a completely fake rumour. Our stock has come from Madhya Pradesh Uttar Pradesh , and Delhi. We are confident of a growth in sales after the weather gets clear,” a local businessman told TOI. The regional WHO representative has also refuted such rumours clearing that the virus does not last long on surface of objects, so it is unlikely that imported goods would be infectious.At present, face masks are enjoying greater sales than Holi products in the city. The price of Holi products that are made in India has also increased by 30-35% as people are avoiding the purchase of Chinese goods. “A packet of balloons which used to cost Rs 40 per packet earlier now cost Rs 80 per unit. Similarly, the cost of water guns have gone up from Rs 50-Rs 60 to Rs 150-Rs 200,” said a local trader.",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/coronavirus-scare-dampens-holi-spirit-for-city-markets/articleshow/74531187.cms

Of these, 24 were referred for further checks, an aviation official said on Saturday.“Among those referred for further checks were passengers who showed symptoms. They flew into India directly or indirectly from Bangladesh, Oman, Saudi Arabia , Singapore, Italy, UAE and Malaysia on Friday. Among asymptomatic passengers, a person coming from Italy via Abu Dhabi, one from Taiwan and three from Singapore were also referred,” the official said.Meanwhile, a Mahan Air flight flew into Delhi early Saturday morning with swab samples of 108 Indians and it returned to Tehran with about 200 Iranian passengers from here, the official said. These swabs are being tested for coronavirus and their results are expected in about 12 hours. Indians found corona-free will be allowed to fly back home on subsequent flights of Mahan Air and Iran Air. These two airlines have been allowed by India to fly 2,000 Indians from Iran and as many Iranians from India.While no Indian carrier flies to Iran, these two Iranian airlines fly to Delhi and Mumbai. Their flights were stopped by India on February 25 due to the spread of coronavirus epidemic in Iran. Indians stuck in Iran are mostly Shia pilgrims from Kargil. Airport operators are now figuring out which all among the 30 international airports can have separate immigration, custom counters and baggage belts for passengers from 12 corona hotspot nations — China, Iran, South Korea, Italy, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, France, Spain, UK and USA — as per health ministry directives. Delhi, which has India’s busiest airport, is doing a trial run on a few flights to work out the modalities for this.Health ministry joint secretary Sudhir Kumar had written to his counterpart in the finance ministry (department of revenue) in charge of customs, V K Shrivastava, on Friday saying: “Minister of health and family welfare (Harsh Vardhan) and other senior officers visited (Delhi’s) IGI Airport in the late night on March 5 and reviewed the preparedness with respect to universal screening of international passengers for coronavirus. It was observed that there was mixing of international passengers from 12 more vulnerable countries and passengers from other countries at immigration counter, customs clearance counter, baggage belts, etc.”Kumar’s letter further said, “There is likelihood of spread of infection from passengers coming from these 12 more vulnerable countries to passengers coming from other countries. Accordingly, it was directed that separate passage at the immigration counter, customs clearance counter and baggage belts be ensured for international passengers coming from these 12 countries. All the departments of government of India concerned are informed to take urgent steps at all the international airports in this regard.

351,['8/03/2020'],Enemy Property case: Rampur court denies Azam Khan’s police remand,"Rampur: The court of additional district and sessions judge Dhirendra Kumar Kamboj on Saturday refused to grant ten-day police remand of Samajwadi Party leader and Lok Sabha member Azam Khan, his wife and local MLA Tazeen Fatma and their son Abdullah Azam in a case of allegedly forging documents to capture land falling under the Enemy Property Act.

According to police, an FIR was filed against the three in August 2019 under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will) 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record) 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant) 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and section 3 of the Public Property Act, 1984.

Additional advocate general Vinod Diwakar, who appeared before the Rampur court from the prosecution side, said, “During the preliminary investigation, it was found that Azam Khan, his wife Tazeen Fatma and son Abdullah Azam had forged documents to capture a piece of land falling under the Enemy Property Act. An investigation is underway and further action will be taken on the basis of available evidence. However, the court denied ten-day police remand for the accused.”

The Enemy Property Act enables and regulates the appropriation of property in India owned by Pakistani nationals. The ownership in such cases is passed to the custodian for enemy property, usually a government department.

Following a complaint of local industrialist Akash Kumar Saxena, son of BJP leader and former cabinet minister Shiv Bahadur Saxena, in 2017, CM Yogi Adityanath had directed then DM to inquire into allegations that government land had been handed over to Azam Khan's trust. Later in his report, then Rampur district magistrate Shiv Sahai Awasthi said that he found 34 acres of enemy property land under the Jauhar University campus. The then DM said since the land was covered by the walls of the university, the district authorities could not attach it.

354,['8/03/2020'],"Lawyer among 4 framed for atrocities, probe ordered","Aurangabad: Inspector general of police, Aurangabad range, Ravinder Kumar Singal and Beed superintendent of police Harssh Poddar have unanimously ordered a high-level probe into a case where a lawyer and three others have been allegedly framed for atrocities by the Beed police.

In addition to this, Poddar has even removed the incumbent investigation officer and handed over the probe of the case to Gevrai sub-divisional police officer Swapnil Rathod.

“We have asked the additional superintendent of police to probe the case in a time-bound manner and submit the report. The central point of the inquiry will be to find out whether the CCTV footage submitted by the lawyer’s kin is genuine or not and match the time of the CCTV footage with the alleged incident. We will also find out if the person in the CCTV footage is the same person who has been named in the dacoity case,” Poddar told TOI.

He clarified that so far, allegations were being made only against the lawyer and that there were no complaints against the other three suspects named in the case.

ITI student Ratnadeep Tathe (22) stated in his complaint that four identifiable and two unidentified suspects waylaid him and his friend while they were passing from Savta Mali chowk on March 1 and sought Rs 25,000. When Tathe said he cannot pay, the suspects allegedly made casteist remarks and attacked him with a sword. Tathe said that he was even threatened with a firearm.

On receiving the complaint, Beed police summoned lawyer Yogesh Gavhane and three of his relatives. Despite the lawyer and his kin claiming that they were not present at the spot mentioned by Tathe at the time of the incident, police registered an offence in the wee hours of March 2 and arrested them under relevant sections of The Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Indian Arms Act. Gavhane and his kin were also slapped with charges of rioting, unlawful assembly and criminal intimidation.

After being produced before a court on March 2, the suspects were remanded in police custody for three days. Gavhane’s kin made a representation to the senior police officers, following which the higher-ups started probing the case in details.

Once the three-days’ police custody was over, the investigation officer, instead of seeking more time for probe, sought that the suspects be put in judicial custody. Beed police even failed to recover the articles with which Tathe was allegedly attacked and threatened.

Claiming that Gavhane has been framed in a false case, his relative said, “On the day of the alleged incident, Yogesh was in the court during the first half of the day. At the time of the incident, Yogesh and his child have been captured in a CCTV camera installed at a jewellery shop near his house.”

355,['8/03/2020'],"Man booked for cheating, forgery","Aurangabad: Based on the directives of the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court, the Satara area police station has registered an offence of forgery and cheating against a man who allegedly forged bank’s NOC while opting for hypothecation cancellation process at the RTO office. As per the registered offence, the man has a vehicle loan of Rs 11.89 lakh obtained from Shivaji Nagri Sahkari Bank Ltd, Paithan in Aurangabad rural.

The suspect is accused of obtaining a vehicle loan from the said bank and attempting to sell it off on the pretext of having cleared off the loan amount. However, it was found that he had not paid a single penny to the bank.

Based on a complaint lodged by 52-year old Sudhakar Shinde, the suspect has been booked on the charges of cheating and forgery.

The bank filed a criminal writ petition before the court seeking directives to the police for registration an offence after the city police failed to take cognizance of their complaints filed on September 14, 2018, and August 9, 2018, and June 12, 2019.

Representing the bank, lawyers MS Karad and SS Thombre contested that the bank had given hypothecation loan to respondent Sanjay Salve and entry of the loan amount was made in the registration certificate (RC) book of the said vehicle.

Salve made an application before the Regional Transport Office (RTO) and requested for removal of hypothecation entry from the RC book that was made in the year 2018. The man even attached a photocopy of the no-objection certificate with his application to the RTO.

In the photocopy, it was mentioned that the loan had come to an end and the contract was terminated. Not taking any chance, the RTO sent a letter to the bank to confirm authenticity of the NOC received by them.

Finding that a forged NOC of the bank has allegedly been created and submitted to the RTO office, the bank immediately reached out to the police in 2018. Police recorded the statement of the debtor and he said that he had given the vehicle to a person for use, but the man did not return the vehicle.

Through his lawyer, the suspect told the HC that he will pay an amount of Rs 1 lakh per month. Accordingly, the HC, on September 27, 2019, asked him to file an affidavit in this regard.

It was when the matter came up for hearing on February 10 this year, the HC found that not a single pie was deposited by the said person. Taking cognizance of the same, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court comprising Justice TV Nalawade and Justice MG Sewlikar issued directives, following which Satara area police station on Friday late registered an offence.

HYDERABAD: Over two months after chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao directed the officials of Telangana State Road Transport Corporation ( TSRTC ) to launch cargo and parcel services to improve its revenues, none of the government departments are giving cargo business to the road transport corporation.

TSRTC had readied about 70 of its buses for cargo and parcel services and these buses were modified at a cost of Rs 1.2 lakh each. Most of these buses are stationed at RTC depots in need of business.

While reviewing the financial condition of TSRTC on December 25, KCR had said all goods and parcel transportation of government departments will be done through TSRTC cargo and parcel service, however none of the departments have given any bulk cargo service order so far.

Instructions were also issued to all the departments to transport government goods such as distribution of books for educational institutions, transportation of lakhs of tonnes of paddy, distribution of 1 crore Bathukamma sarees to every district and gram panchayat, liquor supplies from the depots, medicine supplies to hospitals and all other goods through TSRTC. This would not only raise revenues for the road transport corporation, but would also cut down the transportation costs for other departments.

A senior official in TSRTC said they have approached various government departments, seeking cargo and parcel business. “None of the departments have said no, but none of them have given any business to the corporation. They said they will give business soon,” the official said.

Officials of various departments said the delay is due to non-issuance of government order. “The government has to issue an order directing the departments to end its contract with agencies presently supplying its material, and give entire business to TSRTC,” an official said.

Sources in the state archaeology department said they have started digging trenches near the spots where they had found brick structures in the last phase. A similar floor-like structure had been found by Archaeological Survey of India in 2016 also. This floor is believed to have been the floor of a channel that carried water from the river Vaigai into the habitation, but this cannot be confirmed till a continuous structure is found for a few metres at least.

Now the excavation has started a few feet away from the place where the previous floor-like structure was found. It has taken the archaeologists 15 days to reach the depth of 3.5 to 4 feet where two rows of bricks placed one above the other in two layers have been found. Broken pieces of pottery have also been found near this brick structure.

Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had inaugurated the sixth phase of excavation at Keeladi on February 19.

This time too, the excavation is being conducted in the land belonging to Neethiammal who had allowed the excavation in the fifth phase also.

Keeladi has already started drawing hundreds of people every day with colleges organizing excursions for students to the site. Excavation is also being undertaken at three other places, Konthagai, Aharam and Manalur in the surroundings of Keeladi.

It may be recalled that remnants of burial urns were found at Konthagai which is supposed to have been the burial site of the Keeladi civilisation.

Nagpur: Data collected by the meteorology department after conducting a thorough research on weather pattern and predictions should reach farmers so that they could take precautionary measures to avoid losses, said Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday.

He raised concerns over lack of communication among kindred departments at the inauguration of the Regional Users Meet 2020, organized by the Indian meteorology department at Vanamati, Dharampeth. The theme of the conference was ‘Weather forecast and associated services’.

Present at the programme were deputy director general of meteorology, Nagpur regional centre ML Sahu, director general of meteorological, India meteorological department, New Delhi, Mrityunjay Mohapatra, Ashish Bijwal and PK Jain.

Gadkari said, “A major problem our country is facing, which has also been underlined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is that there is lack of communication, cooperation and coordination between various departments. Information gathered after hard work and research done by the weather department does not reach the agricultural sector the way it should.”

“The objective should be to take information to the common man. This is challenging but use of social media to reach a larger demographic for the transfer of essential information will do well for the country,” he said.

Gadkari also talked about the relevance of weather forecast in sectors like agriculture and aviation, among others.

Sahu said, “The objective behind holding the meet is to give information about developments in the department of weather to stakeholders.” Disaster management sector has appreciated the timely information given by the weather department that helped prevent losses, he said.

Mohapatra said, “The seminar will be instrumental in identifying a road map for improving and assessing services and minimizing loss of life and property due to weather hazards.” He highlighted India’s prominence in weather forecasting in the world and the need to harness renewable sources of energy.

Jain stressed on the importance of management of water resources for economic growth of the country. He said, “India has the utilitarian resources but it is not being used to the optimum.”

Adding to Gadkari’s points, Bijwal said, “Every calamity affects farmers the most. Therefore, the goal should be to educate them on the latest developments in weather forecasting. Information shared by the department can be used only when it reaches the last man.”

The inaugural ceremony was followed by a number of sessions and keynote speeches.

364,['8/03/2020'],Income tax department asks ‘profit-making’ GCDA to pay Rs 13 crore as tax,"KOCHI: With the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) taking up projects like construction of apartment complex and sale of land, the income tax (I-T) department has asked the agency to pay tax. According to the I-T department, “the development agency has switched to profit-making projects and therefore should pay income tax”. GCDA will have to pay Rs 13 crore as tax .

The said sum is arrears from 2009. “It was after certain changes in the parameters which fix income tax in 2009 that GCDA came in to the ambit of income tax payers. We are negotiating with the I-T department to write-off the huge sum which they have fixed as arrears from 2009,” said GCDA chairman V Salim.

“We have changed the manner in which accounting is made so as to ensure that we don’t figure in income taxpayers list. Our officials are working on new accounting pattern,” Salim said. GCDA had been preparing its annual financial statements on the basis of “receipts and payments”. Following advice from chartered accountants, the agency is now preparing the financial statements on the basis of “income and expenditure”. Since it is following the new accounting pattern, the I-T department has exempted GCDA from paying tax for the past two years.

GCDA’s main revenue is contribution by the state government. It does not fall on income category as the amount is given for implementing development activities in the limits of GCDA.

According to the officials with GCDA, it was the projects related to real estate that resulted in the development agency figuring in income taxpayers list. The projects like construction of an apartment complex, in association with a private partner, at Kadavanthra, cage farming and laser show gave a feeling that GCDA has switched to business mode from the status of a development agency.

“Moreover, GCDA had sold out its land parcels in the past few years. Decades ago, the government had acquired land in the city for providing affordable housing to the denizens and also to arrange adequate infrastructure facilities in the city. Later, GCDA diverted from its objectives and shifted its focus to running business. This has led to the situation,” said K T Cheshire, an RTI activist.

Now, the state government has sought a report from GCDA regarding its financial status and other problems faced by the development agency. “We have sent report to the state government on our financial status. Details regarding it can’t be divulged right now,” an official with the GCDA said. There are reports that the state government is planning to intervene in the operations of GCDA. But, Salim turned down the reports that government would step in to solve the problems faced by the development agency. “We are an autonomous agency and so it is up to us to sort out the problems we face,” he said.

The students were deputed alongside heads of 40 government departments of the city’s administration a day before International Women’s Day .

Shagun Katiyar, a second-year B.Com student at MKP PG College , worked alongside district magistrate Ashish Shrivastava on Saturday. A beaming Katiyar said that she found the experience empowering. “The biggest right given to any officer is freedom of expression and this experience has empowered me to speak my mind,” she said.

Katiyar was also given a tour of the campus along with senior officials, to help her understand workings of the DM’s office. “Earlier, I had the impression that government offices are like mazes, where getting work done is extremely difficult. However, when I stepped into the shoes of the district magistrate, my perception changed completely,” Katiyar added.

The experience was as new for the staff members at the DM’s office as it was for Katiyar. They were amazed to see a young girl interacting with people and dealing with their applications.

Saturday was equally meaningful for Divyanshi Amoli, a class 9 student of Convent of Jesus and Mary school, who was designated Dehradun municipal commissioner for the day. Dehradun municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey briefed Amoli on the day’s works. Amoli held a meeting with other DMC officials at her office and also reviewed some files.

Nagpur: Leaders of non-government organizations (NGOs) and fourteen students of Frankfurt University , Germany , discussed threadbare various topics at an interactive session held at Mure Memorial Hospital, Sitabuldi, on Saturday.

They had a healthy discussion on extending social assistance, education of poor children, agriculture, health, employment and animal health, besides others.

Professor Alexandra Casperi from Germany, Tanveer Mirza (Nagpur First), Chalapati Rao (Vidarbha NGO-CSR Forum), Kshitij Ingle (Crowdera Foundation), Ruchika Singh (CICI Foundation), Nakul Agrawal (Renovatio), Shailesh Pisalkar (Bharatiya Gyanpeeth), Irshad Khan (Samadhan) and other 25 NGO leaders took part in the interactive sessions.

The discussion centred around common problems faced by the NGO leaders and various organizations. The German students got exposure to the rich cultural ethos and social life of the city.

Addressing the gathering, Casperi said supporting the needy is divine but there are some elements in NGOs which are working for profit, a practice that should be abhorred. There are also cases of noble-hearted people willing to help the persons in need but are unable to do it for want of proper information. Therefore, organizations in these fields should guide them, she said.

Observing that Nagpur has been growing by leaps and bounds, she said it will become one of the important cities in the world in the years to come. Understanding social fabric of the city is therefore of utmost importance for students from foreign countries so that they too can contribute to the development in their own way, she added.

Leaders of NGOs working in sectors like education, agriculture, health, employment, animal welfare and uplift of people shared their viewpoints and gave solutions to resolve the problems.

The motto behind holding the interaction was to enhance social culture of the city and how to develop various sectors. The participants were divided into three groups who took up various subjects for discussion to prepare a road map for enhancing the social and cultural ties.

The German students too shared their experiences and observations during their stay in the city at a group discussion.

Officials said that commercial buildings faced the most action and added that the stringent measure will continue in the coming days as the civic body has resolved to collect higher tax this year. Although the civic body will easily achieve the target of Rs 74.77 crore towards property tax, set in the current year’s budget, they are looking for higher collection. Three days ago, the civic body had crossed the Rs 70 crore mark.

“In a meeting chaired by corporation commissioner S Visakan last week, he had instructed officials to take action like disconnection of essential services to punish wilful defaulters. Since we have entered into stringent action, the response this time has been better so far. Around Rs 30 crore was collected last month and we are working to collect higher than last month,” an official said.

S Visakan said that tax collection helps the corporation to provide various basic services to residents. People should come forward to pay all the pending taxes to help the corporation to function better.

During a recent meeting convened by the department of municipal administration higher officials warned a team of officials for not showing the intent. At a time when the corporation is executing high value projects after taking loans from various agencies, higher tax collection is crucial to win the confidence of lenders, an official said.

370,['8/03/2020'],Kerala: Experts caution against move to desilt two rivers,"The district administration said the desilting and deepening of the rivers will be done by the local bodies

KOCHI: Environmental experts and scientists have cautioned against the move by the state government to desilt and deepen Periyar and Muvattupuzha rivers in Ernakulam to reduce the risk of flood. Such an exercise undertaken without scientific validation would be detrimental to the waterbodies, they said.

They said the risk of flooding cannot be reduced until natural flow of rivers is ensured by removing encroachments and obstructions. The district administration said the desilting and deepening of the rivers will be done by the local bodies. The plan is to deepen and desilt the Periyar and Muvattupuzha rivers for a length of 92km and 52km respectively.

“Silt at the riverbed is the natural breeding ground for aquatic life. Removing it will adversely affect its existence. We witnessed urban flooding in 2018 due to encroachments on wetlands and paddy fields, which function as natural flood control systems. We have to restore the natural flood control system to reduce the risk of flooding in the future. Besides, meandering rivers face pressure when huge volumes of water due to flooding forces it to flow outwards. In countries like the Netherlands, which we try to emulate, they remove the meanderings and allow the river to flow directly. But it is difficult to implement here considering high population density. What we can do is to give space to rivers naturally,” said A Biju Kumar, professor and head of department of aquatic biology, Kerala University. He said a study should be conducted to know the environment impact and the quantity of silt deposited in rivers and how the removal of silt will impact the aquatic life before starting the works.

Environmentalists felt desilting will lead to indiscriminate sand mining, which will further deteriorate the condition of the rivers.

“Though the authorities claim desilting is done to remove the silt deposited during the flood, the work will invariably lead to sand mining, which remains banned for long. People with vested interests will exploit this opportunity for sand mining on the pretext of desilting. We have removed all sand, which got accumulated in rivers in thousand years, in just 20 or 30 years. Major quantity of the said silt, deposited during the 2018 flood, contains sand. Removing the silt will negate the river restoration programme of Haritha Keralam,” said S P Ravi of Chalakudy Puzha Samrakshana Samithi.

Former chairman of biodiversity board V S Vijayan said: “Desilting more than two feet will adversely affect the rivers.”

MADURAI: It was a day of celebration as hundreds of people from five villages near Melur gathered at the Sengundu tank to mark the centuries-old traditional fishing festival on Saturday. The fish that are caught are cooked by the villagers and offered to the deity for better harvest and health in the coming years. According to custom, a few months before the festival, villagers stand on the banks of the tank near the temple of Sengundu Ayyanar, who is their family deity and offer prayers. They then release fishlings when there is a good rainfall and leave them for a few months.

Later, an announcement is made for the fishing festival, for which the villagers and their families from all villages gather near the tank to catch the fish. “The fishlings we released have grown well this year as the tank held a good amount of water. Catla, carp kendai, and other varieties were in abundance in the tank on Saturday,” said Pandi, a villager.

While some used cloth, nets, hooks and bamboo baskets to catch the fish, others caught the bigger ones with their bare hands. “After offering the fish to the deity, the catch is then shared among their friends and relatives. Villagers claimed that they have been celebrating the festival for more than 300 years, every year.

The Sengundu tank gets its water from Noobura Gangai, on top of Alagarkoil hills. The streams run through the villages of Kidaripatti and Arittapatti before flowing into the tank.

376,['8/03/2020'],"Greater Chennai Corporation intensifies crackdown on poor quality meat sales, seizes 600kg","Cattle kept in unhygienic conditions at the abattoir in Pulianthope

CHENNAI: Greater Chennai Corporation officials have swung into action and ramped up checks on unhygienic conditions in abattoirs and meat shops in the city, after a TOI report on Tuesday highlighted the filthy surroundings in which meat is cut and processed in these places.

Sources said this week alone, around 600 kg of rotten meat was seized from various meat outlets in the city.

A huge portion of the seizure came from a shop in Chintadripet on Friday where 500 kg of rotten beef was seized. The raid was carried out by food safety and corporation officials based on a tip, said sources.

A senior official said that across the 15 zones in the city, around 100 kg of spoiled meat has been seized. The meat is checked for colour, texture and odour and if found unsatisfactory, it is discarded. In suspect cases, sample of the meat is sent to the veterinary hospital in Vepery for tests. Meat that does not have the civic body’s stamp is also seized, even if it is fresh. This is because corporation officials have to put a stamp on the meat after the animal is slaughtered.

In the case of the beef shop, corporation officials said the workers in the outlet escaped as soon as they saw the officials approaching. The shop did not have a valid trade licence. The meat in the shop was found to be decayed and discarded in the Kodungaiyur dumpyard. A police complaint is likely to be filed in the case, a corporation official said.

A senior official said the Royapuram zone (under which Chintadripet falls) is always under the scanner for decaying meat as it also covers Dr MGR Chennai Central and Egmore railway stations. Huge quantities of rotten meat are sent on trains and it lands in these railway stations, the official said.

Apart from this, areas annexed to Greater Chennai Corporation in 2011 and the suburbs also have many unauthorised slaughter houses and shops which sell rotten meat.

Speaking to reporters here, Professor R Murali and convenor Aranga Gunasekharan said protests were being staged across the country against the CAA and NRC which have been passed by the Parliament. “Now, steps are being taken to oppress the voices and protests against these draconian acts.”

“CAA, NRC and NPR are not against Muslims alone, it would affect people from various sections of the society,” he said, adding that the students of universities were being attacked by the police and RSS-BJP goondas under the guise of police. “The acts of goons and Sangh parivar members who were shooting the protesting public, with the police being a silent spectator to these unlawful acts, has caused fear among the people. The transfer of the judicial officials who ask questions about these attacks is condemnable and unacceptable. The Delhi violence was a planned one, this has caused fear among the minority sections. Booking cases against human rights activists like Harsh Mandar who sought action against persons spreading hate seems to be an attempt to silence human rights activists,” they said.

The association said that the ban on national television channels which telecast the Delhi violence is the height of oppression, destroying the very basis of democracy. “Many states have passed resolution against CAA-NRC and Tamil Nadu still continues to support it, which shows that it is not taking the people’s feelings seriously,” said Murali, who added that the attempts by the Tamil Nadu government to implement them is highly condemnable. They urged the government to allocate places for the people protest peacefully and refrain from threatening the media covering these protests. “The Tamil Nadu government should not take up the NPR process and steps should be taken to ensure that the riots in Delhi should be considered a communal riots and investigated accordingly,” they said.

Tamilneyan, of Tamil Desa Makkal Katchi, M N Ravunni from Kerala, Sikkander from SDPI, among others were present.

AHMEDABAD: Pigeons in a Jaipur-bound flight at Ahmedabad airport raised serious concerns about flight safety.

Frequent bird-hits at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport have worried passengers and airline crews. For instance, a Mumbai-bound passenger at Ahmedabad airport on Saturday morning spotted a crow on the aircraft wing as she settled into her seat.

“There are a lot of birds around at the airport and on the campus. It is getting scary, especially after having learnt about the frequent bird-strike incidents at Ahmedabad airport,” said Gauri Wagenaar, a Bodakdev resident. “It is time that the authorities got their act together.”

This year, at least four bird-hits were reported at SVPI airport. In fact, according to data provided by Airports Authority of India (AAI), 37 bird-hits were reported at the airport in 2019.

SVPI airport director Manoj Gangal refused to respond to TOI’s query on whether any additional measures have been initiated to curb the bird menace at the city airport.

City airport authorities have been taking several measures to keep the birds at bay including spraying herbicides, keeping grass trimmed and trees pruned, using acoustic devices, and deploying a team of bird-chasers 24x7.

Trees would also be planted around the bund to increase the green cover.

A team of officials led by corporation commissioner S Visakan inspected the tank after a group of residents urged him to take up the oorani for development. He instructed officials from the engineering wing to develop a walking track. Visakan appealed to the residents to take care of the waterbody and protect it from pollution and dilapidation.

“The circumference of the oorani is around 150m and it can be an ideal place for morning walk. It has been deepened already to hold water. The work for laying the paver block pathway will be taken up at the earliest. The defunct borewells at the tank will be converted into a rainwater harvesting structure,” said an official.

Similarly, the Kannanendal tank, located 500m away from the oorani will also be taken up for development. Residents living around the tank have planted more than 300 tree saplings and taking care of them.

“They have been watering the saplings regularly and installed a couple of plastic tanks for this purpose. Since watering all the saplings is a cumbersome process given the vast area to cover, the commissioner has instructed us to install drip irrigation covering all the saplings,” the official added.

A couple of borewells will be sunk to create water source utilizing the Madurai East MLA fund. The MLA P Moorthy had recently assured to provide fund for drip irrigation.

Bhagat, who returned to Dehradun with CM Trivendra Singh Rawat from Gairsain where the assembly session is underway, told TOI, “In my opinion, the time is right now to work towards making a new district for the summer capital after consulting all stakeholders.” The party chief also added that he would push for carving out of the new district at the party forum as well as with the CM. Gairsain is at present a nagar panchayat and part of Chamoli district.

In Uttarakhand, the most recent example of building a new city from scratch is that of New Tehri which was developed after considerable planning of over a decade involving acquiring of land and thereafter building the infrastructure. An old-timer Tehri resident, Dinesh Doval , said, “If there is total commitment and resolve, then the new summer capital can be built in record time. To start with, the state government must start bifurcating the existing bureaucratic manpower to the Gairsain region.”

The newly established video-conferencing facility was successfully tested on Saturday in the presence of Supreme Court Justice M R Shah and NGT chairperson Justice A K Goel, said GSLSA member secretary H S Mulia.

Mulia further said that the principal bench of NGT had directed all state governments to develop such facilities in state capitals or with the concerned HCs, so that NGT litigants do not have to travel from various states to the NGT bench. Gujarat is under the jurisdiction of the Western Zone Bench in Pune. GSLSA set up the facility in the HC campus in Sola.

In a statement, the authority said, “This system shall help parties, lawyers and other stakeholders, government officials and others in the saving of time and money. As all are aware that in the present days all are afraid and worried because of the wide spread of the coronavirus. This system shall help one and all, as no one needs to travel for presenting his case and through video conferencing one can advance arguments.”

It further said, “By availing of video conferencing facility one can, without requiring his physical presence, advance oral arguments that can be heard by the NGT which will obviously save time, money and will result in expeditious disposal of cases.”

“These include the illegal stalls set up outside the market area encroaching upon the space earmarked for the housing societies nearby,” chief executive officer of PCB Amit Kumar told TOI on Saturday.

Kumar said the board would carry out an anti-encroachment drive along the stretch if granted approval during a special general body meeting of the PCB. “The PCB is firm on clearing off the illegal stalls. Since the board members failed to reach a consensus on Thursday, a resolution would be passed on the matter in the special board meeting to be held soon,” he said.

“Only 565 stall owners are authorized to operate in the Fashion Street Market. The rest are functioning without allotment letters,” he said.

The cramped lanes that lead to the market are lined by many stalls operating right outside the housing societies.

“The residents do not get space for driving or parking their vehicles because of such stalls. If someone takes objection, the stall owners respond inappropriately. I have been requesting the PCB to take cognizance of the matter and act at the earliest,” board member Atul Gaikwad said.

The residents claimed that the authorities’ approach to their deluge of complaints left a lot to be desired. “The number of unauthorized stalls in and around the market area has increased over the years. The PCB is yet to take any concrete action against them,” a resident said.

“Sadly, the measures to ensure safety of people visiting the market area is still on paper,” a senior army officer said on the condition of anonymity.

DEHRADUN: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was visibly moved on Saturday when a Dehradun woman, who is a beneficiary of government’s generic medicine scheme, praised him effusively on live TV.

Deepa Shah, 62, has benefited from the ‘ Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana ’ (PMBJP) which has lowered the treatment cost of her monthly medicines from Rs 5,000 to Rs 1,500. On Saturday, Deepa got an opportunity to interact with the PM via videoconferencing and she broke down while speaking about her hardships.

“Both me and my husband are ill. Due to the scheme initiated by you, I was able to afford the medicines easily. Now, I managed to save money to run my house more effectively and avail good food as well. Maine ishwar nahi dekha, aapko ishwar ke roop mein dekha hai. [I have not seen god but I have seen you in the form of god],” the woman told the PM after which Modi could also be seen choking with emotions.

Deepa met a paralytic attack in 2011 after which it took her almost a year to walk properly. The attack also affected her tongue and speech. She continues to stammer even nine years after the ailment. Deepa struggled for treatment costs for almost seven years and she has been taking generic medicines since 2017-18.

Responding to Deepa’s comparison of him with god, PM said that it is her own courage that helped her overcome the ailment. He also praised Deepa’s efforts of talking in front of a national audience and said, “You are talking absolutely clearly. This is ‘Devbhoomi’ and everyone gets fine here as it has divine blessings.”

The PM also said that people spread rumours about generic medicines while some consider them useless because of its reduced prices. “But I am assuring you that these generic medicines are as good as any other costly medicine available in the market and have passed all quality tests in the laboratories,” the PM added.

The PMBJP is a Central government scheme that provides generic medicines at subsidised prices.

According to the FIR lodged by Thakor’s elder brother Prakash, an autorickshaw driver, his mother is from Viramgam and Thakor used to frequent the place. “The FIR says that there he fell in love with a woman. Two or three months later, she visited Thakor’s house and told him and his family that her father is getting her married in two days,” said a police official. “Prakash called the woman’s father and escorted the woman to him.”

However, the woman’s father started calling Thakor to threaten to kidnap and kill him. On Saturday, Thakor’s younger brother called Prakash and said that their neighbour had seen three to four people kidnapping Thakor.

Indeed, women achievers from different fields continue to inspiring many, but working women still fight a daily battle against patriarchy.

“The responsibility is going to be on us naturally to stay safe. But, it’s a lot of burden. We have to constantly be on guard to prevent ourselves from being exploited. I handle a lot of male clients who are all different. We are forced to be vigilant in every interaction. But, once we assert ourselves and create our space, it gets easier,” said a business woman from Simmakkal. However, not everyone is strong or privileged enough to overcome exploitation, especially those from unorganized sectors.

“Exploitation starts with little things. Male bosses with malicious intent often question and prod at first about every minor thing like taking breaks. Then it escalates to verbal and physical abuse. Once they notice you are vulnerable, they will take advantage. I have seen many friends suffer that way and stay silent because they can’t afford to lose their job,” said a salesperson at a textile showroom on South Masi street. In schools, women teachers, especially those who are principals, have to handle a fair share of male chauvinism on a daily basis. “There is so much struggle for power. Male teachers sometimes create issues on little things to make life difficult and we have to persevere to survive. I’ve seen other women principals give up their position so that they can have less stress,” said the principal of a private school.

For many of those in the unorganized sectors, dealing with harassment and gender inequality is a way of life. “We cannot avoid the male gaze and out on the streets, you have to deal with every type of men. From police to fellow vendors, if they verbally or physically abuse, you just have to not care and carry on. Sometimes, you give it back to them or stay silent. They will leave you alone after a while,” said Rajammal K, a vegetable vendor on East Masi Street.

At the same time, many working women in both public and private organised sectors felt that after the Vishaka guidelines were introduced, women’s safety at the work place has improved. “I think men have also become wary now, especially those in many of the offices where anti-sexual harassment committees are in place. Trade unions have also made a difference as to empower women to stand up and report in case of harassment,” said Ranjani B, member of LIC working women’s sub-committee, Madurai. However, not all companies, firms and businesses have properly implemented the guidelines.

Advocate S Selva Gomathi suggested the creation of a local complaints committee for tackling sexual harassment complaints from the unorganized sector. “Like the internal complaints committee in the organized sector, people from unorganized sector can go to them. First the fear of reporting sexual harassment costing their reputation and job must be tackled. Creating awareness and making such committees approachable is the first step,” she added.

He also demanded land for construction of a Maharashtra Bhavan in the temple town.“This is my third visit to Ayodhya in 18 months and by the blessings of Lord Ram, I have become chief minister. It’s a sad day for those who claimed the Maharashtra government won’t complete 100 hours. I have parted ways with BJP, not with Hindutva. BJP is not the custodian of Hindutva,” he told reporters during his curtailed Ayodhya itinerary in which he skipped the Saryu aarti and a public event due to the coronavirus threat.The Sena leader’s visit to Ayodhya triggered an undercurrent of resentment from seers and some saffron elements who view Thackeray’s coalition with NCP and Congress as a “betrayal of the Hindu cause” as parties of these leaders had termed Lord Ram as “imaginary.”Before Thackeray arrived by road from Lucknow, the district administration put two seers and the Hindu Mahasabha president under house arrest to quell black flag demonstrations. Those interned include Mahant Raju Das of Hanumangarhi temple, Mahant Paramhans Das of Tapaswi Chawni temple and Rakesh Dutt Mishra, president of Hindu Mahasabha, said SSP, Ayodhya, Ashish Tiwari Thackeray urged the Uttar Pradesh government led by Yogi Adityanath to allot a piece of land where the Maha Vikas Aghadi government could construct a Maharashtra Bhavan for devotees from the state visiting Ayodhya.State Congress minister Sunil Kedar, who holds the animal husbandry portfolio, was also in Ayodhya, and Thackeray made his announcement in his presence. Asked if the CM had discussed the issue with his allies before making the announcement, Kedar said, “He (Uddhav Thackeray) is the chief minister of Maharashtra. He sought a plot for the people of Maharashtra and not for his partymen. Even Delhi has a Maharashtra Sadan. It will be built on the lines of Delhi.” The Congress minister also said he had visited Ayodhya along with Thackeray as a citizen and due to his faith in Lord Ram and not as a political party member.NCP state spokesperson and minister Nawab Malik also supported the CM, saying the site in Ayodhya was no more a disputed one (following SC orders). “It is a proper and reasonable demand made by CM Thackeray. It will be convenient for all communities in the state. So there is no question of opposing it,” Malik said.Talking to reporters, Thackeray said, “I came to Ayodhya in November 2018 with soil from the land of Chhatrapati Shivaji. Then the Ram temple issue was in a state of flux. In November 2019, the Supreme Court gave a historic decision and I became the chief minister. I have come here for the third time and whenever I come here, I bring good news.”On his telephonic conversation with the UP CM on Friday, he said, “I requested Yogiji to provide land for constructing Maharashtra Bhavan to accommodate Ram Bhakts.”",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74533178,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1944993,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/split-with-bjp-not-hindutva-says-uddhav-thackeray/articleshow/74533171.cms

We shall discuss this issue with the remaining panel members, take opinion of people and give our report by the month-end,” he said.

Malik said there were several issues regarding the questions to be asked for NPR. This time, a total of 21 questions would be asked as against 14 earlier. The senior NCP leader said they had expressed their reservation on the inclusion of some questions, including the date and place of birth of parents, in the NPR questionnaire.

The new sections introduced for inclusion in the NPR 2020 are Aadhaar number (voluntary), cellphone number, date and place of birth of parents, place of last residence, passport number, voter identity cards, permanent account number (PAN) and driving licence number.

CM Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday constituted the review committee headed by Sena leader and parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab.

With the announcement of local body elections throwing an uphill task in curbing illegal liquor transportation through leaky state borders, the excise department has chalked out a multi-pronged approach to contain the menace.

Vineet Brijlal, inspector general of police (IGP), for sand and excise enforcement, told STOI that they have prepared a new plan to contain NDPL menace.

The check posts that are set up to curb illegal sand transportation will now also look into illegal liquor transportation.

Apart from the 389 static check posts located mostly in border areas, as many as 100 mobile check posts will be deployed along the state border to curb illegal transportation of liquor from other states, he said. “Setting up of mobile check posts will be an integrated operation with enforcement win of excise department along with the men from local police,” Vineet said.

In view of the local body elections, the excise department is also taking steps to bind over habitual offenders who have previous history of transporting liquor from other states or running a belt shop. A surety for Rs 2 lakh will be taken from them and the money will be confiscated in case of breach of terms.

The IGP held a coordination meeting with all enforcement in-charges of excise department and police on Saturday and directed them to chalk out strategies according to their local conditions.

“As one-size fits all strategy cannot be applied at all places as there have been many local issues like arrack brewing, ganja and ID liquor apart from NDPL, we have empowered assistant commissioners and superintendents to act as per their needs. We will monitor the situation from the headquarters on a daily basis,” he said.

Two meetings were conducted with representatives of the banks -- one in Mumbai last week and second in Pune on Tuesday.

According to a senior port official, the master of the cargo ship had sent a declaration to port authorities on Friday stating that none of the 22 people on board were infected with coronavirus.

Subsequently, a senior health official from VPT went into the ship to conduct health checks after which the ship was allowed to berth, the officials informed.

However, crew members will not be allowed to disembark from the vessel.

Fortune Hero— the bulk carrier vessel— reached Visakhapatnam from China on midnight Wednesday. The vessel was carrying pet coke in bulk and had 22 crew members on board, including 17 Chinese and 5 Burmese nationals.

Although the ship had booked a berth well in advance, it was not allowed to berth as it had arrived from China within 14 days.

As per the protocol in place owing to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19), ships coming in from affected countries like China, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore would only be allowed to disembark passengers or unload cargo if the vessel has travelled for more than 15 days and all crew members are fit.

The health official who went into the ship to conduct health checks on members of the crew of Fortune Hero wore a fully-protective cover and was equipped with a thermal gun as well as other devices to test for coronavirus infection.

The official examined the people on board and certified that the people were not suffering from coronavirus. Consequently, the ship was allowed to unload cargo.

AHMEDABAD: It was an ingenious plan a la Hollywood films – a data analyst with a major firm based in Ahmedabad did not find the promotion or salary hike prospects and decided to quit. Before doing so, he worked overtime for two months and made a backdoor in the firm’s server. Two months after he left the firm, a major cyberattack took place where the majority of the firm’s data was wiped out from servers. Nobody suspected the analyst who had left the job.“But it was what we were looking for – we not only found the data breach and method, but also managed to link the incident with the person in question,” said Purvi Makwana, an Amdavadi girl now working with a Mumbai-based firm as a security analyst. “In the final year of my computer engineering, my Facebook profile was hacked. The incident put me on track to pursue it seriously.”While Hollywood films and public perception has made ‘hackers’ cool, the cyber and data security field has a minuscule representation of women ethical hackers. NCRB data for Gujarat in 2018 mentioned that there was 53% rise in overall cybercrimes where crime against women formed a significant part.Prof Debarati Halder, a city-based cyber law expert and victim counsellor, said that after frauds, crimes against women are second-most prevalent cybercrimes. “Over the years, these cases have increased. While arrest rates have increased, conviction rates are still poor,” she said. In such a scenario, can better awareness and experts offer a counterbalance?It was this idea with which Bengaluru-based Vandana Verma had founded InfoSec Girls, educating the women in cyber security and connecting them. Gujarat chapter head Namrata Brahmkshatriya said that in overall cybersecurity scenario, women ‘s representation is minuscule.“It’s lack of peers and mentors that prevents women from entering the field. There are other challenges as well – earlier it happened frequently that there would be a handful of women at security events. Assignments don’t come through because of apprehensions from the industry. But fortunately, the scenario is challenged by women today,” said Namrata, who is also leading Null Ahmedabad chapter for security enthusiasts.Abhilasha Vyas, a Vadodara-based cyber security expert, said that better awareness will result in reduction in the numbers of cybercrime victims. “I had a student in 2014 who broke down after her morphed photographs started making rounds in a few closed circles. We could identify the perpetrator but as it happens in majority of cases, the girl didn’t want to press charges,” she said. “Girls are now making slow but sure-footed progress by dispelling myths and working doubly hard to send across the message that they are as capable in this field as coding or back-end support which a majority of the women computer engineers choose.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74534178,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-429614,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hacking-to-success/articleshow/74532760.cms

All the four have one thing in common they are engineering graduates. Its not the first time that BTech graduates have passed out of short service commission from OTA but these four have struggled in their own ways to make it as officers in the army.

Annapurani V, of Andipattti, is the one who seems to have struggled the hardest to get into the Army as an officer. And she looked the happiest among the cadets celebrating after piping function during which parents pin stars of on shoulders of new officers.

“Training was not easy. I had to repeat a term because I was not upto the mark in the physical training. But, I endured and succeeded. It was possible because I was desperate to prove to my parents and all that I can achieve something in life than getting married off at a young age like all girls in my village.”

Annapurani’s father, a clerk, managed to make her study engineering at a private college in Coimbatore. But they wanted to marry her off soon after she passed out. “They said you are not going to get a job. So marry. But I was not happy. I attended the interview for short service commission (those with BTech degree need not write the exam).

Having no experience in NCC, she had to attempt the interview thrice. Once, without her parents knowing.

While Annapurani wanted to fight social mores, Naveen Udameshi B from Dharwad had always liked the uniform though he studied electrical and electronics engineering and got into a high-paying job at research centre of Mercedez Benz in Bengaluru. “The satisfaction I get here is much better,” he added. Amit Kumar Shukla, son of a farmer in Rewa, who studied computer science engineering and Ipupu Mena, a civil engineering graduate, who has become the second woman Army officer from Arunachal Pradesh, chose a career in the Army because of their love for uniform and the challenging life it offers.

403,['8/03/2020'],"Two children to get death benefits of father, as HC removes mother from claims case","Chennai: A woman who deserted her two children is unlikely to get any compensation for her husband’s death in workplace, as Madras high court directed a labour tribunal to delete her name and instead add the names of the couple’s two children in the claim application.

Justice M Dhandapani also directed the owners of the construction company, in which the deceased father was a contractor, to deposit Rs 7 lakh as interim compensation for the children.

The issue pertains to a plea moved by R Sivaprakasam and C Thirumurugan both builders for whom deceased Manikandan was working on contract basis to carry out centring work. They wanted the court to quash the charge sheet filed by the Poonamallee police charging them for offence under section 304 A (causing death by negligence) of IPC.

On November 30, 2012 during the course of employment, Manikandan got electrocuted when the iron rod which he was using accidentally touched a live electric wire.

When the plea came up for hearing, the petitioners submitted that the charge framed under Section 304-A of IPC does not stand attracted, as the ingredients for an offence to be made out under the provision is that the death should have been caused by the person by doing any rash or negligent act. The death had happened not on account of any negligent act of the petitioners, but more due to the negligence of the deceased himself, they argued.

They further submitted that in fact the wife of the deceased has deserted her two children and remarried and that they are willing to deposit Rs 5 lakh for the benefit of the future of the children on humanitarian grounds.

On inquiry by the court, it came to light that the woman has in fact deserted the children and that the elder brother of the deceased is taking care of the kids at present. The court was further informed that the woman is not pursuing a claim made under for workmen’s compensation seeking Rs 15 lakh compensation from the employers of her husband.

Recording the facts, the judge said: “True it is that the spouse of the deceased having settled in her life, had taken little efforts to take the case to its logical end. The only reason that could be attributed to her said conduct is that having received some money from the petitioner and having remarried, she might have lost interest in proceeding with the case any further. But that cannot be put against the children, who are equally entitled to the compensation due to them.”

The court then directed the labour tribunal to delete the name of the wife in the claim application and add the names of the children represented by their guardian and elder brother of their father.

405,['8/03/2020'],RIICO eyes industrialisation across Raj,"Jaipur: Away from NCR, Jaipur and divisional headquarters, there are many geographies and population concentrations that have been left out of industrial development, but armed with a land bank of 15,000 acres, competitive investment policy and supportive infrastructure, the government is stepping up efforts to spread development across the state.

RIICO managing director Ashutosh Pednekar on Thursday said the government was now thinking to develop industrial clusters closer to the population concentrations which will result in having a good spread of industrialisation throughout the state.

“One of the peculiarities is that much of the industrial development is concentrated in the NCR region, Jaipur and whatever remains is in the divisional headquarters. This is a bit of a mismatch. There is whole lot of areas, geographically and population bases, which have been left out of industrial development. Both the government and RIICO is trying to address that,” said Pednekar. The government is leaning on good infrastructure, proximity to the NCR and the recently announced investment policy to drive industrialisation deeper into the state. “Rajasthan has better connectivity and infrastructure availability and occupies 25% NCR region. Eight of the 44 Bharatmala corridors are in Rajasthan and the national gas grid that is coming up is now being laid throughout the state. We have the second largest rail network in the country. Our investment scheme is very competitive compared to other states. All these will help us spreading industrial development,” said Pednekar at a CII event.

Recently, RIICO has sent out its officials to various cities in the country to woo investors, including the Non-Resident Rajasthanis. “We are concentrating on NRRs and industrial associations representing sectors like medical devices, sports goods, ceramic, and machine tools and we have got lots of tractions,” said Pednekar.

Land allotments has seen a pick up this year but many suspect if the auction route is better. “Compared to last year, land allotments have grown by 4-5 times this year and prices don’t go up in auctions, which is contrary to general perception,” he added. Currently RIICO has 340 industrial zones with about 40,000, many of them belonging to MSME sector. These units engage 27 lakh people in state.

407,['8/03/2020'],RTDC plans to open liquor outlets at its 27 hotels,"Jaipur: Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation ( RTDC ) is working on a plan to open liquor outlets on the premises of its 27 running hotels to tide over the debt and making operations profitable. In the excise policy for 2020-21, the department has allowed the corporation to seek licences and open liquor shops.

RTDC used to retail liquor in 39 of its hotels before permission was denied in 2004. Sources in the corporation said for each outlet, RTDC needs to spend about Ra 6-7 lakh both as licence fees and creating the shop infrastructure.

“The corporation needs about Rs 1.6-1.8 crore to have shops at all its properties. I think the authorities may be facing difficulties to tie up the funds, but they will do it. It seems the immediate mandate is to help the corporation stop bleeding. But the road to profitability will take time,” an official of the corporation said.

Attempts to lease out or sell out the hotels of RTDC were made by the previous government, but it failed to take a decisive step, while allowing the corporation to go from bad to worse. But it seems there is a change in strategy under the current Congress government, said the official.

“The previous BJP government had closed some of the marketing offices of the corporation without having a plan to lease out or sell off the hotels. They wanted to make the hotels so frail financially that leasing out or selling off would remain the only option. But they could not execute their strategy, leaving the corporation in the poor financial condition,” he added.

In the state budget announced last week, the government has even sanctioned Rs 4 crore to revive and renovate four RTDC hotels. The official said this is again another move to help the hotels to offer better services and attract more tourists.

Besides carrying out tourism infrastructure development work, RTDC has two business verticals – hotels and the luxury train. While the Palace on Wheels makes money, RTDC hotels over the years have lost out to the private hotels who offer far better services at lower rates. But many say that no private hotel can match the location of the RTDC hotels.

“If these hotels are renovated and services are improved, they have the potential to compete with the private competition,” said another employee.

408,['8/03/2020'],Santanvati bhava! Blessings now go ‘gender neutral’,"Indore: In a unique way to promote gender equality, priests at some major temples of Indore have started showering blessings on newly-wed couples and pregnant women that could best be called the ‘gender neutral’ blessings.

For, the traditional 'putravati bhava' (may you be blessed with a son) is now being replaced with 'santanvati bhava' (may you be blessed with a child).

“The blessing ‘putravati bhava’ is discriminatory for a girl child and there is an urgent need to bring in required changes. The age-old social belief that a male child is must as he is the one who will keep the name of family alive, earn for it and bring it fame and glory, is still prevalent in large number of households. To end this biased thinking, spiritual and religious leaders too should play a role and bring positive changes in the society, "" priest of Khajrana Ganesh Mandir, Ashok Bhatt, told TOI.

“We are already blessing newly-wed couples and expecting women with 'santanvati bhava.' And if couples/families come after birth of male child, we bless them that they find a vadhu (bride) as well,"" said Bhatt.

“Many people approach us on daily basis with a problem of not finding a bride for their sons. The imbalanced sex-ratio is a major reason behind this. Beti nahi bachaoge to bahu kahan se laoge’ (If girl child is not saved, how will you find a bride),” Subhash Nagar Shiv Mandir priest Ravi Bhargava says he tells such people.

Bhatt said that he has also urged the authorities concerned to advise other spiritual and religious leaders to make similar efforts to bring positive changes in the society.

There are over 1600 priests serving in and around 1000 government-run temples in Indore, where thousands of people visit on daily basis to seek blessings.

“We welcome such initiatives taken by the priests as it will surely create required awareness and help in ‘Save the Girl Child Campaign,’ ” district collector Lokesh Kumar Jatav said.

Of late, district administration has taken several steps to curb illegal sex-determination tests and abortions. Recently, PCPNDT Cell claimed to have witnesses a 10 point increase in sex ratio at birth, recording female delivery rate at 943 girls/1000 boys in last calendar year.

There however is still a room for improvement, experts say .

409,['8/03/2020'],"Had judiciary been proactive, lives lost in Delhi riots could have been saved: Lokur","Justice Madan B Lokur

DEHRADUN: Madan B Lokur , who was one of the four Supreme Court judges to address a press conference in 2018 against then-CJI Dipak Misra, said on Saturday that “had the judiciary been proactive, lives lost in the recent Delhi violence could have been saved.” Lokur, who is currently a non-resident judge of the Supreme Court of Fiji , made these comments while addressing students at the Law College Dehradun, Uttaranchal University, on Saturday.

The former SC judge, while replying to a student ’s question on the role of judiciary in the context of the Delhi riots, said he had “visited the riots-affected area earlier this week and felt that the judiciary should act with urgency in such situations.” He added: “If this had happened, perhaps lives could have been saved.”

Asked to comment on the timing of Justice S Murlidhar’s transfer, just after he had pulled up Delhi Police for not taking action against those leaders who were making provocative speeches, Lokur said, “Until all the facts come out, it’s not fair to be judgemental on this. And the concerned judge has said that he doesn’t want a debate on this, so I think that it is not fair that we do it either.” On being queried about protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the judge said “there seem to be elements of discrimination in the Act.”

When a student pointed out that the Indian government has shut down internet services 95 times in the last one year and asked if this amounted to violation of freedom of speech and expression, Lokur responded by saying, “Yes I think it is. There are different ways of controlling social media. I have heard that rape videos are available on Whatsapp in Meerut for Rs 20. The government can control it. But shutting down internet is not necessarily the way.”

Expressing his views on the lacunae in the Indian judicial system that delays justice to a petitioner, Lokur said Indian courts need to be more focused on time management and cases that need immediate attention must be taken on priority.

“The judiciary needs to sit and introspect on why they haven’t done time and case-management and how this can be done now so that delays can be averted,” he added.

On the question whether he regrets doing the press conference criticising then-CJI Misra’s method of handling the SC administration and allocation of important cases for hearing, he shot back: “Why should anyone think I would be?”

In the wee hours of Wednesday, unidentified miscreants broke into the Magsons store and decamped with Rs 73,000 in cash, besides other items. The police managed to get footage from the night-vision CCTV cameras installed inside the store, which showed a person moving around the store.

Sources at the Colva police station said the footage shows a man with his face covered entering the store, and throughout the theft, he is seen conversing with someone.

Sources said the police have written to all mobile service providers to furnish the details of calls made around the Magsons store or the closest tower during the time of the theft. The details are expected on Friday.

Police sources also said two persons were seen walking together outside the store, and only one of them entered the store to commit the theft.

411,['8/03/2020'],Fraudster gets TN history wrong; HC orders his prosecution,"Chennai: Knowledge in history is a must for fraudsters, particularly those who try to benefit out of forged documents. In one such incident, lack of knowledge about the year in which Madras was rechristened as Chennai has landed a man in trouble, as he forged a legal heir certificate dated 1990 with official seal indicating Chennai when actually the rechristening happened only in 1994. Taking stock of the incident, Madras high court has ordered criminal prosecution against the fraudster besides dismissing his appeal against a civil court order.

“If the legal heirs enlisted in the forged certificate or the person who sought issuance of such certificate are alive, criminal action shall be proceeded against them, so that the issue is brought to a logical end. The criminal court concerned shall impose imprisonment and not let them go only with payment of fine. This is to signal all the fraudsters that law is strict and imprisonment is the only way to punish them for their fraudulent act,” Justice S Vaidyanathan said.

“The capital of Tamil Nadu was rechristened as Chennai from Madras only in 1994. In the legal heir certificate issued in 1990, the residential address of Gramini is mentioned as Chennai instead of Madras. Also, the seal of the tahsildar indicates Chennai though the letter head of the certificate indicates the revenue limit as taluk office, Mylapore-Triplicane, Madras 600 028. Prima facie, the certificate appears to be a forged and fabricated one,” said Justice Vaidyanathan.

The judge also refused to allow withdrawal of the case saying: “As the appellant has approached this court with unclean hands, this court is not inclined to permit him to withdraw this appeal. Moreover, the fabricated certificate will have a bearing on all the litigations connected to the case on hand, pending before various forums.”

The issue pertains to an appeal moved by U Balasubramaniyam claiming that his mother U Thirupurammal is one of the legal heirs of late R Kandasamy Gramini. In support of his claim, he produced a legal heir certificate dated June 18, 1990 issued by tahsildar, Mylapore-Triplicane taluk.

However, counsel appearing for other legal heirs of late Gramini contended that the legal heir certificate produced by Balasubramaniyam is a forged document. They claimed that while Gramini died on May 31, 1970 the certificate has been claimed to have obtained only in 1990.

A verification made with the tahsildar office also proved that the certificate was not genuine. At this point of time, the counsel for Balasubramaniyam submitted that he had advised his client not to pursue the case as there are no bonafides in this case. He sought the permission of the court to withdraw the appeal.

However, they were unsuccessfully in lifting any valuables.

A home guard Ponnusamy at the sub-temple Sri Venugopalasamy temple near the Sri Chandrasekara Swamy temple was the first one to see the broken locks of the main door and inner door at around 5.30 am on Friday.

The home guard security informed the priest Shanmugasundaram about the incident. As the information reached the executive officer (EO) of the temple, Nathiya, she also visited the temple.

Nathiya and other officials checked inside the temple to see if any of the valuable items were lifted. The officials confirmed there was nothing stolen from the temple.

Nathiya lodged a complaint with the Jeeyapuram police on Friday afternoon seeking action against the miscreants.

The burglary attempt in a centuries-old temple came as a shock to the police as the cases of idol theft across Tamil Nadu gained momentum with the arrests of several people and recoveries of the stolen valuables by the idol wing crime investigation department.

As far as the Chandrasekara Swamy temple was concerned, it was not equipped with a security guard. The temple officials said that they were waiting for the permission from the higher officials for appointing a guard in the temple. TNN

413,['8/03/2020'],State seeks former CM’s say in Lokayukta report on mining,"Panaji: The state government has sought a “written explanation” from former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar over a Goa Lokayukta report that alleged “corruption” and “criminal conspiracy” over renewal of 88 mining leases between November 2014 and January 2015.

Former mines secretary Pawan Kumar Sain and former mines director Prasanna Acharya have been asked to appear for a personal hearing.

“The government has sought a written explanation from Parsekar in the case,” chief minister Pramod Sawant told TOI.

Sain and Acharya’s hearing will be conducted by the personnel department on Monday, he said. “Based on the outcome of the hearing, the state government will act on the Lokayukta report,” Sawant said.

On January 20, Lokayukta Justice P K Misra had said that Sain and Acharya shouldn’t hold the offices held by them. He had recommended that the directorate of vigilance’s anti-corruption branch (ACB) file an FIR against Parsekar, Sain and Acharya in the lease renewal case. Misra had said that further investigations should be carried out in accordance with the law by an independent agency i.e. CBI.

“This institution is satisfied that public functionaries concerned have committed a criminal offence punishable under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, as well as the offence of criminal conspiracy as defined in Section 120A and 120B of the IPC,” Misra had observed. “They should be prosecuted in a court of law for these offences. It goes without saying that prior sanction shall be obtained from the appropriate authority before the chargesheet is filed.”

The Lokayukta had said it’s satisfied that the complaint against Parsekar, Sain and Acharya has been substantiated, and in view the magnitude of dereliction of duty, a declaration is required to be made that the public functionaries concerned should not continue to hold office.

That apart, the line of garments is also available store-in-store formats across leading multi-brand retail stores across India.“Our products are supplied across some 23 Indian cities including the metro cities as well as tier-II and tier-III markets,” she added.Revenues are always a challenge when you start out, according to Shukla. “I was overwhelmed because it wasn’t just a new market where I was trying to get visibility for my brand. So I began participating in fashion exhibitions to showcase my products. The first three years were a challenge and there where times I felt I won’t make it,” she said.“Moreover, I had my son, exactly seven months after my boutique was launched so managing the business, my health and taking care of my son all at the same time was tough, and keeping myself motivated was important. In hindsight, the entire effort really feels worth it.”Shukla is also the recipient of Enterprise Icons - SME Women Entrepreneur of The Year, in 2018.Being at the helm and slaying it!Dhruti Pansara, CFO, Gold Star PowerSoon after completing her MBA in 2007 in Jamnagar, Dhruti Pansara got married. Little did she know that within a few years she would be handling financial matters of the company founded by her father-in-law. This young and dynamic chief financial officer (CFO) of Gold Star Power Ltd has seen the battery making company grow in leaps and bounds under her leadership.“I studied finance, but I had no practical knowledge. My father-in-law and my husband encouraged me to join our family business. Soon I learnt the tricks of the trade and started managing all the financials of the company. I was promoted to the post of CFO in a short period of time,” said Dhruti, who also handles production control along with her husband and brother-in-law.When she joined the company, it had a turnover of Rs 12 crore, which is now going to be Rs 50 crore by fiscal 2020.“We have seen many ups and down in the last one decade. We used to do job work for other companies, but thereafter we developed our own brand and promoted it in the domestic and overseas markets. This financial year we are exporting 50% of our production,” she said. The company not only grew in India but also opened its manufacturing unit in Uganda six years ago.Dhruti is handling the company and also taking care of her two sons, Dhairya, 10, and Arya, 6.“Dhruti’s role is very crucial in the growth of the business. It’s better for the growth of the company to get a helping hand within the family,” said her husband Navneet Pansara. The company, under the leadership of Dhruti also got listed in BSE SME exchange in 2017.Empowering others, age no bar!Meghna Shah, founder, CrissCross LingoLearning a foreign language adds a niche to one’s professional expertise and with increased globalization, it is almost becoming imperative to know one. But learning a foreign language can be empowering for many at individual level – who barely got a chance to step out of the cocoon. Ahmedabad-based entrepreneur, Meghna Shah, is using foreign language to empower others, especially women.“I’ve been teaching French language for the past 15 years and over the years, I have taught the language not just to students, youngsters and professionals across the board but also to a lot of homemakers and elderly people too. I realized how confident it makes them and, in many cases, it also helped them grow professionally. That’s when I thought of starting a centre where people can learn foreign languages age no bar,” said Shah, who founded Criss-cross Lingo last year, with her personal savings.“I believe that no dream is small and unrealistic, and age shouldn't be a barrier for achieving those dreams. We have been teaching all major foreign languages including English, for people for 3.5 years. In fact, we have professionals from various spheres who want to learn foreign languages to pursue their interest in foreign literature or for being able to do better at their business too,” said Shah, whose firm has not just collaborated with some corporates in Ahmedabad but has also been teaching university students.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/queens-at-the-helm-carving-their-path/articleshow/74532799.cms

NEW DELHI: Three people have been arrested by the Crime Branch in connection with the riots in Chand Bagh recently. IB official Ankit Sharma was also killed in the same area.

Police said the trio were earlier taken into custody after details emerged from the questioning of suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain .

The accused have been identified as father-son duo of Liaqat and Risayat, and Tareek Rizwi. Police sources claimed that Liaqat and Risayat were involved in pelting stones from their neighbour Hussain’s roof. Rizwi, who is Hussain’s manager, had given shelter to the AAP councillor in his house in Zakir Nagar.

Police said Rizwi will be questioned about the duration of Hussain’s stay in his house and also why he gave shelter to the councillor despite knowing that police were searching for him. Whether he provided any aid to him for communicating with his lawyers will also be probed.

A team of officers, meanwhile, recovered the licensed pistol of Hussain, along with 24 cartridges from his house, said a source. He had switched off his phone on February 27 and later brought a new SIM card to communicate with his lawyers, the source added.

A team of Crime Branch officials also reached Chand Bagh to look for more videos and CCTV footage. The officers asked people to share videos available on their mobile phones or if they knew anyone who had recorded the videos.

Apart from recording a video while violence continued from his building, Hussain also apparently made calls to the police control room and to the senior police officers. Investigating officials claimed that it was a desperate bid to create an alibi and defence for himself. “Even during questioning, he is only narrating things in his defence. He broke down a few times while being questioned,” an officer added.

More arrests are expected to be made on Sunday.

Meanwhile, another team of Crime Branch officials visited the spot where constable Ratan Lal was shot dead and two other senior officers were injured during the riots. A team of officers also met the family of Parwaiz and Vinod who died in the violence. Police spoke to their families to ascertain the sequence of events that led to their death.

417,['8/03/2020'],Remembering the women of the Forgotten Army in Bengaluru,"INA veteran Datuk Rasammah Boopalan recounts her experience in the film At the Altar of India’s Freedom

BENGALURU: One sign in texts that students of history would do well to ponder over is the asterisk. Also known as the footnote, it sometimes points to a completely different story or perspective, even a watershed moment. Or it could rekindle memories of a lost chapter.

Last Sunday, the Mythic Society in Bengaluru hosted an event that sparked thoughts on the need to chronicle rarely-visited episodes of Indian history. One of the films screened at the event was Choodie Shivaram’s “At the Altar of India’s Freedom: INA Veterans of Malaysia”, which chronicles the struggles of the INA war veterans of Malaysia.

Choodie Shivaram’s film evidently left a few members of the audience moist-eyed, even if it mainly records memories of some veterans like N Sundaram, Seethapathi, Datuk Rasammah Boopalan and Meenachi. They talk about their training, the ignited spirit of patriotism and their admiration for Netaji Bose. The presence of women who formed the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, one of the first all-woman combat regiments in the world, was a feature of that struggle.

In the season of Kabir Khan’s web series, “The Forgotten Army”, the story of the INA is bound to have gathered renewed and popular interest. A freelance journalist and researcher, Choodie spent five years studying the Indian National Army and military operations in Southeast Asia during the World War II. She then chanced upon references to role of Malaysian veterans and sought to record their impressions. Of particular interest to her were the women. What struck her most about these women, she says, was their fearless determination to liberate India, a country they had never seen; even at the cost of laying down their lives. “They were all teenagers just about 15 or 16. I’m baffled at the courage of their mothers to send their daughters to war; not sure of whether they would come back, unmindful of the injuries they may encounter. There were a number of families where three daughters together joined INA – the Penang sisters, Rasammah Boopalan, so many of them. It was single-minded devotion to free India and unflinching faith in Netaji whom they saw as God that inspired these people to join INA. They had suffered at the hands of British occupation and knew what their brethren in India were experiencing.”

If that was an instance of the influence of patriotism going well beyond boundaries and individual concerns, it was also was a story of women’s freedom and choices. “In an age of super connectivity and enhanced security, we make headlines about women’s empowerment now, of equality and rights. In 1944 these women were empowered, there was no gender discrimination; the women empowered themselves. And look at the families, how progressive they were, way ahead of their times, allowing their daughters to train for military service and go to war. And it was no ordinary war, it was WW II,” she says. When these women returned from the battlefront, they continued to put considerations of service before self. Many of them were engaged in community projects and causes for social welfare. Rasammah, a teacher and social activist, was to later fight for equal pay for women teachers, apart from playing a big role in the anti-drug abuse movement.

Recording these oral histories was only one part of the job. The film-maker says she had the footage for almost a year and “no one wanted to produce it”, until the Indian High Commission of Malaysia stepped in to help.

Talking of constructing collective memory, presenting events as they are is critical. Daily news is often referred to as history of the present. But there’s no denying that an event in the present works as a reference point in a distant future. Not too different from how archivists, historians, researchers and bloggers peer through the rear-view mirror to collect memories and experiences. Just the way remembering the forgotten army can serve as a metaphor.

Shakuntala Singh

At 68, she can give many 20-year-olds a run for their money, when it comes to fitness and zest for life. It is heartening to see her friends (aged anything between 4 to 84) seeking her advice on all kinds of issues, from school woes to boyfriend troubles and old age dilemmas. With a smile, yogacharya Shakuntala Singh hugs even the strangers, showering them with unconditional love and sharing tips of staying healthy with yoga. Her early morning classes near Bawadia Kalan overbridge, are attended by people of all age groups. “When I see people in physical pain or mental agony, I can't help but reach out to them. And when I manage to bring a smile on their faces, I feel empowered as a woman,"" she says with a twinkle in her eyes. According to Singh, it is not mandatory to reserve certain hours of the day for yourself to stay happy. “My experience says, happiness is about your thought process and empowerment lies in strengthening others while improving yourself.” Fitness for her is an important way to keep herself grounded and healthy. ""Healthy body is the home to happy thoughts and that is what I have been practising for decades. Sometimes, we allow outside world to overshadow our inner core; that is when we start becoming weak. We have to fight this to slay the demons of negativity; age must not allow you from staying healthy or living a new dream.""

Mark your presence

Pankaja Mayande

Her petite frame belies the grit and gumption that lies beneath. After teaching in a convent for almost two decades, Pankaja Mayande, decided to quit her job three years ago to give a fillip to one of her biggest passions- dimishing the use of single-use plastic from Bhopal. “Swachhta Mission started almost five years ago, but in my home, we stopped using plastic more than 20 years ago. Whether it was a wedding or a party, we always abstained from using it. But three years ago, some of the like-minded people joined hands and we started a free bartan bank, which is now supported by government too.” Pankaja has mastered the art of balance, with mornings dedicated to her fight against plastic and evenings reserved for her coaching classes, and time-in-between is devoted to her joint family. Ask her if trapezing around so many arenas, make her feel exploited at times and pat comes to reply, ""On the contrary, whenever I finish a job well, I feel as if I have marked my presence on that particular day."" And what is her mantra to stay happy and empowered throughout? ""To try and spread your wings as far as possible, without trampling on others. In this mission, you have to take others along; it can never be a solitary effort achieved in isolation.”

419,['8/03/2020'],"Coronavirus in Delhi: SDMC to get 30,000 masks for its health staff","NEW DELHI: The novel coronavirus scare has triggered flash purchase of masks by common people, leading to a shortage of the product in the market. To keep the supply chain intact for healthcare workers, South Delhi Municipal Corporation ( SDMC ) has decided to buy and supply 30,000 masks to its frontline workers, a senior official said on Saturday.Not only the masks are not available in the open market at the government-mandated rates, but “our supplier has also said it’s not available in his inventory”, the official said. “Doctors and healthcare workers will need these masks and the Centre will have to impose regulatory control on manufacturers and suppliers to help healthcare staff,” he added.The prices have skyrocketed even in the wholesale surgical equipment market in Bhagirath Palace near Chandni Chowk. Ordinary surgical masks, which were earlier available for Re 1 per unit, are selling at Rs 20-30. A few days ago, doctors at Safdarjung Hospital — which is one of the nodal points in Delhi for isolating patients infected by novel coronavirus — had threatened to boycott work due to non-supply of face masks. However, all doctors and healthcare staff dealing directly with the suspected/infected people have the full protection gear as recommended by the World Health Organization.If the virus spreads , the civic bodies will be expected to start community clustering and mapping to track and identify people who may have been exposed to the infected people. “Indigenous transmission from people arriving to the local community will then have to be monitored,” an official said.At the community level, the civic bodies will have to scan a 2-3km cluster around an infected person and find out people displaying any sign of Covid-19 in terms of fever/lung infections/shortness of breath/cough so that they can be isolated, another official explained.If required, domestic breeding checkers, nurses and other field workers are expected to be roped in, who will also need protective gear such as masks and gloves, he added.Tagging multiple authorities, Sanjay Bhargav of the Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal tweeted, “Traders of surgical equipment and medicines are cheating and charging exorbitant rates for masks and sanitisers. While a mask that used to cost Rs 80 five days ago is sold for Rs 180, a bundle of ordinary masks costs Rs 1,000 instead of the usual Rs 200. Sanitisers with a price tag of Rs 220 is being sold for Rs 500. The government should intervene immediately and stop this blackmarketeering.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74533229,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-117710,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-to-get-30k-masks-for-its-health-staff/articleshow/74532766.cms

Mangaluru: Deputy chief minister C N Ashwath Narayan exhorted journalists not to give undue importance to political reporting, in that it does not help the common man beyond a point. Political reportage is wrapped in grandiose sloganeering that does not translate into any tangible benefit for the common man and even politicians in their effort to be ‘politically right’ and give sound bites, that does not help the society much, he said.

He was speaking after inaugurating the 35th state journalists conference under the aegis of Karnataka Union of Working Journalists , here on Saturday. He admitted that juicy political developments tend to catch eyeballs, and few easily relate to the same. “But how does this help society?” he questioned, exhorting the media to develop a tendency to question those in power.

“No one in a democracy should be beyond questioning,” he said.

Espousing the state government’s commitment to the media to help them discharge their duties more effectively, he said the government is ready to give all the necessary technical help to the media in this regard. “The government will consider any proposal that KUWJ has for the welfare of the journalists in the state,” he said, adding he will personally take up these proposals with chief minister B S Yediyurappa, who also holds the finance portfolio.

Admitting that the media is working in an environment where it is yielding to market dynamics, he said the media perhaps would have been better off independent of such dyanmics, that would have allowed it to be a voice of the masses.

While a lot of good is happening in society along with the bad, only the latter tends to get highlighted, he said, exhorting journalists to uphold values and ethics in these challenging times.

Sandhya S Pai, managing editor, ‘Taragna’, in her keynote address, said that journalism should be a religion rather than a industry, and become the voice for issues of the country.

While the decline in readership of both periodicals and dailies is a cause for concern, she said it is in such times that media houses must collaborate while competing ,and not exult at the demise of a rival publication. There is place for all publications even amidst competition, she said.

D Veerendra Heggade, dharmadhikari, Sri Kshetra Dharmasthala said discerning quality in readers and viewers has only increased the responsibility of media houses in what they report.

The guests that included minister Kota Shrinivas Poojari, honoured the host association, DKWJU, for being the best district association in the state. The ministers also inaugurated a photo and cartoon exhibition on the occasion. Shivanand Tagadoor, president of KUWJ, welcomed the gathering. MLAs Vedavyas Kamath, U T Khader, Y Bharath Shetty, mayor Divakar, deputy mayor Vedavathi and office-bearers of KUWJ were present.

421,['8/03/2020'],Rakesh Asthana: Court accepts CBI clean chit to Rakesh Asthana,"NEW DELHI: A special CBI court on Saturday took cognizance of a chargesheet filed recently in a bribery case wherein former special director of the agency Rakesh Asthana was given a clean chit.

Special judge Sanjeev Aggarwal observed that sufficient ground was not there to proceed against Asthana and CBI’s DSP Devender Kumar , who was arrested in 2018 and granted bail later.

Alleged middleman Manoj Prasad, who was charged in the case, his brother Someshwar Srivastava and father-in-law Sunil Mittal were, however, summoned on April 13.

Names of Srivastava and Mittal had cropped up during the investigation.

As a result, the court took cognizance of the chargesheet filed under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating) and 385 (extortion) of IPC and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

CBI in its chargesheet said that there was no connection between Asthana and Manoj Prasad, and no evidence to prove that Asthana ever demanded or received a bribe to save Hyderabad-based businessman Satish Babu Sana in a money laundering case related to meat exporter Moin Qureshi .

In the last hearing, a war of words had broken out between two investigating officers (IOs), current and former. While former IO A K Bassi accused current IO Satish Dagar of shielding “big names” despite clinching evidence, the latter retorted, claiming that he had asked the former to join and assist in the probe six times but he had refused.

On October 25, 2018, Asthana was booked by then CBI director Alok Verma for criminal conspiracy, corruption and criminal misconduct under relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act on a complaint filed by Sana, who was being probed by Asthana as part of an investigation into money laundering by Moin Qureshi.

But among these – literally – pivotal men on tracks stands out a woman in Karnataka — gangwoman Sonam Wasnik. Posted on the tracks of KSR Bengaluru City railway station under the South Western Railway since November 2016, Wasnik does the hard-job of fixing and maintaining the railway tracks up till the Byappanahalli station limits. Standing 4’11 tall, the 29-year-old can be seen wielding with heavy spanners and hammers and tightening the big bolts and nuts on the rails, a task which requires immense physical strength. “Week one was hard and I experienced excruciating pain on my body especially my fingers. But now I have mastered it,” says Wasnik.A post-graduate in Computer Management, Wasnik hails from Nagpur and comes from a family of railway staffers. Wasnik’s first posting was in Bengaluru limits and she recently completed three years on the job. “I worked on the Bengaluru tracks till I was eight months pregnant and returned after completing my maternity leave. I love my job even though it is tough and I give my best as it involves safety of trains and people,” she says.TRUCKING THROUGH KARNATAKAShe is Bengaluru’s sole female lorry driver and most probably the only one in the state. Jyothi R from Chandra Layout has been manoeuvring her heavy Tata truck across the length and breath of the state since 2011 after she took to the wheels to support her husband Parashiva Murthy and their family of four. In the Nayandahalli lorry den, peers call Jyothi as a female tiger for her driving skills. “I started driving the lorry to bring some additional income mainly to support our kids education.I transport sand and other construction material to different parts of Karnataka,” says the 36-year-woman lorry driver who is a rare sight on the highway in a tough profession. This Mysuru-native is a determined driver and has often proved wrong many who doubted her skill in shifting material from point to point in a specific time.A strong lady in a lorry, Jyothi is struggling to find business these days because of often ingrained misogyny. “I’m determined and won’t back down at least until my daughter and son reach a good position in life,” says this driven mom, her foot on the accelerator of her blue lorry laden with sand.NUMBERS TO NUTS AND BOLTSLocal word is that any problems with mega machinery or any motors, madam’s touch is what it takes. Karthiyayini Vasanth may appear to most as a simple home-maker but she is a self-made pro in heavy motor mechanisms. Famous for her work skills in the Kengeri area, this 44-year-old self-taught mechanic from Udupi remains modest and extremely dedicated to her job.With her husband Vasanth by her side, the couple has been running a motor mechanics shed for over two decades. Karthiyayini arrived in Kengeri from Mangaluru and took up the profession like a fish to water. “I was an accountant back home and never even dreamt of turning a mechanic. But it all happened after I married and came to Bengaluru. I started coming to the shop and couldn’t stop but work on the machines and assist my husband,” laughs this pre-university Mangaluru topper.Despite being a bright student Karthiyayini couldn’t go for higher studies due to financial trouble in the family. The mechanic couple has a daughter. “I’m determined to give our child whatever highest education she aims,” says the heavy machine mechanic mother amidst fixing a coil.HEAVY METALThe hammer which she uses to beat wrought iron is a solid seven kilograms at least. Working as a blacksmith for four decades, Lakshmamma Nagaraj of Hegde Nagar is truly an iron lady in a profession where women are a rarity. “My father was a metalsmith in Hosur and we come from a tradition of metal workers. From my childhood days, the sound of the hammer hitting the iron and the orange flame fascinated me. I took to the hammer at the tender age of ten and there was no looking back,” says Lakshmamma.This 44-year-old woman blacksmith begins work of crafting iron and steel from 7 am everyday alongside her husband Nagaraj who assists her. An extremely strenuous job, Lakshmamma performs it with ease and earned the name of an expert metalsmith in the locality. But she expresses modesty and says, “This is my livelihood and I love it. But by five in the evening I wind up for the day and rush to the kitchen which is more challenging,” laughs the lady who is a mother of three boys. Lakshmamma smiles when she says she knows no other profession. “For me every day is woman’s day,” she chuckles as sparks fly from the hot iron after her hammer smashes down.6,000 CORPSES IN 16 YEARSBurial grounds are often all-male bastions and some traditions even prevent women from participating in final rites. But for 46-year-old Channamma Ganesh, it is a livelihood for the sake of her four girls.

But his sudden demise in 2000 left her with four young children and a bleak future. “I was from a village and didn’t know any work outside the kitchen.

Wasnik’s first posting was in Bengaluru limits and she recently completed three years on the job. “I worked on the Bengaluru tracks till I was eight months pregnant and returned after completing my maternity leave. I love my job even though it is tough and I give my best as it involves safety of trains and people,” she says.TRUCKING THROUGH KARNATAKAShe is Bengaluru’s sole female lorry driver and most probably the only one in the state. Jyothi R from Chandra Layout has been manoeuvring her heavy Tata truck across the length and breath of the state since 2011 after she took to the wheels to support her husband Parashiva Murthy and their family of four. In the Nayandahalli lorry den, peers call Jyothi as a female tiger for her driving skills. “I started driving the lorry to bring some additional income mainly to support our kids education.I transport sand and other construction material to different parts of Karnataka,” says the 36-year-woman lorry driver who is a rare sight on the highway in a tough profession. This Mysuru-native is a determined driver and has often proved wrong many who doubted her skill in shifting material from point to point in a specific time.A strong lady in a lorry, Jyothi is struggling to find business these days because of often ingrained misogyny. “I’m determined and won’t back down at least until my daughter and son reach a good position in life,” says this driven mom, her foot on the accelerator of her blue lorry laden with sand.NUMBERS TO NUTS AND BOLTSLocal word is that any problems with mega machinery or any motors, madam’s touch is what it takes. Karthiyayini Vasanth may appear to most as a simple home-maker but she is a self-made pro in heavy motor mechanisms. Famous for her work skills in the Kengeri area, this 44-year-old self-taught mechanic from Udupi remains modest and extremely dedicated to her job.With her husband Vasanth by her side, the couple has been running a motor mechanics shed for over two decades. Karthiyayini arrived in Kengeri from Mangaluru and took up the profession like a fish to water. “I was an accountant back home and never even dreamt of turning a mechanic. But it all happened after I married and came to Bengaluru. I started coming to the shop and couldn’t stop but work on the machines and assist my husband,” laughs this pre-university Mangaluru topper.Despite being a bright student Karthiyayini couldn’t go for higher studies due to financial trouble in the family. The mechanic couple has a daughter. “I’m determined to give our child whatever highest education she aims,” says the heavy machine mechanic mother amidst fixing a coil.HEAVY METALThe hammer which she uses to beat wrought iron is a solid seven kilograms at least. Working as a blacksmith for four decades, Lakshmamma Nagaraj of Hegde Nagar is truly an iron lady in a profession where women are a rarity. “My father was a metalsmith in Hosur and we come from a tradition of metal workers. From my childhood days, the sound of the hammer hitting the iron and the orange flame fascinated me. I took to the hammer at the tender age of ten and there was no looking back,” says Lakshmamma.This 44-year-old woman blacksmith begins work of crafting iron and steel from 7 am everyday alongside her husband Nagaraj who assists her. An extremely strenuous job, Lakshmamma performs it with ease and earned the name of an expert metalsmith in the locality. But she expresses modesty and says, “This is my livelihood and I love it. But by five in the evening I wind up for the day and rush to the kitchen which is more challenging,” laughs the lady who is a mother of three boys. Lakshmamma smiles when she says she knows no other profession. “For me every day is woman’s day,” she chuckles as sparks fly from the hot iron after her hammer smashes down.6,000 CORPSES IN 16 YEARSBurial grounds are often all-male bastions and some traditions even prevent women from participating in final rites. But for 46-year-old Channamma Ganesh, it is a livelihood for the sake of her four girls. Perhaps Bengaluru’s only woman gravedigger and undertaker, Channamma has buried nearly 6,000 corpses at the Hindu burial ground in Srirampura here in a unique career spanning 16 years.The Kolar native came to Bengaluru after she married Ganesh, a gravedigger at Srirampura and a local resident, in 1987. But his sudden demise in 2000 left her with four young children and a bleak future. “I was from a village and didn’t know any work outside the kitchen. I had never set foot inside the graveyard even though my husband worked here as I dreaded the place. But my family situation brought me here and I began carrying bodies, digging graves and lowering corpses inside,” says ChannammaToday, locals fondly call her Smashana Channamma (Smashana is cemetery in Kannada). “There may be some discrimination in society for the work I do but I’m happy to send the dead to their final rest,” she says.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/sometimes-it-takes-a-woman-to-do-a-real-mans-job/articleshow/74530191.cms

BICHOLIM: Sakhali resident Navanath Gaonkar, 33, who was arrested on Thursday as the prime suspect in the murder of 44-year-old Dhanashree Morajkar from Ravan-Poriem in Sattari, was on Friday sent to the Colvale jail from Bicholim PHC.

Morajkar’s body was recovered from a canal of the Anjunem dam on February 28. Police had detained 10 suspects on Monday, including Gaonkar.

On Thursday evening Gaonkar escaped from custody, but was caught the next day. Since he had sustained an injury while climbing down the tree where he had remained hidden, the JMFC Bicholim directed that Gaonkar be admitted to the Bicholim PHC before being placed in judicial custody.

Gaonkar was discharged Friday evening from where he was sent to the Colvale jail.

Further, with Gaonkar yet to confess to the crime, Bicholim police have requested the court to grant them his custody to enable them to obtain his confession.

426,['8/03/2020'],Political turmoil may churn out first expansion of Nath cabinet,"Bhopal: The ongoing political turmoil in Madhya Pradesh is likely to pave the way for first expansion of Kamal Nath cabinet. The government wants to do it after the budget session while the independents and disgruntled Congress leaders want it before the session.

Budget session of MP assembly will begin from March 16. It will have 17 sittings and conclude on April 13. Budget session could be a litmus test for government. Voting for three Rajya Sabha seats would also take place on March 26. The government wants to pass it smoothly with assurance of ministerial berths to MLAs, minimizing possibility of horse-trading by BJP.

Apart from cabinet expansion, the Nath government would also make political appointments in boards and corporations. There are 28 ministers in MP cabinet. The strength in 230 member assembly cannot exceed beyond 34. At least five sitting MLAs would be made to resign to accommodate new faces. Congress ministers offered to step down in the cabinet meet a day earlier to save the government.

Ministers that would be dropped would be from Kamal Nath and Digvijay Singh camps while one from Jyotiraditya Scindia camp may not be asked to step down, as they had been vocal against the alleged neglect of Scindia in Madhya Pradesh.

The ministers have been asked to remain in the state capital as much possible for the next few days. Congress has 114 MLAs, two short of majority in the House of 230. Four independent MLAs, two BSP and one SP MLA are supporting the Kamal Nath government.

Four independent MLAs are Kedar Dawar (Bhagwanpura), Pradeep Jaiswal (Waraseoni), Rana Vikram Singh (Susner) and Surendra Singh ‘Shera Bhaiya’ (Burhanpur). Pradeep Jaiswal is already with the Congress as mineral resources minister. Surendra Singh, who allegedly went with BJP earlier this week, but denied on returning to Bhopal on Saturday has several times expressed displeasure for not getting ministerial berth.

Two BSP MLAs supporting the government are Sanjeev Singh (Bhind), Rambai Singh (Pathariya) while Rajesh Kumar Shukla (Bijawar) is the lone SP legislator supporting the government. Rambai- also allegedly among the ones in talks with BJP and went to New Delhi earlier this week, said on Thursday she is confident that Kamal Nath would consider her whenever cabinet expansion takes place in the state.

Sources said government has worked out a formula of cabinet expansion. One among two from BSP MLAs could be given ministerial berth and will be adjusted in board or corporation. Similarly, two independents could be made state ministers and one would be accommodated in board and corporation. The list of ministers in waiting is long among Congress MLAs and who would become ministers and who would be dropped among sitting ministers will remain suspense till expansion takes place.

Speculation of cabinet expansion has been doing the rounds ever since senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh recently said that the expansion should take place after the assembly’s budget session. The same was later repeated by ministers and other senior Congress leaders.

428,['8/03/2020'],'Communal agenda not driving any govt move: Rajnath Singh,"NEW DELHI: No Indian citizen, whether he is a follower of Islam or any other religion, will be affected by the amended citizenship act (CAA), said defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday, stressing that PM Narendra Modi and his government would never take any decision based on any communal agenda.

Noting that he knew Modi better than anyone else in the cabinet, Singh said he had personally seen the PM been greatly anguished over the baseless and unfounded allegations being hurled at him during the ongoing CAA controversy. “I know the intention (behind enacting the CAA)…No one will touch the citizens of India, including the minorities,” he said, speaking at the ET-GBS here.

“India believes in ' Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam ’ or the whole world is our family. India can never discriminate based on caste, creed or religion. I am of the belief that it is a crime to discriminate on the basis of religion,” he said, seeking to allay the fears of Muslims over the new law.

Noting that the citizenship (amendment) bill had been drafted when he was the home minister in 2016, Singh said the law was meant for those who were being religiously persecuted in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. “There is a need to remove the confusion among the minorities in India,” he said.

Some people have asserted that it would have been better if only the word “minority” had been used in the law, instead of specifying the Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Zoroastrian communities who were facing harassment in the three countries. “But if the country concerned had changed the definition of minority, we would not have been able to give them citizenship here even if they were being religiously persecuted. That is why we did not use the word `minority’,” he said.

429,['8/03/2020'],Development of women is social investment: Irani,"NEW DELHI: Giving a call for change of mindset to see women ’s development as social investment, Union minister Smriti Irani on Saturday challenged indices that rate a country merely on parameters of inequality, maternal mortality rate and women’s participation in the work force. She said conventional international templates should be reoriented as “the India story needs to be told in the proper context” as the country had taken “gigantic steps” on gender parity.

Speaking at the Economic Times Global Business Summit, the women and child development minister said, “One of the greatest disservices we do to women with regard to policy is when we look at them as social expenditure. Under PM Modi , the narrative is such that I would like it to be known as a ministry for social investment.”

She said in enhancing capacities of women, one needs to understand that there has to be a life-cycle approach. “We are in a time-frame in India where we look at women as enablers of our growth story.”

Asked about her views on the talk around India’s ranking on inequality index, she said, “One of the greatest disservices done to our country’s capacity, especially to serve the issue of gender have been indices which possibly have not done the number crunching with the current data.”

“For instance, they would look at health parameters from the only from the perspective of maternal mortality rate. No other parameter matters for them. Even if you look at the MMR in our country we are way ahead of the SDG deadlines. When we were calculated on the Global Inequality Index they calculated our MMR at 174 whereas the MMR was 122,” she said.

“... when they look at the economic empowerment of women, they only look at them from a labour prism. Are women who are entrepreneurs and owners of small businesses not to be counted. So what about those 150 million women who took the MUDRA loan and are not labour for anybody but run their small businesses. Where are they to be counted?” she asked.

431,['8/03/2020'],"Even I don’t have a birth certificate, says Telangana CM","K Chandrasekhar Rao

HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Saturday wondered why CAA, NRC and NPR were being forced on citizens. He wanted to know where he would get his father’s birth certificate when he himself didn't possess one.

Speaking in the assembly, the chief minister said he did not have a birth certificate and the village (Chintamadaka) where he was born had no hospital then. Also, there was no issue of birth certificates in those days. “Should I die if I am asked to bring my father’s birth certificate when I myself don’t have one?” 66-year-old KCR wondered.

He said since there were no hospitals, priests would write ‘janma namam’ (birth star), which was considered as a birth certificate in those days which, however, carried no official seal. The chief minister recalled that when he was born, their family used to own 580 acres of agricultural land and a huge building in the village. “When I cannot produce my own birth certificate, what would be the fate of the poor people, Dalits and STs. If they ask for all these details now, where will one get them?” he sought to know.

CM: No one will accept law which excludes one particular religion

The chief minister said the Constitution guarantees equal rights to people of this country irrespective of their religion, caste and creed. “The Act is against the spirit of the Constitution. How can you discriminate a particular religion?” he asked referring to the Citizenship Amendment Act. “No civilised society will accept a law which keeps out people of one particular religion,” he said, drawing a huge applause from the members.

He said the image of the country had taken a beating globally. “This (CAA, NRC and NPR) is an issue connected with India’s reputation before the world.” He said the issue was being discussed at the United Nations and various world bodies. “We are a part of this country and we will not keep quiet. We will respond and do what best we can in our own limits,” KCR said.

He said CAA and NPR were among the most important issues that could have ramifications on the future generations, social fabric of this country and future of India also. “It is a serious issue. More than 50 people have died in Delhi. There are lots of doubts about these Acts and let us not create more tension. Let us discuss it in the assembly,” he said.

He said every political party has a stand on the issue. “Whether the Centre agrees or not, as a state, we will send our views and mood of the people in the form of a resolution to the central government,” the chief minister said, while advising BJP MLA T Raja Singh and AIMIM floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi that the House would take up a discussion on CAA separately and that they should confine their speeches to the motion of thanks to the governor’s address on Friday.

Earlier, Akbaruddin urged the Delhi government to extend help to the families of those who have died in the riots and whose properties had been damaged. He also said the Centre was not giving Telangana its share in terms of devolution of funds and the chief minister stood up stating that he was speaking the truth.

The man, first in TN to be confirmed of the viral infection, is in the isolation ward of Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital where his condition is stable, and he is currently showing no symptoms, doctors attending on him said.

Minutes later, health minister C Vijayabaskar tweeted saying a positive patient had been identified and isolated. “TN health department is fully functional to combat the situation,” the tweet said.

Officials said the employee of a Muscat, Oman, construction firm arrived on February 28 but didn’t show symptoms such as fever on landing at Chennai airport. On March 1, when he developed fever and cold, he visited his family physician in Kancheepuram. On March 4, he reported to Stanley Medical College and Hospital with fever, cough and breathing difficulty and was shifted to Rajiv Gandhi Government GH.

“He is in hospital quarantine ever since. His family members have been advised home quarantine. We have drawn samples from them for test,” said health secretary Beela Rajesh. “We may not be able to stop the disease but we will be able to push it back if we follow hand hygiene and surface cleaning.”

Director of public health Dr K Kolandasamy said the man underwent a series of tests including blood investigations, chest X-ray and CT scan in the GH isolation ward. Samples – (nasal and throat swabs, and blood) were drawn for test at King Institute. On March 5, the laboratory said the samples wereshowing signsof confirmation of the disease. “But there were variations. For further confirmation we sent the sample to the Pune lab. Today they confirmed the sample is positive,” he said. At present, the patient does not have fever. “He is a diabetic, but his sugar levels are under control. He is responding well. He will be discharged after two consecutive samples test negative for Covid-19,” a duty doctor said.

His eight family members, including three senior citizens, who were advised home quarantine, have not shown any symptoms so far. Samples were drawn by doctors and health workers as per WHO protocol. At least 19 other contacts including his friends, doctor and visitors, tagged as “low-risk for exposure”, were asked to stay in 28-day quarantine and call health workers in case they develop cold, fever or breathlessness.

CHENNAI: Three transsexuals robbed an autorickshaw driver of some cash at Gopalapuram on Friday, police said. While the transsexuals managed to escape, a woman who was with them but was not part of the robbery was caught by passersby and handed over to the Royapettah police.

The woman, identified as 34-year-old Triplicane resident Pugazhmathi, was booked for creating nuisance before a magistrate's court released her on bail.

Initial inquiries by police revealed that Pugazhmathi, a resident of Bharathi Salai in Triplicane, went with the transsexuals after they promised her liquor.

The four hailed an autorickshaw near RK Mutt Road and asked the driver, later identified by police as Balan, to take them to the Slatterpuram area near Mylapore. Along the way, the four passengers opened a bottle and started consuming liquor when Balan objected.

The transsexuals continued drinking and started to misbehave with Balan. As he continued to oppose their act and warned that he would call police, the transsexuals forced him to pull over on Dr Radhakrishnan Salai. They then attacked and snatched cash from him and escaped.

As Balan raised an alarm, some people passing by and a few residents of the area rushed there and nabbed the woman. They rang up '100' and informed the police control room. A police team came and nabbed Pugazhmathi.

An investigation officer said the woman was drunk when she was brought to the police station.

Women personnel frisked her thoroughly but didn't find any valuables robbed from Balan.

Police have collected her fingerprints and sent them to the state crime records bureau to verify if she was involved in any other criminal act. Further investigations are on.

The project is being executed by Andhra Pradesh Eastern Power Distribution Company Limited (APEPDCL) with financial support from the World Bank.

As per schedule, the first phase of the project is supposed to be completed by the end of this financial year. However, with only 50 per cent of the work complete till now, chances of the work being completed by the end of this month are near impossible, say sources.

Meanwhile, work for the second and third phases is also far off target. Only 30 per cent work has been done for the fourth phase of the project so far, sources informed.

According to the sources, work remained at halt for nearly three months— from October, 2019 to December 2019— because the government had not cleared pending bills.

Later, following a series of requests from concerned authorities, including officials of APEPDCL, the state government released Rs 72 crore in January. It was only after the amount was released that the contracting agencies resume work.

Even now, payment has been made for just around 35 per cent of the completed work from the World Bank through the state government. The total estimated cost of the project is Rs 791 crore.

According to a source from one of the contracting agencies, the government is yet to clearly nearly Rs 25 crore and they are hopeful that the amount will be cleared by next month.

Speaking to STOI, a senior APEPDCL officer admitted that the project, in all four phases, has been delayed. The officials said that they are trying to pressure contractors to speed-up work. APEPDCL wants to start operations from August 15, the official said.

“We hope to be able to operate the first phase of the project by August 15 and all phases by December if everything goes as per schedule,” the official added.

436,['8/03/2020'],Chinese cargo ship allowed to berth at port after 2 days,"Visakhapatnam: After being isolated off shore of the Bay of Bengal for more than two days, the Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) allowed the Chinese vessel ‘Fortune Hero’ to berth at the port on Saturday.

According to a senior port official, the master of the cargo ship had sent a declaration to port authorities on Friday stating that none of the 22 people on board were infected with coronavirus.

Subsequently, a senior health official from VPT went into the ship to conduct health checks after which the ship was allowed to berth, the officials informed.

However, crew members will not be allowed to disembark from the vessel.

Fortune Hero— the bulk carrier vessel— reached Visakhapatnam from China on midnight Wednesday. The vessel was carrying pet coke in bulk and had 22 crew members on board, including 17 Chinese and 5 Burmese nationals.

Although the ship had booked a berth well in advance, it was not allowed to berth as it had arrived from China within 14 days.

As per the protocol in place owing to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19), ships coming in from affected countries like China, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore would only be allowed to disembark passengers or unload cargo if the vessel has travelled for more than 15 days and all crew members are fit.

The health official who went into the ship to conduct health checks on members of the crew of Fortune Hero wore a fully-protective cover and was equipped with a thermal gun as well as other devices to test for coronavirus infection.

The official examined the people on board and certified that the people were not suffering from coronavirus. Consequently, the ship was allowed to unload cargo.

437,['8/03/2020'],"Even I don't have a birth certificate, says Telangana CM","HYDERABAD: Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Saturday wondered why CAA, NRC and NPR were being forced on citizens. He wanted to know where he would get his father’s birth certificate when he himself didn't possess one.

Speaking in the state assembly, the chief minister said he did not have a birth certificate and the village (Chintamadaka) where he was born had no hospital then. Also, there was no issue birth certificates in those days. “Should I die if I am asked to bring my father’s birth certificate when I myself don’t have one?” 66-year-old KCR wondered.

He said since there were no hospitals, priests would write ‘janma namam’ (birth star), which was considered as a birth certificate in those days which, however, carried no official seal. The chief minister recalled when he was born, their family used to own 580 acres of agricultural land and a huge building in the village. “When I cannot produce my own birth certificate, what would be the fate of the poor people, Dalits and STs. If they ask for all these details now, where will one get them?” he sought to know.

The chief minister said the Constitution guarantees equal rights to people of this country irrespective of their religion, caste and creed. “The Act is against the spirit of the Constitution. How can you discriminate a particular religion?” he asked referring to the Citizenship Amendment Act. “No civilised society will accept a law which keeps out people of one particular religion,” he said, drawing a huge round of applause from the members.

The chief minister said the image of the country had taken a beating globally. “This (CAA, NRC and NPR) is an issue connected with India’s reputation before the world.” He said the issue was being discussed at the United Nations and various world bodies. “We are a part of this country and we will not keep quiet. We will respond and do what best we can in our own limits,” KCR said.

He said CAA and NPR were among the most important issues that could have ramifications on the future generations, social fabric of this country and future of India also. “It is a serious issue. More than 50 people have died in Delhi. There are lots of doubts about these Acts and let us not create more tension. Let us discuss it in the assembly,” he said.

He said every political party has a stand on the issue. “Whether the Centre agrees or not, as a state, we will send our views and mood of the people in the form of a resolution to the central government,” the chief minister said, while advising BJP MLA T Raja Singh and AIMIM floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi that the House would take up a discussion on CAA separately and that they should confine their speeches to the motion of thanks to the governor’s address on Friday.

Earlier, Akbaruddin urged the Delhi government to extend help to the families of those who have died in the riots and whose properties had been damaged. He also said the Centre was not giving Telangana its share in terms of devolution of funds and the chief minister stood up stating that he was speaking the truth.

438,['8/03/2020'],"Mobile app to curb influence of money, liquor in local polls","Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy launches the Nigha app at Thadepalli camp office on Saturday

Vijayawada: Chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy on Saturday launched a mobile App called Nigha (surveillance) to ensure ‘clean and healthy’ elections by curbing distribution of money and liquor in the upcoming local body polls in the state.

It may be recalled that the elections will be held for 660 Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTCs) and 9,984 out of 10,047 Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTCs) in the state on March 21.

In a bid to crack down electoral malpractices in the upcoming local body elections, Panchayat Raj Department, has set up the Nigha app to enable people to lodge (alert) the polling staff and police on distribution of liquor and money to influence the voters.

Anyone can download the Nigha app in their smart phones. Photos and videos related to the distribution of money and liquor and any other activity that violates Model Code of Conduct could be reported though the app, which would get registered in the control room for concern officials to immediate action.

The officials said that all the complaints registered though the Nigha mobile app will automatically be routed to the central control room and the information will be shared with the concerned officials. The concerned officials will take stringent action against the people responsible for the violations of the code. The app is designed in addition to the measures taken up by the State Commission and police department to curb the possible malpractices in the local body elections.

PV Ramesh, special secretary to chief minister, Gopal Krishna Dwivedi, principal secretary, panchayat raj, Girija Shankar, commissioner were among those who were present on the occasion.

TDP launches command control room

Saying that YSRC is wooing electorates with liquor and cash to gain upper hand in the upcoming local body elections in the state, TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu on Saturday launched a command control room number (79950 14525) and a toll free number at NTR Bhavan in Vijayawada to receive complaints from the public.

Naidu appealed to the public to share photos and videos related to the violations of the Model Code of Conduct (distribution of liquor and money to voters) committed by YSRC to the Command control room number. He said that they will share the reported violations to polling staff to seek action against the violators.

It may be recalled that the ordinance amending the AP Panchayat Raj Act also has a stringent provision that disqualifies a candidate found guilty of distributing liquor or money to voters.

Naidu appealed to the youngsters in the party to prove their leadership qualities in the local body elections for the victory of the TDP.

439,['8/03/2020'],"EC experts' panels push for digital voter cards, e-filing of nominations","NEW DELHI: Digital version of electoral photo identity card (EPIC), e-filing of nominations, exploring new voting methods to ensure participation of migrant voters who remain registered at their previous locations and bringing print and social media under the ambit of 48-hour ‘silence period’ are some of the key recommendations made by nine working groups set up by the Election Commission after the 2019 general election to suggest improvement in electoral management.

EC had constituted these working groups — comprising senior Commission officials and state chief electoral officers — to collate election-related inputs from the field, analyse them in the context of legal and institutional frameworks and suggest pathways for future to add value to the electoral process. Based on reports presented by the working groups last month, the Commission has now put 25 key recommendations in the public domain and invited comments/suggestions from all stakeholders by March 31.

Among the recommendations is providing e-EPIC to each voter. “In the digital environment, it is recommended to have e-version of EPIC for the voters for better mobility,” the EC said. The working groups have also sought integration of voter registration process with citizen-facing services like DigiLocker and UMANG so that necessary documents, maintained by citizens in DigiLocker and UMANG, may be uploaded/connected easily for purposes of registration.

The working groups favoured a single and simplified form for all voter services like registration, change of address, deletion of names — for which different forms must be filled at present. They have also prescribed online registration of prospective voters at 17 years in schools and colleges. Also, multiple qualifying dates for voter registration on attaining 18 years of age have been sought, with EC suggesting four different dates at the beginning of each quarter and the law ministry wanting to limit this to two (January 1 and July 1) in a year.

An important recommendation relates to exploring possibility and feasibility of different voting methods that are secure for enhanced electoral participation. While absentee voters can currently vote via one-way electronic postal ballot, this facility is limited to force personnel and staff of Indian missions abroad. The working groups have proposed that other methods, including remote voting on a secured EC device to be deployed at “national polling stations”, be explored to enable migrant voters who are away from their constituency on polling date, to vote from where they are. This will facilitate inclusion of around 30% voters who do not participate in elections due to various reasons.

Another recommendation on which suggestions are invited is bringing print and social media under the ambit of Section 126 of Representation of the People Act, which currently bars only electronic media from covering campaigning during 48 hours prior to end of polling.

It has been suggested that online facility be started for filing of nomination by candidates to help avoid errors and ease the nomination process.

The working groups have favoured a cap on political party expenditure. EC had earlier suggested to the law ministry to cap such expenditure at product of half of maximum prescribed limit for individual candidates and number of candidates fielded.

441,['8/03/2020'],HC upholds new evaluation system for bureaucrats,"NEW DELHI: The Narendra Modi government’s 360-degree evaluation system for senior bureaucrats has got a boost, with the Delhi high court refusing to strike it down in a recent case.

The HC also dismissed in end-February a review plea moved by the officer urging it to reconsider the decision, saying “no grounds are made out for review”.

Introduced in 2015, the 360-degree appraisal system made vetting of eligible bureaucrats to highest echelons of office much more stringent. However, it has also drawn criticism from several quarters for being opaque and non-transparent, unlike the Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs).

While dealing with a plea, the HC backed the government’s new system, which is also known as Multi-Source Feedback Guidelines (MSF).

A bench of Justice S Muralidhar and Justice Talwant Singh studied the MSF guidelines and minutes of each of the meetings of the Committee of Secretaries constituted for deciding empanelment of additional secretaries, before rejecting the plea of a senior IAS officer who challenged the MSF, which overlooked him for empanelment thrice, and sought a copy of his appraisal.

The HC agreed with the stand of the Centre through additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain and standing counsel Gaurang Kant , noting: “MSF Guidelines were not intended to be ‘issued’, i.e. placed in the public domain. They were to serve as internal guidelines for the Committee of Secretaries/ Empanelment Committee when it undertook the task of deciding to empanel Additional Secretaries.”

In his plea, the senior IAS officer had urged the HC to direct the Centre to consider his case for empanelment for the posts of additional secretary and later to secretary, government of India. He claimed the MSF norms were never issued or made public and attacked the decision as arbitrary.

The HC had earlier directed the central government to place before it in a sealed cover the MSF guidelines that went into consideration of the officer’s case on the last three occasions.

It found nothing amiss in the process saying MSF is meant to “aid the CoS/ EPC in carrying out their task, their use for arriving at a decision cannot be said to be illegal”.

It also noted that MSF involved the entire process by which the officer’s case was examined for empanelment as additional secretary on multiple occasions prior to and after May, 2016. The government also considered the recommendations of an Experts Panel as well as the Review Experts Panel, the HC ruled.

VIJAYAWADA: V Vijay Sai Reddy, general secretary, YSRC , and Rajya Sabha MP, on Saturday tweeted that former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had taken commissions from Yes Bank , the fifth largest private lender which has landed in serious financial trouble.

Sai Reddy alleged that Naidu received commissions from the bank for depositing Rs 1,300 crore of Tirumala Tirupati Devastanam (TTD). In his official Twitter account, Sai Reddy said TTD chairman Y V Subba Reddy sensed danger in advance and withdrew deposits in time, averting trouble for TTD.

Sai Reddy went on to allege that Naidu extended undue favours to Yes Bank in the name of tourism mission document. He said Naidu gave away tourism funds to the bank in the guise of preparing the mission document to make Andhra Pradesh a favourite tourist destination.

The agreement was signed between the Andhra Pradesh government and Yes Bank in 2015. Sai Reddy said that these were the two known issues and added how many more shady deals were done by Naidu with the troubled lender.

Rebutting the allegations, former TTD board member and TDP leader Bonda Umamaheswara Rao said the TDP government was never involved in the decisions of the TTD board.

“Any decision regarding the deposits of TTD funds made solely on the discretionary powers of the board. The allegations are baseless and far from truth. YSRC leaders, especially Vijay Sai Reddy, have made many allegations about TTD’s assets and Lord Venkateswara’s jewellery while being in opposition but they have failed to prove an iota of what they alleged,” Bonda told STOI.

Rao said that the TDP government had worked towards upholding the sanctity of the temple and to safeguard the sentiments of devotees unlike present regime which recruited employees from other religions. “We have seen the episode of Sri Venkateswara Bhakti Channel (SVBC) chairman in the holy place. YSRC has been playing with sentiments of devotees when it comes to TTD and they have no right to criticise TDP,” Bonda said.

It has roped in CREDAI-MCHI to identify and designate four-five buildings as quarantine facilities.SevenHills Hospital was set up in 2010 as a public-private partnership between a Vizag hospital chain and BMC, which provided land in lieu of free beds and treatment for poor patients. The building could accommodate 1,500 beds, including 300 ICU beds, but it shut down in February, after a prolonged dispute between the two parties over treatment costs.A BMC team of senior officials and doctors on Friday assessed if the closed building could be ideal for quarantining Covid-19 patients. “We had to assess if there was adequate infrastructure to treat serious patients,” said an official. He said BMC would require at least a sevenday intimation to get any hospital space ready as a quarantine facility.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “We are working on keeping hospitals ready in the eastern suburbs and western suburbs.” Kasturb Hospital, near Saat Rasta is the main facility, and BMC is in making 100 quarantine beds in four of its hospitals: Rajawadi in Ghatkopar, Bhabha Hospitals in Bandra and Kurla and Jogeshwari trauma care facility. A report on whether SevenHills Hospital can be used as quarantine facility will be submitted to Kakani on Monday.The state government said 96,493 passengers who arrived at Mumbai international airport were screened between January 18-March 7.

MUMBAI: A fire erupted on the second floor of Club building at Juhu Gymkhana, near the bus depot, at 9.45pm on Saturday. Mumbai fire brigade and police said despite the flames spreading fast, they were contained quickly. A few people were trapped inside for sometime and some were seen running out of the club. Two fire engines, three jumbo water tanks and an ambulance were sent to the site.

Fire brigade officials said the blaze spread through the ground floor and upper two floors. There were no reports of injuries. Fire brigade officials said prima facie, the fire, which erupted on the second floor, was due to a short-circuit. The blaze was extinguished at 10.08pm, BMC disaster management officials said.

Chief fire brigade officer P S Rahangdale said, ""Our teams did a good job mobilising forces, responding and controlling the situation.""

Juhu Gymkhana Club has leading filmstars, sports persons and businessmen as members. A trustee said he had written to the authorities about irregularities at the club. ""Juhu Club does not even have an OC. I have complained about multiple structural alterations inside. The doors of some rooms open inward, instead of outside, so there is no chance of escaping a fire from a closed room,"" he told TOI.

Club vice-president Anil Mahesh refused to comment about the OC. ""I have nothing to say, except that everybody is safe, and there are no casualties,"" he said.

The crew has also been asked to inform the ground staff of any such passengers travelling on the flight before landing.“This is season change time and we have scores of people coughing and sneezing, which are the visible signs to look out for. Reporting passengers who were doing so on a flight to housekeeping and then having the aircraft cleaned means getting all seats rigorously cleaned,” said a senior crew member. All airlines have enhanced aircraft cleaning and issued similar instructions, hence facing the same issue.A narrow body aircraft, usually, completes several flights by the time a passenger tests Covid-19 positive, when the test result comes several hours later. Tracing who all he/she might have been in contact with during the flight and then who all sat on the seat occupied by the patient on subsequent flights is a nightmare, said another crew member.“If a confirmed case is reported and the aircraft is on the ground for a few hours, then wiping clean interiors of the aircraft such as overhead bins, all seats, all toilets with alcohol-based cleanser (70% alcohol) / Lyzol cleanser should be carried out.

CHENNAI: A woman, her daughter and her niece drowned in a lake near Chengalpet on Saturday when they went to wash clothes and take bath in the water body.

A police team from the Chengalpet police station recovered the bodies and sent them to the government hospital at Chengalpet for postmortem. After the incident, a pal of gloom descended on Pon Vilaintha Kalathur in Chengalpet taluk.

Quoting those who were at the spot during the accident, police said B Rajeshwari, 35, a widow, took her daughter B Subashini, 10, and her relative Satish Kumar's daughter S Devadarshini, 6, to the 600-acre lake belonging to the public works department.

As Rajeshwari was washing clothes with assistance from Subashini, Devadarshini was sitting close to them playing with water.

Police said Devadarshini fell into the lake when she tried to catch a floating leaf. In a bid to rescue her, Rajeshwari jumped into the water. However, both of them got trapped in sludge and drowned. Later, Subashini also jumped in to save them and drowned.

Other villagers who were washing clothes or bathing nearby tried to save the three but in vain. They then alerted the fire and rescue services personnel and the police control room. Later, the three bodies were fished out.

A team from the Chengalpet taluk police station rushed to the place and sent the bodies to Chengalpet government hospital for postmortem. A case has been registered under CrPC Section 174 (unnatural death).

Preliminary inquiries revealed that after Rajeshwari's husband Balasubramanian died due to ailments last year she began working in a private firm to make ends meet and to bring up her daughter.

KOLKATA: Slowdown of imports from China following the novel coronavirus outbreak has led to a scarcity of medicines and clinical equipment across several private hospitals in Kolkata. At least two of them are facing a shortage of essential equipment like catheters and cardiac medicines that are sourced from China. Others fear their stocks would run out in the next two-three weeks.While prices of some essential drugs have already shot up due to the supply squeeze, hand sanitizers, masks and thermometers, which have seen a sudden spurt in demand, have turned scarce.About 70% of India’s active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) are sourced from China.RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, for instance, is facing a shortage of medicines like Heparin — a blood-thinning drug — and Enoxaparin — also an anticoagulant that prevents blood clots.Besides shortage of essential medicines, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences is also facing a scarcity of thermometers, most of which are imported from China, said RTIICS zonal director R Venkatesh.Medica Superspecialty had run out of angioplasty catheters last week but has managed to procure them from an alternative source. Suppliers have warned that flow of several drugs sourced from China could soon be affected. “If the situation doesn’t normalize within a month, several medicines and equipment will be unavailable,” said chairman Alok Roy.Across its three units, AMRI Hospitals are yet to face a shortage of medicines but the authorities fear that if the import restrictions persist for a month, a crisis is imminent.Not just hospitals, even doctors are feeling the heat of the supply choke. Dermatologist Koushik Lahiri had ordered a skin examination equipment along with a giant magnifying glass, which are lying at the Chennai airport waiting for clearance since late-January.

The actress, who hails from Berhampore, Murshidabad, has done a number of popular daily soaps including ‘ Jibon Jyoti ’, ‘ Mahapeeth Tarapeeth’. The gorgeous actress is presently playing the lead in ‘Jiyon Kathi’. This International Women’s Day, Etimes TV had a candid chat with the actress who is not only one of the most promising actresses of Tollywood but also a survivor of cancer who never stopped chasing her dreams.“To me, International Women’s Day bears importance. It is a day which should be celebrated in honour of all women out there. Just like our birthday is important to us. But at the same time, I feel, we should think about women in the rest of the 364 days too,” she said.The actress explained how social media is full of posts celebrating womanhood on March 8 and she feels that many issues affecting girls/women should be highlighted and addressed with equal enthusiasm no matter what. Said, “On 8th of March, Facebook and other social media handles will be flooded with posts celebrating womanhood. But 80% of the netizens will keep quiet when some gruesome incidents take place. They will not protest. And I am talking about both male and female users who are active on social media. It is time when we should start protesting against gender bias, stereotyping, crimes against women and other issues.”When asked about any probable solution to this issue, she stressed on the fact that the parents should never set gender roles in front of a child. She said, “In most of the households, we have a gender-specific role. If a man enters the kitchen it is out of passion but a woman has to do all the household chores before going to the office. Since childhood, we are being told that a girl shouldn’t do this since it doesn’t suit them. When a girl achieves something we say the parents have raised them like a boy. My question is, 'Why? Can’t we say that parents have raised their child as a good human being rather than being gender specific?'”Talking about the issue, Aindrila shared about her parents who let her elder sister and the actress to pursue their dreams. “My parents never asked us to come back home early at night. They never set any curfew time for us. If safety is a concern then we shouldn’t restrict a girl to go out. Boys should be taught how to conduct themselves on the road. They should be explained how and why the safety of a woman has become one of the burning issues today. My mom and dad gave us freedom and we never misused them.”While talking, Aindrila shared her personal experience, “I was in class XII, when I was diagnosed with cancer. My parents were shattered but they never showed it in front of me or didi. They asked me to fight. It was painful to undergo chemotherapy. When other people around us were more concerned about how I would get married if my hair doesn’t grow back, my parents held my hands strongly. I lost my hair and they kept telling how beautiful I look.” Aindrila turned emotional as she walked down memory lane. Then she added, “After completing chemotherapy, I posted a picture on Facebook in which I had no hair. My relatives called my dad and asked him to delete my photo as it would lessen the chance of me getting a prospective groom. But my parents never asked me to do so. They stood by me just like they did when I was undergoing the treatment. They told me that losing hair isn’t a scar, it is a sign of a soldier who fought hard.”Aindrila continued her studies and scored quite well. She studied Engineering degree in Computer Science. “My parents never stopped me from pursuing my passion for acting. People say, the entertainment industry isn’t for girls. My parents never stopped me. Likewise, my sister studied medical science and she is a doctor now. They never showed any kind of doubt on our talent.”Talking about International Women’s Day, she said, “In childhood, we used to present something to Maa. We continue the tradition.

458,['8/03/2020'],Ratna gets charge of CM’s outreach campaign in Behala,"Kolkata: Ahead of the civic polls, Trinamool has named former Kolkata mayor and Behala East MLA Sovan Chatterjee’s estranged wife Ratna Chatterjee in-charge of ‘Banglar Gorbo Mamata’ — a public outreach campaign — in Behala East assembly constituency.

TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee announced the decision on Saturday, sending out signals that time is running out for Sovan to get back into active Trinamool politics. Even as Sovan has joined BJP, he won the Behala East seat and also the civic polls from ward 131 in Behala on a Trinamool ticket.

Ratna’s elevation as “coordinator of councillors” in Behala East virtually seals the scope of Sovan’s active comeback to Trinamool because he had indicated he won’t share space in politics with Ratna. “I have been assigned to coordinate with the councillors in Behala East and monitor the campaign programme. Partha-da will be at the helm,” said Ratna.

When asked about TMC deputing Ratna when Behala East has an MLA, Partha said: “We can’t wait indefinitely for an inactive MLA to get active. We can’t afford to forego the BGM campaign.” Ratna sat beside the TMC secretary general at the press meet in Behala knowing that the development might irritate the former mayor. She is trying to make use of Sovan’s absence in the ward and assembly constituency to connect with people.

BJP, on the other hand, is not in a hurry. “The party hasn’t closed the doors on Sovan Chatterjee, who is still with BJP,” a BJP leader said. Bengal BJP, prodded by leaders in Delhi, is ready to give Sovan a long rope and “overtrump” TMC in this game of patience. “Sovan is with BJP. We want him to take an active role,” said Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh.

The former mayor has been in recluse for the last eight months keeping the guessing game going on. Sovan hasn’t yet got back to Trinamool politics though expectations were high after he and his friend Baisakhi Banerjee called on Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee at her Kalighat residence on Bhai Phonta. Neither did the former mayor attend Union home minister Amit Shah’s meeting at Shahid Minar on March 1 despite some posters hung up along the roads in south Kolkata urging “Sovanda” to take his city development plan forward. The posters, issued by an innocuous group — Kolkata Nagarik Brinda — had a lotus symbol beside Sovan’s photograph.

However, Saturday’s development is likely to tilt the scales in favour of BJP.

473,['8/03/2020'],Bengaluru: Three Infyosys employees arrested over I-T returns scam,"Representative Image

BENGALURU: Three Infosys employees involved in the functioning of income tax department’s centralised processing centre (CPC) have been arrested for collecting commission from taxpayers to expedite the refund process. The arrests were made on the basis of a complaint lodged with Electronics City police by an IRS officer and I-T director Sibichen K Mathew on Monday.

The arrested are Renukakunta Kalyan Kumar, 26, Deveeswar Reddy, 28, and Prakash, 26 — all residents of Electronics City. The trio was working at CPC, where all IT returns are directed, validated, scanned, digitised, processed and printed before refunds are initiated. Infosys is the managed services provider for the execution of CPC.

Internal investigations by the IT department revealed the accused were taking advantage of the time being taken to process the returns, which can go up to 60 days, and were directly contacting taxpayers with an assurance to reduce the processing time to less than seven working days.

Rs 3 lakh recovered

The three men were charging 4 per cent commission on the amount refunded. Police sources told STOI they suspected the accused have collected over Rs 15 lakh as commission. “We have recovered Rs 3 lakh from them so far. We aren’t sure since when have they been operating and how much money they have made,” a police officer said, while pointing out that cases have been booked under sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code.

“What is more baffling is how the accused succeeded in accessing the personal information of taxpayers and brazenly contacted the latter,” an officer said. Tthe accused teamed up to make a quick buck and targeted those who pay hefty tax amounts and were expecting returns above Rs 10 lakh.

Police said Kalyan had access to the contact numbers, addresses and other details of taxpayers . He passed on the information to the others, who would approach the taxpayers through phone calls and text messages. But their luck ran out when a person, who denied their services, alerted I-T officers about a possible data breach. The informant, who had recorded the audio conversation with the accused, shared the same with the department. The IT officers, who swung into action, started joining the dots before approaching police.

Joshi Srinath Mahadev, DCP (southeast), told TOI the accused have been arrested and sent to judicial custody. Further probe is under way.

480,['8/03/2020'],"Chidambaram calls SBI plan for Yes Bank ‘bizarre’, wants thorough probe","NEW DELHI: Former Union minister P Chidambaram on Saturday said the Yes Bank fiasco had been triggered by “mismanagement” of financial institutions under the BJP government.

Demanding a thorough probe into the collapse of the bank and fixing of accountability by RBI, he said it was “bizarre” that SBI was being asked to invest Rs 2,450 crore to pick up a 49% stake in the crisis-ridden bank under the government-approved bailout plan. “I don’t get the impression that SBI is a volunteer in this rescue act just as the LIC was not in the case of IDBI Bank ,” he said. He also slammed RBI for failing to notice that Yes Banks loan books were swelling at a rate of 35% per annum when the rest of the banking sector loans were increasing only in the range of 9.5-10%.

Yes Bank indulging in loan giving spree “isn’t banking but buccaneering”, Chidambaram said, adding that the loan book of Yes Bank was allowed to grow and jump manifold between March 2014 and 2019. “When we demitted office, the loan book of Yes Bank was Rs 55,633 crore. It climbed to Rs 2,41,499 crore in March 2019. I was not the finance minister during this period. So the finance minister should explain how this was allowed to be done,” he said.

Responding to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s charge that bad loans were created in the UPA regime, Chidambaram said bank mergers under the UPA regime and when YV Reddy was the RBI governor had ensured that “every penny” of the investors’ money was safe and returned to the beneficiaries.

Congress also asked whether RBI and government were aware that the bank was on a loan-giving spree.

The monuments include Taj Mahal.

Monuments like Red Fort, Qutub Minar , Humayun’s Tomb, Taj Mahal, Sun Temple in Konark , Mamallapuram, Ellora caves , Khajuraho monuments, and the Ajanta caves will be among the other sites that will grant free entry to all women. “Monuments across the country have baby feeding/childcare rooms. The service is available at the Taj Mahal,” Patel said, highlighting initiatives by the ASI and tourism ministry to improve experience for women tourists.

The ministry has also deployed women security guards along with separate entry and exit points for women at some monuments like Red Fort and Taj Mahal.

Superintending archeologist in ASI (Agra circle) Vasant K Swarnkar said, “It is for the first time that women, including foreigners, will get free entry to the ASI monuments.” While tickets for Indians at Taj costs Rs 50, foreigners have to pay Rs 1,100 besides a separate ticket of Rs 200 for entry to the main mausoleum. Of the daily visitors, 40-50% are women, officials said.

482,['8/03/2020'],"More women in ‘soft’ jobs, fewer managers, says UN body report","NEW DELHI: Representation of women in the workforce has been dipping, both in terms of numbers and quality, says a joint report by the United Nations Global Compact , a conglomeration of corporate bodies, and Grant Thornton that was released on Saturday, a day ahead of International Women’s Day.

The kind of work women find representation in has, meanwhile, been heavily skewed towards those that require soft skills — BPO, teaching and desk-based jobs — and not those that need managerial skills. Earlier, the Global Gender Gap Report , released by the World Economic Forum in 2019, had said women across the world would need 257 years to get economic parity with men. That parity is directly linked to the space women find in workplace.

“Barriers to women’s involvement vary by industry and, often, reflect industry cultures as well as overarching economic and social factors … Women are preferred in teaching, clerical and low-level jobs,” the latest report says. This translates into women not getting opportunities to take ownership of work they do. For instance, while 75% of farmers are rural women, only 13% own their land.

On similar lines, having women in leading positions in the workplace creates a more inclusive space. The evidence is compelling. Representation of women in businesses owned by women is very high — 90% in the manufacturing sector and 81% in the services sector. To put this in context, the labour force participation of women across sectors is 24.8%, down from 34% in 2006.

“A look at this year’s Fortune 500 India list shows only 29 companies have women leaders with executive powers — majority of which are in the banking and financial services sector,” the report says. This, however, does not mean the banking and financial services sector is doing better. The quality of representation, too, matters. “In general, banks tend to have a higher percentage of female workforce working as clerks than in other positions. Public sector banks have a higher share of female subordinates than private sector banks,” it adds. The report mentions that progressive iniatives to connect women to economy have been made from time to time. “For example, under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana , women hold 53 % of bank accounts,” it says.

483,['8/03/2020'],72% of business set-ups in Bengaluru lack a trade licence,"TimesView Most business establishments in Bengaluru are, astonishingly, unlicensed, according to BBMP. This is problematic on multiple counts and a nightmare for city planners and officials looking to apply common standards, say, for quality of products/services and for general safety. Traders operating without a licence are only a part of the problem. Impractical rules that make entire neighbourhoods off-limits to everyday shops and complicated procedures that affect compliance are also to blame. Hopefully, an online process will ease the situation and encourage small businesses to register their operations.

BENGALURU: Nearly 1.3 lakh of the 1.8 lakh commercial establishments operating in the city lack trade licences, senior BBMP officials said, citing the findings of a recent inspection.Most commercial establishments in Bengaluru are old and are running without trade licence, they said. Acting on a directive from BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar, the civic agency’s special projects commissioner Ravi Surpur conducted a manual drive to inspect trade establishments.The first inspection showed there were only 50,000 commercial establishments in the city. A startled Surpur ordered a second inspection, which revealed two of every three business set-ups were operating without authorisation. The BBMP exercise began on December 4, 2019 and ended on February 7, 2020. Blaming the existing zonal regulations for the situation, Kumar said, “It is impossible to not have a single commercial establishment in a residential area. This issue needs to be addressed.”West zone leads in unlicensed business establishments. According to BBMP, 50,274 (79%) of the 63,246 trade establishments in the zone lack licences. “Many establishments in west Bengaluru are really old and were set up decades ago. These people have been operating them for a long time,” said an official.South and west zones comprise some of the oldest parts of Bengaluru and are residential zones with roads less than 40 feet wide. Most commercial establishments here are meant for residents’ daily needs, the official added. They include salons, bakeries and tea shops, Kumar said. While west zone includes areas like Malleswaram, south zone has localities like Chickpet and Jayanagar.Officials harrass us: TradersWhen BBMP officials recently asked Chickpet traders to apply for a trade licence, they said they didn’t want to. “The traders often feel harassed by officials. To address this concern, we’ve gone in for an online trade licence renewal process,” Anil Kumar said. Niteesh Lal, a Chickpet trader, said BBMP officials harass traders in the guise of trade licence. “They ask for hefty bribes and we are forced to pay as we fear they will close our shops,” said Lal.In Mahadevapura, a comparatively recent zone, only 3,044 of the 8,090 establishments have a trade licence. “It is a newly developed zone and the roads are over 40 feet wide, which allows for setting up of commercial establishments,” an official said.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74533420,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-326069,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/72-of-business-set-ups-in-bengaluru-lack-a-trade-licence/articleshow/74533395.cms
484,['8/03/2020'],"Women in India Inc: 19% in 2016, 26% now","MUMBAI: India Inc appears to have moved the needle on gender diversity over the past four years. An average of seven sectors that a study by Avtar Group covered shows women ’s representation has risen from 18.7% in 2016 to 25.7% in 2019, and it is expected to cross 26% this year. Avtar is a leading diversity and inclusion (D&I) firm.

The report is based on data from across 353 companies that employ more than 10 lakh women.

Sector-wise, it’s a mixed bag though. Consulting , fast-moving consumer goods ( FMCG ) and information technology and information technology-enabled services (IT and ITeS) are expected to inch up on the percentage of women’s representation in 2020 while pharmaceuticals and hospitality could see a dip.

Saundarya Rajesh, founder president of Avtar, said, “Consulting industry has a greater diversity consciousness. With more women pursuing MBAs , the FMCG sector, too, has enhanced its gender diversity quotient. On the other hand, manufacturing, which is the lowest in terms of women’s representation (8% in 2019), is expected to bounce back this year to over 10%. The initial blip in women’s representation in manufacturing (see chart) could be an effect of market conditions. However, It could become a potent career option for women as the industry is becoming increasingly tech-enabled.”

Women’s representation in consulting, which has their highest representation in India, is estimated to reach 44% by 2020. Arvind Gupta, partner and head, management consulting at KPMG in India, said, “The top two attractive choices at B-schools are investment banking and consulting. Women candidates we interact with are willing to put their careers ahead to accommodate the consulting work requirements. At the same time, companies also try to make the work environment as conducive as possible to encourage more women into the profession. Companies also realize that women bring in a different perspective to problem solving.”

FMCG has seen an increase in women from 12% in 2016 to 20% in 2020. Companies are not only actively hiring from a gender distributed talent pool, they are also introducing innovative variants of flexibility, like location free roles, which is an important enabler for women.

Unilever’s Indian subsidiary Hindustan Unilever (HUL), which started on its D&I journey a decade back, is way ahead of the average FMCG industry statistics on gender diversity. Anuradha Razdan, executive director (HR), HUL, told TOI: “Ten years ago, Unilever was globally at 38% (women’s representation to the overall workforce). And now, it has reached 50%. HUL has been a key part of driving this gender balance. When we started a decade ago, we were the lowest performing geography at 18% gender diversity. Today, we are at 42%. We still have some room to cover. It’s our ambition that by 2022, we want to be gender balanced at 50% representation from women.”

With advancement in technology, manufacturing, which is ranked lowest in D&I among the sectors covered, is no longer seen as a manual labour-intensive sector. This has enabled companies to include women right from the shop-floor level.

Rajesh said with several manufacturing units starting operations in India’s Tier-2 and 3 cities, the opportunities they provide to the local women’s population is not only huge but also breaking gender stereotypes.

However, BFSI, which is seen as a beacon for gender diversity, with women’s representation rising from 25% in 2018 to 32% in 2019, is expected to see a slight decline to 31.5% this year. The sector continues to attract talent as commerce is an undergraduate stream that has one of the highest number of women pursuing the course and 49% of all enrolled graduates in commerce are women, according to All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) 2017-2018.

In pharmaceuticals, despite a focus on research and development, women’s representation has fallen from 23% in 2017 to 19% in 2019. This is projected to move down to 15.3% in 2020. “From our critical observations of similar industries, the sector can incorporate several best practices to become more gender inclusive. There should be a focus on building inclusive work environments. Companies can identify specific functions and roles that can render themselves to women’s employment and initiate gender diversity awareness in these areas,” said Rajesh.

In hospitality, women’s representation progressed from 24% in 2016 to 29% in 2019. As nearly 39% students enrolling in hospitality courses are women, there is available talent. “This is an industry that monetizes care-giving. Relationship-building is a huge driver for multiple lines of work in the hospitality sector. Women who are known to have higher emotional intelligence, are capable of building and growing careers in the industry. However, hospitality has become a feeder industry for allied industries like online services, which makes it difficult to retain women,” said Rajesh.

One of the earliest to adopt diversity consciousness, several IT and ITES companies have visible public programmes for diversity hiring and many of these companies look at the vast available talent pool of second career women as an important talent pool and have programmes to recruit these women. This sector thus has one of the highest representation of women. Over the years, the number has moved up from 31% in 2016 to 34% in 2019 and forecasts show that this can further move up to 35.6% in 2020.

CHENNAI: A woman who deserted her two children is unlikely to get any compensation for her husband's death in workplace, as the Madras high court directed a labour tribunal to delete her name and instead add the names of the couple's two children in the claim application.

Justice M Dhandapani also directed the owners of the construction company, in which the deceased father was a contractor, to deposit 7 lakh as interim compensation for the children.

The issue pertains to a plea moved by R Sivaprakasam and C Thirumurugan both builders for whom deceased Manikandan was working on contract basis to carry out centring work. They wanted the court to quash the charge sheet filed by the Poonamallee police charging them for offence under section 304 A (causing death by negligence) of IPC .

On November 30, 2012 during the course of employment, Manikandan got electrocuted when the iron rod which he was using accidentally touched a live electric wire.

When the plea came up for hearing, the petitioners submitted that the charge framed under Section 304-A of IPC does not stand attracted, as the ingredients for an offence to be made out under the provision is that the death should have been caused by the person by doing any rash or negligent act. The death had happened not on account of any negligent act of the petitioners, but more due to the negligence of the deceased himself, they argued.

They further submitted that in fact the wife of the deceased has deserted her two children and remarried and that they are willing to deposit Rs 5 lakh for the benefit of the future of the children on humanitarian grounds.

On inquiry by the court , it came to light that the woman has in fact deserted the children and that the elder brother of the deceased is taking care of the kids at present. The court was further informed that the woman is not pursuing a claim made under for workmen's compensation seeking 15 lakh compensation from the employers of her husband.

The chief medical officer has initiated an inquiry into their conduct.“I have sought a report from the chief medical superintendents of the District Combined Hospital and MMG District Hospital on the doctor who quarantined himself … The conduct of the doctor was unbecoming and created unnecessary panic. Once the reports come in, action could be initiated against him and the two other doctors,” said chief medical officer NK Gupta.On Friday, one doctor from District Combined Hospital had isolated himself after he found out a ward boy in his hospital had been inside an ambulance in which a suspected coronavirus patient — a 57-year-old businessman who had just returned from Tehran — was carried. Two other doctors from the hospital which sent the ambulance, MMG District Hospital, had then written to the chief medical officer asking for permission to isolate themselves. The doctors alleged no safety protocol had been followed while transporting the patient and the driver and emergency medical technician had not been told they were transporting a suspected coronavirus patient.The chief medical officer, who had on Thursday said the paramedics had only worn N-95 marks because other equipment was “not needed”, said on Friday that the paramedics had “protective gear on”.The chief medical superintendent of MMG District Hospital, Ravinder Rana, confirmed he has been asked for a report. “The doctors resumed duty on Saturday after their apprehensions were addressed in a counselling session,” he said.The doctor who had quarantined himself, however, stood his ground about the concerns he had raised on Friday. “I had decided to keep myself in self-quarantine after I realised I have come in contact with the paramedic team that had transported the Covid-19-positive patient without necessary precautions. I could not possibly have allowed myself to mingle with people after that. My decision to isolate myself came after I did not get the appropriate response from higher-ups in the hospital when I told them about my apprehensions,” the doctor told TOI.",noida,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74534311,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-184607,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/doctor-who-isolated-self-resumes-work-a-day-later/articleshow/74532739.cms

Accordingly, we went to Mehta Buildding and Bagri Market. A firm in Maharashtra is still supplying the masks of different qualities, prices ranging between Rs 7 and Rs 80. We have asked sellers not to charge anything extra for products manufactured by this company,” said Biswajit Ghosh, DC (EB).

It was found during the raid that none of the shops carried the MRP on the masks. At Mehta Building, TOI came across several customers who were asked to pay Rs 300 for one mask. “We do not even know if the mask I bought for Rs 300 is of the N-95 variety,” said Kaushik Roy, a resident of Behala.

“We had three objectives — one is to ensure that prices are not jacked up. The second is to stop hoarding. And the third objective is to understand the supply chain and we have come to know that there indeed is a demand-supply crisis,” said an officer.

According to sources, the market for masks in India has swelled up to Rs 450 crore over last two months from about Rs 200 crore annually. “Earlier, the demand was for 6 lakh-7 lakh a month. Now sales have crossed 10 lakh a month,” a stockist has informed EB officials.

494,['8/03/2020'],Breakthrough in Delhi riots probe: One held for killing sweet shop staffer,"Vehicles which were set ablaze by demonstrators in Delhi's Shiv Vihar area (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Making its second big breakthrough in its probe in the north-east Delhi riots, the special investigation team (SIT) of Delhi Police has arrested a man, Mohammed Shehnawaz , in the case of murder of sweet shop employee Dilbar Singh Negi (20). It had earlier arrested AAP councillor Tahir Hussain in the case of murder of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma.

Shehnawaz alias Shanu (27) is a resident of Shiv Vihar. Negi, who worked at one Anil sweet shop in the area, was allegedly brutally killed by Shehnawaz and associates on February 24. This was during the violence that broke out near the Shiv Vihar tri-junction in which Shehnawaz and several other persons were seen throwing stones and ransacking and setting fire to several shops there, said police. ""Shehnawaz had entered a book store and a sweet shop godown at A-29, Chaman Park, Shiv Vihar, and torched both places along with other rioters,"" said a senior officer.

The body of Negi was found at the Chaman Park shop on February 26. Both hands had been chopped and the body burnt. Police said Shehnawaz and his accomplices took away Negi's hands and dumped them elsewhere. Police are quizzing him to find out where the limbs were dumped. An FIR was filed after eyewitnesses identified Shehnawaz as the main aggressor leading the mob on February 24.

Police: Shehnawaz said he followed his friends

The police are interrogating Shehnawaz and raids are being conducted to arrest his accomplices. It was found that he was in touch with local criminals who were his regular customers and had accompanied them during the riots.

Shehnawaz, according to the police, has said that he owned a shop selling cigarettes near the sweet shop where Negi used to work. He claimed to have attacked him since he had seen his friends in the area doing the same at other shops and believed he could get away with it.

Meanwhile, at his village near Pauri Garhwal, Uttarakhand, Negi’s family is struggling to make both ends meet. “He used to send some of his earnings to us and save a little as he planned to complete his graduation. The shop-owner who had employed him had given him refuge at his house. In fact, he was to return home a few days before Holi and celebrate the festival with us,” said his elder brother, Jitender.

According to the family, Negi had gone to Delhi just four months back to earn so that he could look after his family of four. His father, Gopal, a former government contractor at Pauri is bedridden. He had suffered paralysis a few years back. While Jitender stayed back at home to look after the family, Negi went to Delhi with the help of a relative to look for work.

“We got to know about the incident from the shop-owner who employed him. My parents have been inconsolable since then. We have spent whatever savings we had on our father’s treatment. Apart from a plot of land here, we don’t have much. I can’t even go out to work since my parents would be left alone,” said Jitender.

495,['8/03/2020'],ED seizes PO’s Patiala house in synthetic drug racket case,"In a late night operation, 13 member of ED team sealed the house

PATIALA: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday seized a prime residential property owned by Harpreet Singh Lamba, a proclaimed offender in the multi-crore synthetic drug racket run by Arjuna awardee wrestler-turned-cop Jagdish Singh Bhola. The latter was arrested in the drug trade case in 2015.

Lamba was arrested by Fatehgarh Sahib cops after busting of the multi-crore drug racket. He was booked under various sections of the IPC and Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) Act along with Bhola and others. He has been absconding after he jumped bail granted by the Punjab and Haryana high court in March 2013. He was later declared a proclaimed offender by the court.

The ED investigation into money laundering by the accused led it to the house owned by Harpreet Singh in Patial’s Officer Colony valued at Rs 3 crore. The ED’s Jalandhar officer issued a provisional order to seize the house in September 2010 which was sent to the adjudicating authority of the central government constituted under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act at New Delhi. After the orders were confirmed, the ED served an eviction notice to Harpreet Singh’s wife in 2017, who was staying at this house then.

She told the ED officials that as no prior notice had been served to her, she needed some time to vacate it. In 2019 the ED again tried to take possession of the house, but at that time one Manpreet Singh was staying at the house and he again said that he had not been served with any notice and needed some more time.

When ED officer Davender Sharma and another official of the ED Jalandhar went to the house on Saturday at 3.30pm along with a 13-member team of the Patiala Police, two families were there -- one of Manpreet Singh and the other of one Rupinder Singh. He said both the families requested for more time, but since the eviction notice had already been served, the ED decided to go ahead with taking over possession of the house.

Both the families were allowed time to remove their belongings and by 11:30 pm an official seal was put on the house completing the seizure process.

Harpreet who belonged to Banwala village in Patran block of Patiala district was booked in FIR number 45. As per the official documents, he also owns other properties in the state and the process to confiscate these is underway. He also owned a luxury car, which was to be confiscated, but could never be traced.

Harpreet’s father, Baljit Singh was also a co-accused in the same case, but he died during the pendency of the case in the designated PMLA court at Mohali.

496,['8/03/2020'],TikToker ‘having fun’ held for firing shots into Delhi ACP’s flat in Noida,"Pinit Sisodia flashes guns in several of his TikTok videos

NOIDA: Noida: A 30-year-old TikToker , with a “passion for guns and other deadly weapons”, has been arrested for allegedly firing at the 17th-floor of a Delhi Police ACP in Jaypee Kosmos society on Friday night.

Punit Sisodia, who works as a marketing manager with a private hospital in Noida and lives in the same society, has told police he had fired six shots in the air from inside his black Scorpio “just for fun” and had no intention to attack anyone. On Saturday morning, police stopped Punit’s SUV at a checkpost near Panchsheel underpass and arrested him after sustained questioning.

The Jaypee flat, at which two of the shots were fired around 12.40am on Friday, is owned by Mayank Bansal, Delhi Police’s Vivek Vihar ACP. Although the police officer stays in Delhi, his elderly parents live in the Noida flat. They had just exited the room when the bullets riddled the window panes and got stuck in the ceiling. Guards at Kosmos had seen a black Scorpio parked near the main gate, which leads to tower 18, where the elderly couple stay.

Akhilesh Kumar, additional commissioner of police (law and order), said they had received a call from Bansal’s wife, informing them about the firing. “A police team had reached the spot immediately after getting the call and a primary investigation was conducted. Guards at the society and a few eyewitnesses had told us about a black Scorpio that was parked outside the society during the firing,” Kumar said. Based on a complaint by the ACP’s family, an FIR was registered against unknown persons under sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 427 (mischief) of the Indian Penal Code.

On Friday morning, police scanned CCTV footage of the housing society, but did not get any substantial evidence. “However, we had some inputs on the black Scorpio. We followed the car and traced the accused. On Saturday morning, we stopped the car near Panchsheel underpass. The accused was in the car and he was carrying a licenced revolver,” Kumar said.

Police claimed Punit had repeatedly told his interrogators that he had fired in the air to test his revolver and did not intend to shoot at anyone. “The youth told us he was returning from a friend’s house and fired from inside his car to test his gun. He said it was just for fun and the bullets shattered the window of the police officer’s flat by mistake,” the ACP added.

Police have recovered the licenced revolver from Punit along with 106 live bullets. The 30-year-old has been booked in a separate case of Arms Act and his gun licence cancelled.

Additional deputy commissioner of police Ranjvijay Singh said the accused is an avid TikToker and has a few videos in his phone where he can be seen wielding a gun.

“He claimed to have a passion for guns and other deadly weapons. He said he had no information on who were inside the flat. His phone has a few videos where he can be seen flashing a revolver. Our investigation has revealed it wasn’t an intentional firing. The bullets were fired in the air and two of them hit the flat window,” Singh said.

Punit was remanded in judicial custody after being produced in a Noida court on Saturday.
