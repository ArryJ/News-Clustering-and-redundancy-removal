0,['23/03/2020'],Will the Hubballi Ankola railway project be doomsday for the Kali Tiger reserve?,"‘We will take the issue to the Supreme Court again’

Cannot support such harm to the environment: Sowmya Reddy

Activists urge citizens to support the protest

A hub of protected species

‘Wildlife board has a moral responsibility to protect forests’

In yet another testimony that development projects take precedence over the environment, the state government on Friday approved the controversial Hubballi-Ankola rail line, a project that environmentalists have been opposing for over two decades. Ironically, the decision to okay destruction of close to 600 hectares of forest area came on the eve of the International Forest Day (celebrated on March 21), the theme for which was forests and biodiversity.It also comes not long after it was proposed to reduce the eco-sensitive zone around the Bannerghatta Biological Park by 100 sq km, and at a time when forest land in Kodagu district continues to be under threat. Naturally, environmentalists are peeved that the government has allowed a railway line that will cut through the Kali Tiger Reserve.J Manjunath, the secretary of the Wilderness Club, which has been at the forefront of the protests against the project and taken the issue to the Apex Court earlier, says, “The issue at hand is not just about a railway line. As part of the project, 327 bridges would be constructed, 50 of which will be inside the sensitive zone, as well as 12 railway stations. The 168.4-kilometre line will also have 34 tunnels of 3.4 kilometers length each, for which the Railways wants 594 hectare of land. The state claims only 2.34 lakh trees would be destroyed, but in my estimation, twice that much will be gone. Forests take a million years to evolve and all that will be lost, which will have a direct impact on the rainfall patterns. The people of Karnataka will suffer, as we depend on the Ghats for water. 63 rivers flow through the Ghats and are a source of life for the state.”He adds that they were the first to file a petition with the Central Empowered Committee in 2006 against the diversion of Forest Land falling in the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats . ""Everyone rejected the project. It was rejected the by Central Empowered Committee, The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) back then. So, I do not understand why the state wants to revive it. But if they try to go ahead with it, we will write to the Asian Bank, UNESCO, World Bank and other organisations that are giving them money for conservation purposes and show them just what the Indian government is doing. We went to Supreme Court earlier, we will seek justice again if required,"" he adds.MLA Sowmya Reddy, who was a member of the State Wildlife Board, resigned from the post in protest against the decision. ""I have decided to resign from the state wildlife board because the board with the leadership of Hon’ble CM BS Yediyurappa has decided to implement the Hubli-Ankola Railway project which is harmful to the environment and wildlife. I am not against development, but I cannot support something that is harmful to the environment where there was an alternative, my conscience will not allow me to. Natural disasters in the recent past have shown us that nothing is bigger than preserving the exciting nature"" she wrote online.Other environmentalists have also come in support of protests againsts these attacks on the state’s forest cover. On Saturday, an online petition against the Hubballi-Ankola railway line was floated, seeking the prime minister’s intervention in the matter, which notched up a few thousand signatures within hours. Urging more people to raise their voices against the project, environmentalist Akhilesh Chipli from SWAN and Man (Save-Wild-Atmosphere--Nature and Man) says, ""This is a totally unnecessary and disastrous project, which will affect some 600 hectares of pristine forest and destroy over two lakh trees, some of which are 200-300 years old. The repercussions of such a move would be unimaginable, so it is time to come out and let our voices be heard, at least online, if not on the ground.""The forests where the Hubballi-Ankola railway zone has been earmarked are rich in fauna, represented by 29 species of mammals, 256 species of birds, eight species of reptiles and 50 species of butterflies. Majority of the mammals belong to IUCN Red List and are protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 .(Source - 2018 Site Inspection Report on the Diversion of 595.64 ha of forest land in Karwar, Yellapura and Dharwad Divisions for the construction of new broad gauge railway line of Hubballi – Ankola to Ministry of Environment and Forest)Yhe members of the Karnataka Wildlife Board Members should quit en masse, as the chief minister and the chairman have gone ahead and approved a project that will spell doom for the Western Ghats.

The need to extend Janata Curfew is the right decision,” opposition leader Digambar Kamat, said.The sentiment was echoed by Khaunte who said an “immediate lockdown”, similar to ones declared by Maharashtra and Rajasthan, was the only “scientific way of controlling” the spread of the infectious disease that has claimed six lives in India and infected over 350 individuals.The opposition also urged Sawant to roll out support measures for citizens, especially the poor and elderly who do not have a steady source of income.“We need to unhesitatingly use Goa chief minister’s relief fund and disaster management fund to make sure essentials are provided to every affected Goan,” Khaunte said.Kamat, while stressing on the availability of essential commodities like milk and vegetables also asked the government to provide a “financial package” for those who depend on daily wages.GFP president Vijai Sardesai was a bit more specific. While praising participation in the Janata Curfew, he also stressed on the loss of wages by casual workers and those engaged in the informal sector.“When there is a janata curfew, those who depend on daily wages and workers in the informal economy need income support. The government must think of a package for small and medium businesses and the tourism sector.

NEW DELHI: Even as the day-long nationwide “janata curfew” called for by Prime Minister Narendra Modi drew to a close on Sunday evening, much of India came under a lockdown with most state governments extending total public transport shutdown and other restrictions for varying periods to fight the spread of Covid-19.While many governments brought entire states or Union territories under the lockdown, some others ordered that those districts which have reported Covid-19 cases will continue to remain shut. However, essential services like hospitals, telecom, pharmacies, grocery, milk and vegetables will remain open.In Mumbai, the administration swung into action immediately after the “janata curfew” with the police virtually imposing a curfew till 5am on Monday.According to the police order, “presence or movement of one or more persons is prohibited” in the limits of Mumbai city. The railways have also announced cancellation of all local trains on Central and Western Railway, while Section 144 of CrPC was imposed in all urban areas.According to the health ministry, at least 82 districts in 23 states across the country were shut by 8pm on Sunday.The decision on lockdown followed a high-level review meeting chaired by the cabinet secretary and principal secretary to the Prime Minister with chief secretaries and health secretaries of all states where the Centre emphasised the need to break the transmission chain to contain Covid-19. The Centre also empowered the states to extend the list of districts for shutdown based on their risk assessment.“This lockdown is a natural and logical extension of the ‘janata curfew’ and is vital to break the chain of transmission,” said health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal after the meeting. All public transport, including train and Metro rail services and local and inter-state bus services, have been suspended till March 31. Good trains, however, will continue to ensure availability of essential commodities.Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir and Chandigarh were among the states and Union territories that were completely brought under lockdown on Sunday till March 31. On Saturday night, Rajasthan was the first state in the country to come under complete lockdown.In Madhya Pradesh, 20 districts, including Bhopal, have been put under lockdown.UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced that 15 districts in the state, including state capital Lucknow and Noida and Ghaziabad in the NCR, will come under complete lockdown till March 25. The other districts are Agra, Varanasi, Lakhimpur Kheri, Kanpur, Aligarh, Gorakhpur, Azamgarh, Saharanpur, Bareilly, Prayagraj, Meerut and Moradabad.“The lockdown has been announced to sanitise cities to counter the spread of Covid-19,” said Yogi. The CM indicated that more districts will be brought under lockdown in days to come when he said that “people should be prepared for more measures like ‘janata curfew’ in future to contain the spread of the disease”.In Bengal, the Mamata Banerjee government declared a complete lockdown in Kolkata, Salt Lake and New Town cities as well as the districts of Howrah, Malda, Murshidabad, North Dinajpur, Hooghly, Birbhum and West Burdwan from 5pm on March 22 till the midnight of March 27. Almost all municipal towns in 16 other districts of the state have also been brought under the shutdown. Apart from essential commodities and medicines, the state government has also exempted “e-commerce of groceries and food items and home delivery of food” from the shutdown.While entire Punjab and Chandigarh were brought under lockdown, in the neighbouring Himachal and Haryana, districts where Covid-19 cases have been reported were put under curbs. Of the total 22 districts in Haryana, lockdown was announced in seven — Gurgaon, Sonipat, Panchkula, Rohtak, Jhajjar, Faridabad and Panipat. In Himachal, Kangra district was brought under shutdown.The Bihar government ordered lockdown in the headquarters of all 38 districts, 101 sub-divisional towns and 534 blocks with immediate effect till March 31. Karnataka brought nine of its districts under lockdown till March 31. Odisha imposed week-long lockdown in five districts and nine urban local bodies from Sunday. The Naveen Patnaik government has also suspended all interstate bus services.Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram – which have remained Covid19-free so far — became the first northeastern states where lockdown came under force from Sunday midnight. While in Nagaland it is for an indefinite period, the Arunachal Pradesh government said it will start at 5pm on Monday and extend till March 31 midnight. In Mizoram, the lockdown will run for a week beginning Sunday.However, while most of governments ordered lockdown in their respective regions, Kerala the second worst affected state in the country, dithered on the Centre’s advisory to shut down 10 of its districts. “At present, we have a shutdown in Kasaragod and restrictions in other select districts. We will discuss if such a shutdown is needed in other districts too… There will be restrictions and they will be decided on Monday,” chief secretary Tom Jose said.The Covid-19 infection claimed three more lives in the country on Sunday, taking the toll from the disease to seven, even as states continued to report a high number of cases, which have now touched 400.On Sunday, 68 new cases were reported by 14 states in all, the second highest for a single day after 77 cases reported on Saturday.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74765465,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-311880,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-officially-or-unofficially-india-in-lockdown-restrictions-put-in-place-in-82-districts/articleshow/74765462.cms

NEW DELHI: After expanding its testing policy to all hospitalised patients with pneumonia or severe flu symptoms, the government said its strategy remained adequate and there was no need for “indiscriminate testing” as isolation and breaking the chain of transmission were the key to containing the spread of Covid-19 in India.India’s approach to testing will remain largely focused on symptomatic cases with travel history or those who have come in contact with positive cases. The travel history and home or institutional quarantine list is, however, fairly extensive even as all international arrivals have been suspended till March 31 when the situation will be reviewed.At a briefing on Sunday, the health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) maintained that there was no need for panic as government labs had the capacity to test 50,000-70,000 samples a week, apart from additional capacity being ramped up in private diagnostic labs. Some 60 private labs have applied for permission, which is being granted. “Indiscriminate testing is not to be done. Isolation, isolation, isolation is the key to controlling spread,” ICMR director-general Balram Bhargava said. India has so far tested over 17,000 samples, of which 360 tested positive till Sunday. At present, it is testing around 5,000 samples a week and the number should rise with the involvement of private labs and wider testing criteria.Compared to India, other countries are testing more samples and most of them have still failed to stop transmission. According to Balram Bhargava, the US was testing 26,000 samples a week, whereas France was doing 10,000 and the UK was testing 16,000 every week. India’s government sector labs alone could do around 10,000 samples every day, Bhargava said. Bhargava said those who were in isolation and who showed symptoms must be tested.There remains a possibility that in many cases, as much as 80%, the symptoms do not proceed beyond mild manifestations. Currently, 111 public labs are testing Covid-19 suspects, whereas 60 private labs have applied to ICMR for approval. The council has already started registering these labs, which will expand the network of labs and collection centres significantly. The government has also capped the price for Covid-19 testing at Rs 4500 for private labs, while urging them to do it for free or at subsidised rates.India has, so far, adopted a conservative approach on testing, maintaining that unnecessary testing will not help but only spread panic and waste resources. In response to a question, Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry, said 1,200 ventilators had been ordered.He also said norms of personal protection equipment were in place and had been recently revised. As per the current testing protocol, all those with international travel history in the last 14 days should be in quarantine and get tested only when they are symptomatic with fever, cough or breathlessness. Besides, all direct and high risk contacts, including those who live in the same household and healthcare workers who came in direct contact of a confirmed case, should be tested once between day 5 and day 14 of coming in contact with a positive case.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74765506,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-223893,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-indiscriminate-testing-breaking-chain-is-key-govt/articleshow/74765507.cms

NEW DELHI: The national capital is entirely under prohibitory orders for the first time. Delhi Police imposed Section 144 of the CrPC from 9pm on Sunday to implement the lockdown necessitated by the novel coronavirus outbreak. The order will remain in force till March 31.With all of Haryana under Section 144 and Noida and Ghaziabad as well, it means the restrictions that don’t allow five or more people to gather in one place now extend across the vast urban sprawl of Delhi-NCR. Delhi Police will allow no demonstrations, processions, protests or social gatherings.Only shops selling essential commodities such as milk and vegetables will remain open. “Any gathering — social, cultural, political religious, academic, sports, seminar, conference — is prohibited. Organisation of weekly markets (except for vegetables, fruits and essential commodities), concerts, exhibitions, etc is prohibited. Guided group tours, conducted by various private tour operators, are prohibited,” said the order signed by the Delhi Police chief.Police have also specified that any individual who has tested positive for Covid-19 or is suspected to have it has to take measures for prevention and stay in home or institutional quarantine.“The person shall co-operate to render assistance or comply with the direction of the surveillance personnel,” said the order. Violations of this are punishable under Section 188 (disobedience of an order duly promulgated by a public servant).Asked about the impact of the prohibitory orders on the ongoing Citizenship Amendment Act protest at Shaheen Bagh, a police officer said, “We went to the protest site and hardly three to four people were present. If more people gather and violate the order, action will be taken.”Besides, with state borders also being sealed, Delhi Police will keep a check on any vehicle entering the capital. Delhi Police spokesperson Mandeep Singh Randhawa said, “Apart from emergency and essential services, we will prevent all vehicles from entering. If any commuter wishes to enter the city, they would be screened and asked about their urgency to travel before being allowed to enter.”According to the order, police will also not allow any goods carriers except ones carrying food or other essential items. Gurugram police did not issue any orders but police chief Mohammad Akil told TOI people had willingly complied with lockdown and they did not want to put unnecessary restrictions.Police have advised Delhiites to avoid travelling to NCR cities like Gurugram, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad unless it is for essential work.

Delhi’s border with Haryana and UP will be sealed. “People who come out to provide or avail essential services will be allowed on their self-declaration,” the order said.The government has clarified that no document will be sought from a person who is out to provide or avail of any essential service.

Certain exceptions have been made to ensure essential services,” Kejriwal tweeted after a joint presser with LG Anil Baijal.All offices, shops and commercial establishments, factories, workshops, weekly bazaars, religious places, construction works will remain closed and any gathering of more than five persons will continue to remain banned, Kejriwal announced in a joint press conference with lieutenant governor Anil Baijal at Raj Niwas on Sunday evening. The government has exempted diaries, grocery shops, milk plants, cashier and teller services in banks including ATMs, municipal and water services, general provision stores, home delivery from restaurants, print and electronic media, e-commerce of all essential goods, medical shops, petrol pumps, law enforcement agencies, police, health services, fire, electricity, and other essential services from the lockdown.“Delhi has 27 confirmed coronavirus cases, out of which six are via local transmission, and 21 are those with travel history.

The order has also been sent to the Airport Authority of India chairperson for compliance. Those taking domestic flights will obviously face the problem of commuting to or from the airport at a time when Metro, taxi and bus services won't be available.

Please don’t create panic in this situation and inform us. Please connect to the customer care at least (sic).”

Anuragg Verma complained about poor health check-up being done at Patna airport. “There is no screening at Patna airport. There is a small desk near the entry gate where people are stopped purely on suspicion. Doctors sitting there are gossiping among themselves (sic),” he tweeted.

Patna airport director Bhupesh CH Negi, however, claimed that the thermal screening and other necessary check-ups of passengers were being done by the medical team provided by the state government.

Meanwhile, the autorickshaws in the state would remain off the road on March 23 as well in view of Covid-19 spread.

24,['23/03/2020'],Lockdown hits plan to get skeletal staff at banks,"(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Banks will be open for only essential services, such as cash and cheque deposits, cash withdrawal and government transactions.

However, with the lockdown in 75 districts, senior bankers say that manning all branches, even with a skeletal staff, will pose challenges.

State governments like Maharashtra have announced a lockdown except for essential services. So, banks are excluded as they come under essential services. Banks can only shut shop if the necessary orders are issued by the government under the 139-year-old Negotiable Instruments Act.

A statement by the Indian Banks’ Association on basic services was issued before the government on Sunday announced a lockdown in 75 districts, including most of the metros. Bank officials say that in cities like Mumbai, getting staff to branches would be a challenge as most are dependent on public transport, which will be skeletal.

Many branches are looking at getting employees to work in branches by rotation, although this will end up exposing all employees to risk. One branch manager said that employees who were at higher risk because of health conditions were allowed to stay at home. Some banks are looking at asking staff to report to the nearest branch. But even in such cases, the attendance will have to be in pairs as the core banking system follows a ‘maker’ and ‘checker’ system using biometric authentication.

While no ‘work from home’ option has been extended to frontline staff, branch staff say that they fear exposure. Not all staff members are willing to take up the cashier function and some even fear that handling currency notes may not be hygienic.

Private banks are allowing personal bankers and relationship managers to work from home. While most banks provide ‘anywhere banking’, some customers were upset at being slapped with hefty charges for depositing cash in a ‘non-home’ branch.

On one hand, there was pressure on the regulator to shorten trading hours, which would allow office staff to cut down on exposure to other people, on the other hand, in the government , there were concerns if such a move could send wrong signals to global investors about one of the largest economies of the world.

There was demand for a complete closure of trading for a few days too, however, that was opposed by a large section of brokers, especially those carrying large open positions. Also the expiry of this month’s derivatives contracts are due on March 26, which also weighed on the regulator and the government, sources said.

Through similarly worded statements, the NSE and the BSE said all segments of the exchanges “will operate as usual on Monday”.The government, Sebi and the stock exchanges are expected to take a decision about the trading on the exchanges on Monday, sources said.

The Bengal government has allayed fears of any problem in the availability of essential items during the lockdown period from March 23 to March 27.State food and civil supplies minister Jyotipriya Mallick said, “I am convening an emergency meeting at noon on Monday with all the ration dealers, LPG dealers, kerosene dealers, petrol pump operators and representatives of oil marketing companies. I will issue a guideline for emergency services. I have withdrawn the weekly closure of ration shops; they will be operative all seven days.”The agriculture marketing department will ration potato and onion sales from Monday through the Sufal outlets. “We have decided to allot 3kg potato and 1kg onion, which will be sold below the market price,” said an official.Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s market department has constituted a team to check that people don’t indulge in panic buying or hoarding. At Koley Market, buyers will be allowed to buy only 5kg each of potato and onion and 2kg each of ginger and garlic. Retailers will be allowed to buy a sack each, sources said.Traders said there will be a slight shortage of vegetables in the city markets as 90% of the day’s supply comes by train. These small vendors and farmers have no capacity to hire goods vehicles to reach out to city markets. “If the government can find some way out for these marginal farmers and vendors, they will be saved from losses,” said West Bengal Farmers and Vendors’ Association president Kamal Dey.“They need to carry a board saying ‘essential items’ on their vehicles so that they are not blocked by law-enforcing agencies,” said Mallick.He added that all fuel stations will be open, but the employees of these emergency services must take adequate measures — like use of masks, gloves and frequent use of hand-sanitizers.Pradip Mazumdar, agriculture advisor to the state, said, “There will be no dearth of commodities and we have enough supply of staples. The government will take measures if any person faces any issue on availability or prices.”Consumer affairs minister Sadhan Pandey said, “If people have any problem with price, quality and quantity of essential items, they can lodge a complaint with my office.”However, some commodities which come from other states may face some issues. Fish and egg, much of which come from Andhra Pradesh, as well as some fruits and onion come from Maharastra , may be short in supply since interstate freight movement is stopped.“The government has allowed movement of essential items and we hope there will not be any trouble in supplying goods to the city.

Most non-life policies are annual contracts. While they can be purchased at any time of the year, on most occasions it is done to coincide with the fiscal as it makes accounting for the premium much easier.The Insurance Brokers Association of India ( IBAI ) has written to the regulator to consider permitting extension of existing policies for a minimum of 60 days by paying pro-rata premium at existing terms and rates. For this extended cover to be seamless, insurance companies need to receive the premium before the earlier policy expires.“The Indian insurance market adheres to Section 64VB of the Insurance Act, which further increases the complexity of policies expiring on March 31, 2020,” said IBAI president Sanjay Kedia in a letter to the chairman of sector regulator Irdai.According to Kedia, Lloyds of London has already allowed an extension to existing policies due to the Covid-19 threat. Most global insurance markets have also provided relaxation to policyholders through an auto-extension clause.“Administratively ensuring compliance to Section 64VB will be very challenging for both policyholders as well as insurers. Thus, we request the authority to consider temporarily waiving the 64VB clause for another 30 days, so that policyholders may continue their coverage and make premium payable at a later date,” IBAI said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74770879,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110381,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cos-cover-may-lapse-on-shutdowns/articleshow/74764958.cms

The transport department issued a notification on Sunday regarding the online registration and tax payment on www.vahan.nic.in portal from March 22 till March 31. The deadline for the registration of BS-IV vehicles in India is March 31.

The district transport officers (DTOs) have been asked to complete the registration of BS-IV vehicles on priority basis, while the other work (like permit and driving licence) will remain suspended till March-end.

State transport department secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said entry of common people was banned in all district transport offices to prevent spread of coronavirus. “Besides registration of BS-IV vehicles and tax payment, no other work would be carried out at district transport offices till March 31,” he said.

Agarwal added, “Such vehicles cannot be registered from April 1 as the Supreme Court has ordered that no new motor vehicles with BS-IV emission norms can be sold after March 31.”

Meanwhile, district transport officers (DTOs) have been asked to ban entry of people at district transport offices till further order.

“People have to upload all the required documents, including vehicle papers, on Vahan portal. Papers will be scrutinised by the staff at respective district transport offices and accordingly registration slip will be issued to them. Now, there is no need of hard copies of documents. The tax payment can also be done online,” Agarwal said.

He said people, who purchased new vehicles, would have to coordinate with the automobile dealers. “They will fill the online form and upload the other required documents. Meanwhile, we have waived off technical inspection of the fully-built vehicles till March 31,” Agarwal said.

These samples if tested after 6hours doesn’t show the real result. That's why many results are showing negative. Why Central & state governments are not coordinating?

Either fight it hard now or face a massive epidemic. Testing and Testing alone can mitigate the eventual outbreak. Buy testing kits, setup labs! (sic).”Apart from testing centres, Tejashwi also expressed concern over shortage of several other essential medical equipment. “The third most populous state, Bihar, needs to build its capacity manifolds to fight #Corona. Few testing kits, few personal protective equipment (PPE), not enough ventilators, not enough ICU beds, not enough ECMOs. Ramp up procurement of these or else exponential outbreak is looming (sic),” he tweeted.Meanwhile, health department principal secretary Sanjay Kumar told a news channel on Sunday evening that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has approved sample collection kits to be provided to the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), Patna, as well.“As of now, we have connected all government hospitals in all 38 districts to nine medical college and hospitals for collecting samples.

NAGPUR: The local crime branch (LCB) of rural police have arrested five persons for gang-raping a 19-year-old girl and thrashing her friend in a jungle near Navegaon village on March 17.

The call, made by the accused, threatening the survivor of putting her gang rape videos on social media if she reported the matter to the cops, was traced and five arrests were made. The LCB sleuths, led by PI Anil Jittawar, busted the gang within 24 hours.

The accused have been identified as Akash Lende, Sunil alias Sumit Gawli , Suraj Mane , Chandrashekhar Kadav and Pankaj Kuthve .

According to the police, the survivor and her friend, who hails from the city, had gone to a temple in Khairi village on March 17. They were returning to the city when suddenly their bike suffered a breakdown. They were trying to start the bike when five accused approached them. The accused started abusing the duo and snatched their mobile phones.

While one of the accused was busy thrashing the survivor’s friend, the others took her to a secluded place where they took turns to rape her. Later, the accused took the duo to the Kuhi bus stop from where they fled.

The accused also took the mobile number of the survivor from her friend’s mobile. They later called and threatened her.

On Saturday, the survivor approached tehsil police and lodged a complaint. Tehsil cops sent a zero FIR to Kuhi police station as the incident took place in their jurisdiction. After the rural police swung into action, LCB sleuths nabbed the accused by tracking the mobile number from which they had called the survivor.

PUNE: The city will get very light to light rain along with thunderstorm, dusty wind and hailstorm in isolated locations in the next few days, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Sunday.

“There is a high chance of very light to light rainfall in the city and the district between Tuesday evening and Wednesday. It will also be associated with some thundery activity. Occurrence of hailstorm in isolated locations in the district is also likely,” head of the forecast division of IMD, Pune, Anupam Kashyapi told TOI on Sunday.

The Met department said these conditions could impact the day and night temperatures. “The maximum temperature would hover between 32-33°C. The night temperature would remain between 17-18°C for the next few days,” Kashyapi said.

“There would be wind discontinuity in the easterlies that will develop over Madhya Maharashtra to coastal Karnataka, and it will fluctuate between Vidarbha, coastal Karnataka and Goa. As a result, there will be an interaction between winds coming from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. This will bring light rain over the Madhya Maharashtra region, including Pune,” Kashyapi said.

On Sunday, the Shivajinagar and Lohegaon observatories recorded maximum temperatures of 36.2°C and 36.6°C day respectively. The minimums recorded were 17.6°C and 19.6°C respectively.

Employees continue work

As many as 100 staffers and experts working for the weather forecast division of IMD will work as per the daily schedule. “Monitoring daily weather phenomenon is essential and our staffers and experts will continue their work with due precautions in place. Working under the current circumstances is a challenging task but they have responded positively to the national cause,” Kashyapi said.

40,['23/03/2020'],Maharashtra: Court grants interim bail to actor in Rs 97 lakh cheating case,"Representative image

PUNE: Additional sessions judge S M Agarkar on Saturday granted interim protection till March 31 to noted actor Vikram Gokhale in a Rs 96.99 lakh cheating and forgery case.

The complaint had been lodged by an investor in a plot scheme at Girivan project in Dongargaon and Hotale villages in Mulshi taluka, about 40km from here.

The court also directed notices to be issued to the police for their written submission on the pre-arrest bail pleas moved by Jayant Mhalgi and Sujata Mhalgi, the two directors of the Sujata Farms Private Limited, which floated the Girivan project. These two pleas are scheduled for a hearing on March 24.

Judge Agarkar observed, “Documents on record show that, land mentioned in sale deed is mutated in the name of the complainant. Memorandum of Association and Article of Association (of Sujata Farms) shows Jayant Mhalgi and Sujata Mhalgi are the first directors of the company. There is no reference of the name of the applicant (Gokhale) or post of chairman therein.”

“Thus, considering the nature of the accusation in the FIR and the submission made by counsel for the applicant, it prima facie appears to me that, the immediate custodial interrogation of the applicant is not necessary. It also appears to me that, if interim protection is granted, it will not adversely affect the investigation. Hence, applicant has made out case for interim protection till next date.”

The court directed that in the event of his arrest, Gokhale must be released on interim pre-arrest bail against a personal bond of Rs15,000 and a surety in the like amount. The actor has been directed to make himself available as and when called for questioning by police officer and shall not, directly or indirectly, influence witnesses, besides, he shall not leave India without the court’s permission.

Gokhale’s lawyers — Upendra Khare, Rushikesh Ganu and Shivraj Joshi — had argued that their client is neither chairman nor director of Sujata Farms nor does he hold any rights in the company; that he is not related with the company but on the latter’s request, had allowed the use of his name and celebrity status for the purpose of promoting the project campaign in 1997 against a minor honorarium.

The lawyers argued that the actor was not party to any documents executed between the company and the plot holders and did not receive any consideration in the plot scheme. Nowhere did he indulge in any of the company’s affairs, they submitted.

NEW DELHI: Delhi government will present the budget for the financial year 2020-21 on Monday in a session that has been curtailed from five days to one day due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Soon after the House meets at 2pm, finance minister Manish Sisodia will present Economic Survey 2019-20 and the status report of the outcome budget 2019-20 (up to December 2019), following which the first annual budget of the third Kejriwal government will be tabled and passed.

Following the outbreak, visitors have been barred from attending the session, which had been earlier scheduled from March 23 to 27.

‘Kejriwal Ki Guarantee’, promised by AAP during the assembly election campaign, is likely to form the base of the budget. Its size is likely to increase by 10% from last year’s Rs 60,000 crore, a source said.

The budget is likely to focus on boosting the public transport system by increasing the number of buses and expanding the Delhi Metro network; reducing pollution by one third of the current level; releasing funds for specific purposes such as sanitation to the municipal corporations; providing infrastructure in unauthorised colonies and houses to slum dwellers; and ensuring 24x7 water supply across Delhi. Steps to improve education and healthcare facilities and make Delhi safer for women will also be incorporated.

Sisodia, who will present his sixth budget, will separately present the supplementary demands for grants for 2019-20 and 2020-21, and the appropriation bills 2020, which will be considered and passed by the House.

The consultative process began soon after the formation of the government after AAP’s landslide victory. The revenue generating branches like excise, trade and taxes, and revenue departments are likely to be given higher targets instead of the usual increase of 10%, a source said.

Under the AAP governments, the size of the Delhi budget has grown steadily. In 2015-16, the size of the budget was Rs 41,500 crore, which grew to Rs 46,600 crore in 2016-17, Rs 48,000 crore in 2017-18 and Rs 53,000 crore in 2018-19, before touching Rs 60,000 crore in the last year.

45,['23/03/2020'],17 security personnel killed in deadliest Maoist ambush in Chhattisgarh in 3 years,"ANI photo

RAIPUR: Maoists ambushed security forces in Elmaguda forest of Sukma district late Saturday, killing 17 of them, injuring 15 and looting a light machinegun and 12 AK47s. This is the biggest death toll among the forces in Chhattisgarh in three years, and the first major attack in the current Congress regime. All those killed were from District Reserve Guards — comprising mostly local youth and surrendered Maoists who are at home in inhospitable terrain and are very tough fighters — and STF.

Police believe several Maoists were also killed in the five-hour-long gunfight — one of the most intense in years — but no body has been found yet. The rebels are believed to have used UBGLs — rife-fired grenades —which acted as a force multiplier and had a devastating effect. The encounter took place in the forests close to Minpa and Kasalpad, in the Maoist hotbed of Sukma.

The site of ambush is not far from where the April 2017 attack in Chintagufa, in which 25 CRPF jawans were martyred, took place. “We recovered 17 bodies from the encounter site on Sunday. All the 15 injured personnel are undergoing treatment at a hospital in Raipur after they were airlifted from Sukma,” DGP Durgesh Madhav Awasthi told TOI on Sunday. Maoists — apparently from dreaded 1 Battalion — had set up IED traps for securitymen and taken firing positions on high ground.

Senior police officers told TOI late Saturday night that a 150-strong team of CRPF’s CoBRA commandos, STF, and DRG set out on an operation following intelligence inputs about the presence of a large number of Maoists in the region. Maoists — apparently from the dreaded 1 Battalion — had set up IED traps for the securitymen and taken firing positions on high ground. When the forces came within range, the rebels triggered explosions and laid down heavy fire from well camouflaged positions.

Though taken by surprise, the forces retaliated strongly and a five-hour gunfight ensued. Initial reports said many Maoists were also killed in the ambush but police said they are yet to find any of the bodies as the rebels drag away their dead and injured.

After the gunfight, when police took stock of the situation, 17 personnel were found to be missing, including 12 from DRG. Senior officers clung to hope that the DRG personnel — battle-hardened tribals who know the jungle very well — had dispersed during the encounter and would make their way back to base. This has happened earlier. But not so today. CoBRA commandos led a search party into the encounter site early Sunday morning.

They moved cautiously since Maoists are known to ambush rescue teams. Security personnel flew drones over the encounter spot. Rescue ops were complicated by rain but by afternoon, the grim reality was out. The bodies of 17 jawans were found on the forest floor. Maoists had looted an LMG, 14 assault rifles and an under-barrel grenade launcher (UBGL) from the martyred troops.

The bodies were shifted to a nearby base. This is the first time that DRG suffered such a heavy toll. The unit comprises mostly local youth and surrendered Maoists who are at home in inhospitable terrain and are very tough fighters. DRG has added muscle to counterinsurgency operations, particularly in South Bastar, say police.

This is the first major Maoist attack after in December 2018, and the biggest since the Chintagufa ambush of April 2017. About 90 CRPF jawans were sanitising a road that was being built in the area when 300-odd Maoists, divided into multiple groups, attacked the CRPF party. Only a month before, 12 CRPF men were killed in a Maoist ambush in Sukma.

The incident occurred near Triveninagar in Nigdi, when the woman was walking back home.

SS Ohol, the sub-inspector of the Nigdi police station, told TOI that the complainant was working as a domestic help in the Nigdi Pradhikaran area.

“The woman started walking home around 11.30am on Saturday. When she reached near the Triveninagar Chowk, four youths riding on a black two-wheeler stopped near her,” the officer said.

He said that the youngster who was sitting in the middle on the scooter snatched the woman’s purse, which comprised Rs5,200.

The scooter driver took a U-turn and they then went in the opposite direction.

“The woman raised an alarm. but, there were very few people on the road,” Ohol said.

The woman told the police that all the four youths were wearing masks. “We have started checking criminals on police records. But, most of the houses are locked as people have gone out of the city,” Ohol said.

He said most of the establishments were locked as well because of which they had to wait for the CCTV camera footage, which would help ascertain the identities of the suspects.

“We are working on some clues. Our investigation is on,” the sub-inspector added.

Those waiting were mostly travellers to West Bengal and several others waiting for connecting trains to reach their native place. The food stalls were also not operating due to thin presence of passengers.The pantry cars too did poor business due to low occupancy. “In one way trip from Delhi to Chennai, we usually make Rs40,000. In the last 10 days, we are not earning even Rs10,000. There is exodus of passengers and no new ones are boarding,” said pantry car manager Indresh Singh with GT Express.There were several passengers who wanted to come to Nagpur anyhow. Despite railway closing ticket counters owing to ‘janata curfew’, many travelled without tickets. “I have emergency at home. I came to Nagpur by AP Express. I’m travelling to my hometown Rajnandgaon by LTT-Shalimar Express but as counters are closed, I will travel without ticket,” said Ravi Ranjan. Same was the plight of Sagar Sudame and Piyush Bokre, who came from Pune and was waiting for connecting train to Bhandara.Sanket Gupta of Nagpur too travelled in Jaipur Express without ticket from Chandrapur to Nagpur. “I was fined by a TTE but I refused to pay as ticket counters were closed. It was not my fault,” Gupta said.Manish Baghele, Bhandara, who left the job from a Pune-based firm to join at Butibori, said, “Pune Garib Rath had good occupancy till Badnera. Many from the region are returning from Pune due to coronavirus scare.” Baghele took a cycle rickshaw to ST bus stand at Ganeshpeth to reach Bhandara but as buses were off the road, he had to call a friend to pick him up.MSRTC divisional controller Nilesh Belsare manning the bus stand said, “Since morning only two night halt buses with 18 stranded passengers departed to Paratwada and Deori. We allowed these buses to go as a social service. Bur to massive support to ‘janata curfew’ from people in the entire district there was no demand for buses.”MSRTC’s deputy general manager (DyGM) Shivaji Jagtap said, “As per government orders, entire fleet of 3,800 public transport buses from Vidarbha will come to a standstill from Monday till March 31. Over 22,000 staff will sit idle now. These buses will be available in case of emergency service if sought by the district administration.”The situation of private transport buses was not different either. Mahendra Luley, president, Nagpur Private Travels Association (NPTA), said, “Despite coronavirus scare there is some demand from passengers from Pune but we too have stopped entire operations till March 31. Over 150-200 private inter-state buses operate from the city.”Luley added, “Owing to the precarious situation, we have urged the state government to relax payment of EMIs, give sops in tax and insurance payment as there will be no business now for an indefinite period. Yet, we welcome the government decision in larger public interest.”",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74769957,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-236062,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/janata-curfew-hits-railway-bus-air-travellers-hard/articleshow/74764772.cms
49,['23/03/2020'],"Admin, police arrange vehicles for passengers stranded at rly stn, airports","Varanasi: Despite large scale cancellation of trains, passengers of over 100 trains, which passed through Varanasi junction and Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya junction in Chandauli districts, left the district administration officials and police sweating in making arrangements of special buses and even police trucks for sending them to their destinations in adjoining districts.

Similar, problem was witnessed at LBS International airport as many passengers of the flights which landed on Sunday had to struggle hard to find vehicles for reaching their places.

Though passengers who reached Varanasi junction from Mumbai by Mahanagri Express succeeded in getting transport for their destinations as it reached the city before the commencement of the curfew hours but problems started after overcrowded trains from Delhi, Amritsar, Okha, Jammu and other places started reaching the station.

Director of Varanasi junction, Anand Mohan said that major load came following arrival of seven trains including two special trains from Mumbai. He said that each passenger was allowed to go out of the station only after going through thermal scanning.

As the public transport including auto rickshaws were unavailable outside the railway station, massive crowding in and around the railway station started challenging the directives of maintaining social distancing. Alarmed by it ADG Varanasi zone Brij Bhushan, IG Varanasi range VS Mina, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma, SSP Prabhakar Chawdhary and many other officials also reached there.

Sharma said that in view of the high load of passengers arriving from different trains 50 buses including UP state transport corporation and private were arranged to send them to their destinations in different districts of east UP. In view of more requirement of vehicles five trucks of police were also engaged in the service of those passengers, he added. For those, who had to go to different areas of the city over 30 auto rickshaws were arranged by the officials.

Similar, challenge was faced by the officials of district administration and police at PDDU junction in Chandauli, where 64 trains brought huge passenger load from Mumbai, Delhi and other points.

The aerial connectivity was also affected badly. According to senior manager (operations) of airport Sanjay Kumar, as many as 22 flights, including four of Air India, one of AI Express, seven of Indigo, four of Go Air and Spicejet each and two of Vistara airlines were cancelled on Sunday. A few flights from Mumbai and other destinations landed here. Those passengers, who had not called their family members, faced serious problems in getting conveyance for reaching there destination as no taxi was available even at pre-paid booth and also outside the airport premises. In view of the problem of passengers some buses were arranged by the district officials.

50,['23/03/2020'],Unorganised sector bears the brunt of lockdown,"Aurangabad: The ongoing coronavirus scare and the imposition of section 144 till March 31 have hit thousands of workers in the unorganized sectors, autorickshaw drivers, handcart pullers, porters, hawkers, domestic and farm workers hard.

Anticipating the tough times ahead for several lakhs of workers in the drought-prone Marathwada region, activists said that even if these people survive the coronavirus, they may die of hunger.

On the instructions of the state government, the state labour commissioner has already issued directives to the private employers asking them to neither cut salaries not fire their employees.

On Sunday, none of the workers gathered at the spots where they usually come looking for work. The region has more than 50,000 autorickshaws, and they too have gone off the roads, affecting an equal number of families directly dependent on them. The activists working for the unorganised sector, fear that it would be impossible for the poor to sustain the restrictions, stretching up to 8 days at a time.

Maharashtra Rajya Hamal Mapadi Mahamandal general secretary Subhash Lomte, who has been fighting for the cause of unorganized workers for decades, demanded immediate measures for workers, domestic helps and farm workers. Almost 93% of the workforce in India is in the unorganised sector. They include porters and other workers directly or indirectly connected with essential services. The district administration and the state should immediately initiate measures to address their problems. Health check-ups of the workers should be carried out.”

CPI district joint secretary Abhay Taksal said, “The state government is doing a good job, but considering the situation we are facing, these steps are not enough.” He demanded special packages, apart from unemployment wage.

51,['23/03/2020'],Owners from gunthewari areas to get property cards,"Aurangabad: The long-pending demand of issuing property cards to the property holders of gunthewari areas in the city has been accepted by the state government.

In the latest communication to the town planning section of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, the state government has asked to initiate measures for issuing the desired document.

Acting on the directives from the government, the civic authorities have approached the revenue department to do the needful together.

As per the official records, Aurangabad has around 118 Gunthewari areas with a minimum of around 40,000 properties.

Many of these property owners were either having 7/12 extracts of their property or notarised agreement showing ownership, putting limitations on the real estate transactions besides putting a curb on availing loan against property.

‘Gunthewari’ is the traditional method used for measuring land and one Guntha land is a plot of around 10m by 10m or 33ft by 33ft. The plots are sold in multiples of a ‘guntha’, this is sometimes referred to as Gunthewari development

Corporator Raju Vaidya, who has been demanding the issue of property cards for the owners of Gunthewari areas, said many properties from the areas have not been registered yet due to the previous regime of rules. “Despite being legitimate owners of their houses, property holders from Gunthewari areas were deprived of property card. The issue was brought to the notice of the chief minister and senior ministers recently, who ordered the desired solution,” he said.

In 2015, BJP-led government in Maharashtra had diluted Gunthewari Act, relaxing the norms of purchase and construction of houses on these properties.

Parts of localities from Pundalik Nagar, Vishranti Nagar, Mukund Nagar, Padegaon, Mitmita, Chikalthana, Harsul and Surewadi among other areas have Gunthewari areas.

Real estate agent Santosh Gaikwad said the property card certifies the real owner of land in an urban area. “Properties from Gunthewari area are prone to a false claim of ownership and the owners are at a risk of facing problems. The property card can help in avoiding legal issues,” he said.

The property card, which is issued by the local civic body, has the name of the land owner and changes in ownership, if any, survey number, plot number and the size of the land among other details.

Suhas Patil, a property owner from Gunthewari area in Pundalik Nagar, said, “The property card must be issued through online to avoid the possible influence of middlemen,” he said.

Despite making calls on state ambulance service number 108, no ambulance came to her rescue. At the same time, a traffic police vehicle was passing from outside the hospital. The woman’s husband Santosh stopped the vehicle and requested for help.

The police team readily agreed and rushed the woman to the GMCH where a couple of hours later she delivered a baby girl. Aurangabad commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad said, “In cases of emergency, our men patrolling the streets would readily assist the citizens.”

The officer, however, warned of initiating stringent action, including slapping of offence against those found loitering on the streets without genuine reason.

Even in case of Beed police led by Harssh Poddar and Aurangabad rural police led by Mokshada Patil have officially issued statements appealing people to contact police control room in case of facing any untoward incident.

Some of them even required ICU care, the data shows. In France, more than 50% of the cases are under 60 years old. Even children can end up with severe infection, revealed another study published in the journal ‘Paediatrics’. The study, carried out by doctors in China where the Covid-19 outbreak started, found 11% of the infants who tested positive turned severe or critical. Their survival rates were better compared to the adults, and especially the elderly, but the study shows children, too, could be seriously ill.“There is no scope for complacency in the fight against Covid-19 and younger people have to be equally cautious,” said Dr Vivek Nangia, director and head of pulmonology at Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj.The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 is new and people haven’t developed immune response to it, he pointed out. “It is difficult to predict how will it affect someone and, therefore, everyone needs to be extra cautious,” Dr Nangia said.Another senior doctor from AIIMS said younger people would spread the disease faster if they didn’t follow the physical distancing rules.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged people for self-curfew on Sunday, unless it’s an emergency, to break the chain of transmission. Experts said while staying at home people could follow follow certain tips to reduce the risk of infection and related complications. These include eating a healthy and nutritious diet to boost the the immune system, limit alcohol consumption, and avoid sugary drinks and smoking. “Smoking can increase your risk of developing severe disease if you become infected with Covid-19,” according to WHO. It also recommends 30 minutes of physical activity daily for adults, and one hour a day for children.Previous reports of the Covid-19 spread in China suggested the elderly were at maximum risk to develop serious complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure on getting infected.According to a study published in the American Medical Association journal, which analysed the epidemiology data of China, the overall case-fatality rate (CFR) was 2.3% (1,023 deaths among 44,672 confirmed cases). “No death occurred in the group of 9 years and younger, but the cases in 70-79 years had an 8% CFR, while those in the 80-year-and-older bracket had a 14.8% CFR,” found the study conducted by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74767949,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-291814,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/being-young-may-not-save-you-but-precautions-will/articleshow/74759257.cms

Isolation wards are being multiplied across the state, especially with the COVID-19 positive cases going up to seven in the state as of Sunday.

At GRH ward no. 120, there is an already-existing eight-bedded COVID-19 isolation ward. “The new ward, which is being constructed at the old building of the school of nursing, is set to have 17 beds and will be fully-equipped. All officials and workers are trying their best to complete the ward as soon as possible,” said Dr Sangumani, speaking to TOI.

The ward, which is being built at a cost of around Rs 96 lakh, would be well-equipped as per specifications given by the health ministry. The hospital would also keep ready all personal protective equipment required. Once the ward is complete, the capacity of COVID-19 isolation wards at GRH would be 25.

Meanwhile, at the government hospital of thoracic medicine at Thoppur, a similar 20-bedded COVID-19 isolation ward is being set up for a cost of Rs 96 lakh. “On Saturday, the district collector Dr T G Vinay inspected the works underway for the isolation ward at Thoppur GH.

BHOPAL: While experts said that the level of pollution has gone down in many places, Bhopal’s AQI on Sunday, during the ‘ janata curfew’, was recorded at 142 at 1 pm by the Central Pollution Control Board ’s website, the highest in the last two weeks.

Experts at the MP Pollution Control Board as well as the CPCB were at a loss to explain the anomaly as there was hardly any movement of vehicles on the roads, which contributes to around 70% of the pollution. Members of the CPCB said burning of waste might have increased the pollution level, affecting the city’s air quality index. Interestingly, the levels of PM 2.5 and PM 10 were “poor” from 8 pm on Saturday to 4 am on Sunday, when there is hardly any vehicular movement.

""Vehicle emission contributes to 70% of the pollution, leading to increase in levels of PM 2.5 while dust scattered by the wheels increases the level of PM 10. But the increase in the levels of the particulate matter at night is a matter of analysis, as people don't generally go out in such large numbers after midnight,” said environmentalist Suresh Pandey.

When TOI contacted the regional office of CPCB, the board’s regional director said that the high level of particulate matter may be because of burning of waste as movement of vehicles was not more than usual on Saturday. On Saturday, Bhopal’s AQI was 116.

""Even if we say that people went out to get supplies for their houses for Janata Curfew, it will only increase the level of pollutants from 8 pm to 11 pm, but the rise in PM 2.5 and PM 10 between 12 am to 4 am is only possible due to burning of waste in large amounts near the real time monitoring device in TT Nagar,” said P Jaga, regional director of CPCB.

Rajendra Chaturvedi, scientist at MPCB, said, “Since AQI is calculated for 24 hours, it’s possible that the pollution was more on Saturday, which is being reflected in Sunday’s AQI. According to the pollution monitors of MPCB, we have found the level of PM 2.5 to be under 50 at all centres, while PM 10 was under 100 at all 6 centres in Bhopal on Sunday.”

After referring to the data on the CPCB website, Pandey further said, “There may have been some fault in the instrument as the level of PM 2.5 and PM 10 for the last 20 days is much lower after midnight.""

NAGPUR: Amid occupants complaining of poor amenities, the quarantine facility at MLA Hostel also has persons voluntarily turning up for a stay. As the number of occupants reached 154 on Sunday, there were 12 who have come in voluntarily, said officials here.

On Saturday, six persons came voluntarily, followed by four on Sunday. This takes the number to 12 after taking into account those who had comer earlier, said an official managing the facility. They have preferred to stay here to avoid spreading infection to others in the family and neighbourhood. The number increased as awareness spread, said the officials.

Some have travelled from abroad, but reached Nagpur through a domestic flight or any other mode where the screening is not done, said the official. Such passengers too are expected to remain home quarantined, some of them have come here, the source said. From Monday onwards, there will be no international flights till March 29.

TOI came across a couple who had travelled from Dubai but had reached Hyderabad first and reached Nagpur by train. The husband, a fitness trainer, said, “I already have patients at home and I don’t want to add to their troubles by staying with them. I have a home at Nagpur but will spend time at the quarantine facility first,” he said.

The officials said they will have to stay for 48 hours at least. Rounds by psychiatrists continued at the facility. Source said occupants have been provided with religious books and sessions on stress management are being carried out. They have been advised to practice yoga and breathing exercises. No clinical signs of mental stress has been seen in the occupants so far, the source said.

AURANGABAD: Several parts of the city did not receive water on Sunday, making it more difficult for people confined to their houses due to the janta curfew. Private water tankers were also not available in most of the affected areas, adding to the water woes.

HUDCO, Mukundwadi, Chikalthana, Naregaon and some other parts of the city, which account for a considerable geographical portion of Aurangabad , did not receive tap water on Sunday.

Kiran Dhande, in-charge of water supply at the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, said that a technical snag developed at water treatment plant at Farola which disrupted the water supply in many areas.

“A few systems had a sudden breakdown on Saturday morning and the restoration work lasted for almost four hours. It had affected the city’s water supply,” he said.

Aarti Relgaokar, a resident of N-11 sector, that said her family had exhausted all stored water anticipating tapped water supply on Sunday. “The situation was so bad that we had no water to take a bath. The private supplier expressed inability to supply water citing janata curfew as the reason,” she said.

Aurangabad city gets water after a gap of every four days hence the residents are forced to store the water.

Rupali Wagh, a resident of Mukundwadi area, said keeping hands clean amid Covid-19 scare went for a toss due to water scarcity.

“The civic body must ensure smooth supply of water during the current crisis. The disruption in water supply has become a norm even if the Jayakwadi dam, which supplies water to the city, has sufficient water,” she said.

However, in view of the Covid-19 crisis, the government has decided to use it specifically to manage patients who are moderately or severely ill, the Union health ministry announced on Sunday.All states have been asked to identify hospitals that can be turned into Covid-19-specific health facilities, said joint secretary Lav Aggarwal. “We have also asked the states to ramp up infrastructure needs such as ventilators. The central government has placed orders for 1,200 ventilators too,” he added.As per the plan, prepared by AIIMS in consultation with the ministry, the institute will triage Covid-19 cases requiring acute management at its 20-bedded isolation facility in the Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre, following which they will be transferred to NCI.“We plan to create 125 beds in NCI. Of this, 25 will be ICU beds and the rest will have advanced facilities for monitoring and acute management. Depending on the patient rush, the numbers can be expanded,” said an AIIMS official.At present, most Covid-19 suspect and positive cases are being kept at Safdarjung, RML, Lok Nayak and GTB hospitals among others. Though the isolation facilities have been created in separate blocks, other patients and staff are still scared, said doctors at these hospitals.“At Lok Nayak Hospital, triaging is being done on the ground floor and then symptomatic ones are being shifted to the sixth floor of the emergency block.

The complainant sub-inspector Kalimullah got an FIR registered with Khuldabad police under section 188 (violating section 144 of CrPc), section 269 and 270 of the Indian Penal Code (likely to spread the infection of any diseases dangerous to life) and section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act.

This would be the sixth FIR against the protesters at Mansoor Ali Park — most of whom are women. The other charges against the protesters include unlawful assembly while violating section 144 of CrPc. The complainant alleged that, on Saturday night, a police team tried to peacefully convenience protesters at Mansoor Ali Park to call off their agitation as the assembly of such large number of people could help the deadly virus spread.

He said the protesters were not ready to lend an ear to their appeals and were adamant to continue with their agitation. The agitation, which was launched over two months ago, against the new citizenship law and the National Register of Citizens is still underway at Mansoor Ali Park in the city.

BHOPAL: A day after BJP’s complaint against Speaker N P Prajapati and demand to appoint a protem Speaker after the resignation of chief minister Kamal Nath , Governor Lalji Tandon in a letter to the Prajapati has suggested him to quit the post to honour the tradition after the Congress government fell in Madhya Pradesh .

Tandon also cited a no-confidence motion moved by BJP in the assembly against the Speaker and said that it should be taken up on priority when the session is convened. “I have received a memorandum dated March 21 from the Leader of Opposition (LoP) Gopal Bhargava stating that presently there is neither a leader of the House nor the House is functioning. In such a situation, when the House is in sleeping state, policy decisions should not be taken by the Speaker, which is hurting or helping anyone. But, decisions are being taken every day with political motives which are contrary to the interests of the common man,” reads the letter.

Tandon further said that BJP has submitted a no-confidence motion against the Speaker, but no action was taken till date. “Until the no-confidence motion is decided by the house, I expect you to work in accordance with the Constitution, assembly rules and morality by studying the legality of every subject,” the Governor stated.

The Governor also referred to the resignation letter of BJP MLA Sharad Kol on March 6, after which he had claimed that he had sent another letter on March 16 requesting the Speaker not to accept his resignation, but it was not entertained.

Tandon said, “BJP has demanded that a protem Speaker should be appointed to ensure that constitutional values and democratic traditions are followed. The LoP has also said that the Speaker has followed unlawful procedures to accept Kol’s resignation.”

Besides attaching copies of complaints by BJP, the Governor also quoted a constitutional expert’s opinion stating that when a government falls, the Speaker and the deputy Speaker appointed in that regime should resign.

Both Speaker Prajapati and deputy Speaker Hina Kaware are from Congress.

“The opinion of the constitution expert is attached with this letter for your observation, in which he has stated that the Speaker and deputy Speaker elected from that party must give resignation after being ousted from power as per the tradition,” states Tandon’s letter.

Tandon said after the (Speaker’s) resignation, the principal secretary of the assembly will carry out the normal day to day work as per the (Speaker’s) instructions. “I expect you (Speaker) to work on the statutory position of each subject on the basis of the Indian Constitution, legislative rules and ethics, till the decision on the no-confidence motion presented against you is taken by the House,” the Governor said.

Amid the political crisis, Governor Tandon and Speaker Prajapati were engaged in a war of words over missing legislators, who had sent their resignations through BJP leader Bhupendra Singh from Bengaluru. Later, the Speaker also accepted the resignation of BJP MLA Kol, ignoring his appeal to withdraw the same.

On Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the call for a janata curfew (lockdown) for March 22, wherein he appealed to citizens to stay indoors between 7am and 9pm to stop the infection from spreading.

All streets in the city wore a total deserted and only a few vehicles, mostly two-wheelers were spotted on roads. With hardly any passengers, drivers of autorickshaws, private taxis and rickshaws also stayed away from work.

Following government orders, bus and train services remained suspended throughout the day. A few passengers who did reach bus depots and railway stations ended up going back disappointed.

Small eateries like dhabas and tea and paan shops were closed too. An eerie silence replaced the usual chaos of honking cars and two-wheelers on city roads.

Similar conditions were observed in neighbouring districts like Kaushambi and Pratapgarh, wherein residents supported Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal for a 14-hour lockdown.

The residents were joined by traders’ associations and social, religious and spiritual organisations in extending support to PM Modi’s appeal.

President of Civil Lines Vyappar Mandal Sushil Kharbanda said that city traders welcomed the move and pledged their support to the initiative.

Many residents took to social media to laud the curfew and urged people to stay indoors.

Markets like Civil Lines, Chowk, Kotwali, Bahadurganj, Mutthiganj, Kydganj, Katra, Sulemsarai, Rajapur, Ghantaghar, Allahapur and Teliyarganj were closed. Only shops selling essential commodities like groceries and foodgrains were open for business.

Civil Lines resident Manish Mehrotra said, “The people of this country must unite to fight against Covid-19. The janata curfew is a great way to stop the virus from spreading further.”

“It has already claimed six lives in India and we need to be very careful about the way deal with novel coronavirus,” he added.

Ravi Kesarwani, who lives in Mutthiganj, said, “As individuals, we should understand our responsibility towards the society in such testing times.”

Meanwhile, police patrolled the streets on Sunday afternoon to keep people from gathering unnecessarily on roads.

Police arranged for roadways buses to ferry passengers who had arrived at Prayagraj Junction after de-boarding three trains. The passengers belonged to different parts of the country and were headed to Prayagraj and adjoining districts.

IG (Prayagraj Range) KP Singh said, “When people from different parts of the country arrived at railway station, they started moving towards Civil Lines bus stand. Some of them were also looking for public transport. We arranged for eight roadways buses for those who wanted to go Kaushambi, Pratapgarh, Jaunpur and other neighbouring areas.”

“For around half an hour, a chaos-like situation prevailed at Civil Lines bus stand till the roadways buses arrived,” he added.

“We have sanitised buses which were ferried the passengers to their destinations. They were also screened by a team of doctors..”

It’s for the greater good of people,” he said.Dr Sushant Meshram, HoD of pulmonary medicine at the Super Speciality Hospital, said that people should use this period to build their immunity.“The most important natural immunity booster is quality sleep. Deep and uninterrupted sleep will help a lot. Recent researches have shown that individuals who sleep less than six hours and voluntarily get exposed to the common cold virus are more prone to contracting diseases. Similarly, the population working in shifts has a disturbed circadian rhythm and hence, is also prone to developing diseases,” he said, adding that the lockdown will provide professionals with the opportunity to get good sleep.“I appeal to all the young professionals to ensure that they sleep well, eat well and maintain their health during the lockdown,” he added.Vice-president of Maharashtra Medical Council and paediatrician, Dr Vinky Rughwani, said the lockdown is a remarkable move and the only way to stop this pandemic.“Sunday’s Janata curfew has been a grand success.

Since the action was based on holding bills as proof of violation, stores started selling them without invoice.As per new central government norms, sanitizer can't be sold for more than 50 paise per ml and the rates for 1, 2 3 layer mask too have been fixed. But the main issue is regarding N95 mask said to be effective against coronavirus Shahid Sharif, executive member of Consumer Protection Council Nagpur at district collector office, said, “Stores are not giving bill. Black marketing is legalized and violation of the norms is rampant. Action must be taken. A crisis is going on and they are saying Sunday is a holiday for not taking any action. Then why was the squad was formed,” he asked.He added many people were forced to visit government hospitals on Sunday during the Janata Curfew as no private doctor was available. “These hospitals are ill equipped. Now, people need sanitizers and masks to go there so they are being looted. There is total lack of communication between the collector and the officials,” Sharif said.He said there is another belief that N95 mask will prevent Covid-19. “In the March 21 advisory, N95 is not included. It means adminsitation is not sure. Then they talk of making it a prescription item. There is complete chaos,” he said.Officials admitted the notification issued by Centre must have specific guidelines to stop overcharging.Medical shops in the city are selling premium N95 and simple masks and sanitizers at 150% profit margins, making them quite expensive.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74769156,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-212603,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/masks-sanitizers-being-sold-without-bills-to-evade-action/articleshow/74764826.cms

BHOPAL: The Madhya Pradesh government has finally notified five locations around Sarbhanga ashram in Satna district as protected sites to put a check on illegal miners who were plundering rare artefacts dating back to the 10th and 11th Century BC. The artefacts were buried near the ashram at Chitrakoot, which bears Lord Ram’s footprints during his 14-year exile. The notification was issued last week.

The government had in 2016 decided to notify five sites around Sarbhanga ashram as a protected site by invoking powers of Madhya Pradesh Ancient Monuments, Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1963, and the state’s culture department had said the area would be declared ‘state protected monument’ after two months from date of issue of the notice on May 26.

Once notification is issued under Section 3(1) of the said Act, a final notification has to be issued within next two months.

A study by the state’s archaeology department had pressed panic buttons regarding the loot of relics in Satna district. The area is rich in bauxite , laterite and ochre. Sources said many antiques on Sanwar hill, where Sarbhanga ashram is located, have been stolen and smuggled out during mining operations in the last five years. Several idols have been damaged due to the use of heavy mining machinery and the damaged ones were found abandoned.

The epic legacy around another hillock near Sarbhanga ashram known as ‘Siddha Pahar’, where Lord Ram vowed to eliminate demons and spent nearly 12 years of his exile, has almost vanished following illegal mining. The area is spread across 100 acres. Sanwar and ‘Siddha Pahar’ are located within a 2-kilometre radius.

On August 17, 2015, the Madhya Pradesh high court had ordered the state’s archaeology department to study in detail the ‘Ram Van Gaman Path’ (route used by Lord Rama as per the Ramayana during his exile) in three months and conserve sites of archaeological importance. According to the report, some ancient idols were damaged during mining.

The study was ordered by a division bench of the high court, while hearing a petition alleging that no inquiry or study has been conducted and these sites were not declared as protected.

“This notification would now help government secure antique idols from being smuggled,” said Nithyanand Mishra , an advocate who had taken up the matter in the high court.

The city wore a deserted look following the closure of shops and other establishments. With buses and private vehicles going off streets, the city went quiet.

In fact, people voluntarily confined themselves to homes bringing normal life to a halt. Even medical shops and milk booths remained closed in several parts of the city, although, authorities exempted emergency services like pharmacies to remain open. The pharmacies attached to hospitals sold medicines to only inpatients.

With Indian Medical Association suspending out-patient services till March 31, hospitals have closed their doors for patients. Doctors, however, have continued to attended emergency services, including surgeries.

Despite losses, roadside eateries and fruit stalls did not put up shop on Sunday and extended their support to the government’s mission to contain Covid-19. Interestingly, a majority of domestic help were also allowed to skip work. “It is heartening to see that people have extended an overwhelming support to the call given by the PM and CM to tackle COVID-19. It fosters a sense of confidence that we can certainly beat this dreaded virus,” observed NV Dr NV Sundarachary, a senior professor at Guntur Medical College (GMC).

Guntur Municipal Corporation also brought supply of drinking water to halt from 7am to 9pm in the city. The supplies were resumed only after 9pm. Meanwhile, the emergency wing staff of Central Power Distribution Company Limited (CPDCL) remained in sub-stations to manage uninterrupted power supplies.

With the Centre declaring that the nation is witnessing the stage 2 of Covid-19, health experts think it might be very difficult to contain the virus if it goes to stage 3.In stage 1, persons travelled to Covid-19 hit countries and test positive, in stage-2, people get infected after coming to contact with foreign returnees who were tested positive for Covid-19.With several people with no foreign travel history getting tested positive, Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) had declared that the virus entered the stage-II. The government is leaving no stone unturned to see that no patient goes out of its hands as it would make the situation complicate to handle.AP has reported very less number of positive cases for Covid-19 thanks to extensive surveys carried out by the health department much in advance.The department had tracked down nearly 13,000 foreign returnees since February and directed them to remain in home isolation. Besides, the health department had deputed staff to residences of the foreign returnees to keep a tab on their movements. With the government not allowing any foreign returnee to go out of its watch and home isolation, the situation is said to be largely under control.The district collectors have started giving training to municipal commissioners, tehsildars and police officials along with the health department officials as per the containment plan readied by the state government.

NEW DELHI: If you want to know how one Covid-19 patient can set off a chain of infections, Delhi’s case No. 10 is a good example. The patient is a woman with a history of travel to Saudi Arabia.According to government data, five of Delhi’s 30 novel coronavirus cases so far, excluding her, are linked to her. This includes the Dilshad Garden resident’s two daughters, her brother, mother and a doctor who attended to her before she was taken to Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital with high fever, cough and shortness of breath.While the woman’s son is in self-quarantine at home since he hasn’t exhibited symptoms of Covid-19, according to sources, the doctor himself became the city’s case No. 30. The doctor’s wife and daughter too have shown signs of infection and are in GTB Hospital awaiting the results of testing.District health officials disclosed that 74 people living in the neighbourhood of the Dubai-returned woman are under surveillance. “When the woman tested positive for Covid-19, we rushed to her residence to ask her family for names and addresses of people who had visited them since March 10, the date of her return from Dubai,” an official said. “They weren’t very cooperative, so we had to seek the help of the local police to get information. We also used footage from the CCTV cameras installed near their home to identify some people who needed to be put under surveillance.”The woman’s brother and mother live in northeast Delhi’s Jahangirpur. People the two came in contact with are also being screened, sources said. But one particular area which may prove to be a veritable hub of disaster can be the mohalla clinic where the doctor who came in contact with the woman consulted patients.Between March 12, when the feverish and coughing woman visited him, and March 17, when the woman tested positive for the coronavirus, the doctor continued seeing patients at the mohalla clinic. The clinic has since been shut down and the district surveillance team is trying to get the list of patients that visited the facility over the five days. It is likely the number will over 100 cases, all possibly infected by the doctor.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74768077,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-155409,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-delhis-case-no-10-mayve-set-chain-reaction/articleshow/74765301.cms

In Moradabad, police have decided to book the protesters who had gathered at Eidgah on Sunday.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given a call for ‘janta curfew’ on Sunday to curb the spread of now novel coronavirus-- a highly-contagious disease. Even in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh-- which inspired similar sit-ins across UP and other parts of the country-- the protest became symbolic and the size was cut to just five.

In Deoband, the home to one of the largest Islamic seminaries of the world, the anti-CAA protest was called off. Several religious and political leaders of the community have asked people not gather for any protest. Moradabad MP Dr ST Hasan had also asked people of his city to stay indoors.

But, not heeding to the appeals, the protesters, mostly women, came out and staged a sit-in at Moradabad’s Eidgah, putting local police and the health department in a fix, which is already facing a tough time after surfacing of positive case of coronavirus in the city.

“Around 500 protesters reached Eidgah ground and started a sit-in protest there. Their act may fuel the epidemic. We are going to book them under IPC section 188 (disobedience of order duly promulgated by a public servant) and other relevant sections for posing threat to others’ lives,” said Amit Kumar Anand, additional superintendent of police (city).

One of the organisers at the sit-in site, Waqi Rashid, said, “Coronavirus cannot be controlled by a one-day curfew.”

While in Aligarh, over 500 women protesters continued with their sit-in against the Citizenship (amendment) Act (CAA). The protest against CAA is going on at Aligarh’s Shah Jamal Idgah ground since January 29.

The district administration had served a notice to the organiser two days ago asking them to vacate the place for 10 days amid coronavirus fears or “face legal action”. However, neither the protesters nor the organizers have paid heed to it.

Talking to TOI, Aligarh district magistrate (DM) CB Singh said, “Action will be taken against them.”

However, remaining parts of Aligarh, including Muslim-dominated areas of Jeevangarh, Jamalpur and Upper Kot, followed the appeal of PM Modi and stayed at home.

The administration has, meanwhile, decided to screen people coming from Delhi, Noida, Agra and Mathura.

‘Munadi’ (announcement) was also made by the municipal corporation officials urging people to stay indoors to combat spread of Covid-19. Confirming this, municipal corporation sanitary enforcement inspector Bishan Singh, said, “Munadi was organised in seven zones on Sunday to make people aware about the disease.”

In Deoband, the home to one of the largest Islamic seminaries of the world, the anti-CAA protest was called off. Several religious and political leaders of the community have asked people not gather for any protest. Moradabad MP Dr ST Hasan had also asked people of his city to stay indoors.

But, not heeding to the appeals, the protesters, mostly women, came out and staged a sit-in at Moradabad’s Eidgah, putting local police and the health department in a fix, which is already facing a tough time after surfacing of positive case of coronavirus in the city.

“Around 500 protesters reached Eidgah ground and started a sit-in protest there. Their act may fuel the epidemic. We are going to book them under IPC section 188 (disobedience of order duly promulgated by a public servant) and other relevant sections for posing threat to others’ lives,” said Amit Kumar Anand, additional superintendent of police (city).

One of the organisers at the sit-in site, Waqi Rashid, said, “Coronavirus cannot be controlled by a one-day curfew.”

While in Aligarh, over 500 women protesters continued with their sit-in against the Citizenship (amendment) Act (CAA). The protest against CAA is going on at Aligarh’s Shah Jamal Idgah ground since January 29.

The district administration had served a notice to the organiser two days ago asking them to vacate the place for 10 days amid coronavirus fears or “face legal action”. However, neither the protesters nor the organizers have paid heed to it.

Talking to TOI, Aligarh district magistrate (DM) CB Singh said, “Action will be taken against them.”

However, remaining parts of Aligarh, including Muslim-dominated areas of Jeevangarh, Jamalpur and Upper Kot, followed the appeal of PM Modi and stayed at home.

The administration has, meanwhile, decided to screen people coming from Delhi, Noida, Agra and Mathura.

‘Munadi’ (announcement) was also made by the municipal corporation officials urging people to stay indoors to combat spread of Covid-19. Confirming this, municipal corporation sanitary enforcement inspector Bishan Singh, said, “Munadi was organised in seven zones on Sunday to make people aware about the disease.”

KANPUR: Father and brother of a 21-year-old girl, who was hacked to death in an alleged case of honour killing, have been arrested by Maharajpur police of the district on Saturday.

Chaman Lal and his son Luvlesh were arrested on Saturday for killing the girl on December 25, 2019 over her alleged affair and her court marriage with a youth outside her caste, inspector Maharajpur Raghvendra Singh said.

The girl, Reem Pal , was allegedly having an affair with a youth from Yadav community, he said.

“The two got married in court on November 27, 2019, however, she came back home the same day, but went missing thereafter,” said police.

Sensing trouble, her alleged boy friend Dharamveer Singh Yadav lodged an FIR on December 28 accusing her father and siblings, besides her uncle of kidnapping Reema. Subsequently, the police launched an investigation in this regard.

The police thereafter arrested girl’s uncle Chande Lal and her brother Divesh on January 9 and March 5 and sent them to jail.

“During interrogation the accused father-son duo, who were arrested on Saturday from nearby Chatmara village, told the police that they took the girl to Industrial area in Chakeri and hacked her to death with a hammer and threw her body in a sewer tank. On the basis of clues provided by them, we have recovered the badly decomposed girl’s body stuffed inside a sack,” said inspector further, adding that they have confessed to their crime.

The duo was sent to jail on Sunday, the officer added.

A senior police officer told TOI, “The department has been instructed to ensure complete shut down for the safety of locals as a large number of people, mainly labourers, are returning to their native place from Metro cities and screening everyone is not possible. In such a situation, the movement needs to be restricted.”

When I refused then they threatened to thrash me. They were extremely arrogant. The policemen said that they had clear instructions from their SHO to ensure that all shops were closed. ”

Mahesh Gupta, a grocery shop owner in Jalalnagar locality, said Modi Ji said it was a ‘Janata Curfew’ and would not be forced upon the people, but the way policemen behaved “it appears that we are criminals. In this fight against coronavirus, we must ensure that residents’ get their daily needs fulfilled.”

When asked about the matter, Shahjahanpur SSP Shivasimpi Channappa told TOI, “I have not instructed policemen to close the medical stores. My subordinates told me that medical store owners closed down voluntarily.”

But Delhi appeared to have entered the curfew mode on Saturday itself.Most roads in the city were unusually empty for a weekend and in many parts of south and central Delhi, not many vehicles were spotted on the roads in the morning. Growing awareness about Covid-19 meant that Delhiites stayed home. Closure of the usual haunts, such as malls, markets, cinema halls and restaurants, deterred those who wanted to venture out.The lifelessness in the capital was reflected in Delhi Metro seeing such a massive dip in passenger numbers that at peak hours there weren’t any standing commuters even on the busiest Blue (Dwarka-Noida/Vaishali) and Yellow (Samaypur Badli) Lines. While the average ‘passenger journeys’ recorded in February was 57.1 lakh, the figure slid to 37 lakh on Thursday and further dipped to 30.9 lakh on Friday. The figures for Saturday were not available at the time of filing this report, but according to footfall monitoring sources, the numbers have plummeted.Bus transport, which has recorded a dip of four lakh passengers per day in the first 15 days of March compared with the figures of February, also reported a substantial fall in ridership on Saturday. “The number of bus passengers has been consistently dipping because people are not coming out of their homes now unless compelled by urgent requirements,” a Delhi Transport Corporation official told TOI. “Though the ridership figures for Saturday are yet to be compiled, occupancy in the buses was visibly low.”The popular Sarojini Nagar market, where a sea of humanity congregates every weekend, was so eerily deserted on Saturday that some shop owners could be seen driving their vehicles inside the market lanes. Normally this is impossible due to the crowds. “Only medicines stores and shops selling fruits and vegetables were open on Saturday,” said Ashok Randhawa, president, Sarojini Nagar Mini Market Traders’ Association. “As most people are aware about the market closure, there were very few shoppers. Our volunteers informed even the few who were here about the shutdown.”Randhawa added it was perhaps for the first time in decades that not only was the market closed but even the hawkers were absent. “Due to the coronavirus fear, sales are down 80%. People come only to buy essentials,” said Randhawa. “Shop assistants and employees have left for their homes in UP and Bihar.”The scenes were similar in Defence Colony and Connaught Place, with only shops dealing in essential goods operating.

Two groups clashed over the decision to halt the protest, and later, one of them even hurled molotov cocktails at the barricades near Shaheen Bagh on Sunday morning. Police said no one was injured and recovered an empty cartridge near the Jamia protest site.Locals claimed that they saw two men throwing a molotov cocktail at Shaheen Bagh tents and setting a placard on fire. A similar incident was reported from Jamia protest site too. DCP (South East) R P Meena said two cases were registered and efforts were being made to identify the men.The Sunday’s incident was reported at 9.15am when police were informed about an alleged firing near Shaheen Bagh. A police team reached the scene and found some items were set on fire near the police barricade, while a few white substances were lying around.Locals claimed they had seen two bikers setting bamboo logs and ropes on fire before throwing molotov cocktail at the barricade. The men fled towards Jamia University, they added. The CCTV footage from the area are being scanned to identify the bikers.“We suspect it to be a ploy to dislodge us from the spot. Our protest has been peaceful all along. There are also enough precautions taken against the spread of the virus,” said Imran, one of the protesters.On Saturday, some of the protesters held a meeting with police and agreed to call off the protest for a few days. However, soon after, another group, unhappy with the move, started an argument claiming that they were not consulted and the protest would continue. Following this, a clash broke out between the groups, which was resolved only after police intervention.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74765864,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-284301,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/what-led-to-clashes-at-shaheen-bagh-and-jamia-protest-sites/articleshow/74765311.cms

He was taken to MLA Hostel quarantine facility as a precaution in an ambulance of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC).On Saturday, a New Delhi-based couple was detrained at Kazipeth from Bengaluru-New Delhi Rajdhani Express The 21-year-old student, travelling in New Delhi-Chennai Express, had returned from Russia to Delhi. He had a ticket to Chennai and was in AC-3 tier B2 coach. He is a resident of Vijayawada.The student, travelling alone, was screened at the Covid-19 test booth set up by Central Railways near Platform 1, which is manned by Railway Protection Force (RPF) and medical team of the railway hospital. His temperature recording was ‘normal’, said a railway source.Though the railway personnel tried their best to convince the student, tension and disappointment were writ large on his face as he pulled his luggage into the ambulance before it sped away.Some co-passengers spotted the home quarantine stamp on his hand at Itarsi when the train reached there around 10.30am. Panicked, they immediately informed TTE Sunil Kumar Singh, who alerted commercial control room and Nagpur railway station.At Nagpur, assistant commercial manager (goods) SG Rao and a nursing team led by Central Railway hospital’s divisional medical officer Dr Chandrashekhar were ready for assistance along with deputy station superintendents Manish Gaur and Atul Shrivastav. The commercial department personnel had alerted the state government control room, seeking assistance to shift the passenger to the quarantine facility at MLA Hostel.“When the train reached Platform 2 at Nagpur railway station at 2.30pm, we de-trained the passenger. There was no panic as the passenger has not yet tested positive for coronavirus ,” said Rao. “We sanitized the entire coach at Nagpur before the train left for further journey,” Rao added. “Every part of the coach passengers may use was sanitized thoroughly,” he said.Sources from MLA Hostel said the student would not be tested as he was not a ‘patient’ but only identified as ‘home quarantine’. He would be released after at least 48 hours as per the latest government guidelines, if no symptoms surface. “He (the student) would be tested if he develops symptoms. Under no circumstances would he be allowed to use public transport before 14 days, and will have to stay back at the quarantine facility at MLA Hostel,” said a health official.As thousands of people use railway network, passenger trains are seen as the biggest means of spreading coronavirus. It is becoming very difficult for even officials and front-line staff to detect suspect cases.On Saturday, after co-passengers observed a home quarantine seal on a man’s hand, a Delhi-based couple was offloaded at Kazipeth in Telangana on Saturday.

110,['23/03/2020'],Coronavirus outbreak: Unprecedented response to ‘janta curfew’,"BHOPAL: Eerie silence prevailed on the roads in Bhopal city on Sunday as people responded overwhelmingly to Prime Minister, Narendra Modi ’s call for 14-hour ‘Janta curfew ’ across the country from 7.00 am to 9.00 pm.It was a virtual curfew-like situation with police and security personnel seen at some places and barely one or two vehicles seen in a distance of about a Km on roads. The extent of undeclared lockdown could be gauged by the fact that in some areas, even newspapers were not distributed in the morning. In several localities milk booths, petrol pumps and medical shops were also closed, though they had been exempted from ‘Janta curfew’.Vinod Shrivastava, who runs a medical shop at Mandakini shopping complex in Kolar, said he had opened his shop but it was difficult sitting in the completely deserted complex and even customers were not coming to buy anything. “I closed the shop after an hour and went home. I didn’t see a single person on the road in that one hour”, he said.In the entire stretch from Trilanga to M P Nagar Zone I at 4.00 pm, not a single shop was open including milk booths, medical shops and pan shops.Alok Tiwari, who stays in an apartment on Hoshangabad Road said it was a strange feeling watching some boys playing cricket on road towards the evening, the same roads which usually remain clogged with traffic.Shops stayed closed in markets of the old city as well, but movement of people and traffic was much more than in new Bhopal areas.Sunday remains a holiday in any case, but knowing that everyone has to remain indoors, people had made plans on how to pass time without boredom.Manas Mishra, a government employee told TOI that his day started with a family prayer. “After worshipping our ancestral idol, we recited Hanuman Chalisa for positive vibes, which was live streamed on our extended family WhatsApp group. In the afternoon, we settled down to make ourselves a typical Malwa meal of ‘daal baati’ which everyone relished. We took a nap and watched a film. In the evening, we all assembled on our front porch with our thalis to extend support to the brave souls, who are out there offering services for everyone’s protection.”The self-imposed curfew also gave time to everyone to do something which they are not able to do otherwise due to lack of time. Rishi Manuja said, “Being a professional I don’t get to spend a lot of time with myself. Whenever possible, I spent a lot of time busting myths on WhatsApp because fake news is so dangerous. People don’t understand that there is a difference between holding on to positive thoughts and staying in denial. My family WhatsApp group was bustling with discussions around Corona and I actively participated because I think awareness starts with our families.”If the response to call for “Janta Curfew” was unprecedented so was the call to express gratitude to people engaged in essential services braving the threat from Coronavirus . People clapping, banging thalis or ringing bells (ghantis) appeared on their terrace in several societies and colonies as a gesture of gratitude towards them. At some places, though, people while doing so assembled on the gate of a society or a playground in the midst of the houses, which wasn’t advisable.People also felt that the “Janta Curfew” also turned out to be successful in terms of spreading awareness about Coronavirus and how it spreads as far they were not taking interest in the matter, thinking it’s not a big deal.Angel Saxena, a photographer said, “Being a citizen of the nation, I understood the importance of the Janta curfew. It united us all in a sense. Now we know that it’s almost our duty not to go out and stay inside homes and this is the bare minimum that we all can do at this point of time. It’s a collective fight. The non-suspected citizens have a greater role to play so let’s not panic and hope for the best.”",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74766266,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-453730,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/unprecedented-response-to-janata-curfew/articleshow/74764868.cms

India is among the 15 most affected economies by COVID-19. Demand of goods is vanishing day by day as the number of affected cases are increasing. The situation will worsen due to lockdowns announced to prevent India from entering stage 3 of pandemic.”

Agrawal added, “Government should consider six points. All EMIs, including those of term-loans, should be extended by 90 days without penal interest or late payment charges and the borrower should be saved from adverse rating by CIBIL. Banks and financial institutions should be directed not to take adverse action and relax the conditions related to maintenance of margin against working capital limits obtained to run businesses for at least 90 days. Payment of Letter of Credit (LC) should be extended by atleast 90 days without any penal interest against Letter of Assurance from beneficiaries to avoid any mischief and chaos so as to protect the interest of banks as well as business entity. All time bound commitments under Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) such as collections from foreign debtors, export commitments, payment to foreign creditors, etc. which fall due between March 15 to April 30 should be extended by 90 days from their due date. Payment of GST for the month of February to April should be extended by 90 days without any penal interest and GSTIN should allow submission of returns without insisting on payment of GST.

Several banks have waived charges for digital transactions.Banks as well as ATM operators, however, said that some of the lenders are refilling ATMs more frequently, although there is no surge in cash withdrawals. A private sector bank said that last week it had increased the amount of cash by 20-25%, which was partly linked to the lifting of the moratorium imposed on Yes Bank as many lenders were expecting higher withdrawals from the troubled bank’s accounts.“With lockdown imposed in many parts of the country, the demand for cash is going to be lower in the coming weeks,” said a bank executive.

“We used to receive only limited passengers from Italy or Spain in the airports and hence it was easy for us to screen them and also to track their contacts. But now the scene has changed. Thousands of people are coming from Dubai,” said health minister K K Shailaja.

The minister expressed concern over people coming from Dubai not adhering to the quarantine rules of the health department. Hence, she anticipates a community spread.

“We cannot say that we are totally safe and cannot even rule out a community spread. Look at the person who had come to Kasaragod and where all he had travelled. Because of him there is a panic situation in the district,” said the minister.

Home quarantine has to be strictly maintained or else the government will be forced to take action. The chief minister has made it clear that the government is now going to go ahead with the action against those who violates this. All powers have been given to the district collectors to invoke section 2 of Epidemic Disease Act of 1897 to maintain public health and order.

The minister, who is not ready to rule out a community spread, has said that the health department has readied two plans (Plan B and C) in the event of any emergency.

“We have 126 hospitals ready to accommodate the people who are tested positive and also the suspect cases. This includes 55 private and 71 government hospitals. In the Plan A we had readied 1,000 isolation beds. Now, Plan B is being implemented and we have 1,408 beds under this,” said the minister.

“In Plan C we have kept ready 3,028 isolation beds in the state, which include 81 government hospitals and 41 private hospitals. Apart from this, 147 corona care centres have started functioning in the state. We can accommodate 21,866 people at a time in these centres,” said the minister.

But even after the state government equipped all these facilities we are not getting the support of the people who had to go for compulsory quarantine for 14 days once they have reached from places like Dubai. “We are asking them to obey the order for their safety and also for the safety of the society,” said the minister.

Jaipur Municipal Corporation, which was asked to identify structures which can be used as quarantine wards, is now cleaning up and disinfecting the community centres.

At present, the city has two centres for quarantine – RUHS and SMS Hospital. There more than 600 beds in both the places.

JMC additional commissioner Arun Garg confirmed that the community centres would be used in case of emergency. “We are keeping them on stand-by in case the number of people suffering from coronavirus increase. We have looked into the arrangements that need to be made – lights, sanitation, garbage disposal facilities. Extra precautions have been maintained to keep the things in control and keep these buildings ready on short notice,” said Garg.

Many of the 80 community centres lack toilet facilities and some are not in proper shape. There have been complaints of lack of hygiene and sanitation in the centres as well.

An official said these centres are usually located in residential areas where people may object to keeping the patients over there. “Almost all the community centres are situated in the centre of colonies and we fear that people may object of using them as isolation wards. However, in case of emergency, these are the only options for us. They will be properly covered and packed from all the sides for to prevent spreading of the virus,” said a JMC official.

The civic body has started disinfecting many areas in the city including the community centres. At present, 30 teams are busy disinfecting public places for which the JMC had procured 1% sodium hydrochloride solution. Most of the malaria staff of JMC is busy in disinfection work.

RCC director Dr Rekha A Nair said chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery can induce immunosuppression (suppression of immune system and its ability to fight infection) in cancer patients. This may be deleterious to the patients in the current scenario of Covid-19 and hence, it has been decided to postpone the surgeries, the director said.

The chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery scheduled have been deferred by a week; however emergency ones will be undertaken, she said. Patients who are already on radiation will continue with the treatment as scheduled.

For fixing the new dates, patients are requested to contact the helplines: surgery (8289893454, 0471-2522902), radiotherapy (0471-252 2273/2442541/2445069/2445079) and chemotherapy (0471-2442541/2445069/2445079).

Already the RCC management has imposed restrictions on the people who have travelled from foreign countries on coming to the hospital. The management has asked such passengers not to accompany the patients to OP wings.

The Medical College Hospital in Thiruvananthapuram has also regulated the OP timings in view of the Covid-19.

The regulations have been brought to avoid the overcrowding of people at the OP wings. All the non-essential surgeries have also been postponed here.

Apart from the Covid-19 treatment centre, emergency outpatient services and dialysis centre only will function from the medical college.Authorities have identified Ernakulam General Hospital, Mattancherry taluk hospital, Indira Gandhi Cooperative Hospital and some other taluk hospitals for shifting the patients. “The chances of increasing the number of Covid-19 positive cases and suspected cases are going up. Due to the proximity of airport and certain other features, patients from other districts also are being admitted to the medical college. That’s why it was decided to set up such a centre,” said National Health Mission district programme manager Dr Mathew Numbeli. “There are already some Covid-19 positive cases admitted to the medical college. They will have to avail the facilities like CT scan, x-ray, laboratory, cath lab, etc. This creates problems. Once the centre is converted into a Covid-19 treatment centre, the treatment of the patients can be streamlined,” Numbeli said.The hospitals like Indira Gandhi Cooperative hospital have facilities on par with a medical college to a certain extent. “Moreover, some patients having complexities and require advanced treatment will be shifted to a couple of private hospitals. Most of such cases are reported from the paediatrics department. There are certain schemes which help cover the cost and so there won’t be need of additional funds for the treatment at the private hospitals. The private hospital authorities have also promised to offer free treatment to some patients. More private hospitals have promised to offer their facilities. We are considering their offer too,” Numbeli said.Officials with Ernakulam general hospital said they have started preparations for the purpose. “We have a well-equipped gynaecology and paediatrics department. So, patients in these departments can be shifted to general hospital,” said hospital superintendent Dr Anitha.As of now, the medical college has around 500 beds, including the intensive care units.

The employees working in the sector are facing the threat of unemployment as Cial has suspended international services. Many employees are being asked to go on leave. Also, sources said that cost-cutting measures like loss of pay, lay-off, etc. may be initiated if the situation persists.At present Cial has two major players in the ground handling sector – Celebi Aviation Holding and AIATSL, the fully-owned subsidiary of Air India that is into ground-handling services that include baggage, cargo handling and all other services. More than 1,000 staff are working in both the international and domestic sectors as ground handling staffs.“Airlines’ revenue had cut down drastically over the past 15-20 days and no flights have been conducting services with full passenger capacity. The chance of revival anytime soon is dismal as more countries are strengthening travel restrictions. No termination has been started but if the situation continues, agencies will have to start severe cost-cutting measures,” said a source.According to sources, 30 contract workers hired by Celebi for extra work at night time due to runway recarpeting at Cial were asked to leave already by cutting short their contracts. Meanwhile, Celebi had granted its pregnant and aged employees paid leave due to Covid-19 situation.Meanwhile, the challenges faced by the ground handling staff in the wake of Covid-19 alert are serious too. “Our team is at the forefront of the situation. Ground handling staff in general face issues with passengers who may be ignorant about the precautions that must be taken by every individual during such crisis.

149,['23/03/2020'],"Door-to-door, tracking nCoV path","Ahmedabad: The first death due to Covid-19 infection in Gujarat was not of a person who had travelled abroad – the 69-year-old had visited Jaipur and Delhi. Likewise, an 80-year-old woman from Gandhinagar, who was reported positive on Sunday, also did not have any foreign travel history.

According to health department experts, the death fit in the pattern of a person having co-morbidity and old age, but the pattern has raised concerns on whether Covid-19 has entered stage III where it’s spreading in communities.

Thus, on Sunday, health commissioner Jai Prakash Shivahare sent a letter to all district collectors, district development officers and municipal corporation commissioners to initiate a door-to-door survey, not leaving possible cases to chance.

According to the letter, the survey will commence from Monday and it will be done through Innovative mobile-phone Technology for Community Health Operators (ImTeCHO) application. ‘Those returned from abroad will get precedence in the survey. Afterwards, the entire population is to be covered,’ stated the letter.

The district health official and medical officers will conduct the micro planning for the exercise. The survey will include paramedical staff and ASHA workers. Suspected cases will be included in a module which will be reviewed daily.

“We are already covering every possible person who might have come in contact with the positive cases. But it’s not a foolproof method and thus the thorough door-to-door survey is required.

Areas around quarantine houses will also be checked thoroughly,” said a health department official. “Application of the stickers on the quarantine homes has already begun to ensure compliance.” Officials said they are tracing all contacts of the positive cases with no foreign travel history.

The HCI has already made it clear that since the Indian government has announced that no flights would be operated to India till March 31, the students should go back to their accommodation.

Councillor Geetha Morla, a public representative from Shenley Church End, Milton Keyens, told TOI on telephone that she would be able to assist the students find accommodation if they find it difficult to go back to their universities. Geetha, who is the first-ever Telugu person in the UK to be elected as councillor, spoke to the students and also offered to help. “In fact, PM Boris Johnson has announced three-month of rent relief for all those who do not have jobs. The HCI and local government are ready to do everything to keep the students safe,” Geetha said.

As the students had been insisting that the Indian government operate a special flight to take them home, the lawmaker said since the situation in Rome was different perhaps India chose to operate a flight from there as the place was severely affected. “In London, if one takes precautions and stays at home, there is safety,” she said. “They are safer and better looked after here than in India at this point of time,” she said.

A large number of Indian students had come to the High Commission office after they got to know that their flights were cancelled when they arrived in London. Since they too said they had no accommodation, the public representative said she assisted students in Leicester, Bournemouth, Eastham and Luton find a place to stay.

The students, who had stayed back at the HCI premises, fear that that they might not have a chance of getting tested for coronavirus. “The HCI and local council will help the local students in every possible manner. NHS is free in this country and helps anyone who requires help in relation to coronavirus. Tests are free of cost, so everyone who requires help will be treated. I can help if anyone needs. Any student can contact me. I am happy to help students who require help in connecting to the local people in the area or, if need be, personally calling and helping them,” she said. Geetha said she could be reached on email geethamorla@gmail.com or telephone: +447908589209.

NAGPUR: Citizens made the most of the ‘janta curfew’ on Sunday.

Some helped out their mothers in the kitchen, some shook a leg to foot-tapping dance numbers, some binged watched their favourite TV shows and some enjoyed home-cooked food with their families.

This Sunday was quite different from the usual ones as people did not go out to have fun at restaurants and discos but were alert, smart and cautious and spent their first day of janata curfew inside by indulging in creative activities.

Abheek Ghosh from Growill Foundation came up with an innovative idea where over twenty people participated in meditation in the comfort of their homes. They were connected through a WhatsApp group called ‘Yoga Corona’. “Today we find ourselves quarantined in our homes. It is important to find the calm in our inner self and hence, we made this group and many participated in the meditation,” he said. The session was broadcast live on their Instagram page too.

Tanushree Neware, a student who loves to shake a leg on dance numbers, spent her time making tik-tok videos on the ‘go corona’ theme. “I was on a conference video call with my family members in Mumbai and we were having a virtual dance party. Later, we decided to make a funny dance video on the ‘go corona’ tune,” she said.

For Pushkar Bokarey, an engineer, the day was filled with productivity and innovation as he tried his hand at making the 3D-Printed masks shield that are used by doctors during the treatment of Covid-19. “I tried making a few masks. The mask acts as an outer shield and protects one from germs. Hence, I just tried making it and using my time to the fullest,” he said.

Sarang Jajoo, who is an architect by profession, is spending quality time with this family. He also visits his friend’s place, Yudodhan, where they spend time chatting and relaxing. “Home quarantine via the janata curfew is a great way to spend time with parents and family. I’m just relaxing with my friend in his office. He is a lawyer and we spend hours talking and watching movies,” he said.

Student Sugandha Rohatgi was looking forward to the 5pm community call. “I cooked myself a nice breakfast and have been binge watching Netflix. It’s my definition of a perfect Sunday,” she said.

Earlier, family members would watch a movie or a show together, but these days, preferences have undergone a sea change. “My family is glued to the TV ever since the CM extended the lockdown by a few more days,’ added Rohatgi.

Rebecca Peter, an expert in the Korean language, is also a fan of its dramas. She was glued to her computer screen and was enjoying the latest episodes. She also bonded with her parents. “I’m a student and hence, having a good time completing my notes and assignments, but not at the cost of meeting deadlines, which is a welcome relief. Korean dramas always come to my rescue as I am a huge K-Pop fan.” she said.

“My ideal day included playing carom, reading my favourite books and watching movies. I also utilized the time to study for my exams,” said Rishabh Mutholkar.

For Ajinkya Uike, who runs a steel factory, the ‘free time’ was dedicated to making accounts books for his venture and also cooking. “I’m helping my mother in her daily chores. I’m also enjoying cooking meals for my family too,” he said.

COIMBATORE: The trial in the murder case of Hindu Munnani spokesperson C Sasikumar is unlikely to be completed before March, 31, 2020, the deadline set by the Supreme Court. The case is being heard by the special court for NIA ( National Investigation Agency ) cases in Poonamalle, Chennai.

Earlier, the apex court had ordered the presiding officer of the special court for NIA cases in Poonamalle to wrap up the case on or before this March-end. According to an NIA source, a few more prosecution witnesses are to be examined in the court and it will take at least six more months to complete the trial.

The source said, “We are handling more than more than 100 cases from across the state. While the trial in Sasikumar murder case has begun, it will take at another six months to conclude the trial. The state government should set up another court to deal Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act cases exclusively.”

The source said one more accused - Mohammed Rafiqul Hassan , 33, of Kamarajar Street at KK Pudur - was yet to be arrested. Presently, he is settled in Oman with his family.

NIA has issued red corner notice against Mohammed Rafiqul Hassan to all the airports in the country and alerted immigration officials as well. “He will be detained by immigration officials if he were to land in the country. We have also approached the Oman government to deport him to India,” the source said.

Sasikumar, of Subramaniyampalayam near Thudiyalur, was hacked to death near his residence by a gang on the night of September 22, 2016. The case was first handled by the rural police and then transferred to the special investigation division of CB-CID, who arrested Syed Abuthahir, Saddam Hussain, Subair and Mubarak. The case was, however, transferred to NIA in January 2018.

While the agency filed chargesheet against the five, including Mohammed Rafiqul Hassan, on April 7, 2018, charges were framed against four on June 21, 2018. tnn

With this, the number of people arrested in the case has risen to seven. Another 26 accused are, however, still at large.

The city crime branch police identified the arrested as Krishnakumar, 52, a realtor, Selvakumar, 37, a civil engineer and Nandakumar, all residents of Selakarichal near Sulur. They have been lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison under judicial custody.

Earlier, J Lakshmi Prakash , assistant general manager, Tamilnad Mercantile Bank, Trichy Road branch, had in January lodged a complaint with the city crime branch police stating anomalies to the tune of Rs 33.89 crore was detected in the loans issued by former assistant general manager T Sivasubramanian , 55, of Thoothukudi, during his tenure between March 2018 and December 2019.

The complaint said Sivasubramanian had conspired with other staff of the bank and civil engineers to misappropriate Rs 33,89,39,840. During his tenure he had sanctioned 12 loans amounting toRs 33.89 crore to start nine poultry farms and two poultry feed manufacturing units.

In one of the cases, the complainant said, Gomathi, of Selakarichal near Sulur, had taken a loan of Rs 2.89 crore to buy new machineries for her spinning mill and construct a few buildings by pledging 1.71 acres land, the value of which was just a few lakh rupees.

When the complainant visited Selakarichal, he didn’t find any spinning mill and realized that Gomathi had duped the bank with the help of a realtor, civil engineers and bank officials, an investigation officer said.

“Likewise, Nagarathinam took a loan of Rs 4.24 crore to set up a poultry farm by pledging 9.91 acres land at Varapatti, while Venkatesh borrowed Rs 4.26 crore by forging various documents. The remaining cases aren’t any different either. None had set up poultry farms or poultry feed manufacturing units. The borrowers submitted forged documents and increased the guideline value of their lands by at least four folds. They also submitted photos of buildings, while there were none,” the complaint said.

The officer said it was Nandakumar who forged all the documents. Two weeks ago, the city crime branch police had arrested Sivasubramanian, Gomathi, Mahesh, a realtor from Vilankurichi Road, and K M Pandian, 37, a civil engineer from Sulur, in connection with the case. While Pandian came out on bail, the remaining three are languishing in the Coimbatore Central Prison.

In the study which was conducted along with Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration,Mussoorie, it was found that several factors played a role in the accident that left at least 43 dead and several others injured last year.

The report which was shared with Delhi government recently stated that the blaze took place in a factory where school bags, bottles and other materials were stocked. “The building was packed with cardboards, plastic toys, garments, rexine and other packaging items. This aggravated the fire and resulted in dense smoke, which suffocated the people trapped inside.”

According to the CDMS report, the incident “exposed the poor working conditions of industrial workers employed in thousands of such illegal and ill-managed factories operating from the residential areas of Delhi & NCR. It also highlighted the lackadaisical attitude of various regulatory authorities, government departments and individuals.”

Absence of inspection and inadequate buyer policies pose several threats, the report warns. As per its recommendations, there should be a task force with decision makers, such as local factory owners, industry trade associations, retailers, civic bodies, civil society organisations and unions, NGOs and philanthropic organisations.

“The task force needs to conduct a comprehensive census of all unorganised factories in the city as the existing data are weak and unreliable. It will have to develop an equitable model for determining the financial responsibility of each stakeholder group in meeting the post-disaster overall funding requirement,” the report, prepared by the students, added.

“The decision-makers should focus on developing models to track the migrant population of workers from each part of the country working in the unorganised clusters. And there should be a nodal department to keep a tab on how many workers enter Delhi and how their livelihood takes place, so that they can be identified in case of an emergency.”

“Facilitation centres should be established in zones where people from unorganised sectors and poor economic background live. Problems of livelihood must be solved so that the poor workers can also live in a safer environment,” the report suggested.

164,['23/03/2020'],T students in Kazakhstan told to stay put there,"Hyderabad: With the state government taking up the issue of Telangana students stranded at Almaty airport in Kazakhstan, the Consulate General of India in Astana, Kazakhstan has said it was wrong to say the students were stranded at the airport.

In a letter to the Telangana state government, CGI, Astana, advised that the students be informed to stay back until the situation improves and travel ban was lifted. “Their hostels are still operational and mess facilities are available. The embassy has also advised all universities and educational contractors to continue to run hostels and mess facilities,” CGI, Astana said.

“If students are from cities other than Almaty, which will enforce entry/exit measures from tomorrow, please advise them to go back to their cities urgently. Their student contractors can help in this regard. Staying in large groups at public places like airports might pose problems for Kazakh law and order officials,” the letter issued on March 21 said.

The CGI explained that since the students have semester holidays, they wanted to visit India. The official said Kazakhstan was not highly infected with Covid-19 and the government there was taking all steps to contain the spread of the virus. “When students know that there are government restrictions/quarantine measures, which were announced well in advance, they could have undertaken their travel when the situation improved,” the official said.

The letter was in response to a letter from Telangana government on March 21, mentioning that 14 medical students from the state were stranded at the Kazakhstan airport for the last three days without flights, food and accommodation. The general administration (NRI) department wrote a letter to the Indian embassy in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, seeking help for the students to return.

165,['23/03/2020'],Coronavirus crashes wedding plans,"Kochi: His daughter's wedding was a dream, and Murali Rajan (name changed) was preparing for a big bash in April. However, the spike in Covid-19 cases and the resultant restrictions imposed by the government have forced a change in plans.

“In the changed circumstances I am unsure whether it will be possible to hold even a low-key affair. If we are forced to postpone the event, I don't know long we will have to wait,” said Rajan.

His initial plan was to scale down the event. Instead of the convention centre that was booked, the venue was shifted to a local temple. “Our families are religious and we don’t want to miss the auspicious day that has been chosen. I plan to take a decision after March 31,” he said.

Why March 31? “Current restrictions are in place till then,” says Rajan.

He is keeping his friends and relatives updated over phone, email and WhatsApp about the change in plans. With travel restrictions in place Rajan is not keen on visiting them to convey the news.

Similar sentiments are shared by many families that have scheduled weddings in the months of March and April.

Lalitha Mohan had scheduled her daughter’s engagement for April 16. “There is so much uncertainty. The family is keen on postponing the event to a future date. But, we are unable to finalize a date,” she said.

Cancellations and postponements have adversely affected the wedding industry. Most pre-wedding shoots have been cancelled.

“Families of brides and grooms have already communicated the cancellations or postponements. In most cases they have not given a final date. All large-scale photo shoots are being avoided. In low-key weddings, very few photos are taken, which are mainly for the purpose of documentation,” said Ananthu G Prakesh, a freelance photographer based in Tripunithura.

COIMBATORE: As many as 200 migrant workers who reached the Coimbatore Junction railway station in the Dhanbad-Alappuzha Express on Sunday afternoon were shocked to find the otherwise busy streets eerily empty.

They had boarded the train two days ago, not aware of the state government’s decision to suspend the bus service in support of the Janta Curfew proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“I have been working in the district for 19 years and it is with that confidence that I boarded the train from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh on Friday morning. But even in my dreams I did not expect that I would be struggling to feed my one year old son. Fortunately, my fellow passengers arranged milk and some cookies for him,” said 40-year-old Madhan Kumar, who works in a machine manufacturing unit in Annur.

“I was not aware of the closure of eateries and the state government’s decision to stop the bus service in the city. Otherwise, I would not have boarded the train with my wife and son,” he told TOI.

Ranchana from Odisha was accompanied by eight of her family members who works at an estate in Coonoor. They waited at the bus stop in front of the station for five hours. “We had a harrowing time as we had children with us. We requested taxi drivers to take us to Coonoor and were ready to pay whatever they demanded. But they refused,” she said.

As groups of migrant workers sat in front of the railway station cursing their bad luck, a team consisting of non-governmental organizations led by Coimbatore collector K Rajamani reached there carrying food packets. He also arranged accommodation for them in the community hall of the CSI Immanuel Church at Uppilipalayam in the city after screening them for the symptoms of coronavirus.

However, there were hardly any patrons. Traders’ associations said all members had closed their shops irrespective of political affiliations as this was a public health emergency.P Murugan, district president of Tamil Nadu Vyabarigal Sammelanam , said they had urged all the members to observe janata curfew. “Usually, during bandhs that are called for political reasons there would be one or two shops doing business on the sly.

He said they conducted the ritual at home with a very few close relatives. “We had also cancelled the grand arrangements for the marriage and reception.”As appealed by Modi, at 5pm, residents came out to their doors and balconies and clapped, clanged utensils and sounded gongs to show their gratitude to doctors, health and sanitary workers and other personnel, who are working to contain Covid-19 pandemic.

However, even essential services such as fuel stations, grocery stores and a few others which were exempt from observing the curfew also kept their shutters down.Few services that did remain open were seen functioning with limited capacity. For instance, some fuel outlets ran with only unit. “Since not many customers were expected, only two of the total 12 staff was asked to report for duty,” said Raju, a worker at a petrol bunk in Sainikpuri.Those who came out to buy groceries, many of them daily-wage labourers, had to return empty handed. “Now, neither do we have money to buy vegetables nor are any stores open,” said Rajamma, a daily wage labourer.

However, in some areas people made mockery of the curfew and came out in large numbers on the streets.Ninety-three-year-old Anshi Devi, her 75-year-old nephew Balkishan Bandhana and around 50 other family members gathered at the balcony of their haveli in Johari Bazar and started blowing conches and clapped. “We live in a joint family and since the day we came to know about the Italian couple testing positive for Covid-19, we have been following social distancing,” said Bandhana, who was beating a drum. The Bandhana family, where six generations live together, has asked its relatives and friends not to visit them until the danger of Covid-19 vanishes.Likewise, people living in residential apartments also came out in their balconies and terraces to offer their gratitude. “It is a good initiative by the state and the Union government and we all must abide by it,” said Gaurav Nagar, who came from Ahmedabad to his in-laws house and is now stuck due to lockdown.However, at many places police had to intervene when people came out in large numbers on streets.

The day ended with families coming out on their balconies to clap and ring bells to salute those involved in essential services.

Jaipur witnessed almost complete silence when people of every age, caste, creed and religion preferred to stay indoors. Hardly any vehicles were seen on the roads.

TOI visited various parts of the city to know how Jaipur was responding to the ‘janta curfew’.

The only shops that opened in the morning were a few milk parlours and some grocery shops in the interiors of housing colonies. Police vehicles with loudspeakers made the rounds of streets and requested people to stay indoor. Medical stores, diagnostic centres were among those that opened across the city.

A bike-borne 25-year-old youth was stopped by policemen when he tried to enter through Chandpole Gate. “I am clicking pictures. I have never seen Jaipur like this,” he told the policemen.

The Jaipur railway station that witnesses a footfall of nearly 4 lakh people daily was empty, so was the road in front of it. Some generous voluntary groups and policemen organised food packets for street dewellers including beggars.

“We have prepared 500 food packets and are distributing them among the beggars. We also visited government hospitals to distribute food packets,” said a volunteer at Badi Chaupar.

189,['23/03/2020'],"Mumbaikars clap, clang metal, blow conches to salute docs","Mumbai: The eerie silence on streets, hit by the janata curfew, was broken with the sound of fervous clapping much before the clock struck 5 in the city on Sunday. Clangs of metals, cymbals, bells and blowing of conches rented the air, as people went to balconies and in some cases out of their homes, following an appeal by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to thank healthcare and sanitation workers. Some large gatherings in residential areas defeated the curfew’s purpose.

At Dosti Imperia (Thane), residents were urged to participate with metal instruments and conches. They were encouraged to wear clothes showcasing colours of the Indian flag, told to sing ‘Mile Sur Mera Tumhara’ and shoot selfies and videos. “We came out with an elaborate plan to engage the community. When most of us are reeling under the fear of infection and are confined to our homes, it was a very good activity to get the community together,” said Parikshit Lad, a resident.

Prathamesh Residency (Andheri) saw many people clap and ring bells. “Today, doctors are our soldiers, working selflessly in hospitals. We got a golden opportunity to thank them, as a community. This was needed,” said a resident, Ruhi Kapoor. Some societies sang ‘Hum honge kamyaab’, while others chanted ‘Go Corona’. Some organised prayer meetings to ward of the ‘evil’.

Lokhandwala Complex (Andheri) wore its heart on its sleeve. Ten minutes before the appointed hour, all four crossroads of the complex erupted in a show of gratitude. “Residents of Lane 4 went to balconies and windows, and beat metal plates, rang puja bells and blew conch shells. The enthusiastic show of solidarity, in large part for Modi, lasted approximately 15 minutes,” said a resident.

At Vastu Tower, Vastu Park and Abrol Vastu buildings at Evershine Nagar, Malad (W), the beating of utensils commenced at 4.50pm with a resident. While many rooted for doctors, nurses and police personnel, a family dedicated it to their son-in-law in the armed forces. Within seconds, several people, including children, were at their windows, in several nearby buildings, chiming bells, blowing whistles and conches, drumming boxes, and banging ‘’thalis’. The noise drowned the claps.

Two Italians, whose country is under lockdown, joined residents by clapping from their balcony at a housing society in Vile Parle. Diana Linda, a designer, in the country for 18 years, said it was the duty of all citizens to thank health workers, at the forefront of our fight against the virus. “We can only help by staying at home during this crisis,” said Diana. She said though India may have lost on four crucial weeks, it is more proactive than European countries. It may be a little late, but a complete lockdown is the only way to deal with this, she added.

At some societies, residents came out in large numbers on terraces and on streets, defying the purpose of social distancing. Smriti Nagaraj, who lives in Andheri (E), said few teenagers got out on streets to take videos and adults joined them shortly after that. “Police told them to return home. After repeated requests, when they did not budge, police said they would take them in a van. They returned home. But later, when police saw people on the terrace, they began to go around in their vehicle, announcing, “Terrace se neeche utro aur ghar jaao”. A police van, which patrolled the area, announced imposition of section 144 and appealed to residents to stay indoors in the western suburbs.

KOLKATA: Around 50% of domestic flights operated at city airport on Sunday as international flights stopped operation for a week. Domestic operators said even they were in the process of rationalizing their flights in the days ahead as Kolkata goes into a lockdown from Monday.

“There has been around 50% domestic operation today. While the flights arriving still had decent passengers, those departing had very few passengers,” said a senior official at the Kolkata airport.

While IndiGo said it ran 80 out of 115 operations on Sunday, other domestic carriers like Vistara and SpiceJet said that they ran less number of flights than usual.

“Flights from cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi were near packed with passengers. Though passengers at departing flights to Metro cities were less, flights to regional sectors like Patna and Guwahati ran full,” said an IndiGo official.

Meanwhile, passengers, who arrived in Kolkata on the last international flight — an Emirates flight from Dubai , that touched down in Kolkata at 7am — claimed harassment and confusion as they were taken to a quarantine centre in New Town on Sunday morning. They were, however, allowed to go home even without any “real test”.

“We were checked with thermal scanners at the airport following which we were asked to go to a quarantine facility in New Town. I was mentally prepared to stay there for a few days as per the protocol. But at the quarantine centre, the doctor simply asked if I had fever or any other symptoms of novel coronavirus and then allowed me to go home and stay in home isolation. If this was the only test we had to undergo, why take us all the way to New Town and make us wait for five hours?” said Srabanti De, who works at a hotel in Dubai and lives in Bankura.

Midnapore resident Samiran Hazra said he had even told the doctors at the quarantine centre that for returning home, they will have to avail public transport and if it was at all safe in this situation. “The doctors just said that I don’t need to get admitted or undergo any further test and that I should just go home and stay in isolation and that I should wash my own clothes,” said Hazra, who works at a private firm in Oman.

Both of them were, however, handed over a small piece of paper where it was written that they needed to stay in home-isolation for 14 days. “An official at the quarantine centre told us that the paper is a proof that we have undergone necessary tests and that we can show the paper to the cops or neighbours if we face any trouble from them,” said De.

There was also trouble at the airport after passengers of a domestic airline complained they had a co-passenger with a “home quarantine” tag on his hand in their flight, who had returned from USA to Delhi and then took a flight to Kolkata. The passengers claimed the airline didn’t take any step and only after the flight reached Kolkata, the youth was sent to the quarantine facility by the state government’s health department screeners in Kolkata.

Meanwhile, passengers arriving at the airport on Sunday complained of extortion by taxi and even app-cab operators. A passenger, Vinay Daga, posted on Twitter saying: “I just took a ride from Kolkata airport. App-cab drivers at airport are extorting extra money from riders in the name of ‘janata curfew’ and shortage of vehicles. Riders shown fare of Rs 279 were asked to pay Rs 400, while some, who were shown fare of Rs 450, were finally told to shell out Rs 800 to board vehicles.” The airport’s pre paid taxi counter was also closed down by afternoon following shortage of vehicles.

When officials pointed this out to persons advised isolation at home, it often came to light that they were taking things casually as they were not taking ill.“They do not seem to understand that a person can remain asymptomatic for one to two weeks and still transmit the disease.

206,['23/03/2020'],"Will Help Those Stuck In London, Says Councillor","Hyderabad: The 19 Indian students, most of them from the two Telugu states, who were staying put at the High Commission of India (HCI), London, and refusing to leave until they were flown back to the country, have left the premises of the commission on Sunday.

Local authorities were trying to convince them to leave the premises. The HCI had already made it clear that since the Indian government had announced that no flights would be operated to India till March 31, the students should go back to their accommodation.

Councillor Geetha Morla, a public representative from Shenley Church End, Milton Keyens, told TOI on telephone that she would be able to assist the students find accommodation if they find it difficult to go back to their universities. Geetha, who is the first-ever Telugu person in the UK to be elected as councillor, spoke to the students and also offered to help. “In fact, PM Boris Johnson has announced three-month of rent relief for all those who do not have jobs. The HCI and local government are ready to do everything to keep the students safe,” Geetha said.

As the students had been insisting that the Indian government operate a special flight to take them home, the lawmaker said since the situation in Rome was different, perhaps India chose to operate a flight from there as the place was severely affected. “In London, if one takes precautions and stays at home, there is safety,” she said. “They are safer and better looked after here than in India at this point of time,” she said.

A large number of Indian students had come to the High Commission office after they got to know that their flights were cancelled when they arrived in London. Since they too said they had no accommodation, the public representative said she assisted students in Leicester, Bournemouth, Eastham and Luton find a place to stay.

The students, who had stayed back at the HCI premises, fear they might not have a chance of getting tested for coronavirus. “The HCI and local council will help the local students in every possible manner. NHS is free in this country and helps anyone who requires help in relation to coronavirus. Tests are free of cost. Any student can contact me. I am happy to help students who require help in connecting with local people, if need be, personally calling and helping them,” she said. Geetha said she could be reached on email geethamorla@gmail.com or telephone: +447908589209.

Vadodara: On Sunday evening people across the country applauded doctors, medical staff and all those involved in essential services. But there are also individuals in Sanskarinagri who are going the extra mile to help people who have self-quarantined themselves.

A group of over 70 Barodians will start delivering grocery and milk to all those who will remain inside their homes. “So far our group was delivering face masks and raising awareness among people to keep social distance. But in the coming days we will start delivery of essential items including medicines,” said Parth Purohit.

Purohit further said that the group, which consists of people from different walks of life, is also planning to launch a helpline.

“People in our group have showed readiness to give essential items. There are medical representatives, pharmacists and dentists among others who have agreed to deliver medicines and we are also planning to deliver vegetables and milk directly from the farmers,” Purohit added.

The group was also active during floods last year as they had distributed food packets and medicines to all those were in need.

Kushan Patel, a communications professional working in an engineering company, has also planned to help senior citizens. “I have stocked up some vegetables, oil and milk pouches which I will be delivering,” Patel said. He got the idea as several of his friends work in metro cities while their parents live in the Banyan City.

Like Purohit and Patel, Manish Vya, a photographer, met every cop on road and firemen on Sunday to serve ayurvedic decoction. “We prepared the decoction throughout the night with 15 to 20 natural herbs. We are giving one glass to police staff who are on roads and firemen so that they can have some immunity while working in public,” said Vyas, a resident of Wadi. By Sunday evening, he served at least 7,000 glasses of the decoction.

208,['23/03/2020'],"Private labs await nod to collect samples from home, conduct Covid-19 tests","TimesView The private sector needs to be involved heavily in the fight against the disease. Government hospitals and diagnostic centres alone will not be able to take the huge load that experts say is more than likely.

KOLKATA: With the central government allowing NABL-accredited private laboratories to conduct confirmatory test on swab samples of Covid-19 suspects, at least eight private facilities in Kolkata are applying for registration with the ICMR . Once they get the approval, which is likely to come in the next couple of days, they will start taking samples.Once the ICMR allows private labs to collect samples from home, it could be a huge relief for many, especially those without symptoms or with mild symptoms, who are eager to avoid hospital isolation ahead of confirmation. But health experts said that collecting samples from home could pose logistic and safety challenges.“We will be registered with ICMR on Monday morning. We have trained our manpower and can start conducting tests to detect Covid-19 once we get the approval,” said Somnath Chatterjee, director Suraksha Diagnostics. Currently, ICMR-NICED and the IPGMER are testing Covid-19 samples across the state. Due to the rise in number of suspects and patients, the government has designated four more labs, including in Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, North Bengal Medical College and Midnapore Medical College as testing centres. These labs are, however, yet to start taking samples.“With ICMR extending the category of people whose swab samples need to be tested, the rush for testing is going to be huge. It is impractical to restrict testing to just government labs,” said a health department official.According to guidelines so far, samples of only symptomatic suspects, especially those who flew back from the affected regions and symptomatic persons who had come in close contact with the confirmed case, were being examined. Now, the ICMR has extended this list to those, who are asymptomatic but had contact with a confirmed case, symptomatic healthcare providers, any patient admitted in hospital with respiratory illness. “Labs for PCR testing for virology with at least bio-safety level II can test Covid-19 tests. Since we have the facility, we are applying for ICMR registration,” said Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhury, microbiologist at Peerless Hospital. The city has at least eight labs in the private sector that confirms the specifications laid down by ICMR. Alok Roy, chairperson, Medical Superspecialty, also confirmed that they are writing to ICMR for the registration. The labs are allowed to use US FDA-approved kits while the government has capped the charges for each test at Rs 4,500. Those running these labs said that if the government provides the primer to conduct test, the charges could come down to nearly one fourth. Diagnostics chains like Suraksha are likely to come up with a helpline number where people can contact to get their samples collected from home for testing. Alternatively, the labs have been asked to create separate sample collection sites.“Ideally all labs should have an isolation facility for sample collection with dedicated manpower and proper personal protective equipment (PPE),” said Chaudhury. If any sample tests positive to Covid-19 at these labs, it will be double- checked by NIV Pune before coming to the conclusion.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74768609,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-121081,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-labs-await-nod-to-collect-samples-from-home-conduct-covid-19-tests/articleshow/74765025.cms

212,['23/03/2020'],"Fear, panic, hope. A day spent indoors","NEW DELHI/GURUGRAM: Cities are like sledgehammers. Every day they hit you hard with their sights, smells and sounds. The sights may not be the prettiest. The smells can be downright obnoxious and the sounds overwhelming. But that’s what gives a city its signature, its identity.But on Sunday during the nationwide “janta curfew”, the NCR morphed into another entity. Empty streets evoked a feeling of being someplace else. The odour lessened. And the cocktail of noise produced by cars, trains and people seemed to have disappeared overnight. This wasn’t the city one woke up to every day. “It was a different, almost surreal experience,” said marketing professional Madhur Mehrotra who lives in New Ashok Nagar.And it stayed that way till 9pm, barring a five minute interregnum at 5 pm when conchshells blared, bells rang, hands clapped and kitchen utensils became percussion instruments in a tribute that millions gave to those involved in the fight against the novel coronavirus.“The activity at 5 pm showed everyone is united in this fight against novel coronavirus. People know how serious the problem is and are determined to fight it,” said 72-year-old Manjeet Singh Seble.For Bali Nagar resident Aditya Vij, the day brought a pleasant surprise. “I haven’t felt such peace in years. I could hear birds and music in distance,” said the 47-year-old, who spent the day with his mother and sister.Many had a similar feeling in Gurugram. They spoke how, after a long time, they could hear the sounds of nature — the chirping of the birds and the rustling of the leaves — undistracted by the random everyday tumult that forms the aural soundtrack to everyday life. Even Noida sector-34 resident Dipti Jha saw a group of humming birds and heard them chatter as they flew from one corner to other in the park below.It was indeed a different weekend. Some took it as an opportunity to spend time with family without distractions, others spent the day in fear and panic. For GC Chatterjee, a retired central government employee who lives in Dilshad Garden, it felt like a lull before the storm. “I am a senior citizen, therefore more at risk. It is quite scary. I am feeling restless, trapped and this uneasy quiet is not helping me either. But hopefully it will help keep this deadly disease at bay or at least infect as few as possible,” he said. Chatterjee’s son stays in New Zealand and has been keeping tabs on his parents over the phone. “He is very worried about us,” the 69-year-old said.Confined to their homes different people found different ways to spend their day. Homemaker Jaghdhatri Mishra, who lives in Ghaziabad’s Kavi Nagar, said the lockdown actually added to her chores. “With no maid and no cook I started early. The day was spent preparing breakfast, cleaning floor and doing laundry. I have come to realize this could be the new normal for some days and there is nothing that can be done” she said.Kaushal Verma, a resident of Punjabi Bagh , said he spent his time playing the flute, a hobby he forsook a few years ago. “Generally on weekends there used to be pending work that kept me occupied. But now I am tension free. Of course the problem staring at us is much bigger and we need to address it from the front,” Verma added.For Shalini Khanna of Greater Kailash too, it was a day well spent. “My teenage kids and me began the day by sanitising the entire house. We did yoga and enjoyed a lavish breakfast. We even finished some long-pending chores such as re-arranging clothes in the cupboards and keeping the woollen blankets under the sun,” said Khanna, who works in a corporate house.“I usually don’t get to spend much time at home as I have a family business to take care of, but with the lockdown, I spent time with my children and read stories to them. The day just made me realise that I should spend more time with my kids. They are growing up, and after the situation improves, I will make it a point to spend every weekend with my wife and children,” said Kabir Singh, a resident of Karol Bagh.Arun Malik, a resident of Vasant Kunj, decided to watch his favourite series on Netflix with his family after lunch. “It was a lazy day as nobody could go out. So we got up late, and later watched television together. In the evening we even played board games, something we had not done for a long time. But no restaurant was open and the fact we couldn’t eat out was a dampener,” he said.However, not everyone had an option to stay at home. Mahinder, who works as a security guard at Vasant Vihar , said it was business as usual, the only exception being minimal footfall. “It is like a Bharat bandh. But we have to stand guard,” the 27-year-old said.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74766098,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-202625,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fear-panic-hope-a-day-spent-indoors/articleshow/74765050.cms

Though essential services were exempted from ‘janata curfew’ many medical stores also remained closed besides petrol pumps and grocery stores, leading to inconvenience to many .

As all petrol pumps were closed we had to drop the plan.” “I dragged my scooter for about 3km as it ran out of fuel while I was returning from hospital. No petrol pumps were open in my locality,” said Rajan Verma (25), a resident of Rajajipuram.

Verma had gone to Civil Hospital to meet his grandfather who is undergoing treatment there.

Anjani Pandey (46) of Telibagh said, “Since it was announced that medical stores will remain open, I went to buy insulin but could not find any medical store open. I had to go to SGPGI to get it.”

Nikita Agarwal (34) of Sarojininagar said her son suffered severe head injury while playing, but all private hospitals and clinics were closed. “We had to rush to community health centre for primary treatment,” she said.

SLUG: Collection of Construction & Demolition waste

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) bid to appoint a private agency to collect and transport construction and demolition waste failed to receive any response on two occasions.

Now, the civic body has invited a fresh Request for Proposal from private agencies to collect and recycle construction and demolition waste in the city.

“Earlier, we made two attempts but did not receive response. Now we have floated a request for proposal for the third time from private agencies for collection, transportation, processing and management of constructions and demolition waste in the city on design, build, operate, transfer (DBOR) basis along with onsite recycling facility,” an NMC official said.

The objective is to overcome the issue of construction and waste in the city. The forms will be made available online from March 26 onwards and the last day for submitting the bid is April 4.

Pre-bid meeting of private contractors, who will submit their request for proposals, will be held on April 7 and the bids will be opened on May 6.

Disposing debris from demolition and construction sites has become a major issue in the city. Taking the serious cognizance of this, the NMC came up with a solution to appoint a private agency that will collect and transport the construction and demolition waste.

The civic administration has no proper management or disposal system for the construction and demolition waste. As per the government guidelines, the NMC is planning to manage and recycle construction and demolition waste through private agency.

The civic will provide a land where to the contractor where construction and demolition waste would be recycled. The construction waste, which is not usable or can’t be recycled, will be sent to the dumping ground as identified by the municipal corporation.

The list of dumping grounds in all six divisions — Nashik East, Nashik West, Nashik Road, Satpur, Cidco and Panchavati — will be given the contractor for carrying out the work.

But Amdavadis responded to the Prime Minister’s call and observed a near-complete janata curfew on Sunday. The only people seen on the usually bustling city roads were police personnel, sanitation workers, those out on government work, or those headed to hospitals.

""I have been living in Ahmedabad for over two decades. But for the first time, I woke up to the calls of birds at 8am,"" said Ameya Joshipura, a resident of Anandnagar. ""It was eerily silent. The general ambient noise of people working or chatting below my apartment was missing. The scene outside my window was straight out of an apocalyptic movie.""

With milk distributors visiting homes earlier than scheduled, the day began early for many Amdavadis. Grocery stores remained closed in areas such as Satellite, Anandnagar, Prahladnagar, Vastrapur, and Bodakdev. Several medical stores that had remained open in the early hours shut in the afternoon.

""We received 120-odd crates of milk pouches. The entire stock was exhausted by 8.30am,"" said a milk booth manager in Vejalpur. ""People purchased double the usual supply fearing a shortage. We had to turn a few down, asking them to inquire after 2pm."" There was a rush for bread too. ""One customer bought five packets of bread, which will expire in three days,"" said a milk parlour staffer on Judges Bungalow Road.

The usually active areas such as CG Road and SG Road were completely empty. Experts believe that with the majority of commercial establishments and offices ordered closed for the next three days, and with some providing the work-from-home option, the situation will not change drastically this week.

Many families took the voluntary isolation in their stride to celebrate family time. ""We have seven family members and it’s generally not possible for us to catch up,"" said Darshan Dave, a resident of Vejalpur. ""A family meal in the afternoon was followed by a card-games spree.""

At 5pm, the community spirit brought residents of societies together. Harshad Patel, a social worker from Amraiwadi, said that many people made a noise to praise professionals and volunteers battling the COVID-19 pandemic. He said the gathering was unprecedented.

Khadia-type processions unacceptable, says CM

Chief minister Vijay Rupani termed a procession in Khadia on Sunday ‘unacceptable.’ Some residents of Khadia merged into a procession while coming out to pay tribute to those working in the time of COVID-19, at 5pm on Sunday. The procession took place when the city is in lockdown and CrPC Section 144 is in force. Specifically referring to the rally in Khadia, the CM remarked in a video message, ""I am saying this with grief. Excess of enthusiasm is unacceptable. The very purpose of ‘janata curfew’ and lockdown of key cities gets defeated by such acts."" He said, ""It is a prolonged struggle against the pandemic and all our efforts to contain the virus will go in vain if people do not adhere to guidelines.""

221,['23/03/2020'],New York turns into unknown city,"From the 42nd floor balcony of my Manhattan residence, I get a clear view of the Hudson. New Jersey City on the other bank of the river is known as Little India for the number of Indian population living in the state. As New York , a city which never sleeps, gradually inches towards an absolute lockdown amid the novel coronavirus crisis forcing us New Yorkers to stay indoors, the glimpse of the New Jersey skyline reminds me of my country.

New York has always been a city on the move. From ordering a pizza at midnight or calling for a radio cab in the wee hours — New York has made me fall in love with its charm and energy, a feeling which provides me comfort and wraps me like a warm blanket on a chilly winter night.

But, as I sit in my room tonight, after taking a stroll in the sprawling and the most popular urban park of the city — the Central Park — I realize that New York has turned into an unknown city.

The oddity of the situation struck me hard during my visit to one of the supermarkets. I found that endless racks which are otherwise stacked with myriad varieties of necessary daily commodities are running dry. My other Bengali-speaking friends, too, met with a similar fate that made them trigger a panic button and predict an impending crisis.

On a dull Tuesday evening in Manhattan, as I entered a local store to pick up my daily dose of milk, I was astounded by the unusual sight of a crowded hall where buyers formed an endless queue, waiting patiently to make their way into the store. The very sight took me back to a packed Durga Ashtami evening at a popular south Kolkata pandal.

As I tried to connect with a friend over WhatsApp, who lives in a small town on the outskirts of Chicago , to share my story, she shared a similar experience. The mother of a five-year-old kid, who has been living with her techie husband at the address for the last two years, had faced a distressing time when she encountered empty counters without eggs, milk, water or even the easy-to-procure desserts.

Our days are now being reoriented as we learn to experiment cooking with the limited and available ingredients, video-chat with families, assure parents of our well being sitting in a country thousands of miles away from home.

I always remain glued on to Bengali news channels that keeps me updated about the information of my state. It is heartening to know our beloved ‘Didi’ has taken adequate precautions for the well-being of West Bengal. Everyday, I get concerned thinking if India will be able to survive the onslaught of the virus. More than the view of the New Jersey City skyline, I wish to see the future when India soars past the predicted difficult times ahead.

We don’t have an option. The government should show concern about those who have no means to safeguard themselves,” said the woman who sells balloons to make a living. Sunday was a tough day for her as there was no one to buy balloons.“It’s a double whammy for us. While we live on the streets, now there is the fear of our catching the virus.

Lucknow: Spending quality time with loved ones doesn’t leave room for complaints, said businesswoman Sneha Charan, one among the several lakh city residents who stayed home on Sunday as part of a nationwide social distancing exercise amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.

“As a working mother, I am always guilt-tripping because I don’t get enough time with my children. The ‘janata curfew’ helped me overcome a bit of that guilt. I spent the whole day with my two kids. We read books together and played games,” the 30-year-old Mahanagar resident said.

RK Shukla of Aashiana said he counted his blessings because his wife and son were with him and safe. “When children leave home and city for further studies, parents can’t stop worrying or missing them. My son Madhumesh is back home for now and we all played a game of carom. Guess what? I won!” Shukla said.

If family time topped the to-do list of citizens confined indoors, some cosied up to nature and recorded bird videos, some rustled up happy meals, some pored over books and many took up spring cleaning to fight off the virus.

Hindnagar resident Devendar Kaur cooked the favourite dishes of her two grandchildren before the whole gang sat down for a movie marathon. “We have got together after two years. To me, March 22 is not a curfew day, but one that brought my family closer,” said the 65-year-old woman.

They were punished and told to hold placards with messages about coronavirus.

The law and order police and traffic personnel, who were deployed across the city, were seen stopping motorists and others to check their identity proofs to ensure they were not violating the curfew rule without a valid reason.

Speaking to TOI, Banjara Hills traffic inspector B Prasad Rao, who was manning the streets at KBR Junction, said, “We did not allow anyone to come out on to the streets without a valid reason. In case, someone was found outside without a valid reason, we made them hold placards to educate others about Covid-19 and the importance of staying indoors.”

At KBR Junction, Panjagutta Junction and Jubilee check post, the placards read, ‘Social distancing is social responsibility’, ‘Safe hands save from corona’, ‘Please support janata curfew’ and ‘Use your forearm when you cough or sneeze’.

At Panjagutta junction, the traffic police were seen giving counselling to motorists on why it was important to stay at home during the curfew period before they handed them over placards to create awareness.

“We allowed only essential travel. Those who came out for other reasons were counselled and then asked to create awareness on the infection. Except a few isolated cases, the curfew has been successful as the streets were mostly empty,” Panjagutta traffic inspector M Ravi said.

At some places, police themselves were holding placards to educate the people, while some were requesting them with folded hands to stay indoors. The law and order and traffic police personnel of all three commissionerates —Hyderabad, Rachakonda and Cyberabad — took steps to ensure that the ‘janata curfew’ was successful as the state recorded 22 Covid-19 positive cases so far.

The Begumpet traffic police stationed at Hyderabad Public School identified a person with symptoms of Covid-19 and sent him to Gandhi Hospital for further tests. The traffic police called 108 after they noticed the man was suffering from cold, cough and fever.

Industrial and business associations from the city have decided to keep their factories and offices shut following a meeting of representatives of the associations and Vadodara district collector Shalini Agrawal on Sunday.

The meeting was attended by office-bearers of Federation of Gujarat Industries (FGI), Vadodara Chambers of Commerce and Industries (VCCI), Ranoli GIDC Association, Makarpura GIDC Association, Savli GIDC Association, Waghodia GIDC Association, BITA and Exim Club. These GIDCs are home to medium and large scale engineering and chemical units that supply products locally and even export to different countries.

“After the meeting all the representatives agreed to remain shut to avoid risk to the life of thousands of workers who come to work on a daily basis,” said Agrawal.

“Wages of employees won’t be deducted during these days when the firms will observe a shutdown,” she said, adding that pharma companies, API, masks and other firms making essential products will continue to function as normal.

The state government on Saturday had announced lockdown in Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Surat and Rajkot in the wake of Coronavirus threat.

Members of some associations, however, said that such a shutdown will affect their targets for local supply as well as exports as it is March end. “Also, if small firms remain shut down for a longer time, they can’t afford to pay salaries to the employees. The government has to step in with some financial package,” said Nilesh Shukla, president of India SME forum, Gujarat chapter.

233,['23/03/2020'],"Thanks to RISE, it’s no more a stigma. Period.","NGO RISE has undertaken initiatives to address sanitation issues for underprivileged girls and women

Nagpur: It was the idea of making people ‘period-friendly’ that changed the lives of thousands of young girls.

While working in different social avenues including education and welfare of orphaned kids, inmates of old-aged homes and the underprivileged, city-based NGO RISE (Rising Infinitely For Social Empowerment) came upon the fact that nearly 40-50% girls including daughters of commercial sex workers and those residing in slums were using pieces of cloth instead of sanitary pads during menstruation.

This was around one-and-a-half-years ago. Since then, the organization has installed over 75 vending machines and incinerators at Zilla Parishad schools , orphanages, hostels, slums and offices under its ‘My Health’ project. “We were the first ones in the state to initiate the movement of eliminating the stigma around periods by addressing the unaddressed sanitation issues,” says founder-president of the NGO Gargi Vairagare.

While the NGO would install sanitary pad vending machines to ensure cheap and fast access to pads for every girl, it soon realized that a major problem was disposal of sanitary waste. “To ensure scientific and safe disposal, we started setting-up incinerators,” says Vishal Joshi, outreach resource at the organization.

All the installations done by the group are followed by a session on menstrual hygiene by a panel of dedicated experts. Says Dr Jagdish Deshmukh, a doctor on panel, “We have our team of gynaecologist, nutritionist, psychologist and counsellor who inform women about usage of pads, their disposal and menstrual hygiene.”

After installing the machines, the organization also takes care of its maintenance. “Every month, our volunteers refill the sanitary napkins. We make sure the machines are being used effectively,” says Sumeet Jadhav, outreach resource.

RISE is at present working in districts of Nagpur, Wardha and Amravati. “Menstruation continues to be a taboo in our country. From making women talk about their periods and intimate hygiene issues, to making them switch to pads instead of cloth in many regions and further ensuring proper waste disposal was a challenging journey. But we have been successful in creating an impact for more than 10,000 girls and women,” says counsellor Roopa Kumar.

Apart from this, the NGO has been working on other significant projects too. Under its ‘Annapoorna’ project, the group has been ensuring nutritional diet for thousands of underprivileged including kids. We consult dieticians and doctors before providing the food. Our typical Annapoorna basket contains foodgrains, pulses, glucose biscuits, dates, fruits etc,” says outreach volunteer Prathamesh.

Another impactful project has been the ‘My Mains’ under which the group enables the underprivileged to raise their standard of living. “We do this by providing essentials required for day-to-day living. The kit includes shampoo, bathing soaps, washing soaps, toothpaste, toothbrush, hair oil, sanitary pads, undergarments etc. We first identify the people in need of these and then cater to them,” says Vairagare.

RISE, which is now aiming to expand its work across the country, was born in the city out of empathy. “I was at a restaurant in Bajaj Nagar when a young girl approached me. Showing her injuries, the girl said she had escaped from an orphanage and pleaded to be taken home. Not knowing what to do, I took her to the nearby police station and reported the matter. A few days later when I went to check on her, I couldn’t find her,” says Vairagare, for whom this incident became the initiation point of RISE.

BENGALURU: Six more persons tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday in Karnataka, the highest ever on a single day, taking the total number of those declared infected in the state to 26. Three of the positive cases were from Bengaluru, while Chikkaballapura, Dharwad and Uttara Kannada districts reported one each.

The two in Dharwad and Uttara Kannada were the first positive cases in the district. In Dharwad, a 35-year-old man who had travelled to Dubai via Goa on March 11 tested positive, while a 64-year-old woman from Gauribidanur in Chikkaballapura district, who had travelled to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, was declared infected. On Saturday, her 31-year-old son, who had travelled with her to Mecca, had tested positive. Both are now being treated at a Bengaluru hospital.

The three Bengaluru positive patients were a 27-year-old man who returned from Germany on March 14, a 51-year-old man who came from London on March 13 and a 36-year-old woman, who had travelled from Switzerland on March 9.

A 22-year-old Bhatkal resident who arrived from Dubai on March 19 became Uttara Kananda district’s first Covid-19 patient. He was admitted to Wenlock Hospital in Mangaluru.

In all, 38 people were admitted at isolation facilities across the state on Sunday, including a dozen in Bengaluru. As on Sunday, 135 persons were in isolation facilities, while 28 suspected patients were discharged.

On Saturday, 1,406 international passengers from 11 flights were screened on landing at Kempegowda International Airport. Five of them were isolated and the rest were quarantined.

The government set up 50 home quarantine enforcement teams, each with an ambulance and comprising one Ayush doctor and a policeman with a wireless set. These teams will track people who are not following self-quarantine guidelines issued by the department. The teams will be alerted by Dial 100 or 104 helplines which get calls of home-quarantine people roaming around. The teams will take such individuals to the nearest police station and register a complaint before taking them to a mass quarantine centre.

The government said it will seek permission from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and The National Institute of Virology (NIV) to allow government and private hospitals to test for Covid-19. Presently Karnataka has five testing laboratories.

New testing guidelines

The Directorate of Health and Family Welfare Services ordered all health workers complaining of fever, cough and difficulty in breathing to undergo testing.

The directorate’s new guidelines mandated all persons showing symptoms within 14 days of international travel, all symptomatic contacts of confirmed cases and all severe acute respiratory illness patients where other causes are ruled out to be tested.

Asymptomatic persons who have come in contact with a confirmed case should be tested once between day five and day 14 of coming in contact with the confirmed case. Direct and high-risk contact include those who live in the same household with a confirmed case and health workers who examined a confirmed case without adequate protection as per WHO recommendations.

HYDERABAD: With exports to US, UK, China, and other eastern countries affected due to Covid-19, the seafood industry fears piling up of stocks.

“Around 25% of shrimp exports are to China and there is a significant fall in demand. This has already led to oversupply of shrimp in the Indian market,” a senior official from Seafood Exporters Association of India told TOI. “One of the major reasons for this is also because Chinese markets were not able to sell their inventory during the holidays and so they are not accepting new orders,” he added.

Seafood exporters in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have informed that soorai (tuna), seerfish, kerai (yellow tuna), mayil (sailfish), cuttlefish, sardines, shrimp, silver, freshwater prawns, white leg shrimp, Tilapia, and black pomphret have seen a dipping demand in European markets which account for almost 20% of Indian exports.

“Most of the seafood consuming countries in the middle east and Europe like Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal, and France have stopped imports and we are asked to stop sending shipments till the situation gets better,” an official from Usha Seafood in Kakinada told TOI.

NAINITAL:

In the video, which has been purportedly recorded at the Taj Chauraha in Haldwani on Sunday morning, some policemen can be seen ordering the three unidentified (two of them were wearing masks) to do sit-ups. The policemen later sent the youths home.

Speaking to TOI, an eyewitness said that the youths had violated the curfew by coming out in the market.

“While most of the markets remained closed, the three boys were roaming on the road. This is when the policemen ordered them to do some sit-ups and then asked them to go home,” the eyewitness said on condition of anonymity.

When asked about the video, Nainital senior superintendent of police (SSP) Sunil Kumar Meena said that though he has seen the video, police are yet not certain when and where it was shot. “It was a voluntary curfew and no forceful shutdown or compliance was ordered. Therefore, we are looking into the video to ascertain its veracity,” he said.

Meanwhile, in another video, some policemen can be seen seizing a scooter and stopping a biker for violating voluntary curfew. Defending the second video, the SSP said that the policemen had taken into custody the vehicle parked on the road and no challan has been issued to the man riding the bike as well. “As we have said, the curfew was not mandatory. Therefore, while most of the people chose to stay in their homes, some did come out. No fine has been issued to them either,” he said.

A team of police, district administration and health department officials visited the resort on Saturday evening and asked the staff not to leave the resort until they have tested negative for novel coronavirus.

Speaking with TOI, Ramnagar SHO Ravi Saini said that police have also informed their Delhi counterpart that Dumpy’s son, Azaan, has left Uttarakhand and is now in Delhi. “We along with officials from the administration and medical professionals had visited the resort on Saturday. The staff at the resort has been asked not to leave the premise nor is anyone from outside allowed to enter the resort till we are certain that no one is infected there,” Saini said.

Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor had arrived in Lucknow on March 11. Even though she had returned from London a few days back, she did not quarantine herself and went on with her social engagements. She was also present at a party that was attended by many, including former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje. Azaan had also attended this party and then came back to Ramnagar.

Saini, meanwhile, added that the health department is yet to come up with the report of the staff. However, in the meantime, if Azaan tests negative, the staff will be allowed to leave the quarantine. “We have been informed that Azaan came from Lucknow and stayed in the resort for a night. He is suspected to have interacted others. Therefore, it was necessary that the entire staff should be screened,” Saini said.

254,['23/03/2020'],"CMO wants Kanika FIR rectified, admits ‘errors’","Kanika Kapoor

Lucknow: Admitting lapses in the fact-finding on the basis of which FIR was lodged against Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor, the chief medical officer (CMO), Lucknow, Dr Narendra Agarwal, on Saturday wrote to the district magistrate and commissioner of police, requesting them to make ‘corrections’ in it.

The complaint filed by the CMO at Sarojininagar police station on Friday night had stated that Kanika had tested positive on her arrival at Amausi airport on ‘March 14’ and was asked to isolate herself for 14 days, but she continued socialising, which amounts to disobeying government order.

In his letter on Saturday night, the CMO clarified that Kanika had been advised 14-day self-isolation as per government guidelines when she landed at Mumbai airport from UK, and not at Amausi.

Kanika came to Lucknow on March 11 and kept moving around, meeting people, visiting places and attending parties. She also stayed in a five star hotel for two days during this period, the CMO says in the letter while requesting the administration to make corrections and take required legal action against the singer.

The complaint on the basis of which the FIR was lodged had several inaccuracies. It said Kanika had tested positive at Amausi airport, but the fact is that there is no Covid-19 confirmatory test which can be done at the airport. Only thermal screening is being done at airports, which only detects body temperature.

In Kanika’s case, she came to Amausi on a domestic flight while thermal scanning was being done only for international arrivals. Further, she arrived in Lucknow on March 11, but the complaint said she came on March 14 while her address was mentioned as ‘unknown’.

To a query, CMO said it was ‘clerical mistake’ and refused to comment further.

Three high-level meetings were held during the day to thrash out the details.

Yediyurappa, however, did not refer to his government’s earlier decision to convert an unused BBMP hospital on Broadway Road, Shivajinagar, into a dedicated Covid-19 facility. However, the Broadway Hospital has to set up from scratch and that too will take time.

Yediyurappa said the dedicated facility at Victoria Hospital and all its annexes will have 1,700 beds. The chief minister said the government is set to extend support to shift all in-patients who are presently undergoing treatment to other facilities. But doctors and medical education department officials, under whose jurisdiction the hospital falls, said that they will not shift patients who are critical and will continue to treat them, but they will not admit fresh patients.

However, Victoria Hospital is the nerve-centre of public healthcare in Karnataka. The campus also houses a trauma care centre, PMSSY superspecialty hospital, Institute of Nephro Urology, Minto Eye Hospital and Vani Vilas Hospital dedicated to maternity and pediatric issues. The hospital’s 50-bed burns ward is one of its kind in the state getting up to a dozen patients every day.

Jawaid Akhtar, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare department, told TOI a plan has been drawn up to establish exclusive hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients and they will be rolled out. “A detailed action plan for Victoria Hospital is being prepared and will reveal it in one or two days,” Akhtar said.

Dr PG Girish, director of medical education and special officer, PMSSY hospital, said, “Victoria Hospital henceforth will admit only emergency patients who are in need of critical care. Other patients will be diverted to other hospitals where facilities are available. The intensive care unit and burns ward will continue operations as usual.”

He said that for a week now they have been reducing the number of intakes at Victoria Hospital by diverting patients to other facilities.

“In some cases, if required, we have also considered shifting patients to private hospitals for treatment. The government will pay for the treatment,” said deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan.

Amid coronavirus outbreak, the churches had announced that they would not be having the usual Sunday service.

The Makasare family in Chikalthana, who regularly go to church in the morning, were disappointed. According to 65-year-old Prakash Makasare, the grandfather of the family, this is the first instance in his lifetime that all the churches are closed.

“Sunday service and fellowship is very special to us and we never miss it,” he said.

However, his disappointment went away after his grandchildren told him that their church will be streaming the service live on Facebook. The family joined in and heard the sermon live.

The district and civic administration had earlier given orders to cancel any gatherings until March 31, as a preventive step as India entered the third phase of the Covid-19 outbreak.

Chandrakant Mhaske, a pastor at Satara Nazarene church, shared a message from the book of Isaiah during the live streaming.

“Just like the times of the Bible, it is needed that we stay indoors and look to God. This is the time to introspect and strengthen your relationship with Jesus,” he said.

Prabhakar Mhaske’s family in Cidco N-6 observed the janata curfew but tuned in to the live Sunday mass on Youtube.

Sharad Timothy, a pastor at World Mission church, appealed to his congregation to co-operate with the government in containing the spread. He encouraged people to live right so that their prayers can be heard and the land can be healed.

264,['23/03/2020'],"Goa: Away from churches, Christians keep the faith with online Mass","PANAJI: In an unprecedented scenario, lakhs of Christians across the state stayed away from Sunday Mass services as churches remain closed in view of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s call for a nationwide curfew.There are 172 parishes in the state.Devotees who would otherwise never miss the obligatory Sunday Mass, heeded the government and the archdiocese of Goa and Daman to help stop community transmission of coronavirus The experience of using technology to participate in and celebrate Sunday Mass was a novel one for both, the faithful and the clergy, who used everything from television, YouTube, Facebook and WhatsApp.However, nothing could stop some determined senior citizens habituated to heading to church for their dose of spiritual nourishment.Maria Vas from Margao managed to work her way around the Janata Curfew . She followed her two-decade-old daily routine of waking up at 5am and proceeded to church in her Sunday attire. “There were only three of us in church. I said my rosary and prayers and left the church at the same time I always do. I made sure I didn’t touch or kiss the statues and reached home before 7am,” she told TOI.In Corlim, Maria D’Cruz’ daughter said she had to play ‘hawaldar’ and wake up at 5.30am to stop her mother from heading to church. “I’ve never seen such a day in my lifetime. I asked God for forgiveness and prayed for better days to come. These are testing times for us and I understand that we have to each contribute in our own little way,” D’Cruz said.Devotees watched the Mass on their TVs, laptops and phones as some churches livestreamed services. Others recorded and then uploaded them on Facebook and shared links on WhatsApp.The Monteiros in Loutolim not only watched the Mass on a laptop but participated in it as a family. “We gave our responses, stood up when we had to, in deep reverence, as we do in church. But not being able to receive Holy Communion left a great hollow,” Noemy Monteiro told TOI.Aldona resident Robert D’Costa accepted it as “God’s plan”. Instead of three Masses, CCR TV aired three masses in Konkani, English and Marathi with repeats. Its YouTube channel, that records between 20 and 70 new subscribers each day, saw a surge of 700 new subscribers on Saturday.Many other faithful preferred watching the Masses livestreamed by their own churches as they said it made the experience “more personal”.Youth in churches helped parish priests record and even livestream their services. “I took out my DSLR camera and the youth used Google and figured how to go about it,” parish priest of St Francis Xavier Church in Chicalim, Fr Bolmax Pereira, told TOI.During his Sunday sermon, Pereira urged the faithful to observe a “forwarding curfew” by not sending out any fake and negative messages that create more problems. “Unless these are messages related to essential services, we discouraged the laity from forwarding them,” Pereira said.At the Mother Church of the archdiocese, Se Cathedral, the youth also helped the priests record and then upload a video of the Mass online. Celebrating Mass in an empty church was not a pleasant experience, parish priest Fr Alfred Vaz told TOI. “I felt disconnected from my people,” he said.Last week, archbishop of Goa and Daman, Filipe Neri Ferrao, dispensed with the obligation of Sunday Mass for all the faithful and urged priests not to celebrate Mass with a congregation to observe the 14-hour Janata Curfew. He urged them to instead use modern means of communication to reach the Mass to their faithful.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74771033,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-783499,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/away-from-churches-christians-keep-the-faith-with-online-mass/articleshow/74765332.cms

These include manufacturing units in Naroda GIDC, textile process houses in Narol, garment manufacturers and dyestuff manufacturers across the state.

“Some 1,300 units in Naroda GIDC will remain closed till March 25 and we have informed the staffers that this may be extended. These include units manufacturing dyes, chemicals, intermediates and other products. We have also assured all the workers that their salary will not be deducted,” said Shailesh Patwari, past president, Naroda Industries Association.

A similar decision was taken by Gujarat Dyestuff Manufacturers’ Association (GDMA) which announced on Saturday itself that the units will be shut for three days. “Some 1,000 dyestuff manufacturing units across the state will remain closed till March 25. The decision has been taken in the interest of public health and safety,” said Yogesh Parikh, president, GDMA. Industry estimates suggest that the shutdown will amount to losses worth Rs 25,000 crore per day for the dyestuff manufacturers.

Gujarat Garment Manufacturers’ Association (GGMA) too announced a shutdown of their units. “We had already announced three days of shutdown for all garment manufacturing units from Saturday to Monday. Now that the government has announced a shutdown till March 25, we will obviously comply and have informed our workers accordingly,” said Arpan Shah, honorary treasurer, GGMA.

Ahmedabad Textile Processors’ Association (ATPA) members too said they will shut manufacturing units till March 25 and take a call on whether to continue with shutdown, based on the situation.

266,['23/03/2020'],Trichy: 24-hour drinking water supply scheme in pipeline,"Representative image

TRICHY: Round-the-clock drinking water supply has been one of the ever increasing demands of the city residents ever since the civic body was upgraded into a municipal corporation in 1994. To meet it, the civic body under the smart cities mission has proposed a 24-hour drinking water supply scheme in the 7 sq.km area around Rockfort . The civic body has also plans to expand this facility to other parts of the city. Smart water meters will be affixed to water connections for calculating water charge.

Since the city do not have quality groundwater to meet the demand of people at many places, a demand to ensure 24-hour drinking water supply was mooted in the late 1990s. However, the expensive project was delayed. Meanwhile, utilising Rs 106.62 crore from smart cities mission fund, Trichy City Corporation has proposed to implement a 24-hour water supply scheme for the area based development (ABD) zone (7 sq.m around Rockfort). The civic body officials had inspected working models in Manila, Philippines for the purpose. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition ( SCADA ) enabled system, an automated mechanism, will ensure equal pressure and water flow in the selected areas. The project will be implemented in two phases; one phase for drilling new water sources on the Cauvery River bed and for laying new pipelines.

Automatic water meter reading (AMR) meters will be fixed in the piped water connections. At the end of the billing cycle, AMR will send text messages to the user and the civic body about the quantity of water consumed. Residents will have to pay water charge based on consumption. “Round-the-clock water supply will prevent people from relying on private players,” V B Jaganath, a resident of Karumandapam , said. Charge based on consumption will also plug revenue loss. “Metered water supply will make people use water judiciously. Fund sources will be ascertained to implement the project in the entire city,” a senior corporation official said.

Dehradun/Nainital/Almora/Roorkee: The Janata Curfew call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi received widespread support across the state.

In Dehradun, city roads wore a deserted look on Sunday and the shops remained shut. On the day, Dehradun residents took to various indoor activities like reading books, gardening, cooking, and others. The WhatsApp groups of different RWAs were flooded with updates from residents posting pictures of what they were doing.

Along with the police, social organisations also kept themselves on alert to provide any possible help to the senior citizens. “We received calls from different parts of the city from senior citizens who wanted to ensure if we would send them a vehicle in case of any heath emergency. We also provided hand sanitisers to some people and resolved queries of many senior citizens living alone in the city,” said Vimal Kumar from Apna Aasra, an NGO.

In Nainital, almost all roads and major locations remained deserted and people chose to stay inside. Markets like Tallital, Bara Bazaar and shops on Mall Road remained shut the entire day. Speaking to TOI, traders said that this was a necessary step to combat the Covid-19 threat.

“We chose to shut our shops today (March 22) as we understand how grave the situation is. Social distancing is extremely necessary,” said Raees Ahmed, owner of a restaurant on Nainital’s Mall Road.

Janata Curfew also received overwhelming support from almost all the areas across the Kumaon region. Even the most crowded markets of towns like Haldwani, Kichha, Rudrapur, Kashipur, Almora, and Bageshwar remained shut. Kaushal Singh, a Haldwani local, said that though some people did go out for essential things, but most of the people obeyed the curfew.

The police and administration officials also said that the they did not use any restraint and people voluntarily chose to stay inside their homes. “Police personnel were present at almost all the locations. People cooperated with police and we reciprocated,” said Nainital SSP Sushil Kumar Meena.

Residents of Almora town also followed PM Modi’s call for Janata Curfew. The streets wore a deserted look and hardly a few people were seen in the markets that otherwise remain abuzz throughout the day. Only those involved in providing people with essential services moved out of their homes for work on the day.

As requested by PM Modi, people came out on their balconies (or in courtyards) at 5 pm and banged utensils and applauded all those who are working to help people in times of coronavirus outbreak.

In Roorkee too, movement of people was almost negligible. Commercial establishments in Roorkee and nearby rural towns like Manglaur, Narsan, Jhabreda and Laksar remained completely closed on Sunday. Meanwhile, the sanitation workers utilised the Janata Curfew to sanitise the city. Roorkee’s additional sub- divisional magistrate Gopal Singh Chauhan told TOI that no untoward incident was reported on the day.

275,['23/03/2020'],UP invites online applications to set up sanitiser production units,"in safe hands

Lucknow: In view of growing demand for hand sanitizers as a preventive measure against Covid-19 infection, the state government, in a major policy shift , has invited people to apply for its manufacturing and get online permission immediately.

Speaking to TOI, principal secretary excise and sugar, Sanjay Bhoosreddy said that expecting a likely shortage of hand senitizers, it has been decided that the sugar millers and distilleries apart from any other individual fulfilling certain conditions can get online permission for manufacturing sanitizers.

He said that the big companies which had been manufacturing hand sanitizers felt shortage of raw material suddenly, so the sugar millers and the distillers which have alcohol with them in abundance can provide raw material to sanitizer manufactures and if they want to set up their own brands to sell in retail, they can also go for it.

In another step, the state government has allowed sanitizer manufacturing companies to procure ethyl alcohol more than the stipulated capacity for production of sanitizer in adequate quantity.

In a communiqué sent all district excise officials, excise commissioner P Guru Prasad has said that ethyl alcohol is available in adequate quantity to Indian Sugar Mills association and All India Distilleries Association. The sanitizers are otherwise manufactured from Iso-propyl alcohol which is not available in required amount and therefore manufacture of sanitizer from denatured alcohol is required, the letter, dated March 20, said. Prasad said that the sanitizer manufacturing units be provided ethyl alcohol through passbook facility.

The department has also directed that permission be granted to distilleries interested in bulk production of sanitizers. Directions have also been issued for manufacture of sanitizer in three shifts for which facilities be provided to the units.

Meanwhile, UP medicine manufacturing association sent a letter to UP chief minister seeking his intervention in expediting the production of hand sanitizer in the state. President of the association, Prashant Bhatia said that the World Health Organization has found ethyl alcohol based sanitizer appropriate to tackle the menace of Corona Virus. He said that the state has adequate quantity of ethyl alcohol but it is subjected to decision by the excise department.

“This is causing hindrance in supply of ethyl alcohol to the sanitizer manufacturing units,” he said. Bhatia said that while ethyl alcohol is available at a price of Rs 41 to Rs 50 per litre, the iso-propyl alcohol is subjected to black marketing and is available at Rs 360- per litre.

TRICHY: ‘Janta curfew’ was successful in Trichy city with people preferring to stay indoors on Sunday. All the commercial outlets, except fuel stations and pharmacies, remain closed. Later in the evening, residents in groups gathered outside their houses to clap and thank the various professionals who are fighting Covid-19 outbreak.

The Central bus stand wore a deserted look as buses were moved to five TNSTC depots in the city. With the state government extending the deadline of the curfew, TNSTC officials said that bus services may resume on Monday morning based on the directives from the authorities. The major hubs of commercial activities such as Big Bazaar Street, NSB Road and Main Guard Gate were completely free from public movement. Youths played cricket on the deserted road.

Though the curfew started at 7 am, a few meat stalls did business for a few hours as there were customers.

However, the shops were closed after the curfew kicked in. “Around 60,000 shops in the city and 30,000 shops in Trichy district remained closed. All the traders extended their cooperation to the call of the governments in combating the virus outbreak,” said Ve Govindarajalu, state general secretary, Tamil Nadu Traders’ Federation. Traders said that they await further instructions from the government regarding the reopening of shops as the curfew was extended till Monday morning.

Despite the curfew, weddings that were scheduled earlier were held in various parts of the city. Wedding organisers said that they have hosted the event with a minimum number of people by providing hand sanitiser for everyone entering the halls. Around 90 halls were booked in the district on Sunday.

Around 5 am, people gathered near their houses to clap and cheer the medical professionals, paramedic staff, local body workers and law-enforcement agencies in fighting Covid-19.

“Medical professionals and other warriors including police are fighting an invisible and unpredictable enemy, we are grateful to them,” said Dr V Badrinath , a resident of KVM Subha Mangala apartments, Srirangam.

280,['23/03/2020'],500 Nepalese workers stranded in Mathura amid janata curfew,"Agra: More than 500 Nepalese workers were left stranded in Mathura on Sunday as no public transport was in operation in view of the ‘janata’ curfew across the country to combat spread of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak.

The stranded workers, who were mainly working in Mumbai, were on their way home due to the “uncertainty over total lockdown”.

One of the workers, Padam Singh, said that most of them work in Mumbai, Pune and other cities, but with the uncertain situation, they have decided to return home and be with their families. “There are direct buses to Gauriphanta from Mathura. So, we all came here and are hopeful that we will get a bus after 9 pm,” Singh said.

According to official at local administration, the medical examination of these workers is being done to check for Covid-19-like symptoms. A few shops at bus stand have been allowed to remain open during the ‘janata’ curfew to cater to such people.

Meanwhile, the temple town of Mathura witnessed a total shut down on Sunday with all temples, including Banke Bihari and Sri Krishna Janamsthan, shutting their doors for general public.

While Chandroday temple, Priyakant temple and Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan have been closed till March 31, Daan Ghati temple and Govardhan temple have been shut for public till Monday. The situation would be reviewed by the temple managements and the administration before opening them for public, the officials said.

Banke Bihari temple manager Munish Sharma said, “On the orders of civil judge, junior division, Mathura, the temple has been closed till March 31 for public.” He added paying of obeisance to the principal deity would continue as usual within the temple. The 22-kilometre Parikrama of Govardhan has also been suspended.

281,['23/03/2020'],When bird songs replaced street din,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Waking up to birds chirping near your window is something that few witness in the capital as these cheerful sounds are drowned by the incessant noise of cars, motorcycles and trucks from 7am onward. However, the janata curfew changed all that on Sunday.

With no one venturing out, the streets were taken over by strays, who usually get to frolic in free space only at night. Apart from dogs, monkeys were spotted on the roads near central and northern ridge. The situation only changed around 5pm when birds and stray dogs started scurrying for cover, perhaps taken aback by the sudden din occurring around them.

Experts said a reduction in noise pollution, apart from a visible lack of human presence, helped animals and birds venture out freely, who otherwise have adapted to a more dormant approach during the day.

Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist in-charge at Yamuna Biodiversity Park , said, “Once the noise level goes above 20 decibels, it becomes stressful for birds and they tend to become quieter. With little or no noise around, birds have been chirping all day long, mirroring what they do early in the morning. We’re getting a lot of reports of parakeets and barbets being particularly loud on Sunday.”

Referring to stray dogs and monkeys found roaming on the streets freely, Khudsar said human habitation plays a key role in the behaviour of animals and how they interact with their urban surroundings. “Over time, these animals have become accustomed to human presence around them. They are intelligent species that focus on survival. If there is no threat or human presence around them, it is natural they will venture out,” he added.

M Shah Hussain, scientist in-charge at Aravalli Biodiversity Park, too, felt the lack of disturbance aided in bringing out more wildlife to the urban setting. He added, “Birds and stray animals like dogs and monkeys have adapted to living near human settlements. But with little to no interference, they become more undeterred and roam around freely. This was what was observed on Sunday.”

Zoologist and birder Dr Surya Prakash said the situation changed at 5pm, with flocks of birds fleeing from his colony. “We recorded a number of birds, simply through their sounds, but the din created at 5pm disturbed them. It is just a small indicator of how noise can impact birds,” he added.

TRICHY: Delta districts came to a standstill with deserted roads and vacant bus stands as people observed Janta Curfew on Sunday. Despite the curfew, several weddings took place in the districts, particularly in Kumbakonam in Thanjavur and Mannargudi in Tiruvarur districts.

Following the call for Janata Curfew by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, people in delta districts like Thanjavur, Thiruvarur and Nagapattinam stayed at their houses since 7 am in the morning on Sunday.

All the shops, markets, commercial establishments, churches, temples mosques and cinema halls remained closed. Trains, buses, auto and taxi services were also completely stopped.

However, most of the marriage halls were seen busy as weddings as planned earlier were solemnized, with very few relatives attending the ceremonies. Being a 'Muhurtham day' (an auspicious day for marriage) more than 25 marriages were solemnized including 13 marriages in Mannargudi town itself in Tiruvarur district on Sunday.

Being a temple town, more number of weddings took place in Thanjavur district , particularly in Kumbakonam. However, all the relatives including bride and bridegrooms were allowed to the marriage halls only after thermal screening. Almost all the weddings witnessed low attendance of guests. The weddings were conducted in short and simple way.

Thousands of fishermen from the coastal hamlets in Nagapattinam district remained at their houses skipping fishing activities. Velankanni Basilica and Nagore Dargah also remained closed.

286,['23/03/2020'],Hundreds defy ‘janata curfew’ in Aligarh &amp; Moradabad to protest against CAA,"Agra/Bareilly: While their cities wore a deserted look, women in UP’s Aligarh and Moradabad defied the self-imposed curfew and gathered in hundreds to protest against CAA, notwithstanding appeals given against it by religious leaders, police and administration. In Moradabad, police have decided to book the protesters who had gathered at Eidgah on Sunday.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given a call for ‘janata curfew’ on Sunday to curb the spread of now novel coronavirus-- a highly-contagious disease. Even in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh-- which inspired similar sit-ins across UP and other parts of the country-- the protest became symbolic and the size was cut to just five.

In Deoband, the home to one of the largest Islamic seminaries of the world, the anti-CAA protest was called off. Several religious and political leaders of the community have asked people not gather for any protest. Moradabad MP Dr ST Hasan had also asked people of his city to stay indoors.

But, not heeding to the appeals, the protesters, mostly women, came out and staged a sit-in at Moradabad’s Eidgah, putting local police and the health department in a fix, which is already facing a tough time after surfacing of positive case of coronavirus in the city.

“Around 500 protesters reached Eidgah ground and started a sit-in protest there. Their act may fuel the epidemic. We are going to book them under IPC section 188 (disobedience of order duly promulgated by a public servant) and other relevant sections for posing threat to others’ lives,” said Amit Kumar Anand, additional superintendent of police (city).

One of the organisers at the sit-in site, Waqi Rashid, said, “Coronavirus cannot be controlled by a one-day curfew.”

While in Aligarh, over 500 women protesters continued with their sit-in against the Citizenship (amendment) Act (CAA). The protest against CAA is going on at Aligarh’s Shah Jamal Idgah ground since January 29.

The district administration had served a notice to the organiser two days ago asking them to vacate the place for 10 days amid coronavirus fears or “face legal action”. However, neither the protesters nor the organizers have paid heed to it.

Talking to TOI, Aligarh district magistrate (DM) CB Singh said, “Action will be taken against them.”

However, remaining parts of Aligarh, including Muslim-dominated areas of Jeevangarh, Jamalpur and Upper Kot, followed the appeal of PM Modi and stayed at home.

The administration has, meanwhile, decided to screen people coming from Delhi, Noida, Agra and Mathura.

‘Munadi’ (announcement) was also made by the municipal corporation officials urging people to stay indoors to combat spread of Covid-19. Confirming this, municipal corporation sanitary enforcement inspector Bishan Singh, said, “Munadi was organised in seven zones on Sunday to make people aware about the disease.”

NEW DELHI: The number of patients in Delhi’s hospitals with Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, touched 30 on Sunday with three more confirmed cases. Two new cases in Noida and two more in Gurugram the same day pushed the number of patients with the same disease in both neighbouring cities to 8 each.

Two of those who tested positive in the capital have travel history to nations affected by the pandemic while one is a contact of a 38-year-old woman who had tested positive on March 17, after returning from Saudi Arabia a week before that. Health officials said she is a resident of Dilshad Garden, and not Shahdara, as reported earlier.

A woman and her son, residents of Sector 2 in Greater Noida, tested positive. Though the son (37) returned from Denmark on March 9, it was his 62-year-old mother who first reported symptoms. Both were tested and quarantined on March 19 and are now admitted to Government Institute of Medical Sciences. Three other family members are in isolation at home.

A team of 150 personnel from the health department and local administration carried out a sanitisation exercise in Sector Alpha 1 of Greater Noida where a 30-year-old man had tested positive late on Saturday. The sector has been sealed till 7am on March 24.

“We are alert for the purpose of protecting and containing the novel coronavirus from spreading among residents. Keeping this in view, the administration started immediate action after a person was found infected with coronavirus in B block of Alpha 1,” said district magistrate BN Singh.

A similar drive was carried out in the Sector 74 society where a resident had tested positive earlier this week. “Following the detection of one person who tested positive for Covid-19, we have put 23 families under home quarantine and their homes have been marked with a poster,” said the DM who urged residents to cooperate with the health department team that went door-to-door to initiate home isolation and quarantine measures even as the police personnel ensured no movement to and from the sector. This will also continue till March 24.

In Gurugram , a 35-year-old doctor at the Sector 10 government hospital has tested positive. She is a resident of Sector 9A. Test reports of a 22-year-old man who had returned from London and is admitted at a hospital also confirmed Covid-19.

A total of 17 samples were collected in the city on Sunday for testing. The numbers of positive cases are likely to rise in the coming days, health department officials said. So far, 4,455 people have been screened for Covid-19 in Gurugram .

“The 22-year-old man is from Palam Vihar. The patient had travelled to London in January and returned recently. We have collected samples from the area,” said JS Puniya, chief medical officer, Gurugram . The health department said an MCG team was conducting active surveillance and sanitisation of the Palam Vihar area.

In Ghaziabad, the doctor screening coronavirus patients at the nodal MMG Hospital is down with fever, cold and cough. His samples have been collected and sent for examination. The doctor has been asked to quarantine himself at home till the reports come.

This was the crux of a heartfelt post by one of the first Covid-19 positive patients from Ahmedabad posted on a social media platform on Sunday. The woman with travel history to Finland is currently under treatment at an AMC-run hospital.

She stated in her post that travel to Finland was a gift to herself as she wanted to see the northern lights. She knew about the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan since January 15 but ‘I thought it’s too far from me... I’ll take necessary precautions,’ she wrote.

She flew to Finland in the beginning of March and took multiple domestic and international flights. ‘I wore an N99 mask, sanitized my hands a 100 times, washed my hands for 30 seconds as many times as I could, put the air vents on in my seat, sanitized my tray table and armrests,’ she wrote, adding that one cannot but use hands to touch masks due to security checks, passport controls, eating and drinking. But still there were only 10 cases in Finland at the time. And she thought the chances of her contracting the disease were close to non-existent.

When she returned, Covid-19 was already a pandemic but India still had few cases. She took the precaution of maintaining safe distance from families and other family members to the extent of isolating herself, washing her utensils and clothes with disinfectant and hot water. But on March 14, she got the first signs in the form of a slight fever. The general practitioner she saw advised her antibiotics. But as it persisted, she was tested and was found to have mild upper respiratory infection. On March 16, she visited a doctor friend at SVP where her samples for Covid-19 were taken and turned out to be positive. ‘As long as the numbers are few, this can be managed to a large extent,’ she wrote, adding that she’s worried about her parents even as they are fine currently.

‘Please take care guys whether you are sick or not sick, it’s not worth the risk. However, if you do think you’ve got it, please do not panic’ she wrote.

TRICHY: Fishermen rescued a four-year-old male spotted deer that was struggling to stay afloat in sea off the Manamelkudi coast in Pudukkottai district on Sunday.

Fishermen from Krishnajipattinam village spotted the deer in the morning and ventured into the sea in their boats. They brought the deer ashore and informed the forest department.

Pudukkottai district forest officer (DFO) M Anand Kumar said that the deer, that was in a good condition, was released in the wild in the Aranthangi reserve forest. He said there are no spotted deer in Aranthangi forest but there have been instances when spotted deer were seen here along the coast.

The DFO added the deer could have come from Point Calimere Wildlife Sanctuary in Nagapattinnam district as they can travel miles during summer in search of food and water. Usually deer won’t venture in the sea. “But this one could have been chased by stray dogs forcing it enter the sea,” he said.

While Delhi Metro Rail Corporation had earlier announced that its train services would be completely closed, other modes of transport were soon added to the list. All autorickshaw and taxi unions announced that they would not operate their vehicles in support of the call given by the PM.Sarvodaya Drivers’ Association of Delhi, which represents drivers of app-based cabs, said that they would stay off the roads. Aggregators Ola and Uber said that while they had requested riders to stay at home, a nominal number of cabs were available to meet urgent and essential travel needs of commuters.The only form of public transport visible on the roads were buses of Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and cluster scheme operated by Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System. Delhi government had decided that 50% of buses would run on Sunday. “While around 80% of the fleet of both DTC and cluster scheme are deployed usually, this Sunday only 50% were on the roads,” a Delhi government official said.There were just a few autorickshaws and cabs occasionally seen on the roads. Though the frequency of buses was more regular, not more five passengers could be seen in them. In fact, the only people seen were those waiting for public transport at bus queue shelters.While Indian Railways suspended all train operations around noon, people could be seen at all major railway stations. The roads outside were, however, deserted.The Interstate Bus Terminals at Kashmere Gate, Anand Vihar and Sarai Kale Khan wore a forlorn look because of lack of commuters as well as buses. “These three ISBTs together register a footfall of more than three lakh every day.

The bustling roads wore a deserted look as people remained indoors to avoid spread of the novel coronavirus. The silence was almost deafening.

No shops, except pharmacies, were open. All public transport, including auto-rickshaws and e-rickshaws, were off the roads. Bus and railway services remained suspended. The out-patient department (OPD) at SN Medical College and district hospital were closed for the day. Petrol pumps were also shut.

Few civilian vehicles were seen on the roads, save the official vehicles of police, administration and health department in the city.

Meanwhile, rumours on the social media caused panic among people. Health department officials and coronavirus control room received hundreds of distress calls, regarding queries about Covid-19 infection. Meanwhile surveillance and rapid response teams were on their toes all day long as they went from one place to another throughout the day to verify the information about “patients” and take necessary action.

In Agra, people voluntarily participated in the Janata Curfew. Those running makeshift shops and street vendors also kept away.

Parks and gardens were deserted despite being a Sunday as people did not venture out or allow children to play outdoors.

In the morning, police used public address system to advise people to stay at home. Those driving private vehicles were stopped and asked to return home. In the evening, some people who came out to buy vegetables found the vendors missing.

Head of the district rapid response team for coronavirus, Dr Anshul Pareekh, said, “I have personally got hundreds of calls regarding suspected Covid-19 infected persons. The chief medical officer, district administration officials and control room also received a large number of calls. We are screening all suspected cases. Rumours on social media are causing a major problem. However, the level of awareness among people have also increased. Those with a recent travel history having flu-like any symptoms voluntarily came to give samples for laboratory testing. Everyone should practice social isolation to prevent the spread of the disease,” he added.

Meanwhile, Agra Municipal Corporation workers on Sunday conducted rigorous fogging in different parts of the city as a precautionary measure in the fight against spreading of coronavirus.

The lockdown in city and other districts does not cover them, as trucks that carry essential goods are still operating and cross the toll.The toll management has called upon the NHAI and the ministry of road transport and highways to provide some relief. Some workers urged authorities to let them put themselves in self-quarantine.“Services were stopped during demonetisation too. The current scenario is much more serious and risks human lives. The ministry must show some sensitivity towards toll plaza workers as we are more exposed and vulnerable to the transmission of the virus,” said a Skylark official, not wishing to be named.While the toll management has provided masks and sanitisers to staff, there is anxiety owing to the fact that the workers have been dealing with thousands of people on a daily basis, many of them heading to or returning from the airport. “Are we not humans or do we not deserve to quarantine ourselves? Until now the city wasn’t locked down so we still consoled ourselves. But now transportation activities will be shut. Relaxing our services for a week or so won’t disrupt anything,” a toll operator said.Many employees claimed that they struggled on Sunday to get to the toll plaza as public transport was largely suspended. They fear, their daily struggles are only going to compound. “From tomorrow, when the borders are sealed, even fewer people would be able to come. Why not allow a complete lockdown for us too?” said another lane operator.A Skylark official said operators and supervisors are vulnerable to infection. “Despite FASTags and cashless transactions, these workers still come in contact with thousands of people. It’s high time the authorities suspended the services, at least till March 31,” the official said. Sources in NHAI, however, said there was no such plan to suspend services at the moment. However, the ministry may come up with a necessary advisory if the need is felt. Officials also claimed that with FASTag being implemented at toll plazas, more than 80% of the transactions have gone digital, with either no or limited human interaction.",gurgaon,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74771197,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-198719,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/suspend-our-services-too-say-wary-kherki-toll-staffers/articleshow/74765174.cms

TIRUVARUR: Nesakaram, a non-governmental organization in Mannargudi in Tiruvarur district has brought textile shops and tailors together to manufacture face masks. The masks will be handed over to hospitals and organisations in town as there is an acute shortage of the same. Initially, the textile shops will provide the required cloth free of cost while tailors will stitch the masks without charging any money.

Cities and towns in the central region have largely run out of masks. A few days ago, contract staff at the government medical college hospital in Tiruvarur had staged a protest demanding safety equipment including the face masks. The initiative by Nesakaram is aimed to help ease the situation by making masks available at hospitals and in medical shops.

“Textile shop owners and tailors in Mannargudi have extended their helping hands to by manufacture face masks at an affordable price. We have decided to produce as many masks as required and hand them over to the government hospitals”, Marutham Goki , one of the organisers of ‘ Nesakkaram ’ said.

The face masks will be sold at a meagre price. Using the money generated from the sale of masks, we have decided to produce more masks to cater to the needs of hospitals and the general public, Goki said.“As many as 1000 masks were produced on Saturday and they will be handed over to the hospital authorities on Monday”, he added.

Lanes lined with party places and in-trend stores were pitch dark. India Gate, which sees a footfall of more than 50,000 every day, had just PCR vans for company.The few faces that popped up on the streets were either of those whose curiosity had got the better of them or people who had to step out for something that couldn’t be avoided or postponed. The only stretches of road where some honking could be heard were, ironically, the no-honking zones outside hospitals. From one of Mumbai’s high-rises, the sight of the empty arc of the Queen’s Necklace was nothing short of surreal.“Marine Drive, Mumbai, this morning... this is what national discipline means... Jai Hind,” tweeted Amitabh Bachchan. “I’ve never seen it (Marine Drive) like this. Let’s remind ourselves that today isn’t the end but the first day in battle...” tweeted Harsh Mariwala, chairman of Marico.A few buses did ply in Mumbai, but passengers were few. At train stations, roving squads were deployed to check identity cards and make sure only those associated with essential services commuted. The two airport terminals, which together have a normal daily staff strength of 45,000, on Sunday functioned with barely 2,000 employees handling everything from facility management to duty-free stores.In Bengaluru, nothing moved till 5pm except police vehicles and ambulances. Several churches made arrangements for digital prayer services on Sabbath day so that the faithful wouldn’t have to step out. It wasn’t until 5pm that the self-imposed shackles broke, with a section of residents in some localities spilling out in groups during the show of support for those on the front line of the Covid-19 fight.For Kolkata, where bandhs were a way of life not long ago, Sunday’s total shutdown was ostensibly unlike anything the city had experienced before. Twitter user Chandreyi Sharma posted a picture of a barbet hooting away in front of her home with the caption: “He has been singing for the last 3 hours.” According to the pollution control board, the city’s air quality had improved by several notches since Saturday.

Yogi’s statement came on a day the country observed a complete self-lockdown on the appeal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“Hume ye koshish karni hai ki coronavirus se sankramit logon ki sankhya aagey na badey…Iske liye janata curfew ke jaise karyakramo ki liye tayyar rehna hoga (We will have to work to ensure that number of people affected by coronavirus do not increase. We will have to take measures like janata curfew in future),” said Yogi.

In UP, as many as 28 covid-19 cases have been reported and state government authorities have ratcheted up measures, including halting public transport, including Metro rail to curtail potential threat by the virus. Of the total, 10 have recovered and others are stable or recovering fast, the CM said.

Yogi said the appeal for a janata curfew has been given to protect 130 crore people of the country. “I appeal to people to play their role in fighting the virus. The state government has taken adequate steps to serve people in time of crisis,” the CM said. Yogi appealed to people not to get scared of the virus, but launch a fight. “Prevention is better than cure and steps are taken to prevent people from getting affected,” he said. Yogi said, the state government had 2000 isolation beds in the state. “This has been increased to 10,000 in last two days,” he said.

Asking people to maintain social distance, Yogi said, people should abide by suggestions of doctors and cooperate with officers and security agencies. “The government will not allow shortage or hoarding of essential commodities,” he said.

Yogi said, the state government has already taken steps to provide essential commodities to people. The CM warned shopkeepers not to sell utilities for more than the MRP or else the state government would take strict action.

Mangaluru: Following the PM’s call for a ‘ janata curfew ’, Sunday was a complete shutdown in the coastal districts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi – a first in their lifetime, residents recalled, over a non-communal issue. The streets were largely empty, barring the odd car or auto-rickshaw; public transport too was on an essential basis.

Private bus operators had announced earlier that they would not ply on Sunday and only a small trickle of commuters was seen in public buses. Voluntary organisations provided food packets at KSRTC bus stations to passengers who were forced to wait for the bus forward or home.

With few vehicles on the road, the skeletal staff at retail fuel stations had little work. The Karnataka State Federation of Petroleum Dealers had intimated in advance that fuel sales for the day would be restricted to vehicles involved in delivery of essentials and emergency services. Hospitals too attended only to emergency cases.

Residents put the forced confinement to good use – enlisting the entire family for spring cleaning and other chores. Others are finding a bonus of quality time.

While Dr Ananth Pai P, a paediatrician who is usually swamped with weekend patients, attended to emergency cases, his father Ramdas played chess with his grandson Aniruddh Pai, barred as they were from morning and evening walks or outings.

Temples were closed or requested people to stay away as a precautionary measure. Churches remained open only for funeral services, one of them being for the mother of Robert Miranda, the bishop of Kalaburagi diocese.

The gurudwara has for now done away with the bhajan and langar held every Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon. Fr Vijay Victor Lobo, PRO of Mangalore diocese, said funeral mass would be held without the customary procession till the lockdown is in force.

As Sunday mass has been cancelled, Mangalore bishop Peter Paul Saldanha celebrated mass with other priests at Bishop’s House which was live-streamed online.

“The diocese will take a decision on celebration of Holy Week events after consulting with the archdiocese of Bangalore,” he said. Taking the clampdown for social distancing forward, cross-sections of trade – automobile, jewellery and all those dealing with non-essential items – are set to suspend all commercial activity for a staggered number of days starting Sunday.

AHMEDABAD: Deepak Savaliya , 36, of Nikol has lodged a complaint with Krishnanagar police station on Friday that a man named Ankit Limbachiya has stolen his company’s logo and is selling his company’s GST-approved data at Rs 1999 through Facebook . Police have registered a case under relevant sections of IT act against one Ankit Limbachiya operating from Naroda.

According to the FIR, Savaliya works as regional manager of a Noida-based firm India Mart – Intermesh Ltd. The firm is a platform for selling and purchasing goods. Currently, Savaliya is operating and handling about nine states from a rented office in Krishnanagar.

Savaliya has stated in his complaint that about four months ago, his friend Kalaj Sojitra told him that his company’s logo which is used on WhatsApp is being used by someone else on Facebook to sell the company’s data.

“Sojitra sent Savaliya the link. Apart from using the company’s logo, it was specifically written that at Rs 1,999, four crore GST approved details will be available. Savaliya called on the number mentioned on the advertisement. The person speaking from the other side told him that all data are genuine and that he will send the details of one sample for verification,” said a police official.

According to the FIR, the case was referred to the company’s legal adviser Danish Khan who also got the same reply when he called on the number. However, through his men, Khan found out that the bank account the man gave is of one Ankit Limbachiya of a nationalized bank located at Kapadwanj, Motizur and the address is of Naroda.

“We have lodged a case and with the help of cyber cell are hunting for the accused. We have written to the service providers to obtain the IP log of the device from which the Facebook account was created and operated,” said a police official.

AHMEDABAD: Five more persons have been arrested in connection with the fair price shop scam involving use of forged fingerprints.

The accused used to make silicone fingerprint casts of ration card holders and divert foodgrains and other material meant for the card holders to the open market from fair price shops.

The five accused, Bhimji Chavda, 43, of Bhuj, Natvar Sheth , 62, of Bhuj, Ravindra Maheshwari, 36, of Anjar, Vikas Thakkar, 45, of Anjar and Pranlal Thakkar, 45, of Anjar were arrested by city cyber cell on Saturday. A woman, Bhavna Patel, 26, of Kheda was also taken into custody.

Until now, 59 persons have been arrested in this case that was detected in December 2019.

Inspector Sajan Muchal of cyber cell said that on March 7, Khuma Rabari, Manojkumar Patel, and Mahesh Patel, all of Banaskantha were arrested.

The key accused, Bharat Chaudhary, 26, of Sargasan, Gandhinagar was arrested by Muchal in December.

“Chaudhary used to get the data of customers of fair price shops, including their thumbprints. He then used to take the thumbprints’ soft copy and print them on a rubber like material. Chaudhary then used to sell the thumbprints to accused fair price owners who used to make fake bills using the thumbprints and sell the ration in open market at higher price,” Muchal said.

Mangaluru: After silence being maintained for the entire day, the city resonated to the sound of bells from churches and instruments used for prayers at 5pm. This resonance also saw people come out of their homes on Sunday.

Mangaluru responded positively to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s call to thank healthcare providers and emergency responders who are on the front line to combat Covid-19, across the country. Courtesy Janta Curfew, for a change, people could hear birds chirping instead of vehicles honking.

As the clock struck 5, people were seen standing on the balconies of apartments and terraces, or in front of their houses, either through clapping or with instruments such as conches, small bells, jagate and tala (instruments used during prayers) and plates and spoons to express gratitude to the nation’s caregivers for nearly 15 minutes.

Officers, sailors, civilians and their families of the Indian Coast Guard joined the rest of the country by applauding from their balconies at the Coast Guard residential area, Kunjathbail.

Coast Guard Karnataka stood together to applaud doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers, who were putting themselves at risk on the front lines of the pandemic that is forcing most residents to stay home.

The idea of community clapping,while practising social distancing, appears to have inspired the Coast Guard.

BJP state president and MP Nalin Kumar Kateel participated in the movement by clapping at his residence. Mangaluru City South MLA D Vedavyas Kamath also participated. He not only clapped, but also connected his mobile phone with bluetooth speakers and played the sound clip in full volume, which has gone viral.

Meanwhile, at the entrance of Venkataramana Temple, a group of youth gathered to express their gratitude toards healthcare workers.

Techie Krishna Pawan took this opportunity to play his flute outside his house at Urva Store, as a mark of tribute to those infected with Covid-19 and healthcare and emergency service providers.

As the noise rose to a crescendo, birds took flight and stray dogs barked nervously. People had emerged from their houses to thank the healthcare workers in this unique gesture, as requested by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Balconies filled up quickly and many spilled out of their homes on the streets.The din lasted for about 10 minutes as the city thanked doctors, nurses, paramedics, municipal staff and airport workers, who are fighting Covid-19 from the frontlines. People across the city — and the country — were united in purpose for the long battle ahead which will call upon all their reserves of patience and fighting spirit.“There can’t be a better way of supporting and thanking all these people who, wiout bothering about their own lives, are tracking or reating patients of the coronavirus. That’s why we all did our share of clapping and cheering. It was a great sight...to see so many people cheering loudly from their terraces. Even bells in nearby temples were ringing so loudly,” said Chitra Jain, a resident of New Friends Colony.Ruchin Garg, who stays on Ramjas Road, Karol Bagh, had a similar experience to share. “The area reverberated with the sound of conch shells. My children too joined me. We were excisted to see so many people actually coming out to express their gratitude,” he said. One spotted a young woman beating a thali, all the while chanting, ‘Go corona, go!’ Another young woman held up a placard which read, ‘Equipment for doctors, nurses’, mixing her applause with concern.Sarika Shukla of Adarsh Nagar, however, cautioned that all this din may have obscured the fact that we have a serious situation on our hands and people need to understand the relevance. “At some places, the beating of thalis and clapping by children went on for a long time. “I think parents should have made them understand the purpose of the exercise.”Karan Khanna, a resident of C Block of Janakpuri, shared her concern. “There’s a reason why a janta curfew was called in the first place, and at many areas, people defeated that purpose by gathering on the streets as they could have done the same thing from their balconies. I hope everyone stays safe and better sense prevails,” he said.At Pocket B and C of Sector A in Vasant Kunj, the thanksgiving started somewhat early. “Tough times are ahead and we need to acknowledge the healthcare professionals who are toiling day and night with great risks,” said Seema Sharma, 31. One could also hear hymns being played on a speaker and some firecrackers going off at a distance.“We should respect life and rejoice. And these events teach us to do so,” said Amit Kumar, a 42-year-old businessman. “We take things for granted and have the luxury to stay at home in these times. The ones fighting for us deserve more than a clap. More than 10 minutes of organised noise.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74766173,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-222010,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corona-fighters-hear-city-applaud-effort-loud-clear/articleshow/74765202.cms

Kolkata: Inspired by Italy, a group of young musicians chose to sing their favourite songs, play drums, ukulele and guitars from their balconies instead of clapping and clanging utensils at the end of the ‘Janata Curfew’ on Sunday.

Around 11am, Supriyo Dawn posted on Facebook inviting all musicians on his friend list to sing songs and play musical instruments at 5pm to “thank our heroes and fight this crisis together by staying at home”. Soon, there were many others who commented on his post and shared their will to take part in this initiative in self-quarantine.

Dawn, a Khanna resident, played ‘ Bella Ciao ’, ‘Imagine’ by John Lennon and Bengali song ‘Kotoi rongo dekhi duniyae’ on ukulele and guitar from his balcony. “It is better to sing songs and play musical instruments to pay tribute to our heroes, who are working in these times to save us, instead of clanging utensils,” Dawn said.

Guitarist Abhijit Kundu, a resident of Ultadanga, played ‘Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring’ by JS Bach. He said that when he started playing the song on his guitar, neighbours and passersby cheered him to play more. “Italy and other foreign countries have shown us the way. We should follow the government advisories, stay home and spread art to cope with boredom and mental health issues in such a trying time,” Kundu added.

Salt Lake resident Rohan Bakshi, who played drums from his balcony, said, “The idea was to spread art and motivate our neighbours to stay indoors in such a situation. I had asked all my friends, band members in different pockets of the city to pay tribute to the heroes musically, which I feel is a better option than banging utensils.”

Echoing Bakshi, Patuli resident Srija Chakraborty said that music can be a great healer in situations like this. I hope more people stay indoors and take up art and music to get out of boredom.” Chakraborty sang ‘Let it be’ by Beatles while playing the keyboard.

312,['23/03/2020'],Over 1 lakh Catholics attend online Eucharist mass,"Archbishop Thomas D’Souza held the service from Archbishop House that was streamed live on YouTube

KOLKATA: Nearly one lakh Catholics in the city and some living abroad , attended the Holy Eucharist mass online, read out by Archbishop Thomas D’Souza fromArchbishop House on Park Street. The Archdiocese of Kolkata, which governs Roman Catholic churches in the city, called it an extraordinary measure taken to minimise chances of the spread of the novel coronavirus, which had forced different parishes not to hold individual mass, despite it being the fourth Sunday during Lent.

The 40-minute service was streamed live by the TV channel of the Archdiocese on YouTube from 8am on Sunday so that all parishioners could attend it from their homes. Initially, when Archbishop D’souza’s instructions went out that it would be unsafe to hold Sunday congregations, the community reportedly felt unhappy as they considered the mass during Lent an important religious activity. “We took this step so that all believers could stay at home and pray with the Archbishop as he read out the prayers, focussing on the troubled times and how to ask for grace to help us navigate it,” said vicar general Dominic Gomes . “For many, attending Sunday mass in church is an obligation, but that shouldn’t be the attitude.”

Reading out from Bible, the Archbishop advised people to believe that Jesus was the Shepherd who would lead people from the current crisis unto light and beyond. After the online service was over, congratulatory messages poured in from parishioners of 65 churches. “The online mass was soul-filling. This was so thoughtful of the Archbishop,” said Shipra Goswani, who attends St Patrick’s Church Dum Dum. The vicar general’s brothers, Joseph and Paul Gomes, who live in the US and the UK, attended the online mass with their families. “The service brought us close to Kolkata,” one of them said.

The Church of North India decided to keep all churches and services shut. Bishop Paritosh Canning had earlier suspended church services and with the developing situation, all the 45 member parishes, including St John’s Church and St Paul’s Cathedral, were shut.

MADURAI: The Madras high court has dismissed a batch of petitions filed by chairpersons of various panchayats who challenged Madurai district collector’s order calling for tenders to desilt waterbodies.

The court observed that these petitions were a direct attempt to scuttle and put an end to the scheme initiated by the collector for the welfare of the people.

The petitioners had challenged the order on the ground that it was the exclusive right of the panchayat to frame schemes, based on resolutions passed by the panchayats.

The petitioners stated that the collector's order was a direct encroachment on the power and financial status of the panchayats.

Hearing the plea, Justice C V Karthikeyan observed that the panchayat chairpersons, who have been elected to do public good, would be expected to join hands with the officials in execution of such work and not to obstruct it.

The judge observed that the petitioners did not question the estimate or whether these waterbodies require desilting and deepening.

“When a decision had been taken for public good and welfare, and it would be sanguine on the part of the panchayats to join hands in this welfare object. The panchayats can pass resolutions to second the objects, but taking efforts to scuttle the objects cannot be appreciated,” the court said.

Observing that this court could not be used to prevent a laudable object being implemented for public welfare, the judge dismissed the petitions.

According to a KMC solid waste management department senior official, the demand for garbage cleaning was growing across the city. The official said the civic body was receiving 50-60 calls every day from various areas, requesting to undertake cleaning operations twice a day.

Waking up to the challenge of keeping the city clean at this crucial juncture, the KMC formed a quick response team to reach any neighbourhood to take up cleaning operations. The department also introduced a special three-shift system last week that will continue till March 31. “We have introduced additional manpower to clean the city even at night. We shall continue the drive till March 31,” another official said.

According to him, frantic calls from some housing complexes in Behala, Garden Reach, Kidderpore , Jadavpur , Ballygunge, Tollygunge, Kankurgachhi, Ultadanga and large areas off EM Bypass had prompted the civic body to divide the quick response team into small groups and send the trained workers to the neighbourhoods where their services were urgently needed.

Mayor Firhad Hakim has instructed the solid waste management officials to arrange for adequate masks, gloves, soap and hand sanitizers for on-ground civic workers. In fact, Hakim has been personally checking whether the conservancy workers are facing any difficulty in conducting the cleanliness drive. “For now, we have sufficient stock of such essential materials needed for the huge task force. But we need to send fresh requisitions to the civic top brass by next seven days,” another senior official said.

On Monday, entry and exit to and from the city through the 151 border points were restricted through strict checking, with those entering Delhi required to show proof of the purpose of visit.At least 8,000 vehicles were turned back from the border posts. Cars on city roads were similarly treated when found to be driving without a specific purpose.In stark contrast to Sunday when the janata curfew turned Delhi into a ghost town of sorts, Monday was a grim reminder of the challenges the government would face in locking down the city. Many people were out in the open. A few traffic jams were even reported in some areas. While public transport like Delhi Metro , buses, autorickshaws and app-based cab services have been prohibited, many people were using their private cars on Monday.Atul Goyal, president of the United Residents Joint Action, an apex body of city RWAs, rued, “After Sunday, people thought that things had normalised. While the situation was under control in many of Delhi’s colonies, some places still saw large gatherings. A complete curfew, as announced by central government, would be the only way to fully implement the lockdown.”Amid all this, police were forced to register an FIR against four people, including an Air India employee, for violating conditions of their home quarantine. They have been charged under the Epidemic Act.Traffic built up at the borders due to the bar on entry, but the cops held meetings with their counterparts in UP and Haryana to provide turnaround facilities to non-destined vehicles being denied permissions to enter Delhi. By noon, thousands of daily wagers were seen walking past the border posts to reach their working destinations in the capital. They were allowed entry in batches of two-three people because of the prevailing Section 144 of CrPC banning the assembly of more than five people.In the morning, police made rounds of the city announcing the new shopping guidelines. Shop owners were asked to ensure that only one customer was present at the counter at a time, the others required to be queued up at a distance. Police also advised children playing on the streets to go indoors. Morning walkers and joggers were similarly asked to head home. Patrols were conducted near popular food hubs to ensure only takeaway services operated.Arun Sharma, a resident of Vasant Vihar in southwest Delhi, said that the inner lanes in his colony appeared to be fairly peaceful on Monday, but saw all sorts of vehicles on the main road when he went to the local market for groceries. “It seemed like it was any other day. It was as if an official lockdown and prohibitory orders weren’t in operation. People appeared to be moving freely,” he said.Himanshu Chhabra, a resident of west Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh, also reported a large number of private vehicles moving around in the locality. “I woke up in the morning and went to the balcony when I heard someone honking continuously. I was surprised to see that everything looked the same as on a regular day. It looked nothing like a lockdown,” Chhabra said. “People don’t care about their health and are still taking things casually. For a place like Delhi, a curfew like the one on Sunday has to be implemented. Only such a measure can force people indoors.”Many like Navneet Singh of Hari Nagar made a conscious choice not to venture into the streets. He had to, however, make a quick dash to the grocery shop to stock up on essentials, especially for the needs of his small child. “The panic is getting to us. A person living in our colony recently returned from Canada and his entire family has been requested not to come out from their house,” Singh said. “Delhi is such a place that even if one person catches the virus, it will affect a huge number of people around him or her.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74785850,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-298475,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/people-ignore-lockdown-restrictions-vehicles-out-in-large-number-on-roads/articleshow/74783305.cms

While some of them feel they can work from home only if their domestic help turn up every day as usual, others are demanding leave for domestic help and drivers without pay-cut. A campaign has started on Facebook to allow temporary or flexible workers to stay at home without losing their pay.

Fossils manager Rupsha Dasgupta , her husband, singer-composer Rupam Islam, and their 10-year-old son Rup have become adept at sweeping floors, washing clothes and doing other household chores over the last three days, ever since the couple decided to let their daily help Kajol and Anita go on paid leave. Their 3BHK South End Park flat may not be sparkling, but it still looks pretty clean.

“Between the three of us, we are managing with the housework quiet well,” said Rupsha. She recently changed her Facebook display picture, puting up the #stayhome frame, said, “To fight covid, we must learn to do without our maids for a while and start doing the chores ourselves to fight covid.” The working mother also feels this is a chance to let kids learn basic housework. “Believe me, Rup is cleaning pretty well,” she said.

Having lived on his own in the past, Islam claimed to be more used to housework than his wife. “Doesn’t make sense if only a section of the community practises and the others are left to fend for themselves,” he said.

Before asking her help Bishakha not to attend work from Thursday, homemaker Sudeshna Basu told her to strictly stay at home. “I told her to tell the other people she works for that she needs to be at home for everyone’s safety. It is not easy doing everything. I am cleaning the house every alternate day. It looks a bit messy, but can’t be helped,” the Shyambazar resident said adding, “Bishakha needs to travel in auto from her Ultadanga home. That’s too risky, I thought.”

Swati Biswas Deb, a doctor at BP Neogi Hospital, started a social media campaign titled, “Will you pay your maids, drivers and househelp if they can’t come to work?” But it hasn’t received everyone’s support.

Purnima Haldar, who works as a domestic help, has not missed a day at five Salt Lake households. Asked about her safety, Haldar said, “Who will do the work if we stay at home?”

KOLKATA: Stuck at home with all fitness centres — like gyms, cricket camps and football coaching centres — closed, trainers have started sending fitness and training regimens, including videos, to their trainees over WhatsApp .

Head coach of a cricket coaching camp at Naktala in Tollygunge Rahul Deb said he had been making his students wear masks and had fewer trainees from the second week of March. Now that the camp has closed down, he has prepared a fitness chart for his trainees that he is sending via WhatsApp. He has asked them to practise using the chart at home.

“I have made a separate schedule for bowling and batting. Batting schedules range from front-foot defence with or without the ball and holding the bat in one hand and tapping the ball 1,000 times. Bowling schedule involves ball rotation and spot bowling or one- or three-step bowling shadow practice,” said Deb, of Bidhanpally Chhatra Sangha Cricket Academy.

Ex-cricketer and former national selector Sambaran Banerjee, who also runs a cricket coaching centre, stressed that trainees should utilize the time watching cricket and practising shots and bowling techniques at home.

“We closed our camp well in advance to reduce risk. We all need to be calm while dealing with this situation,” Banerjee said.

Major fitness chains in the city are preparing customized regimens for their trainees to make workouts engaging at home. “People are confused. They call me every now to ask what to do. I tell dem we don’t always need machines and tools. We can do a lot with our body weight only to stay in shape,” said Rupam Chakraborty a fitness expert.

Cricket and football coaching camps in the city had started closing down from the beginning of the last week when the nation saw some of the major sporting events, such as the India-South Africa cricket tournament get scrapped, the IPL deferred and the I-league, suspended midway.

“We had closed our practice sessions last Monday. We made provisions for handwash and repeated hygiene maintenance options. We had also divided the students into smaller groups during training. But considering the aggravated situation, we closed down our training sessions. However, we asked our students to continue freehand exercises and knock-&-dodge practises at home or terrace to stay in touch with the game,” said Arijit Majumdar, secretary of Bulan Football and Cricket academy at Vivekananda Park.

There was an peaceful, but also eerie, feeling on the vacant streets as appeal of prime minister Narendra Modi did what action by official machinery could not.The stunning emptiness of the public places during the Janata Curfew was broken for brief moments at 5 pm when citizens started clapping and beating utensils, like bells, as a mark of gratitude for the medical fraternity, civic and police department who are fighting Covid-19 outbreak. Chants at temples and intonations were also heard at many places like Khamla, Sonegaon. A handful spoilsports watered down the genuine emotion of the citizens by bursting crackers and police had to intervene to stop them.During the curfew, actually second day of the lockdown, city police detained 878 persons and registered 35 offences for the violations of orders. Also, 297 persons were challaned at 66 nakabandi points across the city. City police launched the crackdown, under CP BK Upadhyay and Joint CP Ravindra Kadam, on the violators under ‘Operation Lockdown’ which will remain in place till March 31. “There were already fewer people on the road. We had to be strict when required and send back people to home if they did not have any genuine reason to be out,” said Upadhyay.Police had to act tough at Mominpura with the residents not in a mood to stay inside houses. A squad of riot control police (RCP) had to be deployed along with staff from Tehsil police station and headquarters.The Nagpur rural police too had deployed nakabandi at state borders and checkpoints disallowing entry of vehicles or people into Maharashtra without valid reason.City police, in a fresh development, have now declared prohibitory orders between 9 pm on Sunday and 5 am on Monday during which the citizens would have to abstain from gathering at public places or face action. Sources stated the top brass decided to bring in the order to ensure there are no gatherings on the road when end Janata Curfew and an overnight ritual of a community coincided.In city, citizens’ response to Curfew call left the main roads, lanes and highways wearing an unprecedented deserted look with only the cops seen at otherwise busy junctions. Negligible numbers of vehicles and people were found straying onto the road only to be strictly sent back by the police unless they could furnish reasons of emergencies like heading for hospital or pharmacy and so on. Main markets like Kalamna, Cotton market, Kamal chowk and such places remained closed.The locations like Hingna, MIDC and Buti Bori too were found closed with no industries or factories operating.With shops and establishments, including many essential services, closed, the shutdown was one that the city had not seen in the past one decade over any issue. The absence of autos, cabs, buses and Metro, shut as a part of the lockdown declared by the district administration, added to the effect of the complete shutdown.Citizens, apart from co-operating with police at most places, also showed concern for the khaki department personnel who were on the road since early morning. Citizen groups, like residents of Vaishali Nagar, along with some individuals came forward to serve tea, snacks and water to the cops at many places as no outlets or kiosk were open. Some resident groups, like from Bhaldarpura, also were found offering eatables to homeless and beggars.The regular rush at the Outdoor Patients Department and casualties were also much less at Mayo and Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) with crimes and vehicular accidents remaining negligible. The regular rush at Nagpur railway station, Ganeshpeth bus depot and Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar international airport too was absent while security personnel could be seen all day long.In Amravati, barring some essential commodity shops and sporadically moving police or health department vehicles, there was no life to be seen on roads. The public transport too was not seen. Bus stands in Amravati and Badnera wore a deserted look. Main markets at Rajkamal square, Shyam Chowk and other areas remained closed. Similar was the response in all 14 taluka headquarters and towns and villages of the district.In Wardha too, the response to the Janata Curfew was unprecedented. So far, 107 people are under quarantine while 53 are in home quarantine. Not a single person has been found positive in the district. 93-year-old Bhaiyaji Mashankar said he had not seen such a response for a curfew in his life.In Chandrapur too the shutdown was total during the day. However, after beating of claps and utensils at their home at 5 pm, people started stepping out breaking the curfew. The district administration immediately ordered them back by making public announcements that restrictions had been extended till 5 am on Monday. Police was told to intensify the patrolling and force the people back into homes.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74770207,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-146084,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/janata-curfew-works-not-section-144/articleshow/74764694.cms
319,['23/03/2020'],Plea for compassionate appointment nixed by Madras HC,"Madras high court

MADURAI: The Madras high court has dismissed a plea of a woman seeking compassionate appointment after her mother, who was working as a sanitary worker, died in 2011.

Justice J Nisha Banu passed the order while hearing the plea moved by P Sathya who sought compassionate appointment after the demise of her mother, Pavunthai. Pavunthai was working as a sanitary worker in Usilampatti municipality in Madurai district . The judge observed that as per the GO passed by the labour and employment department in 1995, time limitation of three years has been fixed for the legal heirs to submit an application for compassionate appointment. Her mother had died in 2011 while she filed an application seeking compassionate appointment in 2013, according to her counsel.

The same was rejected in 2018 on grounds that it was not submitted with three years. The authorities stated that she had submitted her application only in 2017. The judge noted that the petitioner could not produce any proof to show she had submitted an application within three years. Hence, the judge dismissed the petition. “The object being of providing compassionate appointment is to enable the family to get over the financial crisis which it faces at the time of the death of the sole breadwinner. Compassionate appointment cannot be claimed when the crisis is over,” said the judge.

From Monday, no city buses will ply at all thus freezing local commute. Even metro rail has announced suspension of services from Monday till further orders. Private autos and cabs have already been grounded since the district authorities implemented the shutdown. State transport buses too will cease operations till further orders.Indian Railways has already announced shutting down all passenger trains with immediate effect till March 31. Only those trains, which started their journey prior to 4AM on Sunday will run till their last stop. For Nagpur station, Kerala Express arriving on Sunday night, going towards New Delhi, will be the last passenger train to halt till at least March 31. Freight trains will continue to operate as per schedule.Air travel is another sector bracing for the impact as all international arrivals at Nagpur airport have been stopped as per Central government’s directions. Domestic routes will continue to operate though the frequency of flights is likely to be reduced.All private establishments in Nagpur, except those dealing in essential items/services, have been ordered to remain shut till March 31. Only those providing essential services or goods will remain open. But since every such outlet will work with very few workers, Nagpurians are advised to avail their services only in case of emergency. MS Lamba, a petrol pump owner, said, “We too are working at reduced staffing levels. I urge people to fill up the tank completely so they don’t have to worry for quite a few days.”Government and semi-government offices will work with just 5% strength to maintain essential activities from tomorrow. Energy minister Nitin Raut announced physical meter reading won’t be done and an average bill will be generated. No bill payment counters will be open. MSEDCL workers will be on duty to attend to repairs and breakdowns.All religious placed have been requested to close down for public, though daily prayers can be offered by the priests. Gurvinder Singh Dhillon , president of Baba Deep Singh Nagar Gurdwara, said they had shut the langar service. “We will support the government completely and since crowds have to be avoided, langar service has been stopped. We are however thinking of distributing foodgrains to daily wage labourers in the vicinity,” said Dhillon.Industries and other commercial establishments, except those engaged in businesses covered under the essential commodities’ list, are expected to remain shut. Pratap Motwani , secretary of Itwari Grain and Seeds Merchants Association , said the grain traders have been specifically asked by the district administration to keep their establishments open so there is no shortage.Rajesh Chabrani, former director of the agriculture produce marketing committee (APMC) at Kalamna, said firms trading in all other commodities except fruits will continue business. The fruit vendors guild has, however, decided to keep business shut for three days.Industry associations too have decided to keep the manufacturing units closed. Nitin Lonkar of Butibori Manufacturers’ Association said all the units except those engaged in food processing business will remain shut during the lockdown.Bullion traders have decided to extend the closure till Monday. However, the association is yet to take a decision on full lockdown, said a source.

The district administration will move them to safe shelters, he said.

In the wake of the lockdown imposed on the district to contain the coronavirus spread, the Beed district administration has realised that people, who end up living on roads due to economic, social or mental conditions, have nowhere to turn to and are vulnerable to the viral threat.

District collector Rahul Rekhawar got to know of a sub-inspector tending to one such homeless person from a photograph taken by a local journalist. Subsequently, Rekhawar made an appeal in which he sought cooperation from the general public asking them to notify about homeless or disabled people. Amid the coronavirus scare, such people face the threat of contracting the infection if they continue to live in public areas, the administration stated.

The municipal councils have arranged for night shelters for such people. Accordingly, the administration will move them to night shelters or mental health facilities where the arrangements of their accommodation, food and sanitation can be done. District social welfare assistant commissioner Sachin Madavi has made the arrangements for the same.

People can call on 7720839155 or 9561840184 and share the information.

323,['23/03/2020'],"As city’s buzz tapers off, nature chimes in","Panaji: The state capital, which otherwise bustles with the commotion of office-goers, traffic and the hum of market activity, was virtually deserted on Sunday owing to social-distancing measures to thwart the potential spread of the novel coronavirus.

However, the silence was offset by the sound of chirping birds, and, for the first time in decades, squirrels and butterflies were seen on Panaji’s otherwise busy streets.

“This seems like the Goa of the pre-Liberation times,” residents said, as they participated in the 14-hour nationwide lockdown.

Clifton Afonso’s family has lived in the heritage quarter of Fontainhas for generations. Located in an extremely busy area with three schools and eateries frequented by tourists, the family has rarely enjoyed the quiet solitude that one would romanticise with the quarter.

There was a shift in this scenario as Sunday’s lockdown materialised.

“We got to spend time with our families and breathe fresh air today. Hearing the birds and enjoying the natural surroundings is a huge contrast from our day-to-day lives. My mother said this takes her back to the time when there was no traffic and the the population was lower,” Afonso said.

Many of the city’s inhabitants had to give the Sunday morning mass a miss. Even the gates of the Don Bosco shrine were kept locked in the morning half to let church-goers know that prayers were suspended.

“We don’t regret missing mass because it’s the need of the hour to avoid gatherings. It is absolutely understandable therefore that the mass was suspended as a precautionary measure against the coronavirus,” a Panaji resident said, adding that he would pray from home instead.

A little ahead, the residents of Mala were cooped up in their homes. The Patto trade centre, which sees people moving about on Sundays as well, wore a deserted look. The solidarity of the city’s inhabitants and professionals was therefore visible.

Transportation was also limited. Buses were stationary at the Panaji bus stand. The yellow and black taxis, motorcycle pilots and rickshaws were not operational, either. The Panaji ferry point was inaccessible as the gates were locked, and the river route closed.

The busy 18th June Road, which sees crowding even at night, resembled a ghost town. For the first time, the adjoining arterial roads had ample parking space.

Heaps of garbage bags lay at nooks and corners of these roads as CCP workers were not working.

The city's roads were near-empty with only a few stray cars and bikes moving around once in a while. The few motorists who were out, were out either looking for food, or a medical store.

While business establishments, grocery stores and most restaurants dropped their shutters for the day, two eateries kept theirs open.

The staff at both these joints said their bosses had asked them to keep the kitchen running for hungry citizens, but advised against letting people sit inside and eat. Only parcels and online orders through Swiggy/Zomato were operational.

While the majority of citizens paid heed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for self-isolation and social distancing, a few were seen walking in the market area. These were workers employed at the hole-in-the-wall hotels, who, for the first time since they started working, had a day off to themselves.

Some were seen soaking the sunlight at the Jardin de Garcia Orta, also known as the Panaji municipal garden.

One of them, Vijay Naik, a resident of Mala, reasoned that he neither has a cough or cold and is sitting by himself in the garden, therefore following the social distancing protocol.

“I had read about the curfew in the newspapers. However, I cannot sit indoors for long periods. I had to venture out,” he said.

While he and a few other men sat there rebelling without a cause, birds, insects and rodents from the garden made merry, feasting on fallen berries, scrambling on the roads or merely enjoying the solitude of the space that was free of humans for the first time in decades.

As many as 30 sanitation inspectors, 115 ward supervisors and 2,000 sanitation workers were on their toes since early morning. They discharged their duty of sweeping the roads and other public places, collecting waste from every household, transporting the waste to garbage depots and processing waste. The sanitation workforce has been put on alert from around two weeks ago, ever since the higher authorities sounded the alarm for coronavirus outbreak in the city.

In the letter written to the head of the solid waste management cell, Nandkishore Bhombe, and addressed to the cleanliness staff, Pandey said that the sanitation workers were the pillar on which the city and the civic body were standing. “We are safe here because you are doing your duty. I know you are doing your job 100%. Hats off to you,” wrote the civic chief adding that they should let him know if they faced any problems.

Sanitation inspector Vishal Kharat said, “The workers are at their jobs on all public holidays and festivals. The appreciation from the civic chief means a lot.”

“The civic body has asked its ward officers, waste collection agency as well as the waste processing agency to ensure the sanitation workers are given masks, gloves and gumboots so that their health is not at risk,” said Bhombe.

325,['23/03/2020'],Madras HC upheld the acquittal of man charged with murdering grandma,"Representative image

MADURAI: Dismissing an appeal, Madras high court confirmed the order of the trial court, which acquitted a person on charges of murdering his grandmother over property dispute at Karur in 2008.

The prosecution case is that Selvaraj had picked up a quarrel with his grandmother Veerammal seeking a share in the property on December 25, 2008. Since Veerammal refused to concede to his demand, Selvaraj is alleged to have murdered her on the same day. The Lalapet police registered a case and arrested Selvaraj. The Karur sessions court acquitted Selvaraj in the case in 2010. Challenging the order of the trial court, Subbulakshmi who is the paternal aunt of Selvaraj, filed a revision petition before the Madurai bench of the high court in 2010 and subsequently the revision petition was converted into an appeal in 2018.

Hearing the appeal, a division bench of Justice P N Prakash and B Pugalendhi observed that the case of the prosecution rests on the eye-witnesses – her husband Murugayee , Subbulakshmi, and her husband Thangavel . The judges noted that the trio had filed a partition suit against Veerammal and Selvaraj in 2002 and the same was suppressed by them. The judges noted that only during the cross examination, the defence was able to establish that the trio had filed a partition suit.

The judges also noted that the trial court had the opportunity to see the demeanour of Thangavel, Subbulakshmi and Murugayee and had chosen to discard the testimonies of these three eye-witnesses on the ground that they were not reliable. The facts and circumstances show that they had a better motive to get rid of Veerammal, since they had filed the suit, which was pending as on the date of occurrence. The judges observed that while dealing with an appeal against acquittal, it is well settled that when two views are possible, the view that favours the accused merits acceptance. Hence, the judges dismissed the appeal.

“The canteen came in handy when all other shops were closed. I would have gone hungry if I did not fine one since I am single and there is no one to look after me,” he said.

Amma canteens run by the Madurai corporation came to rescue of many people like him in the city, especially the homeless and marginalized. They had idly at Rs 1 each and Pongal for Rs 5. For lunch, sambar and curd rice were served at Rs 5 and Rs 3 respectively.

A self help group worker from CMR Road Amma Canteen said, “We sell tiffin worth Rs 800 on most days. This Sunday there was less crowd and sold only of Rs 300. We were prepared only limited food.”

The corporation decided to keep Amma canteens open so that homeless people would not go hungry.

Out on bail, Hema Ahuja, Bhakti Mehare and Ankita Khandelwal told court the owners of their guest houses had told them to vacate in light of the pandemic and they had no homes in the city.

The defence told court the women would travel to their native places by private transport to prevent spread of the virus.

While granting them relief until April 1, the court said it was common knowledge that due to the outbreak of Covid-19, hotels and guest houses are being shut and vacated to avoid spread of the virus.

“Considering the circumstances, it is clear the applicants will have no place to stay in Mumbai. When the entire world is fighting to check the pandemic, it is against human rights to tell the accused to stay in Mumbai despite they not having a place to reside,” the court said.

Tadvi had hanged herself in her hostel room at B Y L Nair Hospital, Mumbai Central, on May 22. While the charge-sheet has been submitted in the case, charges are yet to be framed.

Tadvi’s mother, Abeda Tadvi’s advocate, submitted that the doctors’ pleas were against restrictions of travel imposed by the government. The lawyer said the doctors were recently allowed to travel. The lawyer also submitted that if their travel is advisable, she had no objection.

The judge pointed out due to outbreak, courts were only taking up urgent matters, such as bail, anticipatory bail and remand applications.

Last month, while Ahuja had been allowed to visit her home in Satna from the evening of March 10-18, Warud native Mehare and Ankola native Khandelwal had been granted permission to travel from March 9-16.

In addition to this, countries including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Indonesia and Kuwait, have stopped mass gatherings for prayers in mosques.

Police sources said that her statement will soon be recorded.

The police had arrested Fernandes, a resident of Moll, Sao Jose de Areal, on charges of abducting and raping the minor.

NEW DELHI: The national capital is entirely under prohibitory orders for the first time. Delhi Police imposed Section 144 of the CrPC from 9pm on Sunday to implement the lockdown necessitated by the novel coronavirus outbreak. The order will remain in force till March 31.

With all of Haryana under Section 144 and Noida and Ghaziabad as well, it means the restrictions that don’t allow five or more people to gather in one place now extend across the vast urban sprawl of Delhi-NCR. Delhi Police will allow no demonstrations, processions, protests or social gatherings. Only shops selling essential commodities such as milk and vegetables will remain open.

“Any gathering — social, cultural, political religious, academic, sports, seminar, conference — is prohibited. Organisation of weekly markets (except for vegetables, fruits and essential commodities), concerts, exhibitions, etc is prohibited. Guided group tours, conducted by various private tour operators, are prohibited,” said the order signed by the Delhi Police chief.

Police have also specified that any individual who has tested positive for Covid-19 or is suspected to have it has to take measures for prevention and stay in home or institutional quarantine. “The person shall co-operate to render assistance or comply with the direction of the surveillance personnel,” said the order. Violations of this are punishable under Section 188 (disobedience of an order duly promulgated by a public servant).

Asked about the impact of the prohibitory orders on the ongoing Citizenship Amendment Act protest at Shaheen Bagh, a police officer said, “We went to the protest site and hardly three to four people were present. If more people gather and violate the order, action will be taken.” Besides, with state borders also being sealed, Delhi Police will keep a check on any vehicle entering the capital. Delhi Police spokesperson Mandeep Singh Randhawa said, “Apart from emergency and essential services, we will prevent all vehicles from entering. If any commuter wishes to enter the city, they would be screened and asked about their urgency to travel before being allowed to enter.”

Police have advised Delhiites to avoid travelling to NCR cities like Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad unless it is for essential work. Vehicles belonging to doctors, army personnel and the media have been exempted from the curbs.

According to the order, police will also not allow any goods carriers except ones carrying food or other essential items. Gurugram police did not issue any orders but police chief Mohammad Akil told TOI people had willingly complied with lockdown and they did not want to put unnecessary restrictions.

The aviation ministry spokesperson categorically said, “IGIA shall remain functional” on Sunday evening, after the state’s lockdown order said “all domestic/international flights arriving to Delhi during this time shall be suspended”. Schedule international flights in and out of any Indian airport are not allowed till next March 29.However, how passengers, crew and other staffers of airlines, airports and other agencies commute between the airport and their homes/hotels across NCR remains to be seen. As part of lockdown, no public transport services including Delhi Metro, private buses, taxis and auto-rickshaws are allowed to ply. DTC buses will operate at 25% capacity for employees of essential service agencies like DJB, BSES and health department. Delhi’s borders with Haryana and UP are also sealed during the lockdown.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation is going to seek exemption from these restrictions on commute of aviation personnel and passengers between IGIA and their homes/hotels in private cabs. Delhi Police and its traffic wing come under Centre (home ministry) and will play an essential role in making this possible.A standoff is likely as the Delhi government stood by its order issued with the approval of lieutenant governor and reiterated that neither international nor domestic flights would operate in the wake of complete lockdown. Domestic flights operating despite lockdown in Delhi may leave flyers stranded at the airport due to absence of public transport.Airlines have cabs to transport pilots and cabin crew. Other staffers mostly use personal or public transport. “Let us see how many of our required staffers we are able to ferry between the airport and their homes across NCR,” said an official.“We are seeking exemption on Sunday-Monday night itself before the lockdown kicks in to avoid inconvenience to passengers,” said an aviation official.Immediately after the Delhi government order, top levels of aviation ministry went in a huddle. “It was felt that air connectivity, anyway in very limited now and that too to only schedule domestic, is an essential service that needs to continue,” said a senior official.

Burial urns were discovered at Konthagai even before the excavation began at Keeladi. It is believed that Konthagai was the burial site of Keeladi, where first level and second level burials could have been conducted. Sources at the state archaeology department said that people could have either been directly buried there or those who died elsewhere could have been brought and laid to rest here in the urns.

Madurai Kamaraj University has signed an MoU with the archaeology department to conduct research on the remains, especially bones and other artefacts at the site. The bones were discovered on Saturday. A team from MKU led by vice-chancellor M Krishnan, professor K Balakrishnan from the department of immunology, retired professor Pitchaiappan, deputy director of archaeology Sivanandam, and archaeologists B Asaithambi and Baskaran inspected the site, when the top portion of the skeleton was revealed. It is believed that the remains are of a person who was buried in a seated position. What has been revealed are two hands.

The vice-chancellor said that it would take about three days for the archaeologists to bring out the entire skeleton, which may reveal more details. This is supposed to be the remains of the first level burial. It may be recalled that nearly eight burial urns of various sizes and smaller pots have been discovered at Konthagai, since the excavation started on February 19 this year.

MADURAI: All the shops and commercial establishments remained closed in Madurai to observe the Janata Curfew called on by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as part of precautionary measure for Covid-19. Transportation came to a grinding halt as buses, auto rickshaws and private vehicle stayed off road on Sunday.

Roads and traffic signals wore deserted look as people stayed indoors. There were no cars to be seen on the roads, although a few people used two-wheelers to commute between short distances. People had already stocked essentials like vegetables and grocery items a day before. Bus terminals like Periyar, Arapalayam and Mattuthavan were also found deserted.

A few, who took up travelling, were stuck at Mattuthavani bus terminal. With no shops open to buy water and biscuits, they had to go hungry. After an alert made by TOI, the Madurai Corporation commissioner S Visakan arranged for food for those stuck at the terminal. Zone four sanitation officer Rajkannu brought food from a nearby Amma canteen to feed 35 people. They said they will stay at the terminal until transport department resumes service.

Shanmuga Raja, a native of Nagercoil, was returning home from Bengaluru, where he works in a windfarm. He got stuck at Mattuthavani. He said that he would not mind staying at the terminal if food, water and toilet facility are available. “I booked ticket long back and could not cancel it. I thought I can somehow manage to reach home, if I reached Madurai. But never thought it would be a total shutdown and I would be stranded,” he said.

Some auto rickshaw drivers cashed in on the situation, as they fleeced Rs 300 per person to transport them to Periyar, while a trip itself costs Rs 150 under normal situation. Similarly, auto rickshaw drivers came forward to transport those, who were stranded in terminals to as far as Ramanathapuram, Virudhunagar and Kovilpatti. They charged not less than Rs 1,500 per person.

Police personnel, who were deployed at important junctions and street corners, ensured that people did not wander outside unnecessarily. They stopped people and questioned their need to come out. They sensitized them on the importance of staying at home and asked them to return home.

The corporation utilized Janata Curfew to disinfect public places. Sanitation employees were deployed at Madurai railway junction and bus terminals. They disinfected all public places, hand rails and door handles. Only a few outlets like fuel stations, medical shops, milk booths and hospitals remained opened. Similar situation prevailed in all the districts in southern Tamil Nadu.

As soon as the Prime Minister announced the Janata Curfew for March 22, about 24 families that had planned to conduct weddings on Sunday took the decision to postpone them to a later date. Meanwhile, seven weddings were conducted in the Poonga Murugan temple, which is under the control of the Madurai Corporation at 5 am. The priests had been informed in advance and they came to the temple and conducted the ceremonies one after another. Meanwhile, a bigger ceremony, which had been organized in one of the oldest and biggest halls in Madurai, Raja Muthia Mandram, was conducted in a simple manner. Sources said even the local ministers were expected to participate in this function but it saw a very low attendance on Sunday. Athavan, one of the bridegrooms said that his wedding had been planned as a big ceremony with many rituals and a feast. They were unable to cancel it at the last moment and hence, organized it as a simple ceremony. “The government is doing it for our welfare so we should also co-operate,” he said. In Dindigul, a wedding was conducted with about 50 guests early in the morning and hand sanitizers were distributed to all the guests, who came there. The feast was also reduced to an ordinary meal.

In Tuticorin, a couple Shankar and Sivashankari, had a low key wedding in Kovilpatti with just their parents and a handful of relatives in attendance. They also wore masks as a protective measure. The wedding was planned to be held in the Shiva temple in Tuticorin, but as it was closed, they decided to hold it in a smaller Mariamman temple in Muniasamy puram.

Panaji: Though essential commodities to be supplied to Goa from other states will continue despite the border control on vehicles, anticipating a three-day break in the coming week, the Goa State Horticulture Corporation Limited (GSHCL) doubled its order for Saturday's supply (which will reach Goa on Sunday) to ensure vegetable availability in the state.

Since the Belagavi market will be closed on Sunday owing to the nationwide janta curfew, the vegetable supply scheduled for Monday morning is suspended. With Tuesday being the weekly market off in Belagavi, followed by Gudi Padwa holiday on Wednesday, the supply stays suspended further for two more days. Hence, GSHCL ordered 200 tonne of vegetables to tackle the situation ahead of the three-day break.

The corporation orders around 100 tonne of vegetables which lasts a few days at the horticulture outlets. Now, the horticulture stores are witnessing panic-buying by consumers owing to which the corporation decided to be prepared.

“Vegetable supply to Goa is not going to be affected since it will be covered under ‘essential commodities and groceries’. We kept most horticulture outlets open on Saturday so that people can come out and purchase for the coming week,” GSHCL managing director Sandeep Faldesai said.

“We constantly keep telling the consumers that there will be no shortage and there is no need to buy in bulk. However, they don’t seem convinced, so we have stocked up double the quantity so that there is no shortage of vegetables at the horticulture outlets in the first half of the coming week,” Faldesai added.

Vendors in the Panaji municipal market, however, are less worried. “We are aware that the supply will be suspended till Wednesday. However, most of our customers have stocked up in bulk due to the janta curfew so that should last them until the first half of the coming week,” Jaffar Mokashi, a vendor said.

“As far as our stores are concerned, we will have fewer vegetables but things will normalise once supply resumes from Thursday onwards,” another vegetable vendor said.

Surat: Government Medical College (GMC) and New Civil Hospital (NCH) authorities on Saturday began work to set up a 200-bed treatment facility for COVID-19 patients on their campus. Authorities plan to set up the facility in 72 hours as per the instructions of Kishore Kanani , minister of state for health, and Harsh Sanghvi , BJP MLA from Majura constituency. Both the politicians visited the hospital to inspect existing infrastructure on Saturday.

The facility is being developed at the existing 10-storey building, which remains unutilized since its construction. The building was to house a stem cell hospital but barring a few floors it remains incomplete.

""Three floors have complete flooring, plaster and electrification. We are trying to start medical facility for coronavirus patients in 72 hours as per the instructions of the minister and MLA,” GMC dean Jayesh Brahmbhatt said.

""For the medical facility, the project implementation unit that works under the roads and buildings department has been instructed to begin work. We can create 200-bed facility from the existing equipment and furniture in the hospital,” he added.

After receiving authorization to start a testing facility for Covid-19 patients, NCH started a laboratory on its campus on Saturday. Meanwhile, top government officials on Sunday asked SMIMER hospital authorities to develop a 100-bed facility for treatment of coronavirus patients.

Surat: Officials of Surat district and sessions court and police in their efforts at crowd management on Sunday decided to reduce the number of cops who need to remain present during the hearing in bail applications. In a temporary arrangement that has been worked out, four cops appointed as nodal officers will represent the entire city police in different courts during the hearing in the bail applications of accused. Papers and other material relating to bail applications will be sent to the courts concerned by the police stations through email.

Currently during the hearing in the bail applications of accused, three cops from each police station remain present in a court. Their total number comes to 150, sources said.

""The court has tried to reduce crowd on its campus by rescheduling hearings, but for daily matters which include bail applications, policemen have to remain present. This adds to the number of persons on the court campus and in current situation because of coronavirus, it is risky,"" district government pleader Nayan Sukhadwala said.

""It has been planned that a policeman each from four zones of city police will remain present on behalf of the police stations of a zone assigned to them. The police station concerned will send papers directly to the public prosecutor through email. The papers will be used in the court during hearing,"" Sukhadwala added.

Police can send important points related to applications and affidavit to the public prosecutor for argument in the court. ""In a very important case, the investigation officer can remain present,"" he added.

""We will immediately start this new arrangement. This is a very good decision and will help reduce number of people on court campus. The courts have already issued directives asking applicants and lawyers to avoid coming to the court campus unless it is very important,"" city police commissioner R B Brahmbhatt said.

""The courts have already asked police to return the recently issued summons and warrants back to them. The court will issue fresh summons and warrants once the situation becomes normal,"" Brahmbhatt added.

Police personnel had surrounded the perimeter, and all the shops in the area were shuttered.“There were a dozen men in orange and black suits, probably from the disaster management team, stationed outside the society. There was also a vehicle meant to transport the suspected patient to the hospital,” the 37-year-old psychotherapist told TOI on Sunday.Juneja is a part of a collective called “caremongers”, who have banded together to “assist” vulnerable people in times of lockdown due to Covid-19. Apart from Noida, they have reached out to people in Jaipur, Gurgaon, Delhi and Bangalore. The group was founded on by 38-year-old Mahita Nagaraj, a digital marketer based in Bengaluru, barely a week ago.“The idea came up because a friend of mine from the UK called me recently to check in on her parents. Hours after I did that, another friend from the US called me with a similar request, which made me realise that there must be hundreds of people in need of assistance,” Nagaraj said.So, she wrote a Facebook post, asking people to get in touch if they needed assistance, and the response was overwhelming. It was then that she decided to start a “helpline”. She made a poster with the message, “Let’s move from scare mongering to care mongering,” and made it public, along with helpline. On the first day, she got over 350 calls. Thereafter, Nagaraj started a Facebook group calling for volunteers and in just two days, 2,000 people had signed up from across India. Juneja was one of them. The group provides assistance to people in four categories: elderly, parents with infants aged below one, people with pre-existing medical conditions and physically challenged individuals. Juneja delivered groceries to a family which was out of milk for their infant. “It took me over two hours to purchase milk and other essentials and to deliver to the destination,” said Juneja. She wasn’t allowed inside the society, but she left the items with the security personnel and the family collected it from there. “When Ispoke to the family, they kept thanking me. But for me, the idea is to be there for each other. As a mother of two, I understand it can be very difficult to live in a lockdown, especially with an infant,” she said.Another volunteer, Aishwarya Subramanian, offered to drop off food items on her bicycle to the “elderly” in Bengaluru on March 20. Her post received over 5,000 tweets and over 20,000 likes. Aishwarya has since joined the caremongers Facebook group.In Punjab , Mohit, a young professional circulated a similar message on his social media handles. “Hello folks, if your elderly parent or relatives live in Chandigarh/Mohali/ Panchkula and need help with groceries, medicine or any other supplies, please feel free to call me. I’ll purchase them and drop them at their home,” he wrote in a message, along with his phone number. The post went viral on WhatsApp as well as other platforms. “I think caremongering as a concept started in Canada, where a group of people came together to provide essential services. It was also meant to counter scaremongering that had become common during the crisis. I thought it was apt to use it here in the current scenario,” Nagaraj said. As Aishwarya put it, the idea is to “make the world a little less lonely for people right now”.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74765745,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-256520,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/caremongering-in-times-of-corona/articleshow/74765747.cms

Offices, educational institutions in city shut. These were the scenes of Visakhapatnam on janata curfew on Sunday.

As people observed the self-imposed curfew in a bid to arrest the spread of Covid-19, they spent time with family, watched films that have been in the watch-list for long, shared meals while maintaining hygienic distance and practiced yoga. Some, finally even picked up a book.

On the other hand, there were many who decided to spend the day trying to help people at this time of need. Students and others joined hands (not literally) and made hand sanitizers and masks for people who need it, but have not been able to procure.

Four students who run a start-up called ROHA Biotech prepared 150 sanitizers and distributed it among traffic police personnel, GVMC sanitation workers, fruit vendors and auto-rickshaw drivers.

Vivek, one such student said, “People need to avoid crowded areas including long queues in medical stores. After we distributed sanitizers to people in public places, we got a call from an old-age home to prepare 5liters of sanitizer. We are following WHO norms in making sanitizers.”

Ravikanth Reddy of Fluentgrid said, “Sanitizers are being sold at exorbitant rates. Hence, we made 25litres of sanitizers for office staff and distributed it.”

Meanwhile, NGOs who work in the city took strides towards working remotely. Chandra Mohan Pasari, member of Junior Chamber International (JCI) said, “We had a training session on how to organise virtual meetings. Over 45 people connected. We learnt a lot of things.”

Many also took their old dusty indoor game sets and settled down to play with family. Bhavesh Kumar, a college student said, “My entire family loves to play carom. However, we haven’t played together in years. Janata Curfew gave us an opportunity.” Anjali Dange, on the other hand, decided to enjoy the leisure without being pressed for time.

India, which was already facing growth deceleration, the impact of Covid-19 is likely to pull it down further in the fourth quarter.In this context, Chandrajit Banerjee, director general of CII (Confederation Of Indian Industry) said, “Fiscal and monetary stimulus measures need to be announced urgently.”According to Banerjee, first, the government may consider a strong fiscal stimulus to the extent of 1 per cent of GDP. Second, in order to improve market sentiments which are witnessing extreme volatility, the government may consider long-term capital gains tax of 10% and fixing total dividend distribution tax at 25%.Third, GST payments should be on collection of bills rather than raising invoices. he CII director general further said that the RBI may consider relaxing NPA (non-performing asset) recognition norms.",visakhapatnam,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/cii-suggests-ways-to-boost-economy/articleshow/74763574.cms

Many of these people in isolation wards are foreigners or non-resident Indians (NRIs).Narrating the situation with patients in quarantine and isolation wards, a senior doctor of a government hospital said, “The initial tendency of patients, especially those with foreign connections, is to somehow escape quarantine and leave the hospital. Recently, a US-based woman doctor threw a tantrum because of a four-minute delay in receiving lunch.”“They are somehow in a stage of anxiety and stress, but the moment her report came out negative, her demeanour changed and she felt sorry for her behaviour,” related the doctor.The doctor also spoke of another incident where the authorities had to warn a Belgian national of police action because he was trying to leave the hospital before his test results arrived.In order to help them bide their time while waiting for test results, people in quarantine and in isolation wards have been provided with free Wi-Fi, books and have also been provided with smartphones.Moreover, those with family in the city have been allowed to let their family members bring food in sealed disposable containers.

The airline said resident welfare associations (RWAs) of crew who operated special flights to fly Indians stranded in corona hotspots like Wuhan, Italy and Japan are “obstructing them from performing their duty or even calling in the police, simply because the crew travelled abroad in the course of their duty.”AI has said it is following all precautions to ensure safety of everyone — crew and passengers on these flights — by proving the required personal protective equipment. It may be noted AI is the only Indian carrier that has operated special flights to bring back stranded Indian from China, Italy and Japan. “We do not get our salary on time. We do not know when we will get it either. We do not think about ourselves whenever being called to fly to war zones and now corona hotspots to evacuate Indians. Our salary, which for months has not come on time, is being deducted and on top of this we are facing this ostracisation from our neighbours and RWAs. We are humans, don’t break us,” said a crew member on condition of anonymity.Given the extent of the issue, AI issued a statement Sunday saying: “..it is alarming to note that in many localities, vigilante resident welfare associations and neighbours have started ostracising the crew, obstructing them from performing their duty or even calling in the police, simply because the crew travelled abroad in the course of their duty. These vigilantes have conveniently forgotten that many a spouse, parent, sibling child and near and dear one have been brought home safe and secure from affected countries thanks to the heroic efforts of these Air India crew.”“We would like to appeal to all concerned, particularly the law enforcement agencies, to ensure that our crew are treated with the courtesy, respect and freedom that every citizen of this country deserves especially in light of the fact of their having undertaken flight duties to affected countries to bring back Indian citizens,” the statement added.AI has reiterated it is taking all possible “precaution to ensure the safety of its crew and protect their well-being for each and every fight they have undertaken to fly to cities affected with Covid-19 with all essential and non-essential measures to arrest the spread of coronavirus amongst crew and passengers.”The Maharaja ensures sufficient quantity of hand sanitisers, gloves and masks for crew and passengers are on board. Crew members coming to India from affected cities are sent on home quarantine and also to designated hospitals for check-up as part of the protocol. Hazmat suits are also placed in the cockpit for use in aircraft by crew in the event of any suspect corona case being on board.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74765770,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-122248,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/crew-operating-flights-to-corona-hotspots-being-ostracised-says-air-india/articleshow/74765750.cms
361,['23/03/2020'],India has issued unique ID cards to just 32L of its 2.7cr disabled,"NEW DELHI: Around 32.38 lakh unique disability identity (UDID) cards have been issued by the central government across 682 districts, as per data shared by the department of empowerment of persons with disabilities (DEPwD) with the parliamentary standing committee on social justice and empowerment. The committee gave its report to Parliament earlier this month.

The 31-member committee chaired by BJP ’s Rama Devi noted that the performance of some states was quite poor. West Bengal was highlighted where just four cards were issued against the Rs 23 lakh released under the project. The committee also pointed out that many states, like Bihar , Assam , Telangana , Tripura and Andhra Pradesh, did not receive any funds till 2018-19.

Data from 2016-17 to 2019-20 showed that UDID cards were issued to 32,38,703 disabled persons. Given that the 2011 Census put the number of disabled people at 2.68 crore, a significantly large number of disabled persons is yet to be covered by the UDID project. After West Bengal, those with very few cards issued included Dadra and Nagar Haveli (25), Lakshadweep (27), Goa (78), Nagaland (204), Sikkim (369), Arunachal Pradesh (584), Daman & Diu (742), Manipur (734) and Delhi (918). The maximum number of cards have been issued in Telangana (4,77,106) followed by Madhya Pradesh (3,57,167) and Andhra Pradesh (3,49,300).

The UDID project was initiated by the government to create a national database of persons with disabilities and also for the purpose of issuance of UDID cards which would be valid throughout the country. The DEPwD told the standing committee that all states/UTs have started implementing the project.

The department told the committee that data of 1.5 crore legacy certificates issued by states had been taken on board in the Unique Identification Cards System, an online portal. It was pointed that states were not re-validating those certificates because of which people had to go to the CMO again.

To overcome this, the DEPwD has asked states to upload the re-validated certificate to generate a UDID card and medical examination would be required only for newer disabilities listed in the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. “Even for that, the procedure has been streamlined and norms for constitution of medical teams have been relaxed,” the panel said.

The department said it had given webcam, computer and online password to every CMO so that there was no delay in uploading legacy certificates. For newer disabilities, a team of doctors is required to enable certification. In such cases, the central government has said if a state does not have enough doctors, they could empanel private doctors or take doctors from other states.

362,['23/03/2020'],"Curfew shows vehicles, commercial activities make Delhi’s air toxic","Deserted view of a road in New Delhi after the lockdown announced by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal amid COVID... Read More

Nagpur: The novel coronavirus outbreak-related lockdown has reinforced the fact that transport sector, commercial activities and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are majorly responsible for the toxicity in New Delhi’s air, say scientists. They feel that a review needs to be done on the source contribution aspect of ambient air pollution, including contribution of stubble burning on the Capital’s air crisis.

Stating that air pollution levels have improved following the lockdown, senior principal scientist Padma Rao, of CSIR National Environmental Engineering Research Institute’s (Neeri) air pollution control division, said: “Before the lockdown, the pollution levels in Delhi were high in spite of no significant stubble burning. A one-day lockdown brought significant reduction in the pollution, implying that transport, commercial and small medium-scale industrial activities are mostly responsible and need regulation.”

Rao added that contribution of re-suspended road dust as part of vehicular movement also needs to be reviewed. “During next few days of lockdown we may obtain some more data of city’s improved air quality say scientists,” she said.

TOI analysed the data of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) which revealed that in many areas of New Delhi, levels of particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) plummeted drastically, thereby improving the overall Air Quality Index (AQI).

For instance in Mundka, the level of NO2 went as high as 119 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm) on the night of March 20. The next night too, the NO2 level reached 87 mpcm. However, following the lockdown, the pollutant’s levels nearly reduced to half and was 49 mpcm on Sunday night.

The CO level too saw a similar fall post the janata curfew. From 243 mpcm on March 21, Mundka’s AQI dropped to 119 mpcm after the lockdown.

Most of the other areas witnessed a similar trend of reduction in pollutants. In Ashok Vihar, the levels of CO were 124 mpcm and 105 mpcm on the nights of March 20 and 21, respectively. However, post the lockdown, level of the toxic gas went down to 43 mpcm on the night of March 22. The AQI of the area, which was mostly close to or above 200 mpcm, reduced to 128 mpcm post the curfew.

Air quality monitoring stations at other areas including Anand Vihar, ITO, Jahangirpuri, Lodhi Road etc recorded a similar improvement in the air quality levels.

“The shutting down of transport sector along with other non-essential activities has brought enormous decline in NO2, CO and particulate matter which are majorly emitted from vehicles and fuel burning. The curfew has been a blessing in disguise for Delhi as we can now define the pie of source contribution,” said Rao.

The senior scientist further suggested that at time of emergency and health crisis, the government can introduce such lockdowns to curb air pollution. “Major reforms are needed in transport sector to improve Delhi’s air. Alternate options like use of electric/ CNG/ Clean fuel etc for commercial vehicles will prove to be effective. Apart from this, transition towards BS-VI standard, rationalization of use of cars, improved signalling and traffic decongestion will help in significant reduction of pollution,” said Rao, adding that use of public transport should be encouraged.

The scientist also stated that more information on air quality data of coming days of lockdown will throw major insights on air pollution mitigation, thus providing inputs in streamlining the action plans.

Joggers and walkers were near permanent fixtures in the morning and evening at Indira Glass House, Nrupatunga Hills, Unkal Lake, Tolanakere, Sadhanakeri and Kelageri Lake, among other lungspaces in the twin cities. However, fears over contracting the novel coronavirus or Covid-19 has kept a bulk of them away, resulting in these lush green spaces losing some of their sheen.Forced to shun gardens and parks, joggers and walkers are contenting themselves with strolls on their terraces, or strolling the periphery of their homes. Unsurprisingly, treadmills are in demand, with people refusing to abandon their physical regimen. But there are many with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes worried about keeping themselves in good shape in times such as these.Sharanappa Kotigi, a social worker in Lingaraj Nagar, said that he had not stopped going to the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) Garden near Adarsh College. “I go for a walk between 6.30am and 7am, and there would be around 30 people strolling with me. Now, there are hardly three or four people in the park. But I simply cannot stop taking a walk in the morning, and I have put my faith in God, and will continue to visit the garden,” said Kotigi.On the other hand, Sunil Nalavade, an activist, said that he had stopped visiting Indira Glass House for his daily stroll. “I have started walking along the roads of my locality. Of course, I miss the company of friends I had made at the Indira Glass House, but it is impossible to keep a safe distance while strolling there. But we are staying in touch via online chatting,” Nalavade said.General secretary of the Nrupatunga Betta Vayuviharigala Sangha Siddu Mogalishettar admitted to a marked decline in the number of regular strollers at the Nrupatunga Hills. “The thing is, the garden at Nrupatunga Hills is vast, and it will not be very hard for people to keep themselves at a safe distance from others. With gymnasiums having been closed, many people are coming to this garden. But it is good to see that all visitors to the garden, including the children, are wearing masks,” Mogalishettar said.Raju Habib, a businessman in Old Hubballi, said that he had taken to strolling on the terrace of his home instead of his regular walks at the neighbourhood park. “But it is not as enjoyable. So I am mulling over buying a treadmill soon,” Habib said.Ottilie Anbun Kumar, another activist in Dharwad, said that he had started doing yoga at home, and had taken to walking at a nearby farm, after he decided against walking at the Botanical Garden at Karnatak University.",hubballi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/joggers-walkers-avoid-parks-and-gardens-prefer-exercise-indoors/articleshow/74764192.cms

While most petrol bunks stayed shut across the city, the few that chose to function on Sunday registered little to no business. Most arterial roads in Hubballi, where the bustle of activity is often heard before it is seen, were silent. However, this calm was pierced in some places by some youngsters taking selfies with empty streets in the backdrop, while some could be seen huddled in clusters in front of shut shops.Interestingly, police vehicles too remained off the roads, for the most part. Police personnel, were, however, deployed in small numbers in ‘sensitive’ areas to prevent anti-social elements and miscreants from abusing the ‘curfew’ as a window for crime. While North West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) suspended its operations for the entire day, the number of local buses that functioned in Hubballi was not many. Similarly, autos and taxis too stayed off the roads.Sushmita Toshikani, an optometrist, said that the curfew had afforded her family a great chance to spend some time with one another, since all members were seldom home together. “My father works in Hescom and he often had to attend emergencies even on Sunday. After a very long time, we spent some quality time with each other,” said Sushma.Meanwhile, Sanju Thakur enjoyed the calm silence that made regularly inaudible sounds such as the chirping of birds and the rustle of leaves on a tree vividly clear. He was not alone. Many residents in Hubballi were greeted in the morning by the cooing of sparrows and other birds, with no man-made noises to drown out the sounds of nature.The usually chaotic Koppikar Road too was completely silent on Sunday, a perfect indicator of the success of Narendra Modi ’s ‘Janata Curfew’.",hubballi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74764160,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-54290,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/sounds-of-silence-echo-on-the-streets-of-hubballi/articleshow/74764161.cms

NEW DELHI: The government has brought back 400 people from Singapore and 250 from Amsterdam — all transit passengers — in the last few days. India is still trying to bring back stranded passengers from Malaysia and London , official sources said.

In the past couple of days, India has had to bring back hundreds of transit passengers stranded in different airports around the world, as different countries, including India, imposed travel bans. While this has been an enormous logistics exercise, it has also resulted in enormous hardships for passengers who have endured hours-long wait at Indian airports for screening, blood tests etc before going home or on an isolation routine.

“There may be many people returning from abroad who would be feeling inconvenienced. Officers and employees are putting in hours and days of work to make their safe return possible,” a government source said.

Getting back transit passengers is different from bringing back people from high risk areas. The government has also been running special flights from Iran and Italy after testing passengers for the virus.

Foreign minister S Jaishankar and foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla have been holding video conferences with Indian heads of missions in different regions. The government’s message is that Indian missions have to be more responsive to the concerns of Indian nationals stranded in different cities and airports.

The MEA has been working overtime to facilitate bringing back stranded Indians. The government has stopped all commercial flights to India from March 21.

MUMBAI: A team of 137 doctors which has been at the forefront for the last 20 days to welcome thousands of passengers arriving from Covid-19-affected countries found Sunday a bit relaxing as only two flights landed at the city airport.

This team of doctors has been dealing with passengers flying into the country, including those who could possibly be affected.

These doctors, most of them interns from the civic-run Sion, Nair and KEM hospitals, had to convince their family members and relatives who were concerned about their safety. They have been posted on duty at the airport to examine every passenger arriving at the airport.

BMC’s deputy executive health officer Dr Santosh Revankar was heading the team of doctors and 24 counsellors who deployed at the airport in three shifts.

Dr Revankar said that the relatives of the interns as well as several of his own friends and acquaintances kept calling him to enquire about the situation prevailing at the airport. “Even my family members would keep calling to ask about messages circulating on WhatsApp. I only advised them to avoid reading such messages or watching videos as these only end up creating unnecessary panic.”

The medical team had a tough time over the last week especially as some unscheduled flights also landed at the city airport, adding their workload, said Dr Revankar. He added, “But we ensured passengers that their screening would be done between within 25 seconds to ensure minimum waiting period. Sometimes, multiple flights landed one after another, thereby increasing sudden load at the screening counters.”

Although they suggested that passenge give their details so that it can be easily available with the doctor. But many labourers returning from the Middle East had a difficult time filling up forms after which airport operators asked to arrange few men for assistance.

After medical clearance, the passengers were counselled. Suspect cases were immediately shift them to Kasturba Hospital. Senior citizens were taken to Seven Hills Hospital for quarantine and the rest were recommended self-quarantine.

Revankar said, “Sometimes we didn’t get proper sleep. We were so occupied with the work, there was no fear in our mind. What guided and inspired, “’Ours is not to question why, ours is to do and die’.”

MUMBAI: Fifteen men who ran out of the quarantine facility after landing in the city from Dubai were tracked down and taken back on Sunday. The men, who hail from Punjab, had been stamped for quarantine. They left the quarantine camp, boarded a local train from Andheri and travelled to Khar when they were tracked.

The state ministry has directed concerned agencies to keep a track of all the flyers stamped with self-quarantine, and to check whether they were following instructions.

A team comprising of the Mumbai collector, civic officials and police were kept on alert after learning that 15 people had been reported missing from the quarantine facility on Sunday. Senior inspector Gajanan Kabdule said, “We received information about the suspected runaways in Khar. Our team rushed to the railway station and caught the 15 men around 12.30pm, who were then handed over to civic officials and the collector, who took them back. They were found with the quarantine stamps.”

Five students with home quarantine stamps were found in the Tarapur Atomic Power Station (TAPS) and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) housing complexes in Palghar. District administration was alerted by locals, who then warned the students. The five had returned from USA, Paris, Philippines, Netherlands and UK, approximately five days ago. Two were TAPS residents, and three BARC residents. They had not reported to the district administration after returning to Mumbai.

Taluka health officer Dr Abhijit Khandare said that when information about the students was received, a team reached their homes and explained to them why they needed to be in self-quarantine for 14 days. No police case has been filed against them, and they were warned to follow the instructions strictly. Their family members were also instructed not to report to work till their quarantine period ended. The buildings in which the five reside will be fumigated and sanitized. Those who interacted with the students were also asked to look out for symptoms. The district administration is drawing up a list of people, including students, who have arrived from outside India.

BJP corporator from Ulhasnagar, Meena Sonde, noticed a few people breaking the ‘Janata curfew’ in her area on Sunday. As a punishment, she made them do sit-ups. Sonde said she was at home when through CCTV cameras installed in her area, she saw people roaming around in the slum area without any reason. She went there and punished them, and told them to stay inside.

Talking to TOI, Sonde said, “As public representatives it is our social responsibility to help the administration.” Sonde’s punishment video went viral on social media, and several people were seen appreciating her actions. Some also criticized her, stating that she should not take the law into her own hands.

The MRA Marg police on Sunday morning checked on 23 people who had arrived from Dubai recently and were staying at a guest house on Modi Street in Fort. The police said they had not been detected with coronavirus, and they were asked to remain in home quarantine for 14 days. A police team will keep a tab on them.

On Saturday, three people with home quarantine stamps were found roaming in Sahar Village. They had returned from Dubai recently. “Locals who noticed them alerted the cops. All of them were asked to complete the two weeks of self-quarantine, and warned that if they did not do so, forced quarantine action would be taken against them,” said an officer from the Sahar police station.

City police spokesperson, deputy police commissioner Pranay Ashok said that the BMC was maintaining a list of all incoming flyers at the Mumbai airport. “We are providing support to the BMC, who has asked us to keep a regular check on incoming flyers. The flyers database is used by police personnel to check whether quarantine instructions are being followed,” said Ashok. Those not following the instructions will be sent to forced quarantine.

On Sunday around 12.40pm, a flight carrying 240 passengers from Europe landed in Mumbai. All the flyers were screened. Another set of 212 passengers from the Gulf were to land at 7.45pm on Sunday.

370,['23/03/2020'],Court without lawyers today: Virus sends SC on virtual path,"NEW DELHI: Covid-19 appears to have injected some impetus for innovation in the highly traditional Supreme Court , which on Monday will experiment conducting hearing without the presence of lawyers by using video-conferencing facility in what is known in information technology circles as a ‘virtual court’.The virtual court will be functional in the largest courtroom, the CJI’s courtroom or court room No1, for two cases. On the bench will be CJI SA Bobde and Justice DY Chandrachud with video monitors on their table to hear arguments from lawyers without the advocates or litigants being present inside the courtroom.While the judges will sit on the dais in the courtroom on the first floor of the SC building, the lawyers will be facing cameras in the old court masters’ room nearly 100 metres away on the same floor. They too will have monitors before them to watch and listen to the judges. Three cases are listed before the bench of CJI Bobde and Justice Chandrachud on Monday. The causelist of the SC for Monday says, “The advocates (for litigants in the cases listed for hearing) are requested to address the court from monitoring room No FW-56 (old court master wing).”Apart from the virtual court, there will be three regular benches which will take up 19 matters for hearing and deliver two judgments, a far cry from the routine when there would be 15-16 benches taking up about 800 cases on Mondays.Among the important cases listed for hearing are the sum motu proceedings drawn up by the SC to protect prisoners from Covid-19, for which it had sought action plans from every state’s chief secretary, the home secretary and the DGP (Prisons) on preparations and steps to set up isolation wards within jails and other medical help an inmate would require if he/she was detected with symptoms of Covid-19.In addition, Justice Surya Kant will take up seven cases to ascertain their status and decide whether they required urgent listing. However, there is a clear direction that no lawyer has to be present before Justice Kant for this purpose. On the virtual court, a senior SC official told TOI, “The CJI and Justice Chandrachud decided to start the process on an experimental basis. We are planning to provide feed of the proceedings at the press lounge for journalists to access proceedings. A studio has been set up where lawyers, without being in each other’s proximity, will address judges in the courtroom. The judges and lawyers can see and hear each other through a screen put before each person participating in the proceedings. Three cases are listed on a trial basis.”A full court meeting of all 33 judges of the SC is also scheduled for Monday to review situation.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74765839,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-201394,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/court-without-lawyers-today-virus-sends-sc-on-virtual-path/articleshow/74765840.cms

MUMBAI: A 63-year-old south Mumbai resident, with no apparent history of international travel, succumbed to Covid-19 early on Sunday, taking the count of coronavirus fatalities in the city as well as the state to two. State officials said that the man, a diamond merchant, had travelled to Surat in Gujarat about a fortnight ago, but didn't label it as a case of community transmission. The death has pushed the country’s toll to five. In all cases, the deceased had an underlying ailment such as hypertension, diabetes and heart disease in a few.

The Walkeshwar resident’s 64-year-old wife too has tested positive for the infection and is currently admitted to H N Reliance Foundation Hospital at Charni Road in a dedicated isolation facility. At least eight high-risk contacts from the family have been referred to Kasturba Hospital, Chinchpokli, for testing, while another eight of his low risk-contacts have been placed under home quarantine. TOI has learnt that a private physician, who had seen the man on March 14 after he developed fever, has been counted among the low-risk contacts and placed under quarantine.

State epidemiologist Dr Pradeep Awate said that the senior citizen had a history of ischemic heart disease, blood pressure and hypertension. He had undergone an angioplasty about 12 years ago. The man developed fever and chills on March 13 and went to see a private physician on the next day. On March 17, his condition worsened after he developed dry cough and breathing difficulty. Two days later, he was admitted to H N Reliance Hospital where civic sources said that he needed ventilator support within hours of admission. Here, doctors suspected that it could be a case of coronavirus and sent his swab for testing, which tested positive. Civic officials said that the man developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) early on Sunday that led to his death. The first Covid-19 casualty from the city, too, was also a 63-year-old man, who had a travel history to Dubai.

Civic officials said that the hospital was informed about the protocol to be followed for cremation, which includes placing the body in a leak-proof plastic body bag, decontaminating the exterior of the bag, among others. A BMC ambulance was summoned to ferry the body to the nearby Chandawadi electric crematorium where the last rites were carried out in the presence of a few family members in the wee hours of Sunday. “The family was extremely cooperative. They informed their relatives but asked them not to gather for the funeral,” a civic official said, adding that civic volunteers facilitated the cremation. It was unclear if his wife was informed of the death. While civic officials remained tight-lipped about where the individual may have contracted the infection, they are investigating his meeting with a relative who had travelled from Berlin and flown back.

The death also triggered a massive community exercise to sanitize the area while quelling the fears of an outbreak in the neighbourhood. The civic officials said the neighbourhood has been divided into containment and buffer areas. “Buildings within the containment area have been put under strict watch. We are asking every resident about their travel history and those with symptoms are asked to visit the Kasturba Hospital,” said an official. While buildings in the buffer area are given information and awareness. “Every case causes a panic, so anxiety following a death is understandable. We go to buildings and tell them the dos and don'ts. A good part of our time is devoted in counselling,” a civic official said.

Importantly, the Bengal government has specified that “e-commerce of groceries and food items and home delivery of food” will be exempted, too. This exempted list will include petrol pumps, LPG, oil agencies, their god-owns and transportation. The order imposes no restrictions on vehicles carrying food and essential supplies.The Centre, earlier in the day, gave states a free hand to decide on such lockdowns till March 31 in 75 zones nationwide which have reported Covid-19 cases, in some cases even dea-ths. The state subsequently went a step ahead and decided to lock down Kolkata and all municipal towns in Bengal as a pre-emptive step to contain any further spread of the contagion. Bengal has witnessed a large influx of international and domestic travellers through air, road and rail routes, desperate to return home before travel restrictions set in.Three fresh Covid-19 cases were reported on Sunday. A 38-year-old who died in AIIMS, Patna and travelled from Kolkata two days back tested positive , prompting the Bengal government to seek his travel and stay details.In the order issued by state chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, the provisions of the “Safety Restrictions” under the West Bengal Epidemic Disease, Covid-19 Regulations, 2020, no more than seven persons can gather at any place. The order bars all public transport services, including taxis and auto-rickshaws, from plying in notified zones (see box), but allows vehicles meant to ferry people to hospitals, airports, railway stations and bus terminals. The order makes it clear that all shops, commercial establishments, offices, factories and workshops had to be closed.The state has made it clear that all foreign returnees are to strictly abide by home quarantine. The timelines for the home quarantine rules will be decided by health personnel. The order asks people to stay at home and step out only for emergencies while maintaining social distancing norms. Violation of rules can lead to penal prosecution and a six-month prison term, sources said. Till Sunday, 22,043 people are in home isolation in Bengal, while 630 people have completed their home quarantine period.The rules were issued after Sinha, the state chief secretary, discussed the Centre’s inputs with chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Earlier in the day, Sinha had attended a meeting with the Union cabinet secretary and Prime Minister’s principal secretary on Covid-19 preparedness and measures. It was decided in this meeting that all railway, Metro and inter-state passenger services would be suspended till May 31. The chief minister, sources said, stressed that an immediately precautionary lockdown was a key step to contain the disease spread as Bengal steps into critical weeks.The state transport department on Sunday also ordered the suspension of trucks carrying non-essential cargo items from midnight of March 22 till March 31. “No such non-essential items carried in National Permit-holding goods carriages such as trucks and trailers shall be allowed to enter the state from outside with effect from 12 midnight of March 22 till March 31,” read the letter issued by the transport department.In Kolkata, police said they have identified specific check points. “We have begun conveying our decision to auto, bus and taxi owners.

PATNA: The state government has declared lockdown in urban areas of Bihar with immediate effect till March 31 after the first Covid-19 death and two more positive cases in Patna hospitals on Sunday.

The lockdown decision was taken at a meeting chaired by CM Nitish Kumar. According to a public order issued by principal secretary (health) Sanjay Kumar, the lockdown would remain effective in the headquarters of all 38 districts, 101 sub-divisional towns and 534 blocks and urban and semi-urban areas which have urban local bodies (ULBs) like municipal corporation, nagar parishad and nagar panchayat.

Essential services like medical and telecom sectors, banking and ATM, dairy and dairy-related institutions, foodgrains and general, vegetables and fruit shops, medical and surgical item shops, petrol pumps and CNG stations, LPG gas agencies, post offices and courier services, e-commerce services, electronic and print media have been exempted.

Vehicles being used for the exempted services and those of government would not come under the purview of the lockdown. “The lockdown order was issued keeping in mind the protection of common people in Bihar in the wake of increasing infection of coronavirus,” Nitish said.

Meanwhile, the man who died of coronavirus at AIIMS-Patna on Saturday night was identified as Saif Ali (38) from Munger. He had come from Qatar recently. He was admitted there on March 20, but his test report came on Sunday. Two more positive cases were reported from AIIMS-Patna and Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH).

Principal secretary (health) said the 25-year-old Patna resident admitted to NMCH isolation ward had recently returned from Scotland while the son of the 45-year-old woman from Aneesabad area in Patna and admitted to the AIIMS-Patna had come from Italy a weeks ago.

State chief secretary Deepak Kumar said RMRI, which comes under Indian Council of Medical Research, confirmed two positive cases.

AIIMS-P director Dr PK Singh said Saif was admitted with chronic kidney problem on March 20 and was put on ventilator. He also had symptoms of coronavirus and his swab sample was sent to RMRI for test. Incidentally, his body was handed over to his relatives on Saturday for burial and they took it on a private ambulance to Munger.

Before being referred to AIIMS-P, Saif was admitted to the PMCH emergency on March 19. Sources said now the entire PMCH emergency ward was being disinfected and all those who had come in his contact will be quarantined.

Munger civil surgeon said Saif was a resident of Charambha under Sadar block and had probably come from Qatar on Mach 13.

Munger district magistrate Rajesh Meena said the deceased was buried on Sunday evening following the government’s guidelines. “We will now trace all those who had come in his contact,” said Meena. He added that Saif had landed in Patna and came to Munger by road.

The chief secretary said the government will prepare a plan as to how to trace all those who had come in contact of the Covid-19 positive people.

The CM made a fervent appeal to all residents in Bihar to extend their full cooperation to the state government’s ongoing drive against the deadly coronavirus. “Whenever a major crisis came, we registered a victory over it with the cooperation of all people. The state government is with its people in this hour of crisis,” he said.

Nitish said the entire human race is under the crisis due to coronavirus. “We are fighting against this epidemic with our all strength. Necessary precautions are also being taken, but it is necessary that all people remain alert in the wake of gravity of this epidemic. Maintaining social distancing is best solution for this disease,” he said and urged people to stay at home and not move unnecessarily.

Meanwhile, another death has been reported from the isolation ward of NMCH on Saturday night. However, NMCH principal said the lab report of the deceased had not come yet. The deceased had come from Jaipur.

Six of Kolkata’s Covid-19 patients are admitted at the Beliaghata hospital, while one is under treatment at AMRI Hospital, Salt Lake.According to state health department sources, samples of the three were tested after they felt uneasy. On testing positive, they were immediately shifted to the hospital. Nine other members of the family remain quarantined at the New Town facility.An atmosphere of fear had enveloped the youth’s Ballygunge neighbourhood, as he had apparently been moving about in the area since he arrived from the UK on March 13. His father, who owns a sanitary hardware store in south Kolk-ata that was sealed on Friday, continued to visit his shop, along with other family members, sources said. Alarmed neighbours even lodged a complaint against them at Kalighat police station after the youth tested positive.MMiC Debashish Kumar, who is a neighbour and the local councillor, said several other families will be screened, since the domestic help also worked at those homes.Meanwhile, concerns that the 57-year-old Covid-19 patient — the fourth to test positive in Kolkata, on Saturday — had been infected locally persisted, as the man’s travel history revealed that he had been to Chhattisgarh on a trip with his wife last week, within days of meeting his son, who visited him from the US.While unconfirmed sources claimed that the 57-year-old patient’s son had visited his Dum Dum residence, local councillor Keya Das said this was unverified. Even as the man’s condition remained critical at AMRI Hospital, Salt Lake, concerns have been raised about the health of frontline medical staff at the hospital who treated him before detection and continue to be in service. Seven from the Dum Dum neighbourhood, where the man lives, have been quarantined, including his wife.The Covid-19 patient had returned from Bilaspur in Chattisgarh on March 13 and apparently visited a mall in north Kolkata on March 8, according to neighbours. Neither he nor his wife showed any symptoms till he felt unwell on March 14 and took a rickshaw to a nursing home in Nagerbazar, where he got a blood test done. His condition continued to worsen eventually, leading to his AMRI admission on March 16.The possibility of the patient meeting his US-returned son has not been ruled out, said Gopa Pandey, chairperson-in-council (health), South Dum Dum Municipality . “We have come to know that the youngster had stayed at another flat on Jessore Road, owned by his father,” she said.Since he had not been detected at the time of his admission to AMRI Hospitals on March 16, doctors and nurses who treated him need to be quarantined immediately, felt experts. While hospital authorities maintained that the medical staff, including the treating doctor, were under regular screening, they continued to be on duty. Several senior medics felt it could be risky unless they had been wearing personal protective equipment like masks and gloves, which appear unlikely.“They could be allowed to work only if they wore an N95 mask, cap, gloves and a gown while attending to him. It is unlikely, which makes it mandatory for them to be sent on quarantine,” said a doctor at the hospital.Belle Vue Clinic consultant and infectious diseases expert Rahul Jain said it could be risky, since a hospital has patients with compromised immunity. Other than the doctors and nurses, patients, too, are vulnerable. They should be isolated now,” Jain said.An AMRI statement claimed that the hospital had taken “proper protective measures for its doctors and frontline healthcare workers who were dealing with the patient”. A hospital source added that they had no symptoms yet and were “not on shift duty on Sunday”, but were attending to their duties.Virologist Amitabha Nandy said the chances of the man contracting the virus during his travel to Chhattisgarh couldn’t be ruled out. “Since the number of patients is on the rise, the possibility of a transmission during the journey is high. The chances of his getting the virus from his son, in case he had met him, are equally high,” Nandy said.Neighbours of the Covid-19 patient at South Dum Dum were also worried about the fact that the latter’s domestic help had continued to work at the house till he was found positive. She had attended other households as well and she might have infected others, too, they feared. “The area is a congested one and transmission can’t be ruled out. His wife on Sunday agreed to go for a test at the Beliaghata ID Hospital. We are looking for the rickshaw puller, while the man who conducted blood tests and the maid have been quarantined,” said Das.The Covid-19 patient owns another flat on Jessore Road near Nagerbazar and his neighbours at the apartment building are scared. “I have heard about a case in Dum Dum, but I did not know that the man had a flat in our apartment. Although he did not come frequently here, we are not sure if he had come to this building.

Mathematical modelling is being done and we will get some impressions by Tuesday.”In Surat, a 69-year-old became the first casualty of Covid-19 in Gujarat. He had no foreign travel history but had visited virus-hit Delhi and Jaipur. The state recorded se ven new positive cases — three of them above 60 years. Earlier in the day, a 63-year-old diamond merchant in Mumbai, who had no immediate history of international travel, succumbed to the disease.Maharashtra is the worst affected state with 74 cases and two deaths so far, followed by Kerala (67 cases) and Delhi (30 cases and 1 death). Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry, said states have been asked to do their own risk assessment too and identify areas to be locked down. “This virus is very strong and its transmission rate is very high,” Aggarwal said, emphasising again that lockdown is needed to break the chain of transmission.Officials also indicated that the rise in cases is a result of many Indians coming back from affected countries like the US and UK in the last few weeks. A 39-year-old Jodhpur re sident, who travelled by a train from Delhi to Jaipur, has tested positive in Rajasthan, taking the state’s total to 26. The person had recently travelled to Turkey, from where he returned on March 18. Punjab reported seven new cases including four members from the family of Baldev Singh, a Covid-19 positive patient who died on March 18, his two cotravellers to Germany and Italy and sarpanch of his village Pathlawa in Nawanshahr district. His co-traveller Sant Gurbachan Sigh had also stayed at Anandpur Sahib during the Holla Mohalla celebrations. He and third co-traveller Daljinder Singh freely moved among people.“In 80% of cases, the disease is mild. Some don’t even know they have got it. In 20% of cases, Covid-19 causes fever and cough and about 5% require hospitalisation,” said ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava.He added that supportive treatment remains the mainstay of care of severely ill patients. “Some combinations of drugs have be en tried but there is no magical pill for its cure. Deaths are still taking place in Italy, the US and UK where the health infrastructure is much better,” the ICMR DG explained. The Centre has asked all states to identify hospitals for acute management of those suffering from Covid-19.“The 800-bed National Cancer Institute in Jhajjar, Haryana, is going to be one such centre,” said Aggarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry. On the availability of ventilators, the officer said 1200 of these machines have been ordered.In good news, a four-anda-half-year-old girl, who was suspected to be the first positive case in Assam , was found negative following tests at the Regional Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory in Dibrugarh",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74765879,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-255771,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-crucial-results-tomorrow-says-icmr/articleshow/74765874.cms
381,['23/03/2020'],Indian test kits may be non-starter,"The guidelines issued on Saturday by the health ministry for Covid-19 testing in private laboratories has left Indian manufacturers of test kits bewildered as they stipulate that only USFDA or European CE certified kits can be used by the labs. Going by this stipulation, none of the Indian test kits currently being validated by the National Virology Institute (NIV) in Pune can be used.

W ith export of kits shut down by most countries and a global shortage of testing kits, it was expected that once Indian companies got their test kits validated by the NIV, they could get manufacturing licences from the drug controller general of India (DCGI) and start supplying the kits.

""W here will labs get FDA- or CE-approved kits overnight when most countries are not allowing exports? This would mean that even Chinese and South Korean kits, if imported, cannot be used,"" said a lab owner.

T he testing guidelines for private labs laid down by ICMR and put out by the health ministry stated that ""commercial kits for real time PCR based diagnosis of Covid-19 should be USFDA-approved or European CE-certified or both for in-vitro diagnosis of Covid-19 under emergency use"". The DCGI's office confirmed that only kits with USFDA or CE would be allowed for sale in India. "" Why did DCGI issue test licences to Indian companies so that they can get their test kits validated, if they were going to allow only USFDA-approved or CE-certified tests? It's a totally crazy move. Why is NIV working to validate the tests if they cannot be sold in India?"" asked the owner of one of the companies trying to get its test kits validated. TOI has learnt that NIV has finished validating the test kits submitted to it and handed over the results to ICMR .

C urrently, there seems to be only one Indian manufacturer with USFDA approval, Cosara diagnostics, an Ahmedabad-based company, which has a tie up with a US firm. ""One firm will not be able to meet the demands of all private sector labs. This will make it very difficult to expand testing facilities,"" said an Indian test kit manufacturer .

""W e are writing to the government against these guidelines. A lot of effort and R&D has gone into developing these kits in record time and our companies must be given a chance to prove the quality and reliability of their test kits,"" Veena Kohli of the Association of Diagnostic Manufacturers of India said.

""It is disheartening that the health ministry endorses overseas regulatory approvals as a means of qualification while keeping out Indian manufacturers instead of respecting India's own regulatory processes,"" said Rajv Nath of AiMed.

MUMBAI: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Sunday gave its nod to four private laboratories from Mumbai, including Thyrocare, Suburban Diagnostics, Metropolis Healthcare Ltd Mumbai and H N Reliance Foundation Hospital, to start testing for coronavirus. The four laboratories are likely to start the tests over the next two to three days.

It is said another 16 private laboratories are awaiting the ICMR’s nod to start conducting tests.

Currently, only Kasturba Hospital and KEM Hospital are carrying out the tests, which are being offered for free. The state soon plans to scale up and add more machines to the testing facilities of these hospitals.

In addition, labs are being readied at JJ Hospital in Byculla and Haffkine Institute in Parel to start testing.

A BMC official said that at least 20 laboratories had applied to the ICMR to start testing coronavirus samples. Of these, four have got the approval, while the applications of the rest, including that from leading hospitals like PD Hinduja, are being considered. The ICMR has capped the testing charges at Rs 4,500 for now and has asked them to focus more on testing asymptomatic patients. It has also modified the testing criteria to add healthcare workers and serious patients admitted with respiratory ailments even if they don’t have a travel history.

GURUGRAM: Just as the ‘janata curfew’ ended at 9pm on Sunday, a lockdown kicked in across Gurugram to contain the spread of Covid-19. Gurugram is among seven districts in Haryana — the others being Faridabad, Sonipat, Rohtak, Jhajjar, Panipat and Panchkula — and 75 across India where a lockdown has been announced.From 9pm on March 22 to midnight on March 31, public transport has been shut down, gatherings of more than five banned and shops that don’t provide essential services closed. Essential services – amenities, food production and delivery, health and medicine, communication, government offices, banking, supply chain and manufacturing of essential items – will not be shut down. “We have a list of exemptions in place to ensure residents are not inconvenienced. Our teams will conduct regular checks to see essential commodities are available to all residents,” said deputy commissioner Amit Khatri.In its order, the state health and family welfare department said the presence of two international airports – the IGI Airport in Delhi and Chandigarh International Airport – and the 6,600 people being monitored in the state made it “imperative to adopt strict social distancing and isolation measures”. Most of those who have are back after travelling abroad are from the seven districts it has placed under lockdown, the order added.The decision was taken at a meeting of the principal secretary to the Prime Minister with the chief secretaries of all states.Public transport shutRailways have been shut down country-wide and metro services stopped (both in Delhi and Gurugram). Later in the day, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar declared a blanket ban on all public transport – autos, cabs, e-rickshaws and buses. “Anybody found violating this will be punishable under Section 188 of the IPC (disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant),” said Haryana transport minister Moolchand Sharma.Those returning to Gurugram after taking a flight will be screened at the airport and asked to self-quarantine. “There will be separate arrangements to get them back home, which the airport authority will decide on. Only transportation of essentials like food, groceries and pharmaceuticals will be allowed,” Sharma added.Health experts welcomed the move, saying the chances of the virus spreading are at least six times higher on public transport than in malls and markets. “Metros and local trains are packed in peak hours, with people standing very close to each other. This is very risky,” said a doctor from the state health department.No disruption in food and grocery supplyThe district administration said that while fear of an impending lockdown had led to panic buying, all commodities will be in supply. “Our teams will check that essential commodities are not overpriced anywhere during the lockdown. They will also check hoarding and black market sale of goods. On Friday, residents had started stocking up on things but we are trying to generate awareness. All essential commodities will be available during the lockdown,” said Faridabad deputy commissioner Yashpal Yadav.Food delivery, likewise, will continue. While restaurants have been shut, delivery services have not. “We will continue to operate with curtailed partner network (restaurants and delivery) for those in need of food delivery,” a Zomato spokesperson said. Swiggy, too, said it would continue operations. “We urge all customers to only order in if they must. As an essential service, Swiggy will try and remain operational across most cities for customers in need. The entire revenue generated by Swiggy during this period will be used for the welfare of delivery partners,” a Swiggy spokesperson said.On Sunday, right after the ‘janata curfew’, Gurugram had ample food delivery options. When TOI checked a food delivery app between 9pm and 10pm, 55 restaurants were delivering in Udyog Vihar, 37 in Sector 29 and 22 in Kendriya Vihar. Options in its NCR counterpart in Uttar Pradesh, Noida, were limited – two restaurants in the commercial hub of Sector 18, and none in Sector 16 and Sector 76.",gurgaon,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74768878,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-125775,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-shuts-down-till-march-31-in-bid-to-stop-coronavirus-march/articleshow/74765315.cms

391,['23/03/2020'],"'Globally, 40% lack basic hand-washing facilities at home'","NEW DELHI:Hand hygiene, using clean water and soap, is key to fighting coronavirus but 3 billion people in the world — 40% of the global population — live without basic hand-washing facilities at home.Flagging this fact, noted by multiple UN bodies, on World Water Day, experts on Sunday said the poor across the globe were among the most vulnerable in the face of spread of Covid-19.Reports of WHO and Unicef noted that 1.6 billion people out of the 3 billion deprived ones had limited facilities lacking soap or water while the remaining 1.4 billion had no facility at all — an indication of how the health risk due to coronavirus could be far bigger if the spread is not contained.Referring it as a “global hygiene crisis”, the UN in its factsheet said that one out of six healthcare facilities globally had no hygiene service, meaning they lacked hand hygiene facilities at points of care, as well as soap and water in toilets. “One in 10 patients get an avoidable infection while receiving care,” it said.This is a major concern in most low- and middle-income countries in Africa , Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia , including India. The UN reports said nearly three-quarters of the population of least developed countries lacked hand-washing facilities with soap and water.“Providing access to clean water is the biggest preventive health measure we can take — and this is why, on World Water Day 2020, we must make this connection. For all our sakes,” said Sunita Narain, environmentalist and director general of Centre for Science and Environment.Going by WHO’s prescribed standards where a person takes 30-40 seconds for one proper hand-wash to get germ-free hands, the New Delhi-based think-tank calculated that if each person in these days of Covid-19 needed to wash hands at least 10 times a day, a family of five would need a minimum 100 litres (2 litres per person with the tap closed while scrubbing and rinsing) every day just for hand-washing (assuming that one does not leave the tap running when one rubs hands with soap).Noting the critical water situation in India, Himanshu Thakkar, water expert and and coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), said an estimated 59% of urban houses and 78% of rural houses in the country did not have access to clean water at home even for drinking.He said, “The situation is not improving rapidly as groundwater, India's main source of water, is over exploited and depleting in levels and deteriorating in quality. Moreover, the mismanagement is getting compounded under the climate change, which is the theme of the World Water Day 2020.”Narain pointed at another concern, flagging how the increased use of water will naturally lead to generation of more wastewater.“Keeping in mind the fact that 85-90% of all water used in a household gets discharged as wastewater, the more water we use, the more sewage we discharge. This, when we know that the bulk of wastewater is not intercepted, nor treated or cleaned. This means that we are adding to the pollution challenge of our waterbodies. It will mean higher cost to clean this water for drinking and it will mean more dirty water, which in turn, means more bad health,” she said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/globally-40-lack-basic-hand-washing-facilities-at-home/articleshow/74765952.cms

The CM announced immediate release of Rs 2,417 crore including Rs 1,103 crore for rice distribution and Rs 1,314 crore towards cash distribution. This would be done in next three to five days and the modalities would be spelt out in a detailed government order.Earlier, in the meeting with all chief secretaries held on Sunday, the Centre has requested the respective state governments to ensure that essential services such as hospitals, telecom, medicine shops, milk supplies, provision stores, etc will remain open.

Even this one person must maintain a distance of 3 feet from others,” he told reporters. The CM said that the media will be exempted from the lockdown. He also said that the evaluation of exam papers has been suspended along with all education activity.“It is essential that we take all care and introduce measures to ensure that the virus does not spread in the state. Hence, the state government has taken this decision to lock down the state up to March 31 under the Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 and a notification has already been issued,” KCR said.He said with the suspension of all international flights and none entering the country from the sea route, the threat of importing the infection had been minimised, but there was need to contain the spread.“No vehicles including public and private transport buses and also private vehicles, including cars, autos, will be allowed into the state.

HYDERABAD: The ‘janata curfew’, which was extended from 12 hours as announced by PM Narendra Modi to 24 hours in Telangana by CM K Chandrasekhar Rao, was near total in the state.

Except stray incidents of people coming out for emergencies, almost all people in urban, rural and tribal areas remained indoors, prompting the CM to thank citizens for honouring his appeal. “I bow before the people for honouring my appeal to stay indoors to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus which is threatening entire humanity,” KCR said.

All the roads, markets in Greater Hyderabad and districts wore a deserted look from morning except for those involved in essential services such as milk vendors, policemen and newspaper boys stepping out.

KCR: Maintain this self- discipline

There was no movement of vehicles on both national and state highways too. Public transport including TSRTC, metro, taxicabs and autos did not operate. Those who were not aware about cancellation of bus services were seen waiting at bus stands.Huge police deployment was seen in places such as bus stations, markets and business areas.

KCR said Mumbai and Telangana were termed as number one in terms of making ‘janata curfew’ a total success. “Continue to maintain this self-discipline and remain in your residences. If possible plant a sapling within your residential premises or complete whatever work you have by being at home up till March 31. This way we will be able to prevent virus spread. We should not become another Italy,” he said.

Earlier, Union home minister Amit Shah congratulated KCR for the successful of conduct of ‘janata curfew’ and said that Telangana was as a role model in this regard for other states.

The teaching staff later consulted others and finally the best sample was picked. Staff and faculty members who came to the college to register their attendance on March 21 tried the sanitiser.Saldanha said there are non-teaching staff and Group D employees in the institution who draw meagre salaries. “They cannot buy hand sanitisers from medical stores by paying Rs 50 or Rs 100. Therefore we decided to prepare it in-house and distribute it to staff and students free of cost. If the situation demands, we will also provide it to the general public,” he added.Initially, the staff and students prepared two litres of the solution, which was developed mixing about 60%-70% ethanol and distilled water, along with a chemical substance.The college had decided to distribute the sanitiser solution to all students and staff from Monday, but with the government declaring holidays for educational institutions and most staffers working from home, only those who visited the college were given the sanitiser.Principal T Ruth Shantha Kumari said they are ready to extend help to others too in this fight against Covid-19",mysuru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74783224,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-83467,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/st-philomenas-college-prepares-sanitiser-for-staff-and-students/articleshow/74783214.cms

A day earlier, inmates went on the rampage, set fire to jail property, fought pitched battles with police and attempted to scale over the walls, leading cops to open fire in which one prisoner was killed; at least 28 prisoners, jail employees and cops were injured on Saturday.Police on Sunday morning recovered two firearms and hammers in cells. “It seems to be a pre-planned attack or how could they have access to weapons on the premises,” said state correctional home minister Ujjwal Biswas . CID has started a probe into the incident.On Saturday, trouble broke out a little after 4pm, when the inmates were being sent back to their cells from the premises. Even as the new ADG (correctional services) Piyush Pandey tried to reason with them, the inmates reportedly launched a destruction frenzy, with one group setting a gas cylinder on fire. Before the situation could spiral out of control, police chased the group inside the cells. Another section of inmates reached the women’s ward, where the woman guards stopped them. But the male prisoners allegedly manhandled the women guards. Reinforcement of police and para-military forces ook nearly two hours to bring the situation under control.The reasons for the trouble were the same as that on Saturday: most prisoners and undertrials were upset with the fact that the prison authorities on Friday suspended their weekly interviews with their family members till March 31 to minimise the spread of the novel coronavirus . Another section of inmates demanded parole, as the government had proposed a 15-day “break” to around lifers, reportedly to decongest the correctional home.“We have identified those who have been creating trouble and provoking others. They apparently even threatened some male inmates, who had refused to join in the agitation on Saturday. To garner more support, the trouble-makers on Sunday tried to intimidate the female inmates into joining the agitation,” Biswas said.A CID team that reached the correctional home on Sunday is looking at the possibility of a lacunae in assessing and controlling a supposed emnity between the undertrials and convicts.

The number is expected to dip further as the Indian government’s decision to suspend international flight operations for a week will come into effect at midnight on Sunday.

“About 100 international flights that are currently being operated will go off the radar from Monday. But if the curfew lifts, the number of domestic flights might go up a bit. On an average, Mumbai airport used to handle about 950 arrivals and departures a day and now it is down to 550 to 600 flights,” said a senior Mumbai air traffic controller.

A source at the airport said that a staff strengh of 45,000 operates at the airport on a normal day. “This number includes those from duty free shops at terminal 2. The number of staff working in the terminal buildings has been going down steadily as airlines have been cancelling flights and passenger loads have been low. On Sunday, due to the curfew, the manpower was further been brought down and the airport was run by a mere 2000-odd airport/airline staffers. A number of them stayed back at the airport at night as we figured they might face problems commuting to the airport when the curfew is on.""

Only a couple of food and beverage stalls are currently operational in terminal 2, largely for transit passengers.

While GoAir suspended its domestic operations for the day on account of the curfew (it suspended its international operations entirely last week), other carriers like Air India, IndiGo and SpiceJet have been operating a curtailed flight schedule. The last international arrival is expected before Sunday midnight and the last departure before the week-long closedown is currently scheduled to be operated around 4am on Monday by Ethiopian Airlines to Addis Ababa.

“There could be changes because of the volatile situation,” the airport source added. The last time the Mumbai airport handled an average of 600 flights a day was way back in 2006. Last summer, following the Jet Airways closure in mid-April, air traffic out of Mumbai had suddenly dipped for a few weeks till Jet slots were allocated to other carriers.

""Justice Gogoi could say the same on quid pro quo charge,"" I said and asked: ""Why does an accuser get so angry when he faces an accusation?"" He walked off, promising never to speak with me.

Life is like that. People endowed with sharp tongues train their ears only for sweet praise. What worries one is the selective wagging of their free speech tongues in vain pursuit of independence of judiciary. .

Justice Saiyed Fazl Ali was the first judge to retire from the Supreme Court in September 1951. He was called back from retirement under Article 128. While still a sitting judge, PM Jawaharlal Nehru offered him the Odisha governor's post. In May 1952, he accepted the offer and cut short his extended tenure. In 1954, he resigned to head the State Reorganisation Commission. After completing the task, he was made governor of Assam in May 1956. Yet, history books are silent on his possible 'quid pro quo'.

Rights activists will remember Justice V R Krishna Iyer. We are not commenting on his unparalleled acumen in stretching constitutional boundaries to benefit the poor by intelligently using the vast powers under Article 142. We are discussing quid pro quo.

Some activists made a virtue of ex-CJI Mohammed Hidayatullah becoming Vice-President nine years after retiring from the SC. They argued that a similar cooling-off period would be ideal to weed out quid pro quo.

As CJI, Justice Hidayatullah had the rare distinction of becoming acting President of India from July 20-August 24, 1969. He retired as CJI on December 16, 1970, soon after authoring the majority opinion in privy purses case. He quashed the Presidential Order abolishing privileges and privy purses of erstwhile princes. It angered the Indira Gandhi government no end.

A little later, Indira dissolved Lok Sabha and the co-untry's first mid-term elections took place. A fresh mandate saw her emerge stronger but she was still licking the privy purses wound. Her government ignored Justice Hidayatullah and offered him no post-retirement post till 1977.

Strangely, he readily agreed to become Vice-President in 1979 when Congress and other parties made him their unanimous choice for the post. But who dare criticise stalwarts like Justices Hidayatullah? Their criticism is reserved for lesser mortals.

Italian PM Giuseppe Conte went on live TV to announce that he was tightening the country's lockdown and shutting down all production facilities except those providing essential goods and services. ""We are facing the most serious crisis that the country has experienced since World War II,"" Conte told Italians during a broadcast at midnight. He cautioned citizens to be calm and patient, insisting there was ""no alternative"" than to impose further restrictions.I n the US , where several states have ordered residents to stay indoors, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the government was ""literally scouring the globe looking for medical supplies"". Health care workers from Oklahoma City to Minneapolis sought donations of protective equipment. Staff at a Detroit hospital began creating homemade face masks for workers. Cuomo also disclosed new statistics that indicated that New York State now has roughly 5% of virus cases worldwide. There are now 15,168 cases of the coronavirus in the state, up 4,812 since Saturday, and 114 deaths.Top-level negotiations between Congress and the White House teetered on Sunday on a ballooning nearly $1.4 trillion economic rescue package, as the coronavirus crisis deepened and President Donald Trump called for a deal to steady a shuttered nation. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin indicated a deal was within reach, but congressional Republican and Democratic leaders said there was no deal yet after an hour-long meeting at the otherwise empty US Capitol.Nationwide, there were 31,057 cases and 390 deaths as the US overtook Germany and Spain as the country with the third-highest number of cases. New Jersey and St. Louis were added to a growing list of areas where residents were ordered to stay home.Some 3,500 doctors and other health workers in Spain have tested positive for the coronavirus, accounting for roughly 12% of the country's roughly 28,500 cases, the Spanish health ministry said on Sunday, as authorities moved to extend countrywide emergency measures two more weeks.The army was building a field hospital with 5,500 beds in a convention center in Madrid, where hotels are also being turned into wards for virus patients without serious breathing problems.In Britain , PM Boris Johnson said the country may need to impose curfews and travel restrictions to halt the spread of the coronavirus if people do not heed the government's advice on social distancing. The government has told 1.5 million people most at risk to stay at home for 12 wee k. Iran 's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei refused US assistance on Sunday to fight the virus, citing an unfounded conspiracy theory that it could be made by America. Iran says it has 1,685 deaths and 21,638 cases of the virus - a toll that experts from the WHO say is certainly under-reported. Canada 's death toll from the outbreak jumped almost 50% fronm 13 to 19 in less than a day and PM Trudeau predicted on Sunday the crisis would last for months.

406,['23/03/2020'],Mumbai Lockdown: Poor public response pushed govt to declare lockdown in Mumbai,"Deserted Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus railway station on Sunday

MUMBAI: Hours after the Railway board decided to stop all passenger and suburban trains, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had a brief consultation with senior NCP and Congress cabinet members and it was decided to declare a complete lockdown from Sunday midnight.

A senior bureaucrat said, a week ago, there was a proposal before the state cabinet on closing down the suburban network, but a section of cabinet members expressed reservation. “It was felt that if the suburban rail network is closed, then even the essential staff may not be able to reach their work places. It was then proposed that only essential staff be allowed to board the trains. Accordingly, 135 teams were set up to implement the decision,"" he said.

The bureaucrat pointed out that despite the CM’s appeal on umpteen occasions, the public remained careless and continued to gather in large numbers, which proved to be counterproductive. “We were expecting that in view of the seriousness of the situation better sense would prevail and people would work from home. As there was no response and the Railway board decided to stop passenger and suburban trains, the CM declared a complete lockdown. In addition, Section 144 has been clamped in the entire state, too, to ensure more than five people do not gather at one place,” he said.

The biggest challenge before the government, the bureaucrat said, is to transport essential staff staying in the suburbs and beyond. “We have worked out an action plan. We will press state transport and BEST buses for the purpose. We are open to suggestions. If there is a need, we will not hesitate to amend plans for the essential staff,” he said.

In Puducherry, chief minister

With borders virtually sealed, no vehicles were allowed to enter or exit Tamil Nadu from the neighbouring states except for a few carrying essential commodities. From Mattuthavani bus stand in Madurai, one of the busiest in the state connecting southern Tamil Nadu, to Oddanchathram market in Dindigul, the largest wholesale vegetable market in the state, and the Walayar check post in Coimbatore–Kerala border, all hotspots were deserted.

There were a few meat shops open early in the morning, and some eateries open but by 9am they too were closed. Many churches in Coimbatore had called off Sunday mass and jamaaths had asked members to hold prayers at home.

“Even during bandhs, one or two shops would be open. But this is the first time everyone has closed business,’’ said P Murugan,

Elsewhere, residents who had arranged for functions and rituals had either cancelled them or turned them into low-key affairs. In rural areas, people did step out of their houses, but they were far and few.

A few residents, eager to see their city in an unusually deserted state, ventured out and were seen taking selfies in areas which otherwise would have been crowded in daylight. As the clock struck five in the evening, large number of residents came to their doorsteps and balconies to clap and clang thalis to show their gratitude to doctors, health and sanitary workers.

For the 300-odd migrant workers from Jharkhand and Odisha who landed at Coimbatore railway junction on Sunday, though, it turned out to be nightmare. The workers, most of them working in tea estates in Nilgiris and Valparai, were stuck at the station as buses were cancelled. Since hotels were shut, they were left to starve until the issue was brought to the notice of Coimbatore collector K Rajamani, who arranged for them food and got them accommodated in two community halls.

Though everyone went into the self-quarantine mode, few good samaritans stepped out of their houses criss-crossing the district to distribute food and water bottles to street dwellers and the destitute.

The company plans to begin shipping it to hospitals next week, it said.The FDA confirmed its approval in a separate statement. It said the company intends to roll out the availability of its testing by March 30.Under the current testing regime, samples must be sent to a centralized lab, where results can take days.""With new tools like point-of-care diagnostics, we are moving into a new phase of testing, where tests will be much more easily accessible to Americans who need them,"" U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said on Saturday.The United States is not even close to meeting domestic demand for coronavirus testing. Many medical experts have predicted that delayed and chaotic testing will cost lives, potentially including those of doctors and nurses.On Friday, Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was asked whether the United States can currently meet demand for tests.""We are not there yet,"" Fauci said.The diagnostic test for the virus that causes COVID-19 has been designed to operate on any of Cepheid's more than 23,000 automated GeneXpert Systems globally, the company said.The systems do not require users to have special training to perform testing, and are capable of running around the clock, Cepheid President Warren Kocmond said in the statement.The company did not give further details or say how much the test will cost.The U.S. FDA has been pushing to expand screening capacity for the virus while the World Health Organization has called for ""order and discipline"" in the market for health equipment needed to fight the outbreak.(Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall and Daniel Wallis)",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-fda-approves-first-rapid-coronavirus-test-with-45-minutes-detection-time/articleshow/74766060.cms

CHENNAI: Sitting in his chair outside an ATM in T Nagar, 35-year-old Ramasamy was glad to see a person pass by. The roads were otherwise deserted on Sunday, the day of ‘Janata curfew’ across the country.

Happy to have someone to talk to, he shared readily about his day. Ramasamy said he lived alone and hadn’t packed any food from home. “But I have the Amma Unavagam (canteen). It is just a five minute walk... I will have all three meals for the day there,” he said with a big smile.

The 400-odd Amma canteens brought a smile and soothed the hunger pangs of several urban poor in the city, who had to work for a living despite the curfew. At some Amma canteens in south Chennai, the quantity of food sold was up to 25% more than that sold on a regular day, said officials.

Staff at the Santhome High Road facility said they sold 10kg of Pongal and 500 idlis for breakfast. Usually, they sold about 1,000 idlis but only 5kg of Pongal. “The food we had prepared got over. We had more people coming in, much later than usual, and they seemed hungrier too,” an employee said.

Other Amma canteens across the city also reported an increase in sales, a senior corporation official said. Items on the lunch menu including rice dishes and chappathis sold like hot cakes, he said. “Even the workers were delighted at the patronage and cleaned up quickly after customers, eager to prepare the next batch of meals.”

Among the customers were Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) commissioner G Prakash and his officials, who had their breakfast in an Amma canteen.

The surge was expected. “We anticipated the rush, given that all other eateries would be closed. Those who stay home can manage, cook for themselves, but what about workers living alone,” an official said. Officials said they had made preparations and procured more raw material a day in advance to cater to the extra rush.

The city corporation also provided food for hundreds of stranded migrant workers at the Dr MGR Chennai Central Station on Sunday afternoon.

CHENNAI: Even as Chennaites stayed indoors to observe the janata curfew, the civic body ensured that all its regular functions continued unimpaired.

Conservancy workers went about collecting and clearing garbage from houses and localities and sweeping streets as usual. They were the only people seen on the roads. Around 19,000 conservancy workers help in keeping the city clean.

Similarly, Greater Chennai Corporation's bus route roads and interior roads division continued its work of relaying major roads and footpaths across the city. ""It is a routine work and hence it wasn't stopped,"" a senior official said. Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) had started work on relaying more than 170 bus route roads as well as more than 1,000 interior roads across the city in January.

Meanwhile, the civic body has also activated a disaster relief mechanism, similar to the way it functioned during the 2015 floods. Among the tasks is that every chief engineer and deputy commissioners become nodal officers for each zone and have to supervise proper disinfection.

Disinfectants are being sprayed using jet rodding machines procured from the Chennai Metrowater Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB), apart from using hand-held sprayers. The disinfectant is a mixture of lysol, bleaching powder and water, sprayed extensively in bus terminuses and railway stations in particular.

The civic body also fed some migrant workers stranded at Chennai Central and ferried them to relief centres across the city.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has appealed to all residents of the state to observe health safeguards, especially frequently washing hands, and to avoid leaving their homes unless there was an acute emergency.

There will be no curfew during the lockdown imposed in the state till March 31 but restrictions under Section 144 of CrPC will be imposed, which would prevent more than 10 persons from getting together in a public space at any given time. The state government has made it clear that deputy commissioners will allow all ancillary activities for each item of essential services like delivery of newspapers by hawkers.

Capt Amarinder said restrictions on public transport imposed earlier by the state government will continue till March 31 and all essential services such as water supply, sanitation and electricity shall be maintained by the government.

The chief minister assured that his government was fully prepared to face the challenge. “However, we may be required to take more measures, including imposing tougher restrictions, to save our state and people from any major harm,” he added. Amarinder also appealed to trade and businesses not only to ensure adequate supplies of essential commodities but to avoid hoarding and profiteering.

Seeking the cooperation from the people, the chief minister pointed out that a state control room had already been established for ensuring a coordinated effort amongst different departments of the state and also at all district headquarters. He said that people could reach out to the government on helpline Nos. 181 and 104.

No public transport services, including taxis and autorickshaws, will be permitted, except transport of all kinds to and from hospitals, airports, railway stations and bus stands. Specific routes to be allowed in districts shall be decided by respective deputy commissioners. All inter-state commercial passenger transport (buses) shall be closed.

The health department has made it clear that strict home quarantine for 14 days, excluding the day of arrival in India, shall be observed by all foreign returnees who landed in India on or after March 7.

CHENNAI: Demand for bubble top water cans shot up over the past two days in the city as residents sought to stock up on drinking water in a panic owing to the janta curfew. Retail shops ran low or out of stock after supplying over 20,000 extra bubble top units.

A member of the Greater Chennai Packaged Drinking Water Manufacturers Association said the sudden spike in demand started from Friday, after the Union government announced the janata curfew for Sunday.

Nearly two lakh bubble top units are supplied across the city every day. Nearly 20,000 more such cans had to be supplied due to the increased demand, said the member.

A retail shop owner in Tiruvanmiyur said the demand for hand wash liquids, disinfecting liquid and bubble top cans went up manifold in the past three days. ""Hand sanitizers and hand wash liquids are not available. Though I received stock of bubble top cans, even non-branded ones cost up to 60,"" he said. It will be a couple of days before fresh stock arrives and supply resumes as packaged drinking water units were closed on Sunday, he added.

Some packaged drinking water units in the city's outskirts and neighbouring districts were sealed after they were found to be flouting guidelines. The Madras high court had directed the state government to penalise the units and permit them to operate. The units should be regularized by issuing licence, suggested another member of the association who did not want his name revealed.

""With temperature rising steadily and hotter days ahead, demand for drinking water will go up considerably in the city and surrounding districts. So the government should take a positive decision with regard to the sealed units. Only then can bubble top demands be met,"" he added.

In front of his bike, was a container with 50-odd packets of veg biryani and veg pulao. Mask firmly in place and hands scrubbed clean, Shaikh distributed these packets one by one to the daily wage labourers living here who could not afford groceries and were affected by the lockdown. Every time he handed a lunch packet, the commerce student made sure to advise the beneficiary on the precautions that they must take in the face of coronavirus. Some thanked him, others wondered how long the virus was going to stay.Shaikh belongs to Falah-e-Aam--a charitable trust affiliated to Islamic revivalist organisation Jamaat e Islami Hind--that has decided to provide both food and corona awareness to disadvantaged sections in both Kalyan.

NEW DELHI: Production at factories is grinding to a halt as fear and precautions against coronavirus pick up pace across the country. Top companies such as Maruti Suzuki Hyundai , Samsung, Hero Moto, Ford, Honda, LG, and Havells announced factory closures till the end of this month.The categories that will be impacted by the lockdown include cars, SUVs, motorcycles, scooters, refrigerators, ACs, washing machines, and even mobile phones. The companies said that a review will be conducted around the month-end to assess whether the lockdown needs to be carried forward, or lifted progressively. Even industry bodies Siam (for auto companies) and ACMA (for parts makers) asked companies to consider “limited-period shutdowns”.The production closures come amid growing worry over the spread of the virus, and fear that the cases of infected persons may be on the rise. Also, with the Centre and many state governments putting restrictions on the use of public trans port as well as movement of non-essential cargo, the step was deemed as necessary. Maruti said the company has taken the decision upon an advisory issued by the Haryana government.Samsung also said that its factory in Noida will be shut down. LG said its Pune plant is shut till the end of the month, while the Greater Noida factory will remain closed till March 25. “With the safety and well-being of employees as top priority in view of the escalating COVID-19 situation, Hero MotoCorp has decided to halt operations at all its global manufacturing facilities — India, Colombia and Bangladesh — and the Global Parts Centre (GPC) at Neemrana with immediate effect,” the country’s largest twowheeler maker said.Officials at companies say that with retail also being shut at most of the locations, due to the closure of malls and shopping areas, there is not much of a pressure to immediately have the production facilities up and running. Sources said that operations at factories of phone companies such as Oppo and Vivo are also being reviewed in view of the escalating concerns.Anil Rai Gupta, chairman of Havells, said the company had been monitoring the situation for some time now and finally has decided to shut down its factories.

Given its vast imports, India gains $15 billion for each $10-per-barrel decline in oil price. With the price declining from the average of $65 per barrel to $30 per barrel, India gains approximately $50 billion,” said Arvind Panagariya, former NITI Aayog vice-chairman and Columbia University professor.“Even if half of this is converted into revenues via higher excise tax, the government will have enough extra revenue to finance extra spending. So, the government can and should stay within its 3.5% fiscal deficit target,” said Panagariya.Some economists expect the deficit to widen beyond the target and agreed with the view to use the gains from the crude oil price slide to help cushion the economy. The pandemic has come at a time when the economy is already in the grips of a slowdown. Sluggish revenues as a result of the slowdown will weigh heavily on any effort to stimulate the economy.“Even without the impact of Covid-19, the fiscal deficit in the current year would have been higher than what was indicated in the Budget. With the impact of the virus in terms of additional expenditure for prevention, testing and healthcare, the deficit will go up further. Thus, the scope for additional stimulus is limited,” said C Rangarajan, former RBI governor and former chairman, Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister.“At best, one can think of the additional stimulus being equal to what the government will collect as a result of additional excise duty imposed on petroleum products,” Rangarajan said.Several state governments are contemplating measures to shield people from the devastating impact of the coronavirus outbreak (see box) . “The compensation should come out of the windfall gain that the government has got from free fall of crude prices.

GURUGRAM: At 12 noon on Sunday, the only living beings seen at a Golf Course Road roundabout were a bunch of grazing cows, along with a few cops who sat nearby. As Gurugram observed a ‘ janata curfew ’ — a full lockdown in response to the Prime Minister’s call — the Millennium City turned into a ghost town that was barely recognisable, as all establishments stayed shut and vehicles kept off the usually busy roads.

Coronavirus in India live updates

“In all my years as a cop here, I haven’t seen anything like this. Even at the time of the Jat agitation, the roads weren’t empty like this,” a cop at the MG Road police post said.

For several kilometres, only police officials could be seen other than commuters who were travelling and were stuck. “I came from Orissa this morning till Delhi and managed to reach here somehow. Now, I’m not able to get home despite waiting for almost an hour,” said Ankit Kumar, a resident of Laxman Vihar .

Similarly, a family of 20 people that came from Lucknow stood at Gurugram bus from 4am till 2pm due to suspension of public transport. “We have to go to Hyatpur, but it looks like we are stuck here for now. We do not have enough money to rent a room either,” said one of the women, not wishing to be named.

Neither Haryana roadways buses nor autos and cabs plied on Sunday. An auto driver out on the roads found himself snubbed by a PCR van in Sector 15. The cops also asked the only two grocery shops open in the area to shut down and asked those looking for groceries to go home. “I went out to get milk and bread but the cop asked me to go home,” said Shweta Goyal, a resident.

At Rajiv Chowk junction, two men who had just returned from Dubai waited with their luggage.

“We reached today as it was the last day of flights. We managed to get a private cab till here. But now we need to get to Behror and are unsure when will we’ll reach,” said Islam, one of the men.

Without public transport, it was a tough commute for those employed in the delivery of essential services too. Madhu Sharma, a toll plaza operator at Kherki Dhaula said, “I live in Sector 4 and had to take a ride in a private cab till the highway. Then I waited for an hour at Rajiv Chowk. Finally, I convinced a private car to drop me by promising to waive off their toll plaza.”

She added that they haven’t been provided proper masks, gloves and sanitisers by their employer. And dealing in cash all day, they are highly exposed to the virus.

Sanitation workers were also visible on the roads. Wearing masks and gloves, most of them were out all day. “We have to work unless the government issues an order,” said an MCG contractor, requesting anonymity.

A group of men from the Gurugram Vaishya group, meanwhile, went around town distributing masks, sanitisers and gloves to cops.

“In these difficult times, we all need to come together and help each other. We are just doing our bit,” said Gaurav Agarwal, one of the group members.

5pm soundtrack

Answering the call of the prime minister to give thanks to all those in the forefront of the fight against the spread of the Coronavirus, residents across Gurugram came out of their houses or gathered in balconies to express their gratitude — and make some noise to dispel the negativity and downbeat atmosphere of the last few days.

As if on cue, at 5pm, the sound of clanging could be heard all over, as the young and the old grabbed pots and pans, or anything else they could lay their hands on, to provide a soundtrack to the Sunday evening. A boy was seen playing the drums on his high-rise balcony, but a lot of it was improvisatory.

Some chanted the Gayatri Mantra or sang the Arti, yet others turned to their speakers to play religious songs. Plenty clapped in support of the quiet endeavour of healthcare workers all over. “We wanted to salute the protectors of the nation by beating plates and ringing bells,” said Umed Singh of Sector 21, one of the many happy to take part in this communal event.

But there were voices of disapproval, who lamented that such a din would end up disturbing and even traumatising the inhabitants of the wild, on a day when both fauna and avifauna enjo-yed welcome relief from human activities. “This will have a severe impact on the birds and animals around us,” warned a message on a WhatsApp group.

The ever-bustling city on Sunday resembled a chapter straight out of an eerie, dystopian novel. Nobody on the streets, empty roads and a full stop on all public activity. By 5.45am on Sunday morning, 32-year-old Kilpauk resident Manjari K was atop the water tank on her terrace with a flask of freshly brewed ginger tea and a playlist, ready to watch the dawn break. The freelance teacher started planning this little reverie from the moment she heard the Prime Minister announce a ‘janata curfew ’ on March 22. “I’ll probably never witness deserted roads outside my house again under normal circumstances. It’s a strange, once-in-a-lifetime event I wanted to freeze in time,” she says, flashing photographs on her cellphone.Sunday’s curfew was indeed a first-of-its-kind experience for many Chennai residents.For Iniyan, an engineer at a telecom company, a halfopened shop in Saidapet became the sole source of nourishment on Sunday, as he and his friend sustained on bananas and cups of chai available at the store. While popular food ordering apps like Swiggy showed zero results for most of the day, in Nandanam , another group of bachelor boys found luck with one of the ‘meal-in-bowl’ places that remained open.On the IT corridor of OMR, families in apartment complexes shared meals with their bachelor neighbours.

431,['23/03/2020'],Proposal for desalination plants for southern Tamil Nadu put on hold,"A defunct desalination plant at Naripaiyur village in Ramanathapuram

CHENNAI: It is going to be yet another tough summer for residents of rain-deficit Ramanathapuram and Tiruchendur as the Central advisory body had denied permission for setting up desalination plants due to environmental concerns.

As the proposed site was near Gulf of Mannar National Marine Park , Union environment ministry's Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) recommended a different site to be chosen.

Tamil Nadu Water and Drainage Board (TWAD) had proposed to set up two desalination plants at Kuthiraimozhi and Alanthalai villages in the said districts.

Each of these plants was to have an output capacity of 60 MLD and cost around 1,350 crore.

EAC, while deliberating about the Kuthiraimozhi project, noted that the proposed site was only 25 metres away from a national park and choosing such an eco-sensitive zone was unacceptable.

""It was observed that fishermen are dependent on the Gulf of Mannar for their livelihood and the release of brine certainly will impact not only on fish catch but also the reefs, seaweeds, seagrass and the overall ecosystem of the area,"" EAC observed. The committee said that the proposal did not discuss how brine, considered toxic, was returned into the sea after production.

Also, no detail Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) study, explaining impact on flora, fauna and coral reefs etc, was carried out as mandated by law.

The committee further noted that the project did not have brine dispersion model result which is important to understand the fate and dispersion of the brine discharge from the desalination plant.

So TWAD deferred the proposal and advised TWAD to give up the proposal at Ramanathapuram and instead compensate by doubling the capacity at the other proposed site -- Alanthalai in Tiruchendur.

This means these rain-deficit districts will continue to suffer from water crisis this summer as well. ""The state government has been lethargic in this aspect as the district collectorate, TWAD and port authorities are blaming each other and no progress has been made despite funds being sanctioned,"" said K Navas Kani, Ramanathapuram Member of Parliament (MP).

The district needs 85 MLD but only 30 MLD is actually provided through Combined Cauvery Water Scheme and right now people are managing because of decent monsoon. The district has a population of 20 lakh, according to official data.

Though locals had proposed to revive a defunct desal plant at Naripaiyur instead of constructing a new plant, the government is reluctant because of political reasons, the MP added.

CHENNAI: The state government's move to provide special reservation for NEET qualified government school students may revive the state-run schools as it gives hope to the students to join MBBS.

Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami announced that the state government would form a committee headed by a high court retired judge to make recommendations on this regard. The special reservation would be provided within existing 69% reservation.

The number of students joining medical colleges from government schools has reduced from 34 in 2016 to 2 last year following the NEET based medical admission. Though more than 2000 students from government schools qualified in NEET only two students were able to join due to the increase in the MBBS cut-off last year.

""It is an excellent move. More students will join the government schools thereby they would flourish again. It also would help government school students to study in government medical colleges,"" said G Shanmugavel, headmaster, Government Higher Secondary School in Chennai.

He said government school students are equally talented when compared to the private school students but not able to give repeat attempts to crack the test. Last year, about 70% of students joined MBBS courses were old students. ""We have been demanding it for many years. Students' strength in government schools would be increased,"" said R C Saraswathi, headmistress of Government Girls Higher Secondary School, Ashok Nagar.

Another headmaster from a city school requested the government to relax the Class I to XII rule and asked to make it either Class I to XII or Class VI to XII. ""Many government schools do not have primary sections. So, parents are admitting their wards in neighbourhood primary schools. They mostly come to government schools only in Class VI,"" he said.

However, educationist Prince Gajendrababu called it as a populist announcement. ""The state government has failed to understand the problem. The move has to clear several hurdles,"" he said.

Good litres of water every day

Lots of fruit and vegetable intake

Keep it simple with workouts and diet

Actor Bharath politely asks us to wait for a couple of minutes before excusing himself to break a sweat, as we landed up at his gym a few days ago. Following rounds of weight training, the actor sits down with us at his workout space in Mogappair. “If I don’t gym at least for an hour every day, I feel quite sick and feverish. It has become a lifestyle for me, just like eating three meals a day. When you sweat, you feel nice and fit,” he says with a smile, wiping down beads of sweat.A common misconception about fitness is that people think they can get away with eating whatever they want as long as they work out, Bharath says. “Eighty per cent of your body made in the kitchen and 20 per cent of it is what you burn. Once they sweat for one hour, they eat whatever they want. So, when they go to the gym the next day, they sag on the same weight. They then blame the gym. You need to control your tongue to see the results.”Sivakumar, Bharath’s trainer adds that people need to fix their diet according to their body type. “The same goes for workout routines, too. Not everybody can do everything. For instance, if someone is injured during cross or weight training, they need to change their muscle pattern accordingly. The diet depends on metabolism,” notes Sivakumar, who has been training Bharath for the past 12 years.Gymming apart, the actor is absolutely big on dancing, something that his films, too, often depict. “I have been dancing all my life, which helped me in agility and flexibility. Once I started training with Shiva, I got my muscles,” he observes. However, there is this perception that dancing could cause you to lose your endurance and flexibility, he says, adding, “That is not at all true. Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff are the biggest examples of this. It is all about how you strike a balance between the two.”The actor makes it a point to dance at least thrice a week. “I have always been into western classical, which includes styles like jazz, ballet and hip-hop. Dancing and gymming are like my two eyes,” he says with a grin.Since food is what shapes a person’s fitness quotient, how does Bharath cope with cravings? This question is not really applicable to the actor, as Bharath is far away from being a foodie. “I am gifted with an attitude of not being a foodie. If you are a foodie, you need to control your cravings. That is where the frustration begins. It might look like I am lying for the interview, but I am honestly not a biryani lover (laughs). I don’t eat chocolates or ice creams.However, I do indulge in it rarely, once in three months or so.”Ask Bharath about cross-training and TRX, which have now come to the forefront of India’s fitness landscape, and he explains, “The culture of TRX, cross-training and resistance bands started in Indian gyms just about six years ago.And in the last couple of years, it has been at its peak. This can be proved by how more and more gymnasiums are now calling themselves fitness studios rather than just ‘gyms’. Endurance, agility and functional training are extremely significant today.”Portions of protein, vegetables, eggs and ragiBrown rice, spinach, veggies and chickenEggs and nutsRotis, dal, rajma and a cup of green tea before bed",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74766175,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1606778/74766175.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/dancing-gymming-are-like-my-two-eyes-says-bharath/articleshow/74766175.cms

While the Italians serenaded from their apartment balconies, closer home, it was 'curfew kutcheris', 'gana padal' and 'harikathas' on social media.Just a few days ago, opera singer Laura Baldassari sang out of her window in Milan, Italy, for a flash mob during the nationwide lockdown in a show of mass bonding to cope with the Corona emergency. Last week, in India, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi completed his 30-minute address, there was a flurry to create song scripts and a corona raga.In the run up to Sunday, the curfew kutcheris with their corona theme caught the imagination of audiences. A nationalist and an academician teamed up to jot down the lyrics and help Carnatic singers add zing to the 'corona thillana'. ""The lyrics were set to different tunes including a bhajan, vruttam, folk song and a pure desh-raag based Carnatic tune,"" said Sastra University vice-chancellor S Vaidhyasubramaniam The lyric was composed by Chennai-based literary enthusiast Rangam Balaji , daughter of former attorney general K Parasaran. Sunil Gargyan, Palghat Ramprasadh (grandson of Palghat Mani Iyer), Sivasri Skandaprasad and Sriranjani Santhanagopalan rendered the classical numbers with the theme - 'Nam Prathamar sonnathu, ithil artham ullathu..."" (What our PM said makes sense...). The lyrics focussed on prevention, social distancing, janata curfew and breaking the Covid-19 chain.Tuticorin-based Madhu, a trained classical singer, got hold of a script that went thus: 'Thottaal flu malarum, thodamalum flu paravum...(you will get flu if you are in contact; it will spread without touching too...) from the 1960s song 'Thotaal Poo Malarum...' from the film Padagotti starring MGR and Saroja. ""I sang and circulated it on our various whatsapp groups,"" said Madhu. The song is now popular among kids and elders in her community.The same day, March 14, when T M Soundarajan's song hit the corona circuit, Rashmi Shaarvi floored social media with her 'corona' English number, a takeoff from Camila Cabello 's 2018 song Havana. Others took the corona route for the Shah Rukh Khan 'Chalte Chalte' movie song Suno Na Suno Na.Soon, this inspired Tamil singers, both well-known and little known. 'Corona, Corona...' (Thillana, Thillana from Rajni starrer Muthu) and Gana padal singer Sudhakar joined in.

However, in the wake of the outbreak of Coronavirus pandemic, all those plans had to be put on hold, especially after the state government announced lockdown till March 31. Of course, it’s a lot of revenue loss, but the artistes seem to be trying to tide over the situation, using the time productively by engaging with their audience via online platforms and working on their new productions.Bhargav Ramakrishnan, a stand-up artiste from Chennai, sees this as an opportunity to gain online traction for his work. “Everyone is at home and glued to the screens. What better time to catch the attention of online viewers? So, I’ll be releasing my standup special, titled ‘Kung Fu Bonda’ online,” he states.Kanjira artiste KV Gopalakrishnan , who has gone to the US for a tour, has now decided to stay back there until April as per the initial plan and keeps himself occupied with online classes. “Concerts getting cancelled were totally unexpected. But we’ve decided to avoid travelling back to India at this time. To make the best use of the free time here, I’ve started taking Skype classes,” he shares.Arkay Ramakrishnan of Arkay Convention Centre says if the situation continues longer, he will consider live-streaming performances.“As of now, the plan is to reschedule the concerts. But we’ll think of alternatives if the situation looks bleak even beyond March. I might invite the artistes alone to the concert hall and live-stream their performances. We might have thousands of them watching if we do live streaming.”A bunch of storytellers from Multistory in Chennai has already had two live online storytelling sessions for kids. “We felt this was the best way to keep kids engaged productively while they have their inevitable screen time during the school shutdown. The challenge is on the performer to adapt to a new medium,” says Amrutash Misra from the group.The focus is on online videos, says Coimbatore-based miniature artist, M Savithru, too. “All the workshops have been cancelled. So, I am focusing on working on my online videos now. I see it as an opportunity to promote my work on a different platform.”It is important to keep in touch with the craft, feel artistes, as they try and meet for practice session. Be it individually or in small groups, they are making use of this no-shows period to prepare for their upcoming productions. Says Balakrishnan, “Our group, Theatre Nisha, isn’t a big one in terms of number of people. So, we are meeting and preparing ourselves to stage Girish Karnad’s Crossing To Talikota, by the end of April. We avoid physical contact as much as possible. Also, the space is disinfected before the rehearsal and we ensure that all of us thoroughly wash our hands. Those who are unwell are advised to stay at home. If not meeting for rehearsal, each of us individually work on our writing skills.”Rajhesh Vaidhya concurs, “Individual practice session is part of the daily routine. So, that’s not interrupted at all. Now, I’ve rescheduled my concert to June 13.”Leon James, a musician and theatre artiste, says all his workshops lined up for the next few weeks have been cancelled, but this unexpected free time is fully utilised. “I do workshops on traditional wind instruments. Even after the lockdown is lifted, I am not sure if people will be comfortable with workshops, where it requires a lot interaction. So, I’ve holed up myself, working on new music and developing fresh content for the future workshops.”And Rajhesh Vaidhya says he is also working on his new single, titled Distracted, now. “The whole world is disturbed now. Finding peace in disturbing times is what this single is about. I am planning to launch it in April.”Singer Prithvee Rajesh (of Nerkonda Paarvai’s Agalaathey fame) says, “Last week, I had a concert, which I was really looking forward to. But that got cancelled. Now, until things are back to normal, I’ve decided to work on a new song which I had written some time ago.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74766226,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1453024/74766226.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/coronalockdown-online-sessions-work-on-new-projects-keep-namma-artistes-busy/articleshow/74766226.cms
440,['23/03/2020'],Grateful to Rahman sir for Jwalamukhi: Poorvi,"If there’s an album that could be extra special for AR Rahman , it has to be that of 99 Songs , a film that he’s co-written and produced, apart from composing music for. No wonder then that Poorvi Koutish is thrilled to have sung not one, but three songs for the Isai Puyal in the multilingual. “I’ve sung Jwalamukhi in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu,” she beams. She’s also rendered Voice Without Words in English and Veere Kadh De in Hindi for the film.But this is not the first time that Poorvi has associated with Rahman. “After my stint in the music reality show Indian Idol, in 2012, I wanted to learn Broadway music. But I didn’t find any course like that in Mumbai. Much later, I found out that Rahman sir’s KM Music Conservatory taught Western Classical and even Opera, which came very close to Broadway. So, I joined the course in Chennai, and simultaneously started doing demo work here,” she reminisces, “During my last year there, in 2017-18, Rahman sir saw one of the performances I put up and appreciated me. He asked me what my plans were and I told him I wasn’t sure and was considering studying music abroad. So, he suggested that I intern at his studio and take that time to figure out what I wanted to do. While that was very sweet of him, I told him I had no experience in music production and wasn’t sure what I’d intern as. He said I could explore my options, and I am forever grateful to him for saying that, because it’s only because of him that I understood the process of making a song. I learnt everything there — from music production to video production and even editing.”So, how did Jwalamukhi happen? “Rahman sir initially called me to sing just one word in the song — Jwalamukhi. The rest of the lyrics were being written and he wanted me to sing gibberish of the composition for the lyricist to write. So, I kept singing different sets of lyrics in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu until things were finalised. But turns out, he used my voice for the final cut as well. I’m grateful to him for giving me the Tamil version as well,” she says, adding, “I think the emotions in the song are raw, and sometimes, I love the Tamil version more than the Hindi one.”Ask Poorvi if she is familiar with Tamil, given that she’s stayed in Chennai for a few years and has also sung Veriyera for Anirudh in Ajith’s Vivegam in the past, and she says with a laugh, “Well, I have to thank Anirudh for being patient with me because I was taking time to get every word right in the song. But yes, Tamil konjam theriyum, like I can speak to cab drivers and vendors. I’m still making progress in that zone.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74766255,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-583876/74766255.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/grateful-to-rahman-sir-for-jwalamukhi-poorvi/articleshow/74766255.cms

BENGALURU: A speeding car which mowed down a 39-year-old businessman crossing Ballari Road near Le Meridien last Wednesday midnight has been identified as a Mercedes Benz belonging to a Malleswaram resident. Cops zeroed in on the vehicle based on its broken right wing mirror that was found at the spot.

High Grounds traffic police seized the Benz and issued a notice to its owner, who is also a businessman. ""We have asked the owner to furnish details of the driver, who was at the wheel when the accident took place. We will nab him soon,"" they said.

According to police, Yelahanka resident and real estate businessman Krishnamurthy and his friends Prakash and Munirathnamma were returning home on Wednesday midnight when their car's tyre went flat in front Le Meridien. They called a mechanic, who took the tyre to fix the problem. Krishnamurthy and the mechanic were crossing the road when a car moving towards High Grounds from Windsor Manor junction knocked Krishnamurthy down. The driver sped away, police said.

""The right wing mirror of the car was lying at the accident spot. Krishnamurthy was rushed to hospital where he succumbed to injuries around 5.30am. Eyewitnesses told us the car which caused the accident was a white Benz, but they weren't sure about its registration number,"" a police officer said.

Police verified CCTV footage of nearby junctions. ""We were unable to find the car's registration number. But our staff took the mirror found at the spot and visited a few sales and service showrooms of Benz. Based on their information, we traced the car to Malleswaram,"" a police officer said.

CHENNAI: A day after taking down a tweet of Rajinikanth on Covid-19 for violating norms, Twitter India on Sunday addressed the actor as ‘ Thalaiva ’.

Extending his support to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s call for a ‘janata curfew’ on Sunday, Rajinikanth had uploaded a video saying the 12-14 hour break would help destroy the virus out in the open and help prevent India from getting into stage 3 of the outbreak.

Many questioned the scientific validity of his statement, and asked how remaining inside the house for 12-14 hours would help destroy the virus; some termed it fake news.

Eventually, Twitter took down the video. Twitter India tweeted in Tamil, when translated, read: Thank you for joining us in ensuring the dissemination of accurate information about Covid-19, Thalaiva.

Rajinikanth on Sunday clarified that in his speech he had mentioned that staying indoors for 12-14 hours regularly would help to break the chain. But it was misconstrued as staying indoors only on Sunday, he said.

PUNE: District collector Naval Kishor Ram on Sunday night issued prohibitory orders under section 144 (1)(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) banning the assembly of five or more people at public places and private workplaces from 5am on Monday till March 31.

The Pune police also issued similar prohibitory orders under the same section later.

“We will be very strict about the implementation of these prohibitory directives,” Ram told TOI. He said the order excludes essential services.

The orders will apply to areas coming under municipal corporations, civic councils, nagar panchayats and industrial estates across the district.

The orders put a total restriction on the plying of vehicles carrying five or more people, the movement of five or more people on the roads, their assembly at one place and idling time on the roads. There will be no bar on people going out for essential services, but they cannot go out in a group.

On Sunday, the ‘janata curfew’ across the country from 7am to 9pm was immediately followed by a curfew imposed by the police from 9pm to 5am on Monday. This was done as a measure to prevent people from stepping out in large numbers after the ‘janata curfew’ deadline.

Section 144 until March 31; essential services exempted

Joint commissioner of Pune police Ravindra Shisve referred to the 5pm citizens’ initiative of acknowledging the work done by medical staffers in addressing the crisis. He, however, said, “We saw that many people came together to clap and beat thalis. It defeated the purpose of social distancing. Hence, we decided to issue the curfew order.”

Meanwhile, the prohibitory orders issued by the district collector will ban workshops, ceremonies of all types, cultural, religious and entertainment programmes, festivals, fairs, sports, camps, training classes and meetings which do not involve essential matters.

Public buses, railway services, all private corporates, shops and services establishments, canteens, lodges, messes, shopping complexes, malls, supermarkets, clubs, sports grounds, auditoriums, museums, art houses, video parlours, online lottery centres, paan shops, beer bars, permit rooms, schools, colleges, private coaching classes and training centres will remain closed during this time, the orders stated.

There will be restricted movement of vehicles around the isolation centres and quarantine wards.

However, the prohibitory orders will not be applicable to government, semi-government, state corporations, state establishment and post office employees. Similarly, it won't apply to hospitals, pathology labs, drug and medical stores, health care equipment manufacturers, vegetable and fruit sellers, milk vendors and grocery shops, online food delivery services, student messes, college canteens, vehicles engaged for plying officials and employees engaged in emergency services, medical and nursing colleges, and the performing of last rites in case of death, the orders said.

Also excluded are RBI banking services, ATM services, insurance, online delivery services, telephone and internet services, water, electricity, petroleum, oil, power supply, media of all types, warehouses, waste management and cleanliness services and ecommerce services, among others.

Earlier, the railway ministry announced cancellation of all local trains on the Central and Western railway, while the state imposed section 144 in all urban areas, discontinued state transport and private bus services, and metro services. Only goods trains carrying essential items will be allowed to operate.

Health minister Rajesh Tope said the state government was also considering closing of state borders as the risk of the outbreak spreading to and from the neighbouring states was also high.

Announcing the imposition of section 144 in all urban areas of the state, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said, “We have shut all inter-state buses and now within the state buses too are being suspended. City bus services will only be used for emergency service staff.” He also said that government offices will work at 5% attendance, down from 25% announced earlier this week. The shutdowns have been announced till March 31, but if needed they may be extended.”

PUNE: Prices of herbs such as coriander and fenugreek, and that of leafy vegetables like spinach have increased almost 40-50% in the last two days due to soaring demand and lack f supply.

One main reason behind such a price hike can be attributed to the closure of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC)-run Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard and farmers' mandis at different parts of the city since Thursday.

The APMC officials said there were high chances of surge pricing in the coming days.""A bunch of coriander, fenugreek and spinach was sold in the range of Rs40-50 by local vendors against the APMC market rate of Rs5-6. These vendor stocked up on enough vegetables on Thursday and since all markers are closed, they are selling the items at will,"" said Dipak Dighe, a wholesale trader of the APMC market.

""In the wholesale market, the highest quality onion is priced at Rs15/kg but vendors are selling the same at Rs40/kg. A similar trend can be observed in case of tomatoes and potatoes,"" said Omkar Khatal, another trader of the APMC market.

WASHINGTON: Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has tested positive for the novel coronavirus , becoming the first case of Covid-19 -19 in the Senate and raising fears about the further transmission of the virus among Republicans at the Capitol.Paul, an eye surgeon, went into quarantine Sunday after learning his results. He said he has not had symptoms and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He said he was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person.His announcement led Utah’s two GOP senators — Mike Lee and Mitt Romney — to place themselves into quarantine, stepping away from negotiations as the Senate worked on a $1.4 trillion economic rescue package for the coronavirus crisis. At least five senators, including Paul, were in self-quarantine Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said.“The coronavirus has hit the Senate today,? said McConnell, R-Ky. “It’s not just back in our states but right here in the Senate.?Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona elected in 2018, chastised Paul on Twitter, saying his decision to return to the Capitol after he was tested — but before he learned the results — was “absolutely irresponsible.?Sinema said she has “never commented about a fellow Senator’s choices/actions. Never once.?But she added: “This, America, is absolutely irresponsible. You cannot be near other people while waiting for coronavirus test results. It endangers others & likely increases the spread of the virus.?Other senators, including Ted Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, had gone into self-quarantine while they awaited the results of a coronavirus test. Both were negative.Responding to criticism on Twitter, Paul’s office said, “We want to be clear, Senator Paul left the Senate IMMEDIATELY upon learning of his diagnosis. He had zero contact with anyone & went into quarantine. Insinuations ... that he went to the gym after learning of his results are just completely false & irresponsible!?Paul’s office did not say when he was tested. Representatives of his office could not immediately be reached for comment.President Donald Trump called Paul “a great friend” and said he’s “always there when we needed him.?Paul’s diagnosis came after two House members, Reps. Mario Diaz Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah, tested positive for the virus. Trump said the positive test results showed the virus was “hitting quite close to home. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on.?Paul and other lawmakers “are going to be fine,? Trump said. ”I hope they’ll be fine.?Paul, a deficit hawk, was among eight Senate Republicans who voted against a House-passed bill last week that provided more than $100 billion to boost testing for the coronavirus and guarantee paid sick leave for millions of workers. He also was the only Republican senator who opposed an earlier bill authorizing $8.3 billion for the initial response to the coronavirus.The senator was on Capitol Hill this past week, including at a luncheon Friday among GOP senators. He spoke on the Senate floor on Wednesday afternoon, addressing the cornonavirus and a failed amendment he sponsored that would have paid for virus relief efforts by withdrawing U.S. forces from Afghanistan.A spokesman for Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., said Moran briefly saw Paul at the Senate gym Sunday morning and that he shared that information with GOP colleagues at a policy meeting. Moran “followed CDC guidelines and kept a safe distance between him and Sen. Paul,? spokesman Tom Brandt said. Moran has spoken with the attending physician at the Capitol and has been told he does not need to self-quarantine, Brandt said.South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking Republican senator, said on the Senate floor that lawmakers will consult with the attending physician about all senators who have been in contact with Paul.Romney said he was praying for Paul and noted that Paul’s health is compromised. Paul, 57, broke several ribs in 2017 when a neighbor assaulted him over a long-standing landscaping dispute. Paul, who was later awarded $580,000 in damages and medical expenses, had surgery last year to remove part of a lung damaged by the assault.The Senate was in session Sunday seeking a bipartisan response to the pandemic. If approved, the bill would be the third measure Congress has approved in response to the coronavirus this month.The White House has increasingly emphasized that testing should prioritize the elderly and health care workers who have symptoms of the virus. While most cases of Covid-19-19 are mild and tens of thousands of people have recovered, older people and those with underlying health problems are at higher risk for more serious problems, such as pneumonia.“We don’t want everyone to go out and get a test because there’s no reason for it,” Trump told reporters Friday.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells people to seek testing if they have certain symptoms of the flu-like illness caused by the coronavirus — fever, cough and trouble breathing — and if they have traveled recently to an outbreak area or have been in close contact with someone who is infected. They should first be tested for the flu and other routine infections.The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.

CONMEBOL

CHENNAI: The Under-17 Women's World Cup might be seven months away from kick-off but the threat of Covid-19 is certain to have thrown a spanner in the works of the tournament which India will be hosting for the first time.While the five venues - Ahmedabad, Bhubaneswar, Guwahati, Kolkata and Navi Mumbai - might be ready in time, the ongoing crisis has forced majority of the qualifying tournaments for the event to be postponed.Out of the 16 teams that will take part in the World Cup - which is scheduled to be held from November 2-21, this year - Japan and North Korea are the only sides to have qualified so far. They had emerged as the top two teams - having played in the 2019 AFC U-16 Women's Championship final from the Asia (AFC) region. India, as hosts, are the third team in the tournament. FIFA spokesperson acknowledged the crisis at hand. ""We are currently monitoring the situation regarding Covid-19 in India in close collaboration with the Local Organising Committee (LOC) as well as other key stakeholders, including the AIFF (All India Football Federation ), sports ministry and relevant authorities in the country. With public health and safety in mind, we are also working with the LOC to identify any potential impact on preparations for the tournament, as well as finding alternative solutions to upcoming events that were planned in the lead up to the tournament. Regarding qualifying tournaments for the event, we are currently working closely with confederations regarding alternate dates,"" the spokesperson told TOI.Among the qualification tournaments which have been postponed are the CONCACAF Women's U-17 Championships (originally scheduled for April 18-May 3 in Toluca, Mexico), South American U-17 championships (April 15-May 3 in Venezuela), Oceania U-17 Championship (April 6-19). But the worst hit is UEFA . The European body has postponed this year's U-17 Women's Euros to be held in Sweden from May 9. The event would have served as a qualifying tournament for the World Cup - top three teams make the cut - and the body is yet to work out an alternative date. The only qualifiers which are still happening is in the African region (CAF).Roma Khanna, the tournament director of the LOC, allayed some of the fears and feels alternate dates could be worked out since the tournament is still seven months away. ""We are in contact with FIFA on the qualifying events. FIFA is working closely together with confederations on their respective qualifying tournaments. Locally, we had to postpone our Kick off the Dream football carnivals (promotional events) for this month. We will continue to monitor the situation in relation to future events that are planned to take place in host cities and around the country,"" Khanna told TOI.However, what will reduce some of the LOC's woes is that work at two new venues - Ahmedabad and Bhubaneswar - are nearing completion and the stadiums will be ready in time. ""Things are on track at all the five venues. Three of these (Guwahati, Kolkata and Navi Mumbai) have already hosted U-17 World Cup in 2017 matches and already meet the majority of FIFA requirements. The two new venues planned for the tournament, Ahmedabad and Bhubaneswar, also have the basic infrastructure ready and work at the training sites is underway. The state authorities have also assured us of full cooperation and we appreciate the efforts being put by them in line with public health measures put in place,"" Khanna said.Japan, South Korea and India (as hosts) - have qualified so far.serving as UEFA qualifiers - to be held in Sweden from May 9-22 has been postponed.decided on March 19 that their qualification tournament would be postponed to late August and early September.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74766383,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-348202,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/football/top-stories/womens-u-17-world-cup-qualifiers-on-hold-organisers-tense/articleshow/74766382.cms

LUDHIANA: Loud banging of plates, music on speakers and thunderous claps is what the city descended into as the clock struck 5 pm during ‘Janta Curfew’ on Sunday. The sound therapy, advocated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , was followed seriously by the masses.

People of all age groups were seen on terraces, balconies and roads outside their houses, banging plates and ringing bells. Every family member in each household stood up as a mark of gratitude to those fighting relentlessly helping people with Covid-19.

Residents of the city, specially Kitchlu Nagar D block, marked it with fervour. Aman Kochar, a resident, said, “We cheered for healthcare professionals for their relentless work in this critical situation. We felt proud to chant and be a part of this positive energy that our PM Modi has urged us to radiate. We stand as one, we fight as one. Stay home and stay healthy.”

Her 14-year-old son, Dhruv Kochar , said the clapping was a good way to make citizens feel comfortable as panic was not the answer. “We are thankful to live in such a great country. Our doctors and nurses should be thanked for their services, despite knowing it is dangerous for them too. Let’s all get united and obey the rules made by our government to make our nation free from Covid-19,” he said.

A resident of Tagore Nagar, Swati Gupta , said smiles on people’s faces amid such gloomy times reminded them of the power of unity and oneness. “The move can easily be called a positivity endorsement drive,” she said.

“Ludhiana is geared up for the long battle against the virus. Hopefully, the menace is eradicated with self-isolation. A deep gratitude was expressed to all those helping Covid-19 victims get better and those unsung heroes fighting tooth and nail to prevent further spread of the virus,” she added.

A resident of Kitchlu Nagar D block, Megha Bector, said , “We appreciate the PM’s idea to express gratitude to all those who do not have this luxury of staying at home and working tirelessly to keep us safe.Thank you to all essential service providers for their selfless work, so that our nation is freed of Covid-19.’ Aggar Nagar resident Sudhir Gupta said it felt good to see all his neighbors on the terrace at the same time. “That feeling of unity and togetherness gave me goose bumps,” he said.

I have been deputed outside the isolation ward and will perform my duty wholeheartedly,” he said.He said he was earlier deputed at police lines. “Now, for past 11 days, I have been in the hospital. I even see the family members of those, admitted in isolation ward, are afraid of coming to the hospital and even near the isolation ward. They would ask us to go inside to convey a message to give food to them.”Lalji lost his wife to cancer recently. He has two children, Surbhi Bhatti (19) and Sumeet (16), to take care of. Therefore, now he has sent both to Hoshiarpur , at the house of his in-laws.Surbhi she and her brother were a litte worried about him when he told them he was on duty outside the isolation ward. “But he is a cop. He has to perform his duty. My brother and I support him. All I want him is to take precautions,” she said.ASI Tarsem Lal (54), who earlier was posted at police lines, said there was no need to be scared. “Army personnel also stand on the border and do not care for their lives while serving the nation. Otherwise, we are taking all precautions,” he said.Jatinder Singh (25), son of ASI Tarsem, said, “Of course, we all keep worrying for him. We keep asking him to wear masks, gloves and use hand sanitisers. Along with this, there is a proud feeling too that when everyone is indoor for their safety, my father is on duty to serve people.”ASI Lovely Singh , earlier deployed at naib court, has a wife and a teenaged son at home. “When I go home after performing duty here, I make sure I keep a distance from them,” he said.",ludhiana,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74767733,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-43307,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/cops-who-keep-spirits-up-outside-isolation-ward/articleshow/74765226.cms

LUDHIANA: The All-India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), Ludhiana district , has asked the Punjab government to ensure due compensation for all workers and not only for the registered ones as announced by the state government, where it had stated that it would give a payment of Rs 3,000 to registered ones only.

Over 70% workers engaged in the unorganised sector are not registered at all and will be denied the much-needed benefit in this crisis situation. Under the prevailing circumstances the daily/casual/contract wage earners are the worst hit because they are dependent on their daily earnings to meet the basic needs. The government should announce relief on the pattern of the Kerala government, it said.

The Kerala government has announced a relief package of Rs 20,000 to deal with the situation due to Covid-19. In addition, the pension to the women has been doubled. About 10,000 eating outlets have been opened by the government to supply food at Rs 20. Payment of electricity and water bills has also been deferred for one month. Delhi government followed the Kerala government model and announced one month free ration for BPL and APL and also doubled the pension for women. The Punjab government should follow this model, AITUC said.

The industry and the other employers should ensure that no worker is laid off. AITUC leaders Ramesh Rattan, president, AITUC, Ludhiana, Vijay Kumar, general secretary, D P Maur, state vice-president, M S Bhatia, joint secretary, Gurmail Singh Meldey and Kewal Singh Benwait welcomed the decision of the Trident Group in this regard and appealed to all industry houses to follow this and the government to ensure this. They, however, were critical of the Prime Minister's speech which did not mention a word of relief measures to the poor, needy and vulnerable section of society who are in dire need of government support in such critical situation.

Programmes at Hussainiwala near India-Pakistan border in Ferozepur and at Khatkar Kalan — the native village of Bhagat Singh in Nawanshahr — have been cancelled. In Pakistan also, permission was denied to Bhagat Singh’s followers to gather in remembrance at Shadman Chowk in Lahore.

However, tributes will be paid by various organisations on social media. A live online programme ‘Virtual seminar on Bhagat Singh’ will be held in which many historians will speak about Bhagat Singh and a Twitter campaign will also be held.

The three were hanged at the Lahore Central Jail on March 23, 1931 for killing assistant superintendent of police J P Saunders on December 7, 1928. Their half-burnt bodies were immersed in Satluj river near Hussainiwala where martyrs’ memorial has been built. The three are remembered every year on March 23 and various programmes are organised mainly at Huissainiwala and his native place Khatkar Kalan in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar . On March 23, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had landed at Hussainiwala to pay tributes to freedom fighters.

“We will miss paying tributes to Bhagat Singh due to lockdown, but he always remain in our hearts,” Desh Bhagat Yaadgar Committee member Amolak Singh.

“We have planned to organise online seminar in the memory of Bhagat Singh. Historians will shed light on various aspects of Bhagat Singh’ life,” said Prof Chaman Lal, retired professor from Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, who has authored many books on Bhagat Singh.

Similarly, Lahore-based Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation chairman Imtiaz Rashid Qureshi said authorities have not granted permission for commemoration function at Shadman Chowk, which was part of Central Jail where he along with two comrades was hanged. “But we will hold a small programme at Lahore high court. Qureshi had filed a petition in Lahore high court to announce Bhagat Singh as not guilty of killing Saunders, as his name was not mentioned in the FIR registered at Anarkali Bazaar on December 17, 1928.

Pollution levels are the highest in the most congested parts of Ludhiana, and existing hospitals cannot take the heavy load of patients in case of emergencies, as many neighbouring towns are also dependent on the city for healthcare. He hoped the Punjab government and LSCL chairman shall focus on it on an an urgent basis to provide good health services, as per pan city initiatives under the Smart City Mission, since the Punjab Health System Corporation , working under the health ministry of the Punjab government has limited resources and funds.

470,['23/03/2020'],"17 jawans killed, 15 injured in Maoist ambush in Bastar","Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel meets an injured jawan in Sukma on Sunday

RAIPUR: Maoists ambushed security forces in Elmaguda forest of Sukma district late Saturday night, killing 17 of them, injuring 15 and looting a light machinegun and a dozen AK47s.

This is the biggest death toll among the forces in Chhattisgarh in three years, and the first major attack in the current Congress regime.

All those killed were from District Reserve Guards and Special Task Force. Police believe several Maoists were also killed in the five-hour-long gunfight — one of the most intense in years — but no body has been recovered yet. The rebels are believed to have used UBGLs — rife-fired grenades — which acted as a force multiplier and had a devastating effect.

“We recovered 17 bodies from the encounter site on Sunday afternoon. All the 15 injured personnel are undergoing treatment at a hospital in Raipur after they were airlifted from Sukma,” DGP Durgesh Madhav Awasthi told TOI on Sunday.

The encounter took place in the forests near Elmaguda, close to Minpa and Kasalpad, in the Maoist hotbed of Sukma. The ambush site isn’t far from where the April 2017 attack in Chintagufa , in which 25 CRPF jawans were martyred, took place.

Senior police officers told TOI late Saturday night that a 150-strong team of CRPF’s Co-BRA commandos, STF, and DRG set out on an operation following intelligence inputs about the presence of a large number of Maoists in the region.

Maoists loot LMG, 14 rifles, grenade launcher

Maoists — apparently from the dreaded 1Battalion — had set up IED traps for the securitymen and taken firing positions on high ground. When the forces came within range, the rebels triggered explosions and laid down heavy fire from well camouflaged positions.

Though taken by surprise, the forces retaliated strongly and a five-hour gunfight ensued.

Initial reports said many Maoists were also killed in the ambush but police said they are yet to find any of the bodies as the rebels drag away their dead and injured.

After the gunfight, when police took stock of the situation, 17 personnel were found to be missing, including 12 from DRG. Senior officers clung to hope that the DRG personnel — battle-hardened tribals who know the jungle very well — had dispersed during the encounter and would make their way back to base. This has happened earlier. But not so today.

CoBRA commandos led a search party into the encounter site early Sunday morning. They moved cautiously since Maoists are known to ambush rescue teams. Security personnel flew drones over the encounter spot. Rescue ops were complicated by rain but by afternoon, the grim reality was out. The bodies of 17 jawans were found on the forest floor.

Maoists had looted an LMG, 14 assault rifles and an under-barrel grenade launcher (UBGL) from the martyred troops. The bodies were shifted to a nearby base.

This is the first time that DRG suffered such a heavy toll. The unit comprises mostly local youth and surrendered Maoists who are at home in inhospitable terrain and are very tough fighters. DRG has added muscle to counterinsurgency operations, particularly in South Bastar , say police.

This is the first major Maoist attack after Congress government came to power in December 2018, and the biggest since the Chintagufa ambush of April 2017. About 90 CRPF jawans were sanitising a road that was being built in the area when 300-odd Maoists, divided into multiple groups, attacked the CRPF party. Only a month before this, 12 CRPF men were killed in a Maoist ambush in Sukma.

These range from hi-tech alternatives like real-time video classes conducted remotely to lower-tech options such as educational programming on radio and television.""The impacts of school closure are difficult to overstate and many of them extend beyond the education sector.The disadvantages of interrupted learning are disproportionate for underprivileged learners who tend to have fewer educational opportunities outside school.Moreover, many children and youth rely on free or discounted school meals for healthy nutrition. When schools close, nutrition is compromised.Working parents are more likely to miss work to take care of their children when schools close. This results in wage loss and decreased productivity.School closures place an additional burden on schools as parents and officials redirect children to schools that are open.This then leads to school dropouts. It is a challenge to ensure children and youth return and stay in school when schools reopen, especially after protracted closures.Schools are hubs of social activity and human interaction. When schools close, many children and youth miss out on social contact that is essential to learning and development.UNESCO is also launching a Global COVID-19 Education Coalition that brings together multilateral partners and the private sector, including Microsoft and the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), to help countries deploy remote learning systems so as to minimize educational disruptions and maintain social contact with learners.""The current situation imposes immense challenges for countries to be able to provide uninterrupted learning for all children and youth in an equitable manner. We are stepping up on our global response by creating a coalition to ensure a fast and coordinated response. Beyond meeting immediate needs, this effort is an opportunity to rethink education, scale-up distance learning and make education systems more resilient, open and innovative,"" said UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay.""Difficulties rise exponentially when school closures are prolonged,"" said Stefania Giannini, UNECO's Assistant Director-General for Education. ""Schools, however imperfectly, play an equalizing role in society and when they close, inequalities become far greater.""UNESCO will further host regular webinars and virtual meetings to allow country representatives opportunities to share information on the effectiveness of approaches used in different contexts, building on the success of its ministerial videoconference of March 10 that brought together 73 countries.Globally, the novel coronavirus that first emerged in December last year has infected more than 300,000 people and has claimed more than 13,000 lives as per the data provided by Johns Hopkins University.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74766443,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1954242,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/education/news/half-of-worlds-student-population-not-attending-school-due-to-covid-19-unesco/articleshow/74766429.cms

The sanitizers are otherwise manufactured from Iso-propyl alcohol which is not available in required amount and therefore manufacture of sanitizer from denatured alcohol is required, the letter, dated March 20, said. Prasad said that the sanitizer manufacturing units be provided ethyl alcohol through passbook facility.The department has also directed that permission be granted to distilleries interested in bulk production of sanitizers. Directions have also been issued for manufacture of sanitizer in three shifts for which facilities be provided to the units.Meanwhile, UP medicine manufacturing association sent a letter to UP chief minister seeking his intervention in expediting the production of hand sanitizer in the state. President of the association, Prashant Bhatia said that the World Health Organization has found ethyl alcohol based sanitizer appropriate to tackle the menace of Corona Virus. He said that the state has adequate quantity of ethyl alcohol but it is subjected to decision by the excise department.“This is causing hindrance in supply of ethyl alcohol to the sanitizer manufacturing units,” he said.

Importantly, the Bengal government has specified that “e-commerce of groceries and food items and home delivery of food” will be exempted, too. This exempted list will include petrol pumps, LPG, oil agencies, their godowns and transportation. The order imposes no restrictions on vehicles carrying food and essential supplies.The Centre, earlier in the day, gave states a free hand to decide on such lockdowns till March 31in 75 zones nationwide which have reported Covid-19 cases, in some cases even deaths. The state subsequently went a step ahead and decided to lock down Kolkata and all municipal towns in Bengal as a pre-emptive step to contain any further spread of the contagion. Bengal has witnessed a large influx of international and domestic travellers through air, road and rail routes, desperate to return home before travel restrictions set in.Three fresh Covid-19 cases were reported on Sunday. A 38-year-old who died in AIIMS, Patna and travelled from Kolkata two days back tested positive , prompting the Bengal government to seek his travel and stay details.The order issued by state chief secretary Rajiva Sinha states that under the provisions of the “Safety Restrictions” of the West Bengal Epidemic Disease, Covid-19 Regulations, 2020, no more than seven persons can gather at any place. The order bars all public transport services, including taxis and autos, from plying in notified zones, but allows vehicles meant to ferry people to hospitals, airports, railway stations and bus terminals. The order makes it clear that all shops, commercial establishments, offices, factories and workshops have to be closed.The state has made it clear that all foreign returnees are to strictly abide by the home-quarantine rule. The timelines for the home quarantine rules will be decided by health personnel. The order asks people to stay at home and step out only for emergencies while maintaining social distancing norms. Violation of rules can lead to penal prosecution and a sixmonth prison term, sources said. Till Sunday, 22,043 people were in home isolation in Bengal, while 630 people have completed their home quarantine period.The rules were issued after Sinha discussed the Centre’s inputs with chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Earlier in the day, Sinha had attended a meeting with the Union cabinet secretary and Prime Minister’s principal secretary on Covid-19 preparedness and measures. It was decided in this meeting that all railway, Metro and interstate passenger services would be suspended till May 31. The chief minister, sources said, stressed that an immediate precautionary lockdown was a key step to contain the disease spread as Bengal steps into critical weeks.The state transport department on Sunday also ordered the suspension of trucks carrying non-essential cargo from midnight on March 22 till March 31. “No such non-essential items carried in national permit-holding goods carriages, such as trucks and trailers, shall be allowed to enter the state with effect from midnight on March 22 till March 31,” read the letter issued by the transport department.In Kolkata, police said they have identified specific check points. “We have begun conveying our decision to auto, bus and taxi owners.

490,['23/03/2020'],Kolkata air turns cleaner as residents stay indoors to minimize coronavirus risk,"KOLKATA: The ‘janata curfew’ day has contributed a lot to the city’s ambient air. All parameters of pollutants not only plunged far below the national standard, but also below the World Health Organization-recommended safe standard, which is far more stringent than our national limit. Most heartening aspect is the steep plunge of PM2.5, which is the most dangerous of the pollutants.Particulate matter of size 2.5 or PM2.5 are ultrafine particles of diameter less than 2.5 micrometres, which is about 3% the diameter of a human hair, and can travel straight into the blood stream. The noxious chemicals riding piggyback on these particles play havoc with human lives.People’s response to the ‘janata curfew’ put vehicles completely off the road. There was hardly any bus or taxi on the streets. The automobile emission was almost nil, aiding the environment to heal itself tremendously. “The lockdown reveals how much of the degradation of air quality is anthropogenic or induced by human activities,” said West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) chairman Kalyan Rudra.The PM 2.5 count on Saturday was 53.1µg/m3 (microgram per cubic meter) at Fort William, 57.1 µg/m3 at Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) and 36.8 µg/m3 at Jadavpur. On Sunday, the count plunged below 26.1 µg/m3 at Fort William, 18.2 µg/m3 at RBU, and 14.3 µg/m3 at Jadavpur. While the national daily standard is 60 µg/m3 , the WHO standard is 25.“The latest source-apportionment study by National Environment Engineering and Research Institute (NEERI) found that road dust constitutes 66% of PM2.5 pollution of city’s ambient air. Apart from the tail-pipe emission, the vehicular movement causes re-suspension of road dust. On Sunday, there was no re-suspension of dust,” said Rudra.WBPCB has started sprinkling water mixed with dust suppressant chemicals along all major corridors in Kolkata. With the experiment proving a success, WBPCB has extended the exercise till the end of next month. Significantly, from the month of March, air quality improves dramatically for meteorological reasons. Increase of heat and humidity helped finer particulate matters to coalesce into bigger particulate matter.“The biggest takeaway from the crisis is environmental improvement. I have seen how the air quality index across the city turned green from yellow,” said green crusader Subhas Datta.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74766888,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1239663,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-air-turns-cleaner-as-residents-stay-indoors-to-minimize-coronavirus-risk/articleshow/74766848.cms

That's the hardest thing,"" Lewis told Houston television station KRIV.""I think a more comfortable situation would be two years and put it in the Olympic year with the Winter Olympics (Beijing 2022) and then make it kind of a celebratory Olympic year.""The head of the French athletics federation Andre Giraud also said postponement was inevitable.""Everyone agrees that the Games cannot be held on the dates planned,"" Giraud said.And for some athletes, the IOC's announcement was too little, too late.""So wait... does this mean that athletes face up to another FOUR weeks of finding ways to fit in training -- whilst potentially putting ourselves, coaches, support staff and loved ones at risk just to find out they were going to be postponed anyway,"" tweeted Britain's Dina Asher-Smith, the world 200m champion.""So irresponsible,"" she added. ""I was really hoping to hear an announcement that they'd postponed it to 2021 this week.""Canada said it would not send its athletes to any Games held this summer, calling on the IOC and International Paralympic Committee to ""postpone the Games as a part of our collective responsibility to protect our communities"".But Bach, speaking to German outlet SWR on Saturday, warned postponement was ""a very complex operation.""""Postponing the Olympic Games is not like moving a football game to next Saturday,"" he said.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74766946,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-136473,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/tokyo-olympics/japan-pm-says-olympic-postponement-may-become-inevitable/articleshow/74766900.cms
