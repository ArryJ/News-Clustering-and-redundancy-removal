0,['7/03/2020'],"If you don’t notice the edits, it is probably good editing: Sreekar Prasad","Eight time National Award-winning editor Sreekar Prasad just added one more feather to his cap. The multilingual technician recently entered the Limca Book of Records for ‘films edited in most number of languages,’ which include Tamil, Hindi, Odia, Bengali, Assamese, Sinhalese, Karbi, Mishing, Bodo, and Pangchenpa, among others. While techniques and tools may have changed over the years, the process is still the same, Sreekar told us in a chat at his homestyle office in Chennai, as we spoke about his long-standing collaboration with Mani Ratnam, his idols and the growing appreciation for technicians, today. Excerpts from an interview.It was not a conscious effort at all. It just so happened that as the career went on, I was exposed to a lot of industries. With Chennai being the hub of Indian cinema at that time, at least for the south, north east and east, filmmakers used to come here for post-production. Once I got a few awards, people knew my name and used to approach me. I wasn’t afraid to take up new languages, because initially, you take up any work that comes your way. Across India, the way of life might differ. But the core values of families and relationships are pretty much the same.Sri Lankan films were quite challenging. You can manage to work in other languages because there is some connect with Sanskrit or Hindi. But Sinhalese was completely different. I would subtitle the rushes and edit them together to get clarity. Luckily, most of the films were more about cinematic expression and less verbose, making the job easier.Language is a by-product of a story. I try to balance it out with interesting stories, bigger and smaller films. I usually have a bigger-sized film that is going to take a long time to finish and a few smaller-sized films. It is also about satisfaction at times. A small story with a limited audience gives you immense satisfaction when you look at cinema as an art. To Let is an example. It keeps me from feeling typecast and stay away from monotony.Invariably, for around 90 per cent of the films, the screenplay changes a little during editing. It may not change in many films drastically, but you realise that some things are not necessary at the table. Restructuring, too, happens. As an editor, my duty is to see where the high of the scene is achieved. Whatever happens after that high are extensions, and are taken off if they are redundant.Some filmmakers do that here as well, where they edit the sequences on set and see how it looks. But it’s more an expression of a director to see if he has got all the shots right. This happens in the hustle and bustle of a film set. But the rhythm of editing falls in the editing room. You will be able to see all the rushes that way.Editing was something that came out of necessity, right from stitching two sequences together to juxtaposing two sequences to depict things that are far more interesting. The process of editing has been the same, but with the advent of computers and new equipment, the finesse has been enhanced.With the boom of technology and social media, a lot of people became curious about the technical aspects of filmmaking. Otherwise, it was easy to associate films with just actors, directors and camera crew, because these are the physical aspects of a film. Editing is not something that can be seen and identified by a common audience. If you don’t notice the edits, it is probably good editing to me. A cut will be noticed if there are glitches or jerks. But there has been a great shift in the way editors are recognised.Everybody wants to reinvent something. It is all about how you use the techniques. There are so many innovations coming up today, in terms of filmmaking and computer graphics. But at the end of the day, it is a story you are trying to tell. The story and target audience are the two things that are very important when you make a film. For instance, To Let was made for a festival audience, but it ended up having a small reckoning here (theatre audiences) as well. But I have found over the years that if you don’t use the tools judiciously, you may distance the audience from the film. You don’t want an emotional film to be cut with so many things. That discretion is at the hands of the editor.I don’t intentionally work on a particular style. I work towards making a scene as smooth as possible. When you are watching a scene, you normally don’t realise that there could be anything between 10 and 30 shots that are strung together to make one sequence. The timing with which the sequence is strung determines how you perceive a scene. Most people tell me that I hold on to shots for the audiences to enjoy. I take that as a compliment and move on.I try to bring in a sense of realism in the genre of the film I am working in. That has been my biggest takeaway. Even if it is a very commercial and slightly exaggerated form of content, how real can you keep it? The exaggeration is to the level where you can accept it. You get a high when you watch a person act on screen. But sometimes, you can go overboard. I try to consciously avoid that. When I did Thuppakki for Murugadoss, I tried to bring in a proportion, where the exaggeration and hero worship did not cross a line. You enjoy it and you don’t get bored by it.We have been working for 21 years. He was trying to experiment on structures and his way of filmmaking when I began this collaboration. He is somebody who pushes the envelope. His passion rubs off on you. There is a healthy rivalry here; when he is saying something, you want to give something better than that. He looks at things from a different angle, which excites you. It is always an exciting proposal to be working with him.They have started filming, so it will take quite some time before we come to the main process. The challenge is more for the director in terms of getting the aesthetics, period and costume right. In terms of editing, it is almost similar to editing anything else for me. But it is important to try to keep it as tight as possible. There is probably an impression in the audience that period films are slow. We would keep that in mind to keep the experience as tight as possibleThe more experienced a filmmaker is, the more open they will be to let go. By experience, you know what works and what doesn’t... There was one part in the second half in Kaththi, where we were suddenly cutting off and going for a song. The sequence I am referring to is the one in which Vijay and the others are sitting inside the pipe. There was supposed to be a break there; there was a little romantic interlude, leading to a song. But at that point, we were already in a high. So, to take the audience away from that moment could have ended up in the scene losing steam. By then, they had already shot the song. But the director was not certain (about this suggestion) because songs are an important factor for marketing. But during the time of release, he also agreed to drop the song.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74512627,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1164124/74512627.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/if-you-dont-notice-the-edits-it-is-probably-good-editing-sreekar-prasad/articleshow/74512627.cms

The film, which is being shot in picturesque locations of Shivamogga like Kodachadri and Hosanagara, touches upon Gandhi’s philosophies. Yogi says, “Gandhi Mathu Notu is about a child, Sukri, who is studying at a school in a remote village. She gets inspired by the philosophies of Gandhi, and begins to look for his principles in action, be it speaking truth, shunningalcohol consumption, respecting women, following ahimsa, etc., only to find that no one really follows any of it. Even currency notes that have Gandhi’s image on them, are used forillegal activities. Sukri’s father is also an alcoholic, so she takes up a campaign to make sure Gandhi’s principles continue to thrive, which draws national attention. The idea of the film is that Gandhi's philosophies may seem outdated, but even a child can bring a change in society.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74512620,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-316516/74512620.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/director-yogi-devaganges-next-has-a-gandhi-connect/articleshow/74512620.cms

He needed to redeem himself as a filmmaker, while also making sure that Ramesh’s 101st film was noteworthy. The end product — Shivaji Surathkal: Ranagiri Rahasya , produced by Anup Gowda and Rekha KN for Anjanadri Cine Creations — has by far outdone their expectations, and the film’s warm reception by audiences has fuelled Akash’s plan to turn it into a franchise. “A detective tale always has infinite possibilities to explore and with Shivaji…, since we began at Case No. 101, we can either go back, forward or focus on other pivotal characters. A sequel is definitely on the cards, and since we have already established major characters, the next film can dive into the case from the word go. Remakes in Hindi and Tamil are also being discussed, and it would be interesting to have Ramesh sir in the latter version, since he is a known name in Kollywood, and hasn’t done a lead role there in a while,” says Akash. The team, meanwhile, is also excited about the film’s good showing in Australia, where the number of shows has been increased. “We are also taking Shivaji… to the US and Europe,” he signs off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74509386,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-131695/74509386.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/akash-srivatsa-confirms-a-shivaji-surathkal-a-sequel/articleshow/74509386.cms
3,['7/03/2020'],Vaishnavi Gowda bags her next,"Like most other TV artistes, Vaishnavi Gowda , best known as Sannidhi from Agnisakshi, also made transition from the small screen to the big screen. But after debuting with the critically-acclaimed Girgitle a year ago, she did not immediately sign up for her next. We now hear that Vaishnavi has signed up to play the lead in debutant director Vinay Kumar MG’s as-yet-untitled film. “After Girgitle, I knew that I did not want to do run-of-the-mill roles and was looking for performance-oriented characters. So, while the offers kept coming my way, I took my time to decide on which one to do next. In Vinay’s film, I play Nakshatra, a jovial, independent and responsible girl, whose life takes a turn owing to a certain incident. The narrative follows the people she meets along the way, and and how they help her overcome her problems. I have already begun shooting for the first schedule of the film, much of which involves night shoots. Although the entire team comprises newcomers, their way of approaching the subject and creativity made me accept the project,” she explains. Does that mean it is adieu to the small screen? “Well, it looks that way now. Since Agnisakshi has ended, I am not returning to television and want to concentrate on a filmi career,” she sums up.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74512100,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-155319/74512100.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/kannada/vaishnavi-gowda-bags-her-next/articleshow/74512106.cms
4,['7/03/2020'],a world gone mad: Thermal and a Quarter to address chaos in today’s time in new album,"City-based rock band Thermal and a Quarter is busy gearing up for the launch of its eighth album, A World Gone Mad . The release is significant, considering that it comes almost five years since their last album. Speaking about the mood of the album, lead singer Bruce Lee Mani says that it is a reflection of the present day scenario across the world. “The title of the album is self-explanatory. This time, we are aiming to be more direct than usual and address the different things, events happening all around the world. The state of chaos surrounding us is what triggered our creativity with songs this time. For this album, we started writing songs, about two years ago. As artistes who have the medium of music to express and discuss our opinions and reactions to various events, situations and topics, you can safely bet that this time, we have gone all out and not held back. It is a very different take for our band, this time,” he explains. The album will feature songs that are based on the band’s perspective and from their own, personal experiences. “The title track, A World Gone Mad, is an exploration of today’s scenario, addressing the state of chaos we are in. Believe It All is completely based on people’s perspectives on information, both real and fake. This song is a thought experiment. Distance is another track that is about an individual’s perspectives, things that we view from different lengths and it ends on a deeper note on how distance is just a barrier to all things human. NFA, which stands for Neoliberal Fascism Autarky, is our current affairs commentary, our take on the kind of authoritarianism we are witnessing in governments around the world today. Koston Circle is a more positive track than the rest, as it is about our families and how we vouch for their safety first in times of unrest, the bonds we share with each family member and how they keep our sanity intact,” adds Bruce.Did they ever have second thoughts about expressing themselves so strongly this time around? “We are using our platform, our influence and our voice to start a dialogue on what’s going wrong in the world. A newbie would probably have inhibitions in the beginning, but if you have been in the industry as long as us, then you don’t consider the repercussions from addressing a sensitive issue. It’s not like we’re fearless, it’s not like we didn’t have a fear of what would happen to our careers or the business, but the stage at which we are now, I think it’s right to not remain silent anymore,” Bruce signs off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74508107,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-323972/74508107.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/music/thermal-and-a-quarter-to-address-chaos-in-todays-time-in-new-album/articleshow/74508107.cms
5,['7/03/2020'],Bengaluru’s memory mapping community aim to showcase the cosmopolitan nature of the city through different viewpoints,"Bengaluru is known for its cosmopolitan nature. The city is growing in size and numbers rapidly. In fact, a recent survey done by the Directorate of Economics and Statistics states that the city will host 20% of Karnataka 's population by 2021. With this rapid expansion, it is difficult to retain memories of the old city, that was once even called the Pensioner’s Paradise. This is where memory mapping exercises have come into play. While the initial exercises tried to re-create memories of older neighbourhoods, the teams now plan on including communities to showcase new perspectives. Aliyeh Razi and Arzu Mistry have been championing the concept, conducting workshops for people in the city who want to know more about the city’s history and its present state. “It initially started out as a product of nostalgia. Both Aliyeh and I developed the idea of having workshops on memory mapping, as we wanted people to understand the evolution of their neighbourhoods and the people living in it. But the concept has helped us think beyond and now we are looking at different perspectives,” says Arzu, who is an educator, ecologist and visual artist.Krupa Srirangam, a conservation architect, says that collecting data or hosting surveys is not enough to understand the city’s evolution over the years. She adds, “It is only when one hears the stories of the people living in the city and walk with them to the spots where those memories were created, does one understand how the city has changed through their memories. The way a child would see Bengaluru is certainly different in comparison to his/her parent, who might have a lot more to add. To understand the city’s landscape and the cultural, social aspect of its evolution, I have listened to many stories from individuals of different age groups, belonging to different religions, communities and financial status.”Muralist Poornima Sukumar, founder of the Aravani Art Project, has spent the last few years working towards creating a safe space for the transgender community in the city. She uses art as the medium for interaction and engagement with the community. She is teaming up with Aliyeh and Arzu for workshops on memory mapping of the transgender community.“The transgender community in the city has not had a smooth past and some of the members are still looked down upon, more often in public spaces. Initially, when I spoke to a few on the idea of memory mapping the community, they wondered if Bengalureans or people who have just moved into the city would be interested in hearing their stories. Once people visit places where the community stays, and get a glimpse of their everyday lives, they will change their mindset and that would help in bringing about more inclusion,” believes Poornima. Aliyeh and Arzu are also planning a memory mapping workshop for the migrant population of the city, especially the Rajasthani community, many of whom are into performing arts, like folk dance and art.Urban historian and writer Aliyeh Razi says, “Memory mapping helps one understand the people, their lifestyle, culture, listen to their stories and learn more about how the city used to work. We use the concept to increase the individual’s knowledge about the city via the exercise, to increase their familiarity with the present landscape of the city. A healthy mix of old Bengalureans and people who have just migrated to the city in one session of a workshop helps in the sharing of personal experiences and an exchange of narratives.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74511579,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-178233/74511579.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/bengalurus-memory-mapping-community-aim-to-showcase-the-cosmopolitan-nature-of-the-city-through-different-viewpoints/articleshow/74511050.cms

On his blog, Casey writes that as part of his project, he travels with his family, to various countries and meets local artistes. The journey led him to collaborate with Raghu. Speaking about this, Raghu shares, “Musician Abigail Washburn is our common friend and she introduced me to Casey. When he was in the city with his family, he stayed at my house for about three weeks. On one of those occasions we decided to jam. For a long while, I wanted to work on the Da. Ra. Bendre poem, Baaro Saadhanakerige . I had performed it long ago, but the right opportunity to record it, never arose. But when Casey and I sat down together, it just felt like the right song to work on.”Of the collaboration, Casey writes, “Raghu grabbed a guitar and gave me a sample of the song. Not only did his harmonic, melodic, and groove sensibilities immediately speak to me, but I was blown away by his voice with its amazing power, range, and soulfulness. And then he told me about the meaning of the words — a travelling song of nostalgia and longing, of leaving your home to search for what you think may be better, only to return to your home and find that it has been the true place for you. Needless to say, it resonated in a big way with me on these travels since I’m on a long journey home (sic).”He adds that after working on the song for a little while, the track fell into place very quickly and they recorded it in one take. The duo also performed the song on the TV show Haadu Karnataka.

7,['7/03/2020'],When pets paraded through city’s college campus,"It was a day of fun and excitement at Mount Carmel College recently, with nearly 20 dogs and cats parading on the college premise as part of a special event, called ‘It’s a Paw-Ty’. Decked up in jackets and boots, these four-legged buddies managed to put up quite the show on campus. Benmol, a final-year student and one of the organisers, says, “We wanted to end the last event as members of the Student Union this academic year on a high note, and what better way to do that than having pets over.”

The event saw many students interact with the furry little ones, as they took part in games like jumping through hoops as well as the lemon and spoon race. The event saw breeds such as Golden Retriever, Labrador, Pugs, Shih Tzu and indie varieties among others.

Mehak Gurung — a first-year student, who had brought her Rottweiler pet, named Laila, says, “I was surprised to see how calm she was even though she was surrounded by so many people. I had a lot of fun and I was happy to see so many students around my pet.”

Spurthi Eyathirajulu, a second-year student, says, “It was a great opportunity for my dog Benzy — a Golden Retriever, who is quite old — to enjoy himself and bond with other pets. He became the centre of attention and the girls kept giving him belly rubs, which he really liked. He likes people and I was happy to see that he was so chilled out even around big dogs.”

9,['7/03/2020'],I don’t understand why a small film should take over two years to release here: Badri,"Though he won a National Award for his short film Vidiyalai Nokki and then established himself as a film director, Badri Venkatesh says he didn’t really have an easy journey. While he may have debuted with Baana Kaathadi in 2010, his second film, Semma Botha Aagatha, came out only in 2018. Badri says that he’s been busy with television for a much longer time, and that caused the gap.Now, the director is back with Plan Panni Pannanum with Rio Raj and Ramya Nambeessan , and he says that he’s going to be giving undivided attention to movies and focus on making films within a quicker span of time. Before we even get talking about his upcoming film, he declares that serious films were never his cup of tea. “As a film student, I was too exposed to that kind of cinema. Eventually, I decided to start with a light film like Baana Kaathadi, and had even more fun doing Semma Botha Aagatha,” begins Badri.So, what’s Plan Panni Pannanum? “Well, it is a story written by my close friend Karuna Murthy. I heard the story over coffee and really liked it. When I heard the story, I felt like an audience in the theatre. It was entertaining for me, and I was certain that it will entertain others, too,” he says.Badri says that it is hard for him to contain this film in one genre. He says, “It is a mixed genre film. It will be on the lines of Pammal K Sambandam and Kaathala Kaathala. It has travel, romance, comedy and is more dialogue-oriented. Usually, the hero will have a problem and his friend will stand by him. Here, the hero’s friend will have an issue, and our hero will travel with him to sort out his issue. Because it is largely a comedy film, we have several comedians in the film. I believe comedy can be carried only by a professional artiste. We have about 17-18 recognised artistes and they made my job easy. We have Robo Shankar, MS Bhaskar among others. Bhaskar sir comes only for about 5-6 scenes, but I was particular about having him for the role. Having said that, I haven’t cast for the sake of doing it. There is proper justification of why each of them are there in the film. It is not an insensible comedy film. S Ve Shekher sir had mentioned in one of his interviews that ‘messages’ are best given from parents and closed ones. Today’s audiences are intelligent and all they want is entertainment. There is a lot of sermonising happening in cinema anyway, and I do not want to do the same.”Rio’s debut film found mixed response. What made him choose the actor for the film? “Rio is an entertainer and he has a lovely connect with audiences. I needed a north Madras boy for the role and I felt he would work. I didn’t know him much before I started the film, but over time, I realised that he’s an effortless actor,” he says.As for Ramya, Badri didn’t even plan on casting her initially. “Ramya is a good friend and a natural performer. She doesn’t take up film just for the heck of it. I was casually talking about this film to her and she was even looking out for heroines for our film! I later realised that she would be apt for the role. It is not a film where she will come for two songs and four scenes. Her role has the same weightage as Rio’s. Actresses like Ramya, Anjali, and Aishwarya Rajesh are performers who can transform themselves into any character. I needed a heroine who speaks Tamil. She plays a today’s girl.”Today, making a movie is easy. But the hurdle arises during the release. Ask Badri about it and he says, “Well, my previous film went through this. I think it would have been received better if it had been released as planned. I think every director goes through this. All I can say is that it is tough and agonising. Things should be streamlined. A car’s tyre can’t be costlier than the car. But here, popcorn is costlier than a film’s ticket. People don’t come to the theatre to have popcorn, right? The restructuring must start from there. We can’t stop anybody from making a film. There are so many screens today. Until and unless it is a big film, I don’t understand why a small film should take over two years to release here. Nobody should dictate to me on when I should release my film. There should be transparency. Only then things will fall in place,” elaborates Badri.But is it hard to survive as a filmmaker in today’s times? He says, “It is quite difficult. Until and unless you understand the business of cinema, one cannot survive in the industry. I understood the business dynamics and this came over time as I have a lot of television exposure. You need to be clear about your film. I am a lecturer in a film institute and I keep telling my students that cinema is not the end of their lives. If you must expose your creativity, there are several platforms to showcase your talent. Having said that, the industry gives one several chances. You need to make the best use of it.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74512678,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-852834/74512678.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/i-dont-understand-why-a-small-film-should-take-over-two-years-to-release-here-badri/articleshow/74512678.cms
10,['7/03/2020'],Experts want total ban on peacock feather sale,"eacock feathers are, no doubt, a thing of beauty, coveted by many as a decorative item. The problem, though, was that to meet this demand, the birds began to be hunted, which prompted a ban on the sale of peacock feathers in 2001, in accordance with the rules of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. Unfortunately, though, the rule came with a loophole — feathers shed naturally could be collected and sold — which traders (mostly illegal) made the most of. The question, naturally, was, how does one determine if a feather is legally obtained or not? A recent case of two people selling peacock feathers in Bengaluru being let off scot-free by the forest department has put the focus back on this issue. Wildlife rescuer Rajesh Kumar M has started an online petition seeking amendment of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 to ban sale of peacock feathers completely.Rajesh says, “The killing of peacocks for feathers falls under trophy trade. After I spotted peacock feathers being sold in Bengaluru, I was told that the people selling these feathers were not in possession of any paperwork to verify the source of the feathers. What makes this whole operation look suspect is that one peacock can shed only up to 300 grams of feather and the sheer quantity that is in circulation for trade points to an illegal source, probably, poachers.”He adds that people are using the exemption in the law to kill the birds and claim natural shedding. “The last peacock census was in 1991, so there is no telling how much harm has already been done. The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change is looking at amending the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, which bans the sale of peacock feathers, since 2001,” says Rajesh. What has also irked activists is that the traders were let go without any penalty. Environmentalist Manjunath Janakiram says, “If you were to collect feathers shed by a peacock naturally, it will take quite a lot of time to get the quantity that was being peddled. These feathers are brought into Karnataka from states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, which indicates that there is organised killing of the birds. The officials should have booked a case under Section 57 of the Wildlife Protection Act, which states that it can be presumed that the person is in unlawful possession of the peacock articles in huge quantity. We are exploring legal options to stop the sale of peafowl feathers.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74512255,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-515041/74512255.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/experts-want-total-ban-on-peacock-feather-sale/articleshow/74512253.cms

Benmol, a final-year student and one of the organisers, says, “We wanted to end the last event as members of the Student Union this academic year on a high note, and what better way to do that than having pets over.”The event saw many students interact with the furry little ones, as they took part in games like jumping through hoops as well as the lemon and spoon race. The event saw breeds such as Golden Retriever, Labrador, Pugs, Shih Tzu and indie varieties among others.Mehak Gurung — a first-year student, who had brought her Rottweiler pet, named Laila, says, “I was surprised to see how calm she was even though she was surrounded by so many people. I had a lot of fun and I was happy to see so many students around my pet.”Spurthi Eyathirajulu, a second-year student, says, “It was a great opportunity for my dog Benzy — a Golden Retriever, who is quite old — to enjoy himself and bond with other pets. He became the centre of attention and the girls kept giving him belly rubs, which he really liked.

The project sees her collaborating with long-time associate, piano-player Aman Mahajan for a total of seven tracks. “It was Aman’s idea to keep the format simple — just piano and vocals. The genre is jazz, but some tracks also have a few Indian elements — like a mridangam korvai, or a traditional raaga, like raag Yaman, for instance,” explains Radha.There are two tracks in the album that capture her love-hate relationship with the city, shares Radha. Load Shedding, for instance, is an instrumental piece composed by Aman, with lyrics by Radha. It brings out the effect of the city’s frequent power cuts.The album’s title track, on the other hand is about a particular moment when Radha was abroad and missed the city’s ambience. The music video for this song will feature Bengaluru-based illustrator Paul Fernandes’ work. “When I wrote it, I actually did not have Paul’s work in mind. However, as the album came together, I figured that his art work would be the best fit for the album art and this particular music video, which captures the essence of the city. I was delighted when he gave me permission to use it. The album art shows his painting of a well-known restaurant, while the music video features his illustrations of city locales like Ulsoor lake, and the Vidhana Soudha among others,” explains Radha.The other tracks in the album, have a more personal theme. “For instance, Jailer is a track about a troubling experience I faced years ago. Had that experience happened in recent times, I would have spoken about it during the #MeToo movement. Instead, I wrote a song about it,” she shares, concluding that the album is an amalgamation of personal experiences, as well as her memories of the city.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74508040,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-170707/74508040.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/music/radha-thomas-and-aman-mahajan-find-a-muse-in-bengaluru/articleshow/74508040.cms

15,['7/03/2020'],No acquittal if witnesses turn hostile: Madras high court,"Representative image

CHENNAI: Asserting that witnesses in a criminal prosecution turning hostile has become the norm, the Madras high court has made it clear that it can no more be a ground to acquit the accused.

""The witnesses in a case are the eyes and ears of the justice system and any manipulation of those witnesses, including threat, coercion, intimidation, lure, would definitely adversely affect the prosecution case. However, a balanced approach by segregating the grain from the chaff would, in effect, unerringly point the finger at the accused, had the accused adopted such a course,"" Justice M Dhandapani said.

Witnesses are being bullied or won over by lure or lucre and they, without any moral regret, retract from their statements made previously before the police. The upshot is the acquittal of persons responsible for commission of heinous crimes — triumph of the devils and sorrow for angels, the court added.

Weeding out the culture of compromise (turning hostile) is the greatest test not only for the prosecution, but equally for the judiciary as that culture, in no way, should tilt the scales in favour of the accused, thereby allowing them to walk out scot free. The scales of justice should be maintained in balance so that the wrong doer gets punished and the innocent is freed, the judge said.

The issue pertains to an appeal moved by Radha alias Radhakrishnan challenging his conviction and 10-year sentence imposed by a trial court for attempt to murder. In his appeal, he claimed that since three prime prosecution witnesses including a victim witness turned hostile, there is nothing more with the prosecution to prove him guilty.

Opposing the appeal, additional public prosecutor Iyyapparaj explained the hardcore nature of the appellant, who is a habitual offender and against whom 35 cases are pending at various stages. He contended that there is nothing sinister in the prosecution witnesses turning hostile.

Concurring with the submissions of the prosecutor, the court said, ""In the case on hand, as held by the court below, such a course adopted by the accused cannot be completely overruled and in such a scenario, the justice delivery system should break itself from its self-imposed shackles with a view to uphold the truth and majesty of justice, lest the faith in the judicial system of the common man would start dwindling.""

The trial court, on the materials available on record, and further taking into consideration the hostile attitude exhibited by the eye witnesses has come to the right conclusion that all was not well between the time they deposed in chief and the time they deposed in cross and the intervening mid-day break has been utilised by the accused to his benefit, has analysed the whole scenario coupled with the evidence and has arrived at a just and reasonable finding, which does not warrant interference at the hands of this court, Justice Dhandapani concluded.

In the wave of pictures, campaigns and warnings over coronavirus that’s doing the rounds, one of the references to the virus is definitely grabbing attention. And it dates back to 1981! Social media posts are rife with posts on American author, Dean Koontz ’s book, Eyes of Darkness and how he may have predicted the coronavirus outbreak in it. Snapshots of a page, purported to be from the book, is going viral with its reference to a killer virus called ‘ Wuhan-400 .’ Interestingly, the real-life virus gripping the world has emanated from a city called Wuhan. Conspiracy theorists describe the outbreak as a “perfect” biological weapon. However, Dean isn’t the only author to cavort with such a subject. Several contemporary science fiction novels have employed the use of viruses — real and imaginative — in their books.This ancient Greek poem has an underlying theme of suffering. The Greeks disrespect a priest of Apollo (the son of Zeus). Angered by their action, Apollo fires a volley of arrows into their Achaean camp, bringing about a plague. This goes on for nine days till the Greeks express remorse and make a sacrifice with sheep and goats to the god.Conspiracy theorists have also pointed towards horror-fantasy author Stephen King. They believe he has predicted the coronavirus in his book, The Stand. The postapocalyptic read is about the outbreak of a super-flu named Captain Trips, and how it kills over 99% of the world’s population.It’s a battle for survival in this thriller by Michael Crichton, as scientists grapple with the outbreak of a deadly extraterrestrial micro-organism in Arizona. The virus escapes after a US research satellite carrying the deadly organism crashes into the small town there. The probe sees the biomedical scientists deal with a horrifying fumigation chamber and much more.Bioterrorism is at the helm of this one. It revolves around how a common cold is fused with one of the world's most virulent diseases, smallpox. It sees people falling prey to it and dying. A pathologist uncovers how this is a gruesome work of a killer who goes by the name Archimedes. He wants to spread the deadly 'Cobra virus' throughout New York.The sci-fi tome, Pandemic , by Scott Sigler evokes the tale of how an alien virus plays havoc by turning normal people into murderers. The American government has to do all it can to gain control on it. The third in a trilogy, this makes for more than a few tense stomach-churning moments.The medical thriller Outbreak sees the director of a clinic in LA succumbing to a contagious and highly dangerous virus, along with other patients.

And you don’t always need to rely on pricey spa facials and wraps. Take a cue from good ol’ ayurveda which expounds using natural ingredients to give you a skin glow. And the best part is these ingredients can be got right at home. From neem leaves to sandalwood and turmeric powder, rose water, ghee, basil and fenugreek leaves, nuts and more, this philosophy aims to nourish the skin and beautify you using holistic ways. Gwyneth Paltrow has spoken about panchakarma treatments, Kim Kardashian has taken to Insta to talk about amla-based skincare and Madonna, Demi Moore and Halle Berry are all said to be fans of it. There’s every reason why you ought to adopt it your regimen, too...Holistic wellness consultant Amrapali Patil says, “Ayurveda is the ancient science of India. Its treatments are sans side effects. The ingredients used in it can be found easily in your kitchen. For instance, you can make a hair mask by grounding besan, curry leaves and curd. Herbs used in ayurveda beauty treatments include turmeric, triphala, amla, beheda, haritaki, bibhitaki, nagkesar, pippali and sunthi, each having their own use. Most famous of these is multani mitti or fuller’s earth. Different decoctions are also consumed for a skin glow. Ayurveda is also constitution based — you categorise a person according to his or her dosha — vata, pitta and kapha. Based on these, the treatment is specified. A pitta person would be prone to acne rashes, a vata person is prone to dry skin and kapha persons have more fatty deposits on the skin and could be prone to issues like cystic acne. For them, the beauty treatments would include nagkesar (saffron) and kumkumadi oil (ayurvedic oil) as well as drinking a kada of manjishtha (Indian madder).”Dermatologist Dr Shefali Trasi shares a word of caution. “A lot of patients are also allergic to Ayurveda. Do one sitting and if it suits you go ahead and do it on a regular basis,” she advises.Green gram lentils or moong dal is a remedy that dates back to ancient times. It revives dull skin, helps lighten it and the moong dal scrub is used as a facial hair remover.Grind moong dal powder, chandan powder or sandalwood powder as well as orange peel powder. Add lemon juice, rose water and curry leaves to it. To moisturise the skin, soak the dal overnight and add honey to it. Another tan removing treatment involves mixing chilled dahi with moong dal powder. Apply, leave it on and then wash off.Here’s something that works to remove the harmful effects of pollution by cleansing the skin. Papaya aids in tan removal, while fuller’s earth removes grime, dust and other deposits on the skin. It also helps reduce breakouts.Mash papaya in a bowl and add honey, lemon juice, sandalwood powder and fuller’s earth powder to it.This is an age-old remedy that that uses a mix of Ayurvedic ingredients. Traditionally, brides and grooms apply it to the skin in order to get glowing for D-Day. It is believed to provide clear, dewy skin.Make a paste with haldi, gram flour (besan), sandalwood powder (chandan), rose water and milk. Apply this on the skin.Tamarind or imli is a powerhouse of antioxidants. It makes for an effective brightener and protects the skin from harmful free radicals. It also has an anti-aging effect on the skin.Mix a spoonful of tamarind pulp and salt and add cold dahi to it. Apply and then wash it off.Purifying neem is one of the best remedies to battle acne and other micro bacterial build-up on the skin. It makes for a powerful toner.Take a few neem leaves and grind them to a paste. Squeeze lemon juice into this as well as water, and mix. Apply the mask to the face and wash off with lukewarm water. You can add sandalwood to calm the skin. You can also make a paste of roe water and neem to clear blemishes and tone the skin.One of the best natural pick-me-ups for the skin, haldi-chandan evens out the texture of the skin, helping to brighten it. Over time, it adds a luminosity to the skin. Sandalwood is also considered to be anti-ageing.To reduce acne from the skin’s surface, mix turmeric powder and sandalwood powder and add a spoon of lime juice to it. Apply and wash off after 10 minutes.

19,['7/03/2020'],Kiran Karmarkar: Rinku and I are neither enemies nor are we dead for each other,"In November 2017, BT had reported that telly couple Kiran Karmarkar and Rinku Dhawan were living separately. At that time, they wanted to keep the matter private. Now, after two years, we have learnt that they are officially divorced. We spoke to the two about what went wrong in their marriage and the rapport they share today. Kiran said, “We got married in 2002. It was a 15-year-old marriage and the best part of our relationship is that we share a son. Ideally, no one wants a marriage to break, and the notion that two actors can’t make a marriage work is incorrect because marriages don’t break only in the film and TV industry. I don’t think that our marriage ended because of the demands of the profession. There came a situation when we did not agree on many things. The circumstances and situations compelled us to take our son into confidence and explain to him that we wanted to separate. But we made sure that he would not suffer in the process. Today, he doesn’t have to choose between staying with Rinku or me. He is free to stay with either of us and chooses to do whatever he wants. We have told him that together we will support him in good and bad situations, and will also correct him if he is wrong. We do go together for all our son’s activities and meet during festivals. We have made it a point that our differences will not affect the equation in the family.”Talking about incompatibility that led to their divorce, he said, “Compromise is a very subjective term. You can’t really have a yardstick on what should be the level of compromise two individuals should make in a relationship. But yes, tolerance levels are low these days. A slight provocation results in a big fight. If your car is hit by another vehicle, there is a war on the road (laughs!)” He added, “Rinku and I weren’t compatible, and so, we thought it was best to move on. When we got married, obviously, we never thought that we would come to this point, because no one can predict the future. There are individuals stuck in marriages, and their fights go to the extent of hitting each other. Thankfully, Rinku and I have handled this well, and we are neither enemies nor are we dead for each other.”Kiran is not cynical about the institution of marriage. He said, “I am not scared to take the plunge again, and I continue to believe in love. But, right now I can’t say that I want to find someone. These things are best left to destiny. A companion is every individual’s requirement. I have accepted that my first marriage did not work out, but that does not make me pessimistic about the future.”Those close to Kiran and Rinku feel that they are both strong-headed individuals, which probably led to the conflict in their marriage. When we spoke to Rinku, she said, “It is true that we are both strong individuals. But we knew that from day one, and we respected that. But, yes, in a marriage there are so many things that happen between two individuals and the outside world will never know about them. I look at things this way… two people met, got married, they tried hard to mend their differences, but it didn’t work out. We realised that we were incapable of living a good life together, and we did not want to make it miserable by bringing out the worst in each other. By the time people got to know about it, we were living separately, and eventually, we filed for a divorce. But, we are not enemies. We have both dealt with this as mature individuals and definitely because there is a child involved.”Like Kiran, Rinku too feels that one needs a companion in life, but she doesn’t want to get married again. She said, “Nobody wants to live a lonely life. A companion is important to share one’s thoughts. But if you ask me about marriage, honestly, I am done with it. My friends keep telling me to think about marriage again, but I feel what’s important is to find the right person.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74514940,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-89701/74514940.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/kiran-karmarkar-rinku-and-i-are-neither-enemies-nor-are-we-dead-for-each-other/articleshow/74514920.cms

Until now, this is the biggest opening of the year and overtook Ajay Devgn 's 'Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior' which scored around 13 crores on its opening day. The film expected to do more as there will be Holi holidays.The plot of the film revolves around a fiercely protective Ronnie who goes up against a dreaded terrorist group in Syria to save his brother Vikram (Riteish Deshmukh) from their clutches.Commenting on the preparation for giving such perfect action shots Tiger says, ""I don't have to tweak too much because being in shape [is not] a chore for me. "" And while talking about the action sequences in the film, Jr Shroff said, ""About 90 per cent of the scenes include live-action.

25,['7/03/2020'],Yes Bank: SBI set to acquire 49% in Yes Bank even as ED raids promoter Kapoor,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: A day after the Reserve Bank of India superseded the Rana Kapoor-promoted Yes Bank board and capped cash withdrawals at Rs 50,000 (Rs 5 lakh in exceptional situations) and the State Bank of India said it was “exploring an investment opportunity” in Yes Bank, the RBI on Friday came out with a “draft reconstruction scheme” under which SBI will bring in Rs 2,500 crore for a 49% stake in the crisis-ridden private sector bank.The scheme proposes full repayment of all deposits, dilution of equity, and write-off of Rs 10,800 crore of additional tier one (AT-1) bonds.In a bid to reassure depositors and markets, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said although a moratorium of 30 days had been imposed, the resolution would be much quicker. RBI has invited comments and suggestions on the scheme up to March 9, after which it will take a final view.Sources in the government said the RBI decided against merging Yes Bank with SBI because it would have put pressure on the government-owned bank’s balance sheet. The government and the RBI are hopeful SBI’s funding and Yes Bank’s “strong brand” would help turn around the bank. The reconstruction scheme envisages increasing the authorised capital of the bank manifold to Rs 5,000 crore from Rs 800 crore.While the face of shares is Rs 2, SBI will pay Rs 10 per share — that is a premium of Rs 8 — and will not reduce its holding below 26% for three years. Government sources expect SBI to get a higher-than-entry price as and when it sells down some of its stake. SBI’s investment in fresh equity will proportionately dilute the holdings of existing shareholders.While some analysts expressed surprise at the scheme as it placed shareholders’ interest above that of the AT-1 bondholders, the RBI and government sources said this was in line with Basel norms and the terms of the bond issue. AT-1 bonds are purchased by institutional investors, mutual funds and insurance companies.The scheme of reconstruction has been proposed under Section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act 1949, which gives RBI enormous powers to deal with a bank superseding any norms of the market regulator.On Friday, rating agency Moody’s downgraded the bank’s long-term deposit rating to Caa1 from B2 after the RBI’s moratorium, which the agency said constitutes an event of default.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74520496,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1855215,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-set-to-acquire-49-in-yes-bank-even-as-ed-raids-promoter-kapoor/articleshow/74520493.cms

NEW DELHI: In a major relief to governments and official agencies, the Supreme Court has cleared the air over validity of land acquisition that was initiated but could not be completed in the stipulated five-year period. The court ruled the process will be deemed lapsed only if the possession of land is not complete and no compensation been paid.

The SC further clarified that delay caused due to an interim order passed by a court has to be excluded from the computation of five years. The ruling will help speed up land acquisition and reduce litigation.

A five-judge Constitution bench of Justices Arun Mishra , Indira Banerjee , Vineet Saran , M R Shah and S Ravindra Bhat brought to an end the controversy over the land acquisition law arising from contradictory verdicts of two benches of the apex court on interpretation of Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in the Land Acquisition Act.

The issue was whether farmers who had refused to accept compensation for land acquired from them could be deemed to have been compensated if the government had deposited the money with the treasury or a court.

A Constitution bench was set up to interpret the section which says that in case of land acquisition proceedings initiated under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, where an award has been made five years or more prior to the commencement of the 2013 Act, but physical possession of the land has not been taken or the compensation not paid — the said proceedings shall be deemed to have lapsed. The appropriate government, if it so chooses, shall initiate the proceedings of such land acquisition afresh.

Enumerating the provision, the bench said, “The word ‘or’ used in Section 24(2) between possession and compensation has to be read as ‘nor’ or as ‘and’. The deemed lapse of land acquisition proceedings under the Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 takes place where due to inaction of authorities for five years or more prior to commencement of the said Act, possession of land has not been taken nor has compensation been paid. In other words, in case possession has been taken but compensation not paid, then there is no lapse. Similarly, there is no lapse if compensation has been paid but possession not taken.”

The court said Section 24(2) deals with inaction on the part of the authorities, not delay as a result of dilatory tactics and conduct of landowners. It said the word “paid” used in Section 24(2) cannot be said to include within its ken “deposit”. It brushed aside the plea of the farmers that land acquisition be invalidated if compensation amount is deposited in the treasury instead of court.

Observing that farmers should not be allowed to take advantage of litigation initiated by them against acquisition, the bench said time lapsed in court proceedings be excluded from the five-year limitation period. It said they cannot be allowed to take advantage of delaying tactics.

“...when the landowner does not accept the amount, but seeks a 202 reference for higher compensation, there can be no question of such individual stating that he was not paid the amount (he was determined to be entitled to by the collector),” it said.

27,['7/03/2020'],Tata Sons board tilts towards bid to acquire Air India,"(Representative image: PTI)

MUMBAI: The board of Tata Sons is veering around to back the proposal to acquire Air India (AI), which has been put on the block by the Centre. However, the board, which met on Friday, wants Tata Sons and its aviation partners—Singapore Airlines and AirAsia Malaysia—to resolve structural issues before putting out an expression of interest for the state carrier. This is to avoid litigation at a later date.

The deadline to submit an EoI (expression of interest) for Air India is March 17, but this will be extended, according to aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri .

Earlier this week, Tata SIA Airlines , operator of full-service carrier Vistara, had said, “Which company would not be interested in evaluating a sovereign airline of the country?” Though Vistara is leading the M&A efforts, AirAsia India, in which the Malaysian budget carrier holds 49%, will also be a part of the arrangement for the potential Air India acquisition.

AirAsia India’s shareholders’ agreement stipulates that Tata Sons cannot invest more than 10% in another budget airline without the Malaysian partner being willing to waive the covenant. So, if Vistara, in which Tata Sons owns 51%, wishes to put in a bid for Air India including its budget carrier arm Air India Express, the Malaysian partner will have to waive the covenant. In lieu of the waiver, Tata Sons has proposed a merger between AirAsia India and Air India Express to create a larger budget airline.

Tata Sons’ arrangement with Singapore Airlines is only for full-service carriers. The Vistara-Air India combo will help Tata Sons to monopolise the full-service space in India.

28,['7/03/2020'],SC commutes death sentence of man who murdered 3 minors,"Supreme Court (file photo)

NEW DELHI: At a time when the execution of the Nirbhaya case convicts is getting repeatedly postponed, the Supreme Court has commuted the death sentence of a man found guilty of killing three children in cold blood nine years ago.

A bench of Justices U U Lalit , Indira Banerjee and M R Shah concurred with the findings of the trial court and the Chhattisgarh high court to hold Manoj Suryavanshi guilty of killing two boys aged eight and six, and a four-year-old girl but commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment, which should last a minimum of 25 years, taking into account the murderer’s mental condition at the time of crime.

Suryavanshi had said he kidnapped and murdered the children when they were returning home from school to take revenge on their father, whose younger brother had eloped with his wife. “The mental condition of the accused at the time of commission of the offence … due to his wife’s elopement with the uncle of the deceased and [that] his children were deprived of the company of their mother, the mitigating circumstances are in favour of the accused to convert the death sentence to life imprisonment,” it said.

Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Shah referred to just punishment theory and said, “It is true that the court must respond to the cry of society and to settle what would be the deterrent punishment for an abominable crime. It is also equally true that a larger number of criminals go unpunished, thereby increasing criminals in society and law losing its deterrent effect.”

“It is also true that the peculiar circumstances of a given case often result in miscarriage of justice and make the justice delivery system a suspect; in the ultimate analysis, society suffers and a criminal gets encouraged. Sometimes, it is stated that only rights of criminals are kept in mind, the victims are forgotten. However, at the same time, while imposing the rarest of rare punishment, that is the death penalty, the court must balance mitigating and aggravating circumstances of the crime and it would depend upon particular and peculiar facts and circumstances of each case.”

Referring to guidelines laid down by the SC in the Bachan Singh case for bracketing a case in the rarest of rare category warranting imposition of death penalty after weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the bench said, “The mitigating circumstances in the present case, if considered cumulatively and ,more particularly, that the accused was under extreme mental disturbance because of the reasons stated herein above, we are of the opinion that, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the death penalty is not warranted and the same be converted to life imprisonment.”

32,['7/03/2020'],NGOs involved in stirs for public causes can get foreign funds: SC,"NEW DELHI: In a ruling that expands the areas of permissible activities for non-governmental organisations , the Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the Centre cannot prevent NGOs and civil society groups from receiving foreign funds if they indulge in agitations, bandhs or hartals in support of public causes, saying such action could not be termed political in nature.

A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Deepak Gupta held organisations of farmers, workers, students, which are not directly aligned to any political party but work towards advancement of political interests of these sections, are entitled to receive foreign funds under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act. After examining various provisions of the law and the rules framed under it, the apex court said such voluntary organisations cannot be penalised under the act for getting foreign funds.

“Any organisation which habitually engages itself in or employs common methods of political action like ‘bandh’ or ‘hartal’, ‘rasta roko’, ‘rail roko’ or ‘jail bharo’ in support of public causes can also be declared as an organisation of political nature, according to the guideline prescribed in Rule 3 (vi). Support to public causes by resorting to legitimate means of dissent like bandh, hartal etc cannot deprive an organisation of its legitimate right of receiving foreign contribution,” said Justice Rao, who wrote the judgment for the bench.

The court did not declare the provision unconstitutional but clarified that it would be applicable only to those organisations which are involved in active politics.

“It is clear from the provision itself that bandh, hartal, rasta roko etc are treated as common methods of political action. Any organisation which supports the cause of a group of citizens agitating for their rights without a political goal or objective cannot be penalised by being declared as an organisation of a political nature. To save this provision from being declared as unconstitutional, we hold that it is only those organisations which have connection with active politics or take part in party politics that are covered by the rule,” the court said.

The bench passed the order on a plea filed by the Indian Social Action Forum (Insaf), a voluntary organisation, challenging the validity of various provisions of the act and rules. Senior advocate Sanjay Parikh contended the act confers “unguided and uncanalised power” to the Centre to specify an organisation as an outfit of political nature — though not being a political party — to prevent it from accessing foreign funds. The words “political interests” used in the rule are vague and susceptible to misuse, he said.

The court held that “a balance has to be drawn between the object that is sought to be achieved by the legislation and rights of the voluntary organisations to have access to foreign funds. The purpose for which the statute prevents organisations of a political nature from receiving foreign funds is to ensure that the administration is not influenced by foreign funds. Prohibition from receiving foreign aid, either directly or indirectly, by those who are involved in active politics is to ensure that the values of a sovereign democratic republic are protected.”

“On the other hand, such of those voluntary organisations which have absolutely no connection with either party politics or active politics cannot be denied access to foreign contributions. Therefore, such of those organisations which are working for the social and economic welfare of the society cannot be brought within the purview of the act or the rules by enlarging the scope of the term ‘political interests’. We are of the opinion that the expression ‘political interests’ in Rule 3 (v) has to be construed to be in connection with active politics or party politics,” the court said.

BIHARSHARIF: All private clinics in Nalanda district remained shut and doctors of government hospitals boycotted outpatient department (OPD) and emergency services in support of their demand for the arrest of the killers, who shot dead their colleague Dr Priyaranjan Kumar Priyadarshi on Thursday.

The agitating doctors have demanded that Rs 5crore be given as compensation to the family of the deceased doctor, who is survived by his wife and eight-year-old son, and the immediate removal of Nalanda SP Nilesh Kumar.

All private and government hospital doctors, including Biharsharif sadar hospital and health centres across the district, responded to the boycott call given by the district unit of Indian Medical Association (IMA).

Doctors at Vardaman Institute of Sciences (VIMS), too, boycotted the OPD service on Friday, after observing a two minute silence for their slain colleague while doctors sat on a symbolic day-long dharna at the sadar hospital.

The Nalanda deputy development commissioner, Rakesh Kumar, accompanied by Biharsharif SDM Janardhan Aggarwal and SDPO Imran Perwez went to the sadar hospital and assured the agitating doctors that the culprits would be arrested soon and their other demands have been forwarded to higher authorities. However, the doctors refused to withdraw their protest till all their demands were met.

President of the district unit of IMA, Dr Shyam Bihari, said, their day-long protest on Friday was symbolic and if their demands were not fulfilled in the next 24 hours, they might go on an indefinite strike and protest in front of chief minister Nitish Kumar ’s residence on Saturday. The state IMA may give a state wide protest call on Saturday.

“Investigation into the murder is on and the culprits who shot Dr Priyadarshi will be arrested soon,” SDPO Imran Perwez said.

Dr Priyadarshi was shot dead on Thursday by some motorbike borne men while he was on his way to Gosai Math PHC under Rahui police station. The deceased doctor is a relative of former JD(U) MLA from Harnaut Engr . Sunil Kumar .

35,['7/03/2020'],Big B’s Jaya post shines spotlight on unfinished film,"Kolkata: Days after Amitabh Bachchan shared a picture of his wife, actor Jaya Bachchan , “playing Vivekananda” from an incomplete film, the director’s son recalled what went wrong during its making. Directed during the late 50s by Nabyendu Ghosh , 80% of the movie was completed before work got embroiled in controversy.

Subhankar Ghosh, the director of ‘Woh Chhokri’ (1993) and associate director of ‘Trishagni’ (1989), was also the first unit director of this film.

“I had finished my course at the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) and joined my father’s unit as the second assistant,” Ghosh said.

The film — ‘Dagtar Babu’ — was adapted from Phanishwar Nath Renu’s Hindi novel titled ‘Maila Aanchal’. Starring Dharmendra , Jaya Bachchan, Utpal Dutt and Urmila Bhatt, the music for the film was scored by RD Burman with songs by Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhonsle.

What had appealed to the director was the way the novel had woven a love story in the backdrop of the prevalent caste system in a remote village in Bihar. It narrated the story of young doctor, Prashant Kumar, who had migrated to a village in Bihar to serve the poor. But what left him surprised was that wherever he went, the first thing people asked him after knowing his name was his caste. Even when taken ill, it was the untouchability factor that was of great concern for the villagers.

In his Instagram post, Bachchan had captioned the photo, “Jaya .. in film Dagtar Babu in Bengali playing Vivekananda .. film could not be completed.” On being asked why Jaya had taken on the Vivekananda look, Ghosh said, “It was a Hindi film called ‘ Dagdar Babu ’. The doctor — played by Dharmendra — was an idealist. He considered Swami Vivekananda as his ideal. The zamindar’s daughter, played by Jaya, fell in love with him and wanted to win him over. So she decided to fake an illness. Aware of the doctor’s high regard for Swamiji, she dressed up that way. When the doctor was surprised to see that look, Jaya removed her turban to reveal her real self. It was a small romantic track in the film.”

This was Nabyendu’s second film as a director which didn’t get completed. After 80% of the film got ready, the producer and the distributor had a fall out.

Looking back, Ghosh said, “This film was made sometime during the 70s. Producer S H Munshi, who had earlier made Bimal Roy’s ‘Baap Beti’, had a fallout with the financer-distributor, Maniya Daga, from Bengal. The film was getting delayed and then the producer died. The son shifted back to Bihar and there was no one to take care of the negatives. Meanwhile, there were floods in Mumbai and the negatives drowned in the labs. As the director’s unit members, we didn’t own the negatives and couldn’t do anything. I don’t even know what happened to that family.”

JAIPUR: Rajasthan has generated the highest number of mandays, totalling 30.03 crore, of paid employment under the MGNREGA scheme among all states in the country, said deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot .

Pilot made this revelation in the state assembly late Thursday night while replying to a debate on demand for grants for the rural development, panchayti raj and public works departments.

“Rajasthan stands on top at the national level in the creation of highest number of mandays,” he said, adding the state has also been recognised at the national level and awarded for achieving this feat.

The state created 30.03 crore mandays of paid employment against a target of 30 crore in fiscal 2019-20 under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, clocking more than 100% performance, he said.

Enacted by the Manmohan Singh-led UPA I in 2005, the MGNREGA aims at enhancing the livelihood security of people in rural areas by guaranteeing 100 days of wage-employment in a financial year to rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.

In his reply, Pilot, who holds the portfolios of the PWD and the Rural Development and Panchayati Raj Department , said under the MGNREGA scheme, Rajasthan has also added the works of developing model water reservoirs, funeral and burial grounds and sports grounds in every revenue village of the state.

Accusing the previous BJP government of neglecting rural employment generation under MGNREGA, he said the Congress government began giving importance to MGNREGA schemes ever since assuming power in the state.

Talking about generation of 30.03 crore mandays against a target of 30 crore, the deputy chief minister also told the House the government is set to create 30.34 crore of mandays under MGNREGA by the end of fiscal 2019-20.

“A total of 5.88 lakh families were given 100-day employment under MGNREGA in 2018-19 while the previous BJP government gave employment to only 2.28 lakh families. The number of families who got 100-day employment in Congress government was almost double than those getting it during the tenure of the previous BJP government,” he said.

37,['7/03/2020'],"BJP stooped for lust of power, rues Nath in open letter to MP","Bhopal: With the ‘horse-trading’ political storm apparently ebbing, CM Kamal Nath wrote an open letter to the people of Madhya Pradesh, accusing BJP leaders of “stooping low in their lust for power”.

“Dear citizens, I could never have imagined that the lust for power would lead BJP leaders to such moral degeneration that they would start trading and manipulating the democratic decision of the people of this state. Today, this manipulation of BJP leaders has tried to tarnish the glorious history and tradition of this state,” he wrote, wondering if BJP leaders are “backed by sand mining mafia, extortionists and adulterators” against whom his government has initiated a crackdown.

The CM alleged that BJP is not only trying to bring down his government but also hindering the development of the state. “Today, state BJP leaders have tried to scuttle the investments and infinite opportunities coming to Madhya Pradesh, attacked the future of farmers whose loans are being waived by my government and trying to stifle employment opportunities for the youth,” the blog said.

Nath said he has complete faith in the legislators of the ruling alliance. “I am assured all my MLAs are with the state government and are committed to the development of the state,” the letter said.

“I’d like to make it very clear to BJP that in more than four decades of public life, I have never given any space to hatred, despair and negativity. When I was Union minister and BJP was ruling the state, then also I had given my maximum support to the development of Madhya Pradesh,” he wrote.

Former BJP minister Narottam Mishra — who Congress accuses of being a leader of the alleged poaching bid — contested the allegations. “Other than CM Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh, who is saying that BJP took the MLAs? Have the MLAs said it? The forest minister (Umang Singhar) tweeted that the entire episode has connection with someone who wants a Rajya Sabha ticket. They are making allegations of horse-trading and Congress MLA from Chachoura Lakshman Singh says that chief minister should not lie.”

Leader of opposition Gopal Bhargava accused the state government of acting in a “vindictive manner, targeting BJP leaders and their supporters”. “I have also been in public life for more than four decades and never seen a government with so many contradictions and failures,” he claimed.

State BJP chief VD Sharma Sharma said: “You (CM) accuse BJP of trying to destabilize the government, but you should first say what all you are resorting to save your minority government in MP. You claim to run a drive against mafia, but your government is under pressure from mining and liquor mafia.” He accused Congress of “misusing government machinery” to target political rivals.

38,['7/03/2020'],Nalanda-born diplomat pens anthem for Mars,"PATNA: Nalanda-born diplomat-turned-poet Abhay Kumar has teamed up with Kenyan music group Kapnea to bring out a Mars Anthem for our neighbouring red planet.

As NASA plans to launch Mars 2020, a Mars rover mission on July 17, 2020, Abhay has collaborated with Kenyan singer Ondiko Kevin of the Kapnea music group to bring out the Mars Anthem aimed at inspiring younger generation to pay attention to the upcoming exploration on the red planet. The music video has been made by Mishree Yadav of Nepal.

Speaking about it, Abhay said: “Mars is the new centre of space exploration where a man is likely to land soon. I wanted to write an anthem with the perspective of a Martian, the way a Martian would feel about his planet, brag about it to us earthlings. For example, its lyrics includes lines like“Earth’s twin in the Milky Way/Similar seasons, length of the day/Channels, valleys, dykes and dunes/dry ice, dust devils, two moons/vallis marineris, Olympus Mons/ highest mountains, deepest canyons...”

Abhay has penned Earth Anthem and Moon Anthem in the past. Earth Anthem has been translated into over 50 languages and is widely used to celebrate Earth Day and World Environment Day, while the Moon Anthem was telecast live on major Indian TV channels hours before landing of Chandrayan-II on the moon.

India’s own Mars Orbiter Mission-II is scheduled to be launched in 2022.

39,['7/03/2020'],Learn from British how to respect nation &amp; law: DGP,"PATNA: DGP Gupteshwar Pandey is in the news again for heaping praise on the British nationals for having great respect for their nation as well as the law. On the contrary, he castigated Indians for not having much respect for their nation and the law.

“The people of UK have fear of law of the land. They respect the law. On the contrary, the Indian citizens not only disrespect the law but also have no fear of law,” Pandey is heard saying in a video released by him from London on Thursday.

The 1987-batch IPS officer also talked about patriotism of the British nationals. “Unke ander deshbhakti kutkut kar bhari huyi hai. Wo anushashit hote hain. Koi bhi kanoon banate hain to unka shakhthi se palan karte hain. Lekin Bharat ke log jaati aur dharm ke naam per ladte hain (They are full of patriotism. They are disciplined and respect the law of the land. But the Indian citizens are divided on caste and religion),” he is heard saying in the video.

Later, trying to strike a balance, he said: “Bharat ke log agar jaati-dharm ke naam per ladna chhod de to isse sunder koi desh duniya mein nahi hai (If Indians shun fighting on caste and religion, it’s the most beautiful nation in the world).” Pandey said the Indian citizens, especially the youths, should take a lesson from the British.

The six minutes and 10 seconds video, which went viral on social media on Friday, was made while Pandey was leaving for Bristol from London after attending the two-day conference on ‘Security and Policing 2020’, which concluded on Thursday evening.

“I have visited the country earlier also. But whenever I visit the UK, I try to find out the reasons for this small and tiny country having ruled over half of the globe much earlier,” he said in the video.

The state police chief’s statement, however, evoked sharp reactions on social media. Making a sarcastic comment on his remarks, a social media user wrote, “Sir, Bihar ke sabhi thane ki police ko rishwat lene se sudhaar dijiye, sabhi logon ke dil mein kanoon ka bhay aur ijjat dono aa jayegi (Sir, reform the cops seeking bribes at the police stations in the state and people will have both respect as well as fear of law).”

Another user wrote, “Bhrashtachar ka dusra naam Bihar police hai (corruption is synonymous with Bihar police).”

This is not the first occasion when Pandey has landed in controversy for his remarks. Recently, a video went viral in which he was heard casting aspersions on the ‘thanedars’ (incharge of the police stations) and the village ‘chaukidars’ (watchmen) for their failure to check rampant liquor smuggling in ‘dry’ state. “Bina thanedar aur chaukidar ki mili bhagat se sharab nahi bik sakti hai (liquor can’t be sold without the tacit support of the SHOs and the village chaukidar),” he had told a gathering at Aurangabad.

40,['7/03/2020'],Drone survey of Patna rail project done: Minister,"PATNA: Urban development and housing department (UDHD) minister Suresh Sharma said in the state assembly on Friday that Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has completed the drone survey work on the construction of 31.39km of Patna metro rail.

Sharma said DMRC is engaged in conducting soil tests along the 31.39km route. The total expenditure on executing the Patna Metro Rail Project (PMRP) has been estimated to be Rs13,366.77 crore. He was replying to the House debate on his department’s annual budget of Rs7,213.71 crore for 2020-21 fiscal. A cut motion was moved by RJD member Lalit Kumar Yadav, but the budget was passed by voice vote, while the opposition members walked out of the House.

Sharma said work on Patna Master Plan 2031, covering an area of 1,167 square km and seven other urban agglomerates, has begun. In connection with the same, steps have been initiated to select a consultancy firm to prepare the zonal development plan. An action plan was also being made to develop satellite towns in and around Bihta, Naubatpur, Beldarichak, Daniyawan (Fatuha) and Khusrupur.

The seven urban agglomerates consist of Patna Municipal Corporation, nagar parishads of Danapur, Khagaul and Phulwarisharif, as well as nagar panchayats of Maner, Naubatpur and Fatuha. Within the master plan are located 575 revenue villages and 13 blocks. The land use of the area falling under the master plan has already been fixed.

Sharma also said steps have also been taken to prepare the GIS based master plan of 26 towns in the state, while directives have been issued to all the municipal corporations to take requisite steps in line with ease of doing business — like online building permit system. For this, Bengaluru-based e-Gov Foundation has been asked to develop the required software, besides doing the geographic information system (GIS) mapping, property survey and web customization.

Women MLAs demand 33% quota in legislature: Cutting across party lines, women members of the state assembly entered the well of the House on Friday demanding 33% reservation in the state legislature and Parliament. They also carried placards displaying their collective rights. Their demand received sympathetic concern from Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary to mark the International Women’s Day due on March 8.

The Speaker said it was really heartening to see and know that women had become aware of their rights and were also pressing for their fulfilment both globally and in the country. The Speaker said it was in this spirit that a couple of years ago, he had even asked a woman MLA to conducted the House proceedings. He was referring to the JD(U) member and former minister Leshi Singh, the Dhamdaha MLA.

However, they are closely assessing the developments in these countries and giving advice to customers accordingly.“Some of the destinations like Bali, Maldives, South Africa, Mauritius and Sri Lanka are still open for travel and we are getting inquiries from travellers.

Many parts of the city including Chowk Bazaar, Majura Gate, Nanpura, Udhana, Varachha, railway station, Adajan and Palanpur Patia received light to moderate shower accompanied by low-density winds. The shower continued for half an hour which resulted in low-lying areas getting waterlogged in some parts of the city.

Parts of Navsari, Dang and Valsad districts received light to moderate showers. Gandevi taluka in Navsari district received 1mm rainfall. After cloudy atmosphere in the morning, it rained at several places across the region.

At Jilani bridge across Tapi river which connects Adajan and Ved Road, a car skidded at the sharp turning from Adajan side and rammed into another car.

PATNA: An FIR has been lodged against unknown persons after a seized SUV parked in front of Agamkuan police station in Patna City was stolen on Thursday. The matter came to light on Thursday morning only after which the officers posted at the police station got cold feet.

It is the second such incident in which someone dared steal a vehicle from police station’s premises. Earlier, the official vehicle of special branch SP was stolen from the police lines just besides Sachivalaya police station on the intervening night of October 8 and 9, 2018. The SP’s vehicle could not be recovered yet.

When contacted, Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said an FIR was lodged against unknown person.

Agamkaun police station SHO Abhijeet Kumar said the vehicle was seized from near Zero Mile a fortnight back after it had collided with another vehicle. “There were four occupants, including the driver, inside the SUV and they were in an inebriated state. They were creating ruckus after which police had arrested and forwarded them to jail,” he said.

The SHO said the vehicle was parked outside the police station building which has no periphery. The matter surfaced after someone spotted that the vehicle was missing, he said.

In his complaint, Dharmendra Goswami (36) alleged that his five-year-old son Premgiri was abducted by main accused in the case, Solanki and his nephew Pratap alias Shiva Solanki, Usmanmohammed Qazi and three more unidentified aides from near Diu checkpost at Ahmedpur Mandvi of Una, while Goswami was deposing before a CBI court in Ahmedabad on February 1, 2018.

As soon as Goswami learnt about the abduction, he complained to the court which did not record his deposition. The court then handed over an inquiry into the case to the CBI. As soon as the court hearing got over, Premgiri was released at the same place from where he was abducted on the same day, Goswami said.

“On July 27, 2019, the CBI recorded the statement of Goswami. The CBI conducted an inquiry into the abduction case and submitted its report to the court. Following the instruction of the CBI court, Una police station registered an offence,” said an official from Una police station.

Talking to TOI, Goswami said: “At the time of my deposition, I had complained to the court that I was being arm-twisted in order not to depose before the court. Still the persecution against all the 38 witnesses in the Jethava murder case is going on unabated.”

Last year, a CBI court had sentenced Solanki and six others to life imprisonment for the murder of Jethava. Jethava was gunned down by two bike-borne assassins on July 20, 2010.

The CBI had arrested Solanki and his nephew Shiva in November 2013 and on July 11, 2019 respectively for their alleged role in Jethava murder.

GAIRSAIN: Two days after announcing that Gairsain will be the new summer capital of the state, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat took the first step to look into the issue of water crisis in the region.

Gairsain and adjoining areas face an acute water shortage, which is likely to deepen once infrastructure development activities start, a concern which officials said, has motivated the state government to address the water issue on priority.

Rawat inspected the location where the artificial Chaurada jheel (lake) is to be developed by the state government. The CM said that he has asked officials to develop a lake that could cater to the needs of 31,000 people by 2070. Rawat added that his government was ""making long-term arrangements for Gairsain as people in high numbers are expected to arrive there once the summer capital comes into existence."" “I have asked authorities to ensure that all arrangements for the lake are in place at the earliest and the project is completed as soon as possible,” said the CM.

The lake is to come up near Ramganga close to the assembly building premises at Bhararisain. “Earlier, the plan was to develop it near Gairsain but I asked the authorities to come up with the project near Bhararisain. I have directed them to prepare a design through which we can further increase the capacity of the lake keeping in mind the future requirements,” the CM added.

While the initial groundwork for the project would be done this month itself, the tender process would be over by April this year, the CM said. “Soon, we will look into other matters such as mini secretariat and other related projects for developing the infrastructure of Gairsain,” Rawat said.

MUMBAI: RBI governor Shaktikanta Das has indicated that investors would not have to wait for 30 days for the moratorium on Yes Bank to be lifted and a resolution was likely much earlier. “You will see very swift action on the part of the RBI to put in place a scheme to revive the bank,” said Das, speaking to reporters on the sidelines of Assocham’s annual banking summit.

Responding to a query on why the RBI took the decision now, Das said that the central bank is always accused of acting prematurely. “A market-based resolution, a bank-led, investor-led resolution is always preferable. Naturally you have to give time to the management to take whatever steps they need to take,” said Das.

He added that the bank did try over several months to resolve its problems. “When we found that it was not working out and we could not wait any longer, the RBI decided to intervene. The timing is appropriate and I can assure that the RBI will come out with a scheme very shortly,” said Das.

Earlier in his speech, Das said that lenders need to look beyond the traditional bank lending system of relying on financial statements and collateral of the borrower. “With increased availability of data from several sources, including GSTN, income tax, credit bureaus, etc, it is now possible to appraise the MSME loan proposals expeditiously by doing due diligence online,” said Das.

He added that the new intermediaries that RBI will license — account aggregators (AA) — will provide lenders access to potential borrower’s financial information at a single point with their consent. “Furthermore, emergence of fintech companies has made it possible to assess credit worthiness of MSMEs by utilising unexplored data sources such as digital transaction trails, data generated through e-commerce sites, etc,” said Das.

53,['7/03/2020'],Worried depositors make beeline at Yes Bank branches in Hubballi-Dharwad,"Hubballi/Dharwad: Thousands of panicky depositors on Friday rushed to the branch of Yes Bank on Club Road in Hubballi and on old PB Road in Dharwad to withdraw their money. Most of them were in shock with restrictions imposed by the Reserve Bank of India across the Bank's branches.

They waited patiently in serpentine queues armed with cheque books and Aadhaar cards to withdraw their funds as both net banking and the bank's mobile app services were down.

With withdrawals capped at Rs 50,000 per depositor, tension among customers was evident. Banks had deployed private security guards to manage the crowd.

Madhusudan HS, a private employee, who has his salary account with Yes Bank said he used the bank’s ATM card at a petrol bank on Friday morning. ""It showed some technical error. I paid in cash. As I reached office, I heard that the bank is in crisis. I rushed to the bank but officials there insisted that I bring a cheque. I had left my cheque book at home. So I had to use the withdrawal slip and furnish my original identity proof,"" he said.

Several customers were seen arguing with bank officials to allow them to withdraw their fixed deposits and money from their SB accounts. The ATM located beside the bank on PB Road was running dry angering customers.

Even though staff members tried to pacify customers, not many were willing to hear them out.

Basavaraj, a distressed customer, said his father had a FD for Rs three lakh. ""My sister's wedding is in May. We are tensed how we are going to meet the expenses, as the bank has capped withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account for a month,"" he added.

Neeta, a college student, was most relieved after she withdrew Rs 25,000 from the bank. ""My parents stay abroad. They used to transfer money to this account regularly. I had all of Rs 25,000 in my account and was most worried when news of the crisis broke across TV channels. I will now have to open an account in another bank,"" she said.

None of the staff spoke to the media or agitated customers who demanded that bank employees explain as to when the crisis will be resolved, as they struggled for cash with cheques and withdrawal slips.

""We are not allowed to speak to the media in this regard. Attending to customers is our priority,"" said a senior bank official.

Mumbai: Among the many hit by the Yes Bank crisis could be those investors who have invested in the hugely oversubscribed IPO for SBI Cards that closed on Thursday. After RBI put several restrictions on withdrawal of funds from the private sector lender, merchant bankers are now grappling with the issue about how all those applications in the SBI Cards IPO that came through Yes Bank will be handled.

Markets regulator Sebi is also reviewing the situation, looking for a solution. In the SBI Cards IPO, which was subscribed over 22 times and garnered about Rs 2 lakh crore, several investors applied using Applications Supported by Blocked Amount ( ASBA ) facility, UPI and cheques.

On Thursday, RBI put a Rs 50,000 per month withdrawal limit from all Yes Bank accounts while the payments for SBI Cards IPO is slotted to be debited from investors’ accounts by Wednesday, after the allotments are completed by the merchant bankers. As the name suggests, ASBA is a process where the amount for which an investor applies in an IPO, is blocked by the bank till allotment of shares in the offer is completed by the merchant bankers.RBI and Sebi are yet to comment on the situation.

According to sources, ASBA worth nearly Rs 1,400 crore from Yes Bank had come in the SBI Cards IPO. In addition, there were about 5,900 applications through UPI through Yes Bank, worth about Rs 19 crore. Sources said Yes Bank has already accepted all the applications and blocked the amounts in the respective customer accounts. Now the lender has till Monday to send the final list of IPO applicants to the merchant bankers.

PATNA: Traders of Mairwa Bazar in Siwan district blocked the Mairwa-Majhauli road and disrupted vehicular traffic for about an hour on Friday to protest the murderous attack on a wholesale dealer of building construction material, Nagendra Prasad.

Prasad was referred to a Gorakhpur hospital for treatment where his condition is stated to be stable. Two motorcycle-borne criminals opened fire causing bullet injuries to Prasad when he was sitting in his shop at Mairwa around 9pm on Thursday.

Siwan SP Abhinav Kumar said efforts were on to ascertain the identity of the assailants, who fled towards the Uttar Pradesh border after committing the crime. “The reason behind the incident couldn’t be immediately known,” he said.

The local traders, however, blamed the Mairwa police’s failure to initiate any action against the extortionists, who have threatened several businessmen with dire consequences for not following their diktats. “Police haath par haath rakh kar baithi hai (Police are sitting idle),” a local resident, Satyendra Kumar , said.

PATNA: Former Union minister Manoj Sinha, who represented Ghazipur (Uttar Pradesh) in the Lok Sabha thrice, has emerged as the frontrunner among the BJP probables for a Rajya Sabha seat from Bihar.

Notification for the biennial election was issued on Friday, but no leading political party has so far officially declared its candidates for the Upper House election to be held on March 26.

Altogether five vacancies from Bihar will be created in the Upper House following the retirement of Harivansh, Kahkashan Perween and Ram Nath Thakur of JD(U) besides Dr C P Thakur and R K Sinha from BJP on April 9. Sources in the BJP said the party’s top leadership has made up its mind not to resend either Dr Thakur or R K Sinha to the Rajya Sabha due to various reasons.

“As the party has decided to drop Dr Thakur, a towering Bhumihar leader, it wanted to make up by fielding a candidate from the same caste. Other Bhumihar leaders are also in the race, but Manoj, because of his proximity with the party’s top leaders, has emerged as the frontrunner,” a senior BJP leader, who didn’t want to be identified, told TOI on Friday.

The first preferential vote of 42 MLAs would be required for a candidate’s entry into the Rajya Sabha. The BJP has 54 MLAs in the 243-member state assembly. As per its strength, the saffron party can send only one member to the Upper House.

Lalu Prasad’s RJD, with its 81 MLAs and support from allies like Congress (26) and friendly CPI-ML (3), can send two members to the Rajya Sabha. While RJD itself has a long list of aspirants, ally Congress, sources say, has been exerting pressure to spare one of the two seats to it on the plea that Lalu had assured to give one Rajya Sabha seat to the party during the distribution of Lok Sabha seats among the Grand Alliance partners in 2019.

Sources in RJD said Congress wants to field former Patna Sahib MP Shatrughan Sinha as its candidate. Shatrughan had met Lalu in the Ranchi hospital on February 15 this year.

RJD’s Rajya Sabha member from Jharkhand , Prem Chand Gupta, whose term is ending on April 9, is one of the main contenders for the RS ticket from Bihar.

Sources in RJD said leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Friday went to Delhi to hold talks with the Congress leadership on the Rajya Sabha election. “RJD has authorized Lalu to take decision on the candidates for Rajya Sabha election. He will declare the names at an appropriate time,” RJD spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan told TOI.

The district hospitals would also do the screening of patients with chest pain, after which they would be provided early diagnostic care, so that they could be referred to the hub concerned. The training of the doctors and medical experts at the district hospitals would also be conducted to give cardiac emergency care to patients.

With respect to the other short-notice question of Yadav, Pandey said the state government provided Rs8.84 crore and Rs55 crore in two chunks to Bihar State Health Society for 2019-20 fiscal as the state share under Ayushman Bharat scheme of the Centre.

Back in 2018-19, the state health society had received Rs138.83 crore, of which Rs102.66 crore had been spent till February 2020.

PATNA: Three people, suspected to have connections with Pakistani nationals, were arrested from Gopalganj and Siwan districts for their alleged involvement in duping a Delhi resident of huge money under the garb of ‘ Kaun Banega Crorepati ’ lottery, police said on Friday.

Acting on a tip-off, a joint team of the Delhi and Gopalganj police arrested Imtiyaz Ali (20), Irfan Ali (20) and Santosh Kumar (22) on Thursday. Police said Santosh was arrested from Gopalganj and Imtiyaz and Irfan from Siwan.

Siwan SP Abhinav Kumar , however, said he had no information about any such arrest from the district. “I will let you know after verifying the matter,” he said.

The three were arrested on the basis of a complaint lodged against them by a woman from Najafgarh in New Delhi. The woman had accused them of duping her of a little over Rs 40 lakh on the pretext of her selection for reward under ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati’ show.

During investigation, it came to light that the woman fell into the trap after receiving a WhatsApp call from Pakistan in March last year. The caller had informed the woman that she was selected for the reward of Rs 25 lakh and asked her to deposit the money in the bank account to pay GST and other charges.

The racketeers later collected more money from the woman by claiming that the reward money had been increased to Rs 75 lakh. She could realize that she had fallen victim to a racket only when the entire amount was withdrawn from her bank account.

Gopalganj SDPO Naresh Paswan said the local police cooperated with the Delhi police team. “We have nothing to do with the arrest of the suspects. No case is pending against any of the suspects in the district,” he said.

Sources said the trio revealed that they were in touch with the mastermind of the racket, Rauf, a resident of Islamabad in Pakistan. The trio was paid something between 20% and 25% as commission while the rest of the amount was deposited in the bank accounts of Rauf.

NAGPUR: Entire security apparatus in the city, including police, intelligence agencies and state ATS went into a tizzy for a few hours after two “suspicious” youths were found shooting a video using mobiles and clicking selfies near Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) headquarters in Mahal on Thursday.

The two were detained and thoroughly interrogated. The duo was, however, let off on Friday after recording their statements.

According to sources, two Bengaluru-based short film makers, in their mid-20s, had gone to attend an international short film festival at Raipur in Chhattisgarh . They were supposed to board a train to Bengaluru on Thursday, but missed it. Later, they reached Nagpur to take a late evening train from here.

The youngsters, one of whom has studied journalism while another has completed a film direction course, decided to visit the RSS headquarters. It was while filming the place that they were spotted by one of the locals who alerted the police.

The two were rounded up by Kotwali police for interrogation. Other intelligence agencies and state anti-terrorist squad (ATS) sleuths also reached the police station to check the antecedents of the duo.

Categorized as a highly sensitive zone following a terrorist attack bid in 2006, photography and videography has been restricted at the RSS headquarters. Three terrorists were gunned down near the HQ in a pre-dawn operation then. The RSS, known for its hardline pro-Hindutva stand, has been under threat from several organizations, including anti-India outfits operating from foreign soil.

During questioning, police checked the duo’s social media accounts and also the content in mobiles. The cops also contacted relatives of the youths to verify the information disclosed by them.

According to a source in the police, the two have made films, wrote articles and posted them on social media. The two had also posted some of their films on a social media channel.

MUMBAI: Several of the top mutual fund houses, along with some smaller ones, that held Yes Bank’s debt instruments have been hit by the crisis at the private lender as well as the proposed rescue package. Fund houses were holding commercial papers as well as “additional Tier 1” bonds of Yes Bank and the values of most of these holdings have been written down fully, experts said. However, not many funds hold Yes Bank’s stocks since troubles in the lender started about a year ago.According to estimates, fund houses together held Yes Bank’s debt papers worth about Rs 2,800 crore as of January end. Data for February is yet to be published. Among the fund houses which had Yes Bank’s papers and have been hit due to the RBI decision are Nippon India MF, Franklin Templeton MF, UTIMF and Kotak MF. While some of the fund houses have already segregated their Yes Bank holdings from other holdings, others are yet to do the same.The write-offs were also triggered by action by rating agencies, which downgraded bonds to ‘D’, meaning default status. Of all Yes Bank’s debt papers, the additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds have been fully written off by the RBI, which surprised fund managers since these were considered quasi-equity instruments. If these bonds are fully extinguished, investors will not get any money on these.“In the proposed Yes Bank restructuring, it is proposed to write off AT 1 bonds. This is the first time when AT 1 bonds are written off ahead of equity. Equity shareholders will still own 51 % of restructured bank, but AT1 bond holders will suffer full loss,” said a top fund manager.The troubles for debt funds seem to be unending that started with the crisis in IL&FS in September 2018, followed by at DHFL and then Altico Capital, fund industry players said.Among the many hit by the Yes Bank crisis could be those investors who have invested in the hugely oversubscribed IPO for SBI Cards that closed on Thursday.After RBI put several restrictions on withdrawal of funds from the private sector lender, merchant bankers are now grappling with the issue about how all those applications in the SBI Cards IPO that came through Yes Bank will be handled.Markets regulator Sebi is also reviewing the situation, looking for a solution. In the SBI Cards IPO, which was subscribed over 22 times and garnered about Rs 2 lakh crore, several investors applied using ASBA facility, UPI and cheques.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74525273,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-151426,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mfs-holding-yes-bk-papers-hit-hard/articleshow/74520404.cms

Due to payment blockage, merchants and manufacturers are facing severe liquidity crisis.”Kathiriya added, “Diamond trading in Mahidhapura and Varachha diamond markets has been severely affected due to weak demand for polished diamonds and blockage of payment by traders in Hong Kong and China in the past one month. Trading has been reduced to just 20%.”Industry sources said China and Hong Kong are largest markets for polished diamonds after the United States. About 40% of polished diamonds to the tune of $8 billion are exported to China via Hong Kong. While Chinese market is totally closed, Hong Kong market is shut till April 24 with the government announcing holiday in schools and colleges.Diamond industry analyst, Aniruddha Lidbide, told TOI, “The situation in diamond markets in Surat is such that nobody is ready to purchase diamonds due to severe liquidity crisis. As coronavirus is spreading to other diamond consuming countries like the US, Europe etc., the demand for diamonds is only going to fall further.”Venus Jewels chairman Sevanti Shah said, “The liquidity crisis will increase due to payment issues in Hong Kong and China. Also, the buyers have stopped coming to India due to coronavirus outbreak.

68,['7/03/2020'],Re 1 per litre VAT hike on petrol and diesel could fuel price rise,"Mumbai: Brace for a hike in petrol and diesel rates as the state budget on Friday proposed an increase in the value added tax ( VAT ) on both by Re 1 per litre.

The VAT on petrol and diesel is already high in Maharashtra, with Mumbai recording the highest price of petrol across all cities in the country. The state collects as much as 26% VAT on petrol and 24% on diesel in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai; elsewhere in the state, it is 25% on petrol and 21% on diesel. This is besides the central excise duty, cess and dealer commission. Over the basic price of petrol, the Centre and the state together impose taxes and levies totalling around Rs 40. The current rates of petrol and diesel in Mumbai are Rs 76.83 and Rs 66.82, respectively.

Deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar, though, said the Re 1 per litre hike in VAT will enrich the state exchequer by Rs 1,800 crore per annum. “The government will create a special dedicated fund called ‘Green Fund’ and the additional collection of VAT from the proposed levy will be transferred in this fund,” he said while reading out his budget speech. “The special fund will be utilized for conservation of environment, specifically for projects related to sewage disposal and waste management and such other projects,” said Pawar.

Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis opposed the move. He told mediapersons after the budget that it was “a huge burden on not just the common man, but also transporters and farmers. Diesel is an important component in the operational costs for those transporting goods while it is also relevant to those in agriculture (equipment, vehicles, etc). So it will be a major setback to scores of citizens across the state.”

Pawar, though, said, “Given issues like climate change, I hope people of the state will support the move. Petrol prices in the previous government’s tenure were much higher than today and so it will not be like we are introducing a huge hike.” When asked if hike in fuel prices will have a cascading effect on food prices and other goods, he said the government will review these regularly.

Petrol Dealers’ Association secretary Chetan Modi said the VAT of 26% in Mumbai is the highest in the country and this tax is in the range of 20-22% in other cities. “The state government earns maximum revenue from VAT on petrol and diesel and does not share a single paisa with the Centre. Our association has repeatedly petitioned the government to reduce VAT in Maharashtra, and an increase is unwarranted,” he said.

He said the dealer commission was a paltry Rs 1.82 per litre and not even Rs 2 a litre as should be the case.

Eyewitnesses said the driver of the van, used for carrying children of a play school, was in an inebriated state. However, there was no schoolchild in the van when the incident occurred.

SHO of Ramkrishna Nagar police station Manoj Kumar Singh said the van was lying abandoned on the road when the police reached the spot.

“The injured people were rushed to a hospital for treatment. Since no complaint has so far been lodged in connection with the accident, we have not seized the vehicle,” the SHO added.

Many celebrities, including singers and dancers, will also attend Holi Milan events. Several events have been organized by women groups, housing societies, water parks, hostels and schools.Ambpali handloom and handicraft multistate cooperative society president Archana Singh, who will be organizing a Holi Milan event on International Women’s Day on Sunday, said: “It’s our annual event where we invite people from rural areas as well.

Besides, it is not a huge gathering.”Sagar, an official at a water park in Danapur area, said over 2,000 people have already made bookings for Holi Milan event. “From Bhojpuri and Bollywood music by renowned disc jockeys (DJs) to pool party and unlimited food and refreshments, the pre-Holi event will have everything to refresh the mood of Patnaites.

Several rally participants were seen moving on motorbikes without helmet. The roadside vendors also had to face the wrath of the rallyists, who thrashed a few of them for their audacity not to remove their wooden carts from the roads to ensure smooth flow of the vehicles.

Ram Naresh Choudhary (48), a fruit seller at Kargil Chowk, said, “I was roughed up for not removing my ‘rickshaw thela’. It seems that a few of them were drunk. They were not ready to listen to my pleas.”

The rally, which began from the Millar School ground, crossed IT roundabout, Dak Bungalow, Kargil Chowk and then moved towards the Chiraiyatand flyover leading to traffic congestion at different points. The rally mostly comprising youths later culminated into a meeting near Moin-ul-Haq stadium at Rajendra Nagar.

VIP president Mukesh Sahni, former CM and HAM (S) president Jitan Ram Manjhi, former Union minister and RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha and former minister and RJD leader Uday Narain Choudhary led the rally. They were seen moving in a pickup van. However, Congress leaders were conspicuous by their absence.

The VIP chief later told TOI that the purpose of the rally was to create awareness about the supreme sacrifice of Jubba Sahni.

72,['7/03/2020'],Speak for India finalists debate on campus politics at grand finale,"Kolkata: A war of words laced with dissent, disagreement and sarcasm was followed by camaraderie fostered over coffee and cookies at the finale of Speak for India, a youth empowerment CSR initiative by Federal Bank in association with The Times of India on Friday afternoon. The first edition of Speak for India in Bengal, which witnessed more than 18,000 youths from 600 colleges in the state registering for the debate, concluded with Abhigyan Saha of Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata, walking away with the first prize.

The jury included actor and theatre personality Kaushik Sen, director Sudeshna Roy, cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar and elocutionist and actor Sujoy Prasad Chatterjee.

Responding in favour of the motion — “if students should engage in campus politics” — Saha built his discourse around how students were leading the protests against the new citizenship law, police brutalities on students, hike in fee in colleges and universities and fascism. “Students are on the front line of the agitations around the country. In our own city, students of Jadavpur University and Presidency University are standing up for issues. If students distance themselves from campus politics where will we get the leaders of tomorrow? We must not forget that those in power today in the state and in the Centre emerged from campus politics. Campus politics must be constructive, peaceful and revolve around issues,” said Saha.

But he was up against a tough opponent in Paramita Nandi from St Xavier’s College in Burdwan, who launched her attack by saying campus politics would not help one clear examinations or “fetch two meals in future”. “Time has come to think if we want to waste taxpayers’ money by engaging in campus politics or studying hard to give back to the city what we get from it. It only distracts us from our studies,” said Nandi.

Shyam Srinivasan, MD and CEO of Federal Bank, said he found the quality of debating in the state among the top in the entire country. “Speak for India is an initiative to give students a platform to develop and acknowledge their oratory skills,” he said.

No jobs will be lost. The banks will merge from April 1. After announcing the share swap ratio on Thursday, Indian Bank MD and CEO Padmaja Chundru told TOI, “The two public sector banks have a total of 105 zonal and administrative offices across the country, post consolidation it will stand between 75-80 zonal offices. The merged bank will be headquartered in Chennai, while also having a significant presence in Kolkata, Delhi, Lucknow and Mumbai.” On employee strength and consolidation, Chundru said “There will be consolidation at the top level, and but not at the Scale III or IV level. We are already facing shortage of staff and cannot lose our employees at the customer facing branches.” Indian Bank sees about 1,000 employees retire this year.

From the overall 6,062 branches of the two banks, there is an overlap of 200 branches which will be consolidated going forward, she added.

On the government stake, she said “It has gone up from 81% as of December quarter, to 83% as of today. For Allahabad Bank, it stands at 93% post the announcement of share exchange ratio.” In February, 2020 , the Government had infused a capital of Rs 2,500 crore in Indian Bank, which was propose during the merger proposal with Allahabad Bank in 2019.

74,['7/03/2020'],"Yes Bk crisis: UPI’s use dives 40%, PhonePe lines go dead","Digbijay.Mishra@timesgroup.com

Bengaluru: An unexpected fallout of the Reserve Bank of India’s moratorium on Yes Bank was a disruption of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) offered by fintech firms, which accounts for the bulk of digital transactions in the country. UPI transactions were down by about 40% on Friday, largely because PhonePe — which sees 20 million transactions a day — could not operate as it is plugged into Yes Bank to provide UPI-based account-to-account transfer services. Peer-to-peer payments, online merchant payments, and in-store QR code-based payments were some of the services that were hit.

Late Friday night, a PhonePe spokesperson told TOI that peer-to-peer UPI transactions were back. A source said that the RBI and the National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) have allowed PhonePe to switch to ICICI Bank even as it lets users retain the Yes Bank UPI IDs after migration. This was crucial as current norms mandate customer consent before changing the UPI handle. PhonePe will finish the migration for merchant payments in coming days.

In January, Yes Bank processed 39% of the 1.3 billion UPI transactions in the country. This was because PhonePe clocked around 570 million transactions, and most of it came from UPI. Other tech platforms that used Yes Bank, such as food delivery application Swiggy and B2B commerce player Udaan, also saw failures earlier on Friday in their UPI payments option.

PhonePe parent Flipkart group and MakeMyTrip group platforms have partnerships with Yes Bank for UPI payments, which were affected. PhonePe, which hitherto relied only on Yes Bank to provide UPI identities to customers, was forced to accelerate talks with ICICI Bank to use its services. There is no indication when all the services will be restored.

The PhonePe outage also divided the fintech industry, with Paytm engaging in guerrilla marketing, sending out messages to customers that said, ‘Payments app not working? Switch to Paytm’. This was followed by Paytm and PhonePe exchanging heated messages on their official Twitter handles.

Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma said this (PhonePe’s unavailability) is a lesson and reminder that the NPCI should not allow such apps to depend solely on one bank. “This is a lesson and reminder that NPCI should only allow payment service providers who are issuing handles on behalf of multiple banks, not just one. It should also not allow more than a 33% market share for any single payments application. This is an example of how over-dependence between a few players can send things into a tailspin,” he said.

While Paytm owns a bank, Google Pay, another third-party UPI app, works with four banks to issue UPI handles.

Besides the app-based payments, there was an impact on in-store UPI payments through QR codes. BharatPe, which enables merchants to receive payment from any UPI app, has put a fleet-on-ground team to replace QR-codes with those issued by ICICI Bank. While PhonePe has 10 million merchants, BharatPe has 4 million. BharatPe’s founder and CEO Ashneer Grover said about 20% of its QR-codes are by Yes Bank and rest were moved to ICICI Bank over the last six months. “We have sent our team to merchant locations to replace existing Yes Bank QR-codes,” he added.

The water resistant shoes, socks and gloves with anti-microbial properties made using the polyester, cotton and lycra fabrics has been developed by scientists at the Man Made Textile Research Association (MANTRA) in Surat.

With Gujarat having more than 8.50 lakh hectares of land under paddy cultivation, farmers and labourers working in the farm fields will get protection from leptospirosis and other deadly diseases.

According to state health department, 322 deaths due to leptospirosis has been reported from across the state—majority from south Gujarat—in the past decade.

Dr Munjal Parikh, senior scientist at MANTRA said, “Farmers are not comfortable with the gum-boot as they get stuck in the muddy water. So, we thought of developing light weight water resistant shoes with anti-bacterial property for protection.”

The project was conceived three years ago after studying the working pattern of the farmers in Surat and South Gujarat. The farmers were suggested to wear gumboots, but due to its weight it turned out to be counter productive.

Dr Syamal Maiti, senior scientist at MANTRA told TOI, “It took us three years to develop the shoes, socks and gloves. We have conducted successful trials in the fields in south Gujarat. More than 100 kits containing shoes, socks and gloves have been distributed free-of cost to the farmers in Navsari and Surat and they are using it successfully.”

Paresh Puna Talavia, a resident of River Heaven apartment at Yamuna Chowk in Mota Varachha and trustee of a private international school in Velanja village in Kamrej had come in contact with the victim, a divorcee and mother of two teenage children, about a year ago.

The woman and her children stay in a house adjoining Talavia’s relative’s in Mota Varachha.

79,['7/03/2020'],Gujarat: Wanted drones to contain mosquito menace in Rajkot,"Representative image

RAJKOT: The buzzing sound of mosquitoes is giving sleepless nights to residents of Saurashtra ’s commercial capital.

A little over a fortnight after mosquito menace sparked clashes traders between traders of Rajkot market yard and police, huge swarms of mosquitoes have literally laid a siege to the city.

The problem has assumed such serious proportions that the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) has been forced to take help of a drones to control the pests. The civic body has already called for 60 fogging machines and immediately floated a tender to buy drone to spray chemicals to kill the mosquitoes.

Ironically, the sudden surge of mosquitoes in the city is being attributed to the cleaning of water weeds from Aji river bed that was the main cause of the menace in market yard and resultant violence. The sewage water of entire city accumulated in Aji riverbed behind the market yard, thus making it a breeding ground of mosquitoes. After the violent agitation by traders and closure of the market yard for nearly a week, the administration was forced to clear the water weeds that had grown in a stretch of 2.5km to 3km due to sewage. The cleaning was done on the instructions of chief minister office. A special weed removing machine was brought from Surat for this purpose.

Experts and RMC officials said this has resulted in mosquitoes spreading inside the city.

Municipal commissioner Udit Agrawal said, “Mosquitoes can fly up to four km. We believe that the reason for the severe menace is the removal of water weed in Bedi area.”

“We have deployed 60 fogging machines and have started the process to acquire a de-weeding machine. We have also floated the tender to acquire a drone to sprinkle chemicals from the air in the some areas,” Agrawal added.

According to RMC officials, chemicals prescribed by the health ministry and which are not harmful to humans will be sprayed from the air.

NAGPUR: Teacher unions in Nagpur district are unhappy over their members not getting cash for earned leave as per the seventh pay commission level by the local pay unit (PU), citing lack of government directives. Senior academicians say there are multiple cases of encashment applications being rejected with PU putting the onus on them to bring the necessary documents.

Dilip Bose, a senior academician and also office bearer of School Headmasters Charitable Association (SCHA) said, “On February 5, one such application was rejected by the local PU. The remarks by the official said that the applicant must produce state government’s guidelines on processing earned leaves as per seventh pay commission.”

Another academician said such confrontation between academicians and education department is not needed. “If seventh pay commission has been implemented, then obviously it is for everything. How can earned leave be left out? This obsession of the education department to get even the most obvious things in writing is illogical,” the academician said, not wanting to be identified.

On Friday, SCHA made an effort to bridge the gap and met with deputy director of education Anil Pardhi . Razia Sultana , office bearer of SCHA, said, “The DDE assured us that he will expedite our request and up the issue with his seniors. There were many other issues mentioned in our memorandum and he promised to look into it with urgency.”

GAYA: The district administration has identified nearly 4,000 potential miscreants, who may foment communal trouble during Holi. SHOs and other police officers have been directed to obtain bonds of good conduct from them to ensure peace.

This was revealed at a district level peace committee meeting in Gaya collectorate on Thursday. DM Abhishek Singh and SSP Rajiv Mishra interacted with peace committee members, obtained inputs and issued advisory to the committee members.

Sources said the list has been prepared on the basis of database available with the police. The database includes the incidents of communal strife recorded during the last five years and people allegedly found fomenting trouble.

Officials worries have gone up on account of 2020 being an election year. Delhi violence and the ongoing anti-CAA protest has also been taken into account by the district officials responsible for maintaining law and order.

The DM-SSP duo reminded the peace committee members of their responsibility in promptly quelling rumours. Baseless rumours and highly exaggerated account of minor problems ignite communal fire and, as such, the peace committee members have to be extra careful and prompt in presenting facts and dispel rumours.

Peace committee members advised district officials to intensify patrolling in areas having mixed population as past data showed such localities as more disturbance prone.

Gaya as per tradition has got extended festivals. Holi is celebrated at least for three days in Gaya town and ‘Jhumta’ procession with group of Holi revellers moving with drum full of liquid colour, dry powders and other celebratory items and use the same somewhat indiscriminately. According to activist Shri Bhagwan Bhaskar , be it image immersion or Muharram procession, everything has an extended scheduled in Gaya.

Meanwhile, 24X7 control room will monitor peace in the district during the forthcoming Holi festival. The district police, according to sources, is also updating the ‘Goonda’ register profiling repeat offenders.

86,['7/03/2020'],Kolkata: Fine waiver scheme a hit with car owners,"KOLKATA: More than 2.7 lakh cases have been disposed of in the past six days after the traffic-fine waiver scheme was introduced for the second time since 2018. The cops said that over 37,000 vehicle owners have responded so far and over Rs 1.5 crore was raised. In contrast, the first phase had witnessed the realization of only Rs 42,000-Rs 60,000 per day — around Rs 4.5 lakh — in the first week.

The present waiver scheme allows motorists to settle their pending traffic fines by paying only half of the amount. The scheme will continue till March 31, but cops said a decision on extension will be taken depending on the response.

According to an officer, they expect to cross Rs 2 crore in fine collection well before the end of the first week. “There is a set of queries that has been shared on social media platforms and we are trying to answer them. Simultaneously, we have decided to advertise about the scheme across the city,” said an officer.

“We have had a good beginning. With the weekend approaching, we are expecting a surge in online settlements and we are ensuring that motorists are aware of the scheme,” said joint CP (traffic) Santosh Pandey.

The data shows that, like the last time, a good number of private car owners are availing of the scheme compared to others. This apart, a large number of two-wheeler owners are also submitting pending fines in order to get them settled for half the amount.

“We had 80% compliance from private vehicle owners in 2018. This time, more than 70% of the 37,000 vehicle owners who have responded in the first six days are private car and bike owners,” said an officer.

However, people were told that the cases which have been sent to court cannot be settled under this scheme. Confusion cropped up regarding the compound cases which are also sent to court within 15 days of prosecution. “Only the cases which are pending in the traffic guards can be settled. If the case documents, along with the compound slip, have been sent to court, the case cannot be disposed of under the waiver scheme,” said Pandey. He suggested these could be settled at the lok adalats.

Besides the total number of people who paid fines offline, by visiting the 25 designated traffic guards and Lalbazar headquarters, almost double of that chose the online route — using the Kolkata police sites. Several citizens wrote back lauding the scheme and pointed out even those cases sent to court were getting settled online. “Good initiative by KP. Court cases are also getting paid. Hassle-free and don’t have to pay extra bucks to the middlemen,” wrote Rajeeb Bhattacharya.

While many saw this as an opportunity to clear all fines, others felt that not adhering to the police offer was foolhardy for the future. The cops have warned of severe action once the waiver period gets over — not only will the owners have to pay in full, but the police are even proposing to the government and insurance companies to accept a no objection certificate (NOC) from cops that will be mandatory for transfer of ownership, renewal of insurance certificate and renewal of pollution certificate.

87,['7/03/2020'],Why India’s fintech economy is in a tizzy,"(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: RBI’s (Reserve Bank of India) moratorium on Yes Bank has triggered a panic among financial technology startups that used Yes Bank’s services. Industry insiders said Yes Bank’s application programming interface , called API, offered a better experience and hence attracted scores of startups. “Yes Bank was one of the few banks with an online platform for developers and was the most aggressive among banks to build relationship with fintechs,” a startup founder told TOI.

What is an API?

An API allows startups to access a bank’s digital products and services that may not be available for third-party non-banking institutes. A plug-and-play arrangement with banks’ APIs makes it easy for fintech startups to offer their customised products to consumers or businesses.

Why is PhonePe taking a big hit?

Non-banking payments firms need a banking partner to access UPI. For PhonePe, it chose only Yes Bank, which issued all its UPI handles to make or receive payments. PhonePe’s QR-codes are issued by Yes Bank too and they are failing in offline merchant locations. Replacing all QR codes would be a tough challenge for PhonePe.

How are other startups affected?

If a startup is using the current account service to pay salaries, make disbursals to suppliers or merchants, all of those are affected due to RBI’s restrictions. The payments, usually of large size, are stuck in the accounts and recipients can’t withdraw it.

If a wealth management startup is using, for example, a broker pool account, the money for buying financial services products stays there before being paid to stock exchange and mutual fund houses. Now the money is stuck in these accounts.

Startups like Swiggy, Flipkart, Myntra, MakeMyTrip and redBus use Yes Bank to receive UPI payments. They can still accept payments via cards or netbanking, but UPI has become a popular tool.

Many lending startups also relied on Yes Bank for user account verification via debiting a small amount of money from a consumer’s account.

PUNE: The Food and Drug Administration has directed chemists against over-the-counter sale of N95 masks, among other items, to check hoarding.

In a notification issues on Friday, the FDA asked chemists to sell the N95 mask and personal protective equipment (PPE) kits only against doctor’s prescription. The administration also warned chemists against overcharging for these items.

“The objective here is to ensure that there is no hoarding of N95 masks and PPE kits and people are not overcharged. The move will also rein in panic-buying,” state FDA commissioner Arun Unhale said.

Anil Belkar, secretary of Chemists’ Association of Pune District, said, “We have already told our chemists to abide by the selling norms as stipulated by the FDA. However, N95 masks are not included in the drug category, hence, can be sold even at departmental stores and malls. We want FDA officials to look into this issue. Besides, there is no mention of a maximum retail price on such masks. Wholesalers and retailers sell them as per the cost involved in purchase charge. We have told our members to not indulge in overcharging.”

Sushil Shah president of the Chemists Association of Pune District said, “Though not a single positive case has been reported in Maharashtra, the demand for N95 masks, sanitisers, thermometers and gloves has increased to an extent that we are encountering a sudden shortage. If the trend continues, the shortage will only become severe.”

NAGPUR: A document seized by Gadchiroli police during recent operation against Maoists suggests the guerrillas have no plans to shift their base from the forested and hilly Abhujmadh straddling on Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border. The document clearly stated ‘last blood would be shed at Abhujmadh’ implying the reds wish to make their last stand here.

The Maoist document, relating to their plans regarding Abhujmadh, also puts to rest any speculation regarding developing forested terrains of Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh as their alternative base after repeated strikes on Abhujmadh by security forces of Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra. It is learnt three platoons of Vistar dalam were operating from Amarkantak forests from where their top brass can control movements in Madhya Pradesh, especially in Balaghat region where they enjoyed domination in the past. Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh are also accessible from Amarkantak.

Abhujmadh, which listerally means ‘unknown terrain’, has been fortress of the Maoists from where their underground Central Committee (CC) members manage the rebel movement under the banner of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist). The apex body members meet their various formations, plan, strategize and also holds plenum here, according to the documents seized from them. The place is also known to have a arms factory, printing press and medical facilities surrounded by minefields.

Security agencies had been spotting increased presence and movements of rebels in Amarkantak forests in last couple of years. There was strong speculation that many of their senior cadres, including CC members, had shifted to Amarkantak forest as security forces, especially from Maharashtra, started penetrating Abhujmadh forest in an unprecedented manner.

SP Shailesh Balkawade said Gadchiroli police have now been penetrating deeper into Abhujmadh forests now. “Three Maoists have been neutralized and five arrested by C-60 commandos from Abhujmadh in the last few months,” he said. “Abhujmadh occupies a place of pride among Maoists which is unlikely to get replaced going by the documents we have seized,” he said.

Gadchiroli police have arrested five Maoists from Perimilbhatti in Abhujmadh in the last week of January. In November last year, two cadres were gunned down at Abhujmadh while their camp was busted. Another cadre was gunned down in February this year by C-60 commandos in an operation in which Gadchiroli’s elite force went almost 18-20 km inside the guerrilla base zone.

“Hundreds of vehicles that had been seized by cops were stationed at the stadium. Some of them have been parked there for months,” said station fire officer, Rajkumar.

The fire erupted in one corner of the stadium and soon spread to other parts. Officials suspect that a spark from a high tension wire could have triggered the fire. “A high tension wire crosses the portion of the stadium where the fire broke out. We suspect that a spark from this wire could have caused the fire. The dry grass on the vehicles immediately caught fire,” added the official.

There was no separate meet.” Asked about alleged poaching bid by BJP, Mishra said none of the MLAs has said so.

Pathak reiterates threat to life: “I am with BJP and remain with BJP whether Congress kills me and my family,” said BJP MLA Sanjay Pathak while talking to reporters at the state BJP headquarters on Saturday.

Umaria district administration removed encroachment from a resort owned by Pathak in Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve. It comes two days after his mines were closed. “Action against me and my relatives by the government will continue in days to come. It is pressure tactics to force me to join Congress, which I will not come what may. I did not meet any senior Congress leader.” Sanjay Pathak also alleged that he was chased from Bhopal airport on Thursday. He alleged it was a bid to abduct or kill him and he somehow saved himself. When asked why he did not lodge n FIR, he said he would consult his senior party leaders first.

Police targeting my family, alleges Bhadoria: “I will not surrender to police atrocities on my family,” said BJP MLA Arvind Bhadoria, adding, “My brother was called at the police station and harassed. Kamal Nath government has stooped down to the lowest level of politics.” Bhadoria is BJP MLA from Ater constituency in Bhind district.

Varanasi: Going a green way, people in some localities of the city have been using cow dung cakes instead of wood for Holika dahan on the eve of Holi for a couple of years.

One can see piles of cow dung cakes collected at the crossings for Holika Dahan in localities like Bhojubir and Nadesar as the residents of these areas have voluntarily shunned the use of wood. “We have been using cow dung cakes for Holika burning since past four years,” said Nand Lal of Bhojubir area.

“We are the first in the city to shun the use of wood in Holika Dahan, and we are happy that others are also following us,” said Manoj busy arranging cow dung cakes for Holika Dahan along with his friends. Similar arrangement could be seen near the tehsil office and in Nadesar area.

The organisers have also put posters appealing people to not cut trees and keep the city clean. “The use of cow dung cake will help saving trees. We appeal to others also to switch over to this greener way of celebrating festival, said Nand Lal.

Holika is burnt at over 2,000 places in the district including rural and urban areas.

HYDERABAD: A day after he was arrested, Congress leader and Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy moved a bail petition in a local court on Friday. Six associates of Revanth who were arrested on Wednesday in the same case, were granted bail by the court on Friday.

Revanth’s bail application is expected to be heard by the court on Tuesday. Revanth was arrested by Narsingi cops on Thursday when he went to the police station and questioned how a criminal case could be registered against him and his followers.

Revanth was booked for using a drone to capture an aerial photograph of a farmhouse which, Revanth alleged, belongs to IT minister KT Rama Rao.

TRS MLA Balka Suman had clarified that the farmhouse was taken on lease by KTR.

PUNE: The Savitribai Phule Pune University ( SPPU ) has cancelled three events scheduled over the weekend after instructions from the University Grants Commission (UGC) to avoid public gatherings and meetings in the wake of coronavirus spread.

SPPU Registrar Prafulla Pawar confirmed the development and said, “All departments have been told to cancel their events.”

The cancelled programmes include the Student Welfare Board’s award distribution and felicitation ceremony on March 9, the debate competition on Women's Day and also the annual felicitation programme of the National Service Scheme.

KOLKATA: A woman on her period on Saturday alleged that she was denied permission to use the washroom at a cinema hall, citing that she would “soil” the floor. The allegations were made against a prominent hall in the Hatibagan area in north Kolkata.

The woman’s husband — who shared her ordeal on social media — approached the Shyampukur police on Saturday, after which the manager of the cinema hall was asked to come down to the police station. By late evening, police sources said, the manager had tendered an apology. The incident led to a major hue and cry on social media with a large section of netizens extending their support to the woman.

The couple from Rajarhat had gone to the hall to watch a movie in the evening. “After the show got over, the woman went to use the washroom but found a few housekeeping staffers cleaning the facility. They refused her entry to the bathroom. However, the hall staffers claimed that she tried to use the entry gate to come out of the hall and they requested her to use the exit gate instead,” an officer said. “The woman then told them that she was on her period. It was then that one of the housekeeping staffers stopped her from using the washroom and suggested that she use a toilet outside the theatre,” the cop said.

The couple alleged that people passed snide remarks even as an argument broke out between the woman and the staffers. The shocked couple then left the hall in “severe trauma” and approached the police. The hall manager on Saturday, though, claimed that it was a “misunderstanding”.

“No theatre in Kolkata has ever asked women if they are menstruating or not. They have used the toilets without ever having to disclose this information. The same rule applies in my theatre as well,” the management later said.

Hundreds of women from the city took part in the run, which was flagged off from Charminar by Telangana state home minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali , director general of police M Mahendar Reddy and commissioner of police Anjani Kumar .

Mahmood Ali said that the state government was committed to the safety of women. “Soon after the formation of the government, the state has placed the issue of safety and security of women on priority. We have also allocated nearly 33% quota for women in the police department. She Teams and Bharosa centres are also committed to protecting women,” said Mohammed Mahmood Ali.

Mahendar Reddy also stressed on the need to create more awareness on the presence of the She Teams so that more women could reach out to them.

99,['7/03/2020'],Covid-19 formalities push up travel time at Kolkata airport,"KOLKATA: Flight suspensions and advisory against travel to several countries has led to a drop in international flyer count at the Kolkata airport. But it has not improved the average time required for in-bound passengers to complete formalities and exit the airport. On the contrary, it is taking much longer now.The reason, Kolkata airport officials revealed, is two-fold. First, flyers have an additional queue to deal with now. While they needed to clear immigration and then wait at the baggage carousal to collect their checked-in bags, they now have to queue up for a thermal scan that has been mandatory in the wake of the Covid-19 spread for all passengers arriving in international flights. And then, flyers have to fill up a form in duplicate that is adding to the wait time.“Earlier, passengers with travel history to the worst-affected countries — China, Iran, South Korea and Italy — were undergoing thermal screening. After the flights to China were suspended early in February, passengers requiring screening were few, numbering in hundreds. But since the introduction of universal screening, we have to now screen nearly 4,000 passengers daily. Though it takes less than a minute to clear a person, everytime there is a suspect, the queue has to stall for the passenger to be segregated and handed over for transportation to the quarantine centre at the ID Hospital,” an airport official explained.But what is adding to the delay in processing each passenger at both the medical desk and immigration is the time flyers are taking to fill a form in duplicate, declaring their name, passport and flight details, travel history, address of stay and contact number. While one form needs to be submitted at the medical desk, the other has to be handed over to the immigration officer.“We have handed the forms to all the airlines that operate to Kolkata for distribution on board before the flight lands in the city. But most of the passengers don’t fill it in the flight and wait till they land. This is particularly true with Indian passengers. This is resulting in delay,” the official said.Following a meeting chaired by civil aviation secretary Rajiv Narayan Choubey on Friday where he urged airport directors to ensure faster processing of arriving passengers, Kolkata airport director Kaushik Bhattacharjee has urged all airlines to distribute the forms just after meals are served and make an inflight announcement that everyone needs to fill up the forms for sumbission on touchdown.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74534756,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-539043,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-19-formalities-push-up-travel-time-at-airport/articleshow/74532168.cms

LUCKNOW: As thundershowers continued to lash the city for the third consecutive day on Friday, weather office predicted possibility of thunder activity accompanied with one or two spells of rains on Saturday, and after a two-day lull on Tuesday, the day Holi will be celebrated.

Sky was partly cloudy since Friday morning and several spells of showers with thunder and lightning occurred from afternoon till night. As a result, the maximum temperature dropped to 26.7 degrees Celsius, 2.8 units below normal.

The minimum temperature, however, was high at 16 degrees Celsius, 3.3 notches above normal, because of cloudy sky. Rainfall was scattered and ranged from 1mm to 10 mm in different parts of the city.

The rains led to traffic congestion in some parts of the city. Power outages of short durations were also reported from some localities.

Met officials said a western disturbance over Pakistan and low-pressure area over Rajasthan are responsible for thundershowers and rains in the hill states and northwest India, including some parts of UP, for the past three days. The system is expected to weaken by Sunday.

As a result, thunder activity with one or two spells of rains may occur is some parts of UP, including Lucknow, on Saturday.

Thundershowers may occur again on Holi due to development of another cyclonic circulation over north India.

102,['7/03/2020'],Tech spin to Mani Bhavan upgrade: Audio guides &amp; digitized archives,"Memorial to get a Rs 25 crore allocation

MUMBAI: Mani Bhavan—the two-storey Mahatma Gandhi memorial at Gamdevi’s Laburnum Road which served as his headquarters from 1917 to 1934—might soon boast audio guides , touchscreen computers and other spiffy upgrades dictated by the spinning wheel of time.

As part of programmes taken up to “promote and disseminate” the thoughts and principles of Mahatma Gandhi, the state budget on Friday proposed an outlay of Rs 25 crore for renovation of the building and a museum inside.

It was 16 years ago, in 2004, that the modest structure, where Gandhi began his tryst with the charkha and launched several agitations including the non-cooperation movement, had last received such a grant from the state. Usha Thakkar, honorary secretary, Mani Bhavan , said they had last received a grant of Rs 92 lakh from the state in 2004. The funds, she said, will be used to implement a detailed restoration plan prepared by conservation architect Abha Narain Lambah last year.

From improving signage to digitizing archives, the plan includes upgrades to make Gandhi's message “alive and contemporary”. “Many of Gandhi’s freedom movements and most of his visionary ideas, from giving up milk to spinning khadi, started in Mani Bhavan. It encapsulates Mumbai’s contribution to the freedom movement,” said Lambah. The plan was prepared last year to mark Mahatma’s 150th birth anniversary.

Tushar Gandhi, his great- grandson, said he would like a visual narration of the time Dr Martin Luther King visited in the 1950s. “That had a big impact on the civil rights movement in the US. Since Mani Bhavan has a lot of foreign visitors, this would be something they would like to see.”

HYDERABAD: Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan avoided making a mention of CAA , NRC and NPR in her address to the joint session of assembly on Friday, but sent a clear message that the TRS government will deal with a firm hand with those trying to foment communal trouble in Telangana .

In her over 30-minute speech, the governor was also effusive in her praise of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao who, she said, was the major force behind Telangana emerging as number one state in various parameters, including the power sector.

Making a mention of Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb , she said: “My government will respect every religion and celebrate all festivals. However, my government will act sternly against those who are trying to create communal tension and suppress such attempts with an iron hand.” Her comments assume significance as in her first budget speech she had made no mention about religious harmony and had only said that all festivals would be celebrated with fervour.

Sources said the TRS government did not want to ruffle any feathers at this time and played it safe. “The government avoided making a mention about demonetisation or GST in the governor’s address but later passed resolutions in the assembly. The government did not want to put the new governor in a tricky situation,” sources said.

Speculations were rife after the LDF government in Kerala made a mention of anti-CAA stand in governor Arif Mohammad Khan’s speech.

He refused to read anything against CAA initially, but later read it saying it was the state government’s opinion and not his.

Soundararajan’s speech was replete with Tamil words as she wanted Telangana to be “Uriapsiyum pvappiniyum serupagayum sera thaiyalathuu nadu” which means “hunger-free, disease-free and enmity-free state.”

While explaining the success story of the state government in various sectors like power and irrigation, she said her government had accorded more responsibilities to collectors. “My government accorded more responsibilities and powers to the collectors with a view that villages have to be developed. Powers hitherto with ministers have been curtailed and given to the collectors.”

Making an important statement, she said Telangana accounts for 66% of CCTV cameras in the country. “For maintenance of law and order, six lakh CCTV cameras have been installed in Telangana.”

The governor also announced that the government had decided to reduce the age limit for the old-age pensions from 65 years to 57 years.

Praising KCR, the governor recalled Telangana started its journey under a leader who had successfully spearheaded the separate statehood movement.

DEHRADUN: Since the formation of Uttarakhand in November 2000, agricultural and fallow land has reduced in the state by 24,985 hectares, of which 7,704 hectare has turned barren.

BJP legislator from Jhabreda Deshraj Karanwal posed a question on how much agricultural land had turned barren in the hills and how much agri land in the plains was being used for other purpose.

In his reply, agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal said that as per revenue department records, the hill areas of the state in 2000-01 had a total 5,17,628 hectares of agricultural and fallow land, which has reduced to 4,92,643 hectares in 2017-18.

In reply to the second question, Uniyal said that in the plains of Udham Singh Nagar district, a total of 56.42 hectare agricultural land is proposed to be used for other projects. Similarly, 2,144 hectares in Nainital and 1,204 hectares in Haridwar district will be used for other works.

The report said there were significant duplication in the Aadhaar/ Bhamashah linking resulting in irregular distribution of wheat more than entitlements. Rajasthan introduced National Food Security Act from October 2, 2013 without conducting a survey for identification of beneficiaries or to eliminate significant number of bogus ration cards.

The report said the food and civil supply department carried out an exercise to identify bogus ration card in 2016 where in it estimated that about 39.32% of ration cards are bogus. The report pointed out that in some blocks excess ration cards were issued more than the number of beneficiaries, while in some other blocks, the percentage was as low as 12-17. The report pointed out that despite the distribution of wheat through Aadhaar /Bhamashah enabled point of sale (PoS) which have unique identification features, there were instances of multiple and duplicate RCs leading to excess distribution of food grains. Another deficiency found in the report was “Viability of fair price shops in terms of number linked RCs and minimal income was not ensured. Absence of automated system and monitoring bodies like state level vigilance committee also resulted in poor monitoring and weak internal control.”

Inspections of fair price shops were not carried out as per norms. Though the state food commission was notified by the government it was made functional. “These deficiencies coupled with ineffective grievance redressal mechanism, lack of inspections, non-existent internal and social audit resulted in the weakening the public distribution system .”

HYDERABAD: The word YOLO (you only live once) — one of the many modern-day internet jargons — best describes Mohammed Haneef . Even at a ripe age of 84, retirement is the last thing on his mind. While on the one hand he plies people back and forth; on the other hand, his auto-rickshaw doubles up as an ambulance. Since 2017, when he began the service, Haneef chacha has driven thousands of people to private and public hospitals for free.

One among them is Ram Singh. Last year, Singh, a tea stall owner in Gachibowli, faced a difficult situation. His four-month-old son, Akhilesh Kumar, who had been discharged from ICU, developed complications again within a few days, and needed to be rushed to the hospital. Instead of calling an ambulance, which he thought might take time, he dialled Haneef’s number, who appeared within 20 minutes with his autorickshaw. He drove Ram Singh and his son to Niloufer Hospital at Lakdikapul.

“My son is fine now. The government hospital took good care of him, but that is their work. More than the hospital, I am grateful to Haneef bhai. I had got his number from my brother, and Haneef bhai did not charge a penny that day.

The resident of Zehra Nagar, Banjara Hills, Haneef has been driving his auto for the past five decades, and has six sons and two daughters.

Haneef says his children are doing well and his duty is done. But he wishes to do something for the society so that if he were to be questioned about his deeds by God, he will be ready with an answer. There is one other reason why ‘auto chacha’ does this work. In 2007, he cycled to Mecca for haj. He wishes to go for Haj again this year and believes his good work will help him earn blessings and make his journey easy.

111,['7/03/2020'],Men with D-Company link among four arrested in Mumbai,"Representative image

LUCKNOW: A fortnight after the Rakabganj dacoity and murder, four men — including two assailants — were arrested on Friday from the slums of Dharavi in Mumbai along with Rs 45 lakh of the Rs 50 lakh booty.

The amount recovered is one of the biggest cash hauls in 10 years, police said. Sources said the assailants were close aides of a man who earlier worked for underworld don Dawood Ibrahim and was arrested by Mumbai Police in Patna on January 9 this year.

On February 20, Subhash Gupta (52), an employee of a tobacco shop in Rakabganj, was shot dead for resisting a dacoity. The gang of four on bikes escaped after firing multiple rounds in the air.

Lucknow police commissioner Sujeet Pandey said Dharavi residents Firoz Khan and Kadir Anwar were directly involved in the dacoity and murder. Md Sajid of Wazirganj provided escape vehicles and Md Ateek of Ambedkarnagar too played a supporting role. “Firoz pulled the trigger. All of them have confessed. We are close to arresting the two other assailants,” Pandey added.

Two bikes used in the Rakabganj robbery have been recovered from a parking at River Bank Colony, from where the gang took an e-rickshaw after changing cloths. They changed public transport many times to reach Dharavi.

The arrested quartet were involved in a daylight robbery of Rs 38 lakh at ICICI Bank in Ambedkarnagar in August 2019. Their arrests may also lead to culprits involved in an ATM robbery of Rs 50 lakh in Hasanganj in February 2015, during which three persons were killed.

JAIPUR: Jaipur Rural police on Friday rescued 24 child labourers from Dudu police station area where they were working in a stone powdering factory .

The juveniles told policemen that they were paid by the factory owner, who is yet to be arrested.

“We received information that a factory owner had employed child labourers at his establishment and we raided the place where we found 24 children. In the recent past, this is the biggest rescue of the child labourers in Jaipur,” a police official said.

According to officials, the children were working in extremely hazardous conditions. “The children were employed in a stone powdering factory with hardly any safety equipment and were also made to work for long hours despite being so young. They were also subjected to the stone powder which can lead to various health issues. We will be raiding other places as well to rescue more children. The children rescued were all boys,” the official added.

The labourers told the police that they were paid approximately Rs 11,000 per month by the owner and they worked for around 12 hours a day. A case under relevant sections of IPC has been registered against the owner who is yet to be arrested.

His family has registered a case of murder against unidentified persons. When the body of the 18-year-old youth was found, the feet of the deceased were touching the ground.

The deceased Asharam Bairwa hailed from Sindholiya village in Malpura police station area.

Chakravarti Singh, circle officer, Malpura told TOI, “There was some construction work going on at the victim’s house because of which he at times used to sleep in a vacant house close to his own. On Thursday, he left his residence and on Friday morning a local saw his body hanging from a tree following which his family reached the spot and we were informed.”

The family claimed that they did not search for Asharam during the night as they assumed that he had gone to sleep in the other house.

“We have registered a case of murder as his family alleged that when they found the body, his feet were touching the ground. There could be various reasons for it, including partial hanging which is quite common and can also kill. When a person hangs from a tree, the branch is also pulled down due to the weight of the body, but we are investigating the matter,” said the official.

The dog squad and FSL were also called in for help. Singh further said, “No suicide note was found and FSL checked the incident spot as well as the body. I also checked the body, but did not find any marks of injury or struggle which are usual indications of a suspected murder.” The postmortem was done on Friday and the body was handed over to the family.

But, it wasn’t until a women’s day discussion, which involved role playing, that he realised what damage a single word can do and decided to act.

The 30-year-old MBA aspirant and crusader by choice has teamed up with like-minded people to launch a campaign to stop use of vocabulary that degrades the fair sex. On International Women’s Day this Sunday, #WhyAbuseOnWomen (WAoW) will seek a pledge from everyone against use of such abusive language.

Alok’s hashtag campaign will roll out at a two-day event — aptly titled ‘Excuse me, Dear Patriarchy’ — to celebrate equal rights. The programme at Kala Srot, which will see poetry sessions in Hindi, Urdu and English, besides a photography exhibition and film screening, is being organised by Dastak Manch.

“It is always women at the beginning and end of cuss words. We hear it daily, don’t we? But, do we ever ask why women? Our campaign will raise this question,” said the lad from a middle class family who has always been an activist at heart.

The hashtag campaign will be sustained through workshops, seminars, discussions in schools, colleges and offices, nukkad nataks across the city and flash mob in malls.

He said there was no mention of unemployment allowance to the youth which the TRS government had promised in 2018 elections. He said that the government had failed in all parameters was clearly evident in the governor’s speech.

BJP’s lone MLA Raja Singh accused the TRS government of forcing Soundararajan say lies in her speech. “The TRS government did not fulfil any promise. We will expose the government during this budget session,” he said.

The BJP state unit, however, breathed easy with the governor not mentioning CAA, NRC or NPR.

“It would have put us in an embarrassing position had she mentioned them,” a party leader said on the condition of anonymity.

HYDERABAD: It was about a decade ago when Shiva Ilias Hanumanthu lost his adopted brother Pavan. He died while trying to save a suicide victim. “They both drowned,” recalls Shiva, who has since taken up the mission to save people who try to end their life by jumping into Hussainsagar . Over the past few years, Shiva has prevented at least 110 suicides, and recovered countless bodies from the lake — those that he couldn’t save.

“Only a week ago, a man jumped into Hussainsagar around 11am. On seeing him, a police constable jumped in to save him... Eventually, I had to go in to save both,” says Shiva, giving us a glimpse of his usual day that’s spent patrolling around the lake in a vehicle recently donated by a Good Samaritan, after hearing about his work. A retired officer also come forward to pay him a monthly remuneration of Rs 5,000. Shiva lives close to the lake in a tent, with his wife and a young child.

Last year, he saved a 90-year-old woman. “She was from a well-to-do family, and said she didn’t want to be a burden to her children,” the 34-year-old says. “I have seen so many women who come here, often with their small children, to commit suicide after fight with their husbands.”

But the job isn’t child’s play. Shiva was grievously injured twice — in 2014 and 2016 — while trying to rescue people who jumped in the lake. “The first time, I jumped into the lake to save a person and a sharp iron rod pierced left of my chest and shoulder. I went to Gandhi Hospital myself. Another time, it was 2am when a boy jumped into the lake, with no ropes. I jumped to save him, but a nail pierced my leg,” he says, confessing to the lack of safety gear at his disposal. “If the government provides safety gear, I can do a better job and save more people,” Shiva says.

But he doesn’t ask for a fee or reward, for retrieving bodies or saving lives. He takes whatever police officials offer voluntarily. “I sometimes take up small side roles in Telugu films to make some extra bucks,” he says.

JAIPUR: The construction of maternity child health unit above the first floor of the old hospital building at Pannadhaya in Udaipur without ensuring structural safety, resulted in structural damage to the whole building and an additional expenditure of Rs 10.47 crore, said the CAG report tabled in the assembly on Friday.

Construction of a 100-bed maternal child health unit at the hospital in Udaipur was included in the state programme implementation plan for 2012-13 under National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). Accordingly, administrative sanction was issued by mission director, NRHM in June 2012 for construction of the MCH unit having 7,095 SM area. Financial sanction of Rs 15.27 crore was issued in August 2013 which was revised to Rs 17.64 crore.

CAG report said that the records revealed that a departmental committee recommended construction of the MCH unit above the first floor of the existing hospital building. The committee also suggested obtaining structural safety certificate from the PWD.

But contract was issued without obtaining any structural safety assessment. Meanwhile, another technical committee noted that the walls of the hospital were nearly 60 years old and were constructed with stones. So, construction of another floor on such an old building is not feasible.

But without taking this into account, the remaining work was awarded to another contractor and the work was completed in 2016, with an additional expenditure of Rs 10.47 crore. But cracks soon developed on the building and the building was declared unsafe.

121,['7/03/2020'],Kabul attack: Dozens killed as gunmen attack Afghan political rally,"Security personnel arrive near the site of an attack in Kabul, Afghanistan (AP)

KABUL: Dozens of people were killed when gunmen opened fire at a political rally in Kabul on Friday, the deadliest assault in Afghanistan since the US signed a withdrawal deal with the Taliban.

The attack, claimed by the Islamic State group, highlights a glaring lack of security in the Afghan capital just 14 months ahead of the scheduled withdrawal of all foreign forces.

It also calls into question a key element of the US-Taliban deal signed February 29 -- whether the Taliban can stop jihadists such as IS from running amok in Afghanistan after US forces pull out.

In a statement, IS said two brothers had targeted a ""gathering of apostates"" with machine guns and grenades.

The gunmen inflicted devastating carnage at the crowded event in west Kabul, killing 32 people and wounding 58 others, health ministry spokesman Wahidullah Mayar told AFP.

Interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi put the toll at 29 dead, with an additional 61 wounded. He said special forces units eventually killed the two gunmen.

The assault occurred at a commemoration ceremony for Abdul Ali Mazari -- a politician from the Hazara ethnic group, most of whom are Shiite Muslims.

The Sunni-extremist IS had claimed an attack on the same ceremony last year, when a barrage of mortar fire killed at least 11 people.

Rahimi said gunfire had erupted from a construction site near the event.

Several top political officials were at the ceremony, including Afghanistan's chief executive Abdullah Abdullah .

The interior ministry later confirmed that all the high-ranking officials had been ""safely evacuated.""

""We left the ceremony following the gunfire, and a number of people were wounded, but I do not have any reports of martyred people for now,"" Hazara leader Mohammad Mohaqiq told Tolo News.

President Ashraf Ghani condemned the massacre as a ""crime against humanity"".

The attack came less than a week after the US and Taliban signed a deal that would result in the complete withdrawal of foreign troops in 14 months.

The withdrawal however depends heavily on the Taliban being able to control jihadist forces such as al-Qaeda and IS.

If such groups remain, so too does the US military.

A US Forces-Afghanistan spokesman said the response to the attack was ""Afghan led,"" but US personnel gave medical aid to the victims.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insisted that despite the attack, violence in Afghanistan was ""significantly down"".

""The violence levels, they're still lower than they have been in the last five or six years,"" Pompeo told CNBC television.

""We see the path forward towards a peace and reconciliation opportunity.""

He later condemned the ""despicable"" attack, saying in a statement that the peace process ""presents a critical opportunity for Afghans to come together to build a united front against the menace of ISIS.""

But since the deal was signed in Doha fighting has continued across Afghanistan, raising questions over whether the agreement would reduce violence and lead to talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government.

Afghan government officials and the Taliban are supposed to meet in Oslo next week, but talks are likely to be delayed over disagreement about a prisoner release.

The US-Taliban deal calls on the Afghan government to release as many as 5,000 Taliban prisoners before March 10, when talks are supposed to start. President Ghani however has rejected that commitment.

The Taliban's political spokesman Suhail Shaheen said that the insurgents were ready for talks -- but only if the prisoners were released.

""If the negotiations are delayed beyond the stated date, the responsibility will rest with the others,"" Shaheen tweeted.

The Islamic State group, which follows a radical Sunni interpretation of Islam, first became active in Afghanistan in 2015.

It has claimed responsibility for a string of bombings, including several in Kabul targeting the city's Shiite community.

In recent months the group has suffered mounting setbacks after being hunted by US and Afghan forces, as well as Taliban offensives targeting their fighters.

At the United Nations, Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemned the attack and expressed his ""deepest sympathies"" to the families of the victims.

""Attacks against civilians are unacceptable and those who carry out such crimes must be held accountable,"" Guterres said.

Riders in Delhi NCR had the best average wait time of four minutes. According to Uber, this means that riders in Hyderabad stay on the road for a shorter time due to lower traffic congestion and also have shorter wait times than their Bengaluru counterparts, leading to lower cancellation rates and higher ride completion rates.Uber said its Bengaluru drivers earn up to 20-25% lower than their counterparts in Hyderabad due to higher cancellation rates and regulatory caps. “If you compare drivers in Bengaluru and their counterparts in other cities, Bengaluru drivers earn 20-25% lower incomes.

Jaipur: The CAG report for 2018, which was tabled in the assembly on Friday, found glaring irregularities in tendering, preparation and sanction of road works by the public works department in the state.

“In some cases, tenders were invited before issue of technical sanction, notice inviting tenders (NITs) issued before administrative sanction, irregularities in issuing corrigendum in NITs and inadequate time for submission of bids were noticed,” said the report. The report said irregularities like non-preparation of preliminary estimates, non-availability of road history and road register, traffic census etc while sanctioning new projects.

Similarly, technical sanctions were accorded for estimates having excess/deficit/ wrong provisions and in cases where exact components of price variation were not approved, leading to avoidable/unauthorized/excess/irregular expenditure. Execution of contracts suffered from deficiencies such as non-submission of work programme, non-deployment of technical staff by contractor, bank guarantee not renewed, insurance cover to worker not provided, non-recovery or levy of compensation etc.

Similarly, quality control testing was not carried out properly in many divisions and payments made to contractors without ensuring receipt of quality control test reports.

“Prioritization of roads was not carried out in majority of the cases to support road project proposals but based on recommendations of peoples’ representatives and local pressure groups,” said the report. The department did not have an updated data base of roads to facilitate systematic and objective planning.

133,['7/03/2020'],IAF proposes shorter route to Mohali airport,"This passage can be constructed after removing unauthorized constructions falling within 100m from IAF base bo... Read More

CHANDIGARH: Haryana, one of the stakeholders in Chandigarh International Airport, is struggling hard to get shorter access route to the airport in Mohali for residents of Panchkula, who have to travel long distances to reach it.

The issue, which Haryana had raised in the previous year’s Northern Zonal Council, now seems to have a viable solution — the Indian Air Force (IAF) has suggested that a road be constructed between the old and the new terminal buildings along the outerside of the boundary wall of its airbase. As per the proposal, this passage can be constructed after removing existing unauthorized constructions falling within 100 metres from the IAF base boundary wall.

The proposal, according to IAF, would resolve three issues — save estimated cost of Rs 1,357 crore for construction of a proposed underpass to shorten the route, save the airbase from security threat due to construction of the proposed underpass and remove unauthorized constructions within 100 metres of the airbase boundary wall.

The proposal was tabled by IAF officials in the last civil-military liaison conference led by UT administrator V P Singh Badnore and also in the Northern Zonal Council meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah in September last. The proposal, however, is pending for fresh consideration by all the stakeholders.

The airport is managed by Chandigarh International Airport Limited, where Airports Authority of India (AAI) has 51% equity and the governments of Haryana and Punjab have an equal share of 24.5% each. With the new building, the Chandigarh International Airport shifted to Mohali district in Punjab and the distance of the new terminal building increased from Panchkula in Haryana. People travelling from Haryana have to travel around 20-25km and those from Chandigarh around 15-18km to reach the new terminal building in Mohali.

The Haryana government had prepared a technical feasibility report by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) for a new route for which estimated cost was Rs 1,357 crore. As per the proposal, an underpass was to be constructed in the airport area that would have reduced the distance by around 10km for people coming from Panchkula or Haryana.

The issue was discussed in detail in the Northern Zonal Council meeting in September where the Punjab government expressed inability to share the estimated Rs 1,357 crore cost, citing its severe economic stress.

Haryana’s underpass proposal also faced objections from the Indian Air Force authorities because an underpass below operational surface of Chandigarh IAF station would not be acceptable for security reasons.

Representing the IAF, Group Captain Manoj Rana, chief administrative officer of Chandigarh Air Force Station, however, proposed an alternative route along the boundary wall of the IAF station after clearing all obstructions within its 100 metres. “This definitely will cost much less (including any compensation as well). The road along the boundary wall of the airbase can be constructed even by removing all illegal constructions and acquiring their land and this would entail lower expenses compared to the proposed Rs 1,357 crore on the underpass project,” the IAF official had suggested.

Experts suggest that if the IAF proposal is accepted, the distance between Chandigarh airport and Panchkula would be reduced by 8-9km. The cost of construction of the road along the boundary wall of the airbase, including acquisition and demolition of illegal constructions, would not go beyond Rs 400 crore instead of the proposed Rs 1,357 crore for the underpass in the airfield area. This Rs 400 crore would be negligible for Haryana, Punjab and Chandigarh, if shared by them, they added.

136,['7/03/2020'],Court notice to UT admn on sealing of unregistered PGs,"Chandigarh: A district court on Friday issued a notice to the UT administration on a civil suit filed by a city resident against sealing of unregistered paying guest facilities that has left “many students homeless”.

The court has sought UT’s reply by next date of hearing on March 17.

In the suit, Naresh Chander Chadha, a 70-year-old landlord, said the Chandigarh administration be “restrained from sealing unregistered paying guest accommodations and registering criminal cases against the owners without a legal notice till the civil suit was decided.”

It was argued that thousands of students preparing for competitive exams come to Chandigarh from far-off places. “The administration has failed to provide any hostel facilities to them. Landlords come to their rescue by providing them accommodation at reasonable rates,” Chadha contended.

“In September 2006, the administration had asked landlords to get their PGs registered so that details could be shared on its website. But for years, unregistered PGs ran under the nose of the UT and no notices were issued to them. The administration woke up from its deep slumber only after the February 22 incident wherein three girls died after a fire broke out at an illegal PG in Sector 32,” it was argued.

The civil suit also mentioned that the administration had notified a revised PG policy on February 26. And without giving any prior notice or time to owners for registration, the administration started sealing unregistered PGs and filing FIRs against landlords. It was contested that this was illegal because sealing left several students without shelter in the absence of proper arrangements made by the administration. “Students were left harassed as their exams were approaching and their careers were at stake. Many landlords are shutting PGs due to the fear of FIR,” it added.

LUCKNOW: In major changes made to the Uttar Pradesh Subordinate Services Selection Commission ( UPSSSC ) examination system, candidates will now be given a percentile based on their performance in the preliminary exam. Eligibility to appear for all subsequent exams for various posts will be determined by the respective percentiles.

The percentile can also be used by private companies during hiring. The Commission, it said, will make scores available to companies with permission from the candidates.

The commission will also start a ‘know your candidate’ (KYC) system from this year. Under this, a candidate will have to register once for an exam, linking his or her Aadhaar number with personal details. Henceforth, they can appear for any exam being held by the commission without have to register for it.

The decisions were taken in a meeting chaired by UPSSSC chairperson Pravir Kumar.

From now, preliminary exams will be held twice a year and will be compulsory for all UPSSSC candidates. “A candidate will be tested on general knowledge, contemporary issues, Hindi language, reasoning and high school level maths. They will be scored in percentile terms. These scores will determine one’s eligibility to appear for future exams for various posts. Candidates will have the option of re-appearing for the preliminary to improve their scores,” Kumar.

While registering with UPSSSC, candidates will be required to provide their Aadhaar card number, educational qualifications, certificates and other details.

142,['7/03/2020'],Visakhapatnam: GVMC puts in place initial spadework for civic polls,"VISAKHAPATNAM: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) is preparing the ground for municipal elections. After gazette notifications on ward delimitation and voter lists were recently published by the state government, the civic body notified the polling stations needed for the electoral process.

GVMC officials met officials of Andhra University (AU) on Thursday and presented a requisition to utilise a part of the campus for counting, reception and other election-related purposes. However, the GVMC is still waiting for a formal order from the state government to finalise ward-wise reservations.

Speaking to TOI, a GVMC official said the civic body has already concluded the initial groundwork for ward-wise reservations based on two to three different percentages of reservations. “It would become much easier for the GVMC in finalising the reservations as we have already kept our options ready. The GVMC is all set for the polls other than finalising the reservations,” said the official.

Based on voter lists provided by the state election commission (SEC), the GVMC has identified 17.51 lakh voters in the city, including 8.8 lakh male voters and 8.71 lakh female voters. Voters belonging to the backward communities form a lion’s share of the electorate, comprising about 9.3 lakh votes.

The GVMC has also notified 1,713 polling stations. While zones-IV and V have the highest number of stations with 376 polling stations each, Bheemili zone has the fewest number of stations at 54.

However, writ petitions on the merger of some villages under Bheemili mandal are pending for disposal at the high court but GVMC officials are hopeful of an order in their favour from the court soon.

There have been no elections to the GVMC council since February 2012, when the tenure of the previous council ended.

In the meantime, pending court cases delayed the electoral process. At present, political parties are deliberating on potential candidates even as ward-wise reservations and reservation for the post of mayor are yet to be finalised.

The incident is eight days old when the victim, identified as Vishal of Pakka Talab Krishna Nagar locality, was abducted allegedly by seven men in the Daroga Bagh locality under Kotwali police station.

SP Unnao Vikrant Vir has ordered a probe in the case after Vishal approached him.

According to the complaint filed with the Kotwali police, on February 26, Vishal had left his Pakka Talab Krishna Nagar home on a bike to distribute 'terahnvi' invitation cards of his maternal uncle to his relatives and friends, when seven persons abducted him and physically assaulted him over suspicion of stealing a pig.

147,['7/03/2020'],IAS officers have lens on state’s diversity,"Meerut: The hidden talent of UP's IAS officers has come alive in the form of a calendar that showcases the best shots of a selected few depicting rich biodiversity of state. From a picturesque click of boatride with the rising Sun in in the backdrop in Varanasi to flock of Greylag Goose at Hyderpur Wetland near Bijnor; from 20 feet high dangler ‘Bareilly ka Jhumka’ to majestic one-horned rhinoceros in Dudhwa National Park, the calendar displays vivid reflections of UP’s culture, architecture, tradition, landscape and wildlife in their best avatar.

“We seek entries through the WhatsApp group of the UP IAS Association group in January. All entries are compiled and screened. Idea is to represent different culture, monuments, natural places and new events happening in the state. An officer or his close relative like wife or son can contribute only one picture,"" says divisional commissioner Saharanpur, Sanjay Kumar, who is a part of two-member committee responsible for bringing out this 12-leaf calendar. Kumar is himself an awarded photographer on wildlife.

The other member is Alok Kumar, secretary to the chief minister. “The main idea to bring out this calendar is to showcase comparatively lesser known attractions of UP. For instance, Rajdari Falls of Chandraprabha Wildlife Sanctuary in Chandauli district is something not as famous as Agra’s Taj Mahal. So these places also get opportunity to be highlighted. Besides, we encourage officers to explore these hidden treasures that could contribute immensely to eco and other kinds of tourism. We also send these calendars to IAS Associations of other states also,”said Alok Kumar.

Every year, the selected pictures find place in a photo exhibition held as part of the annual services week. But, this year as the services week was not organised, entries were sought on Whatsapp. In all, 120 pictures were sent for the calendar by 23 IAS officers from all over the state. Some of the pictures selected this year are that of Taj Mahal by Anil Kumar and one-horned Indian Rhinoceros at Dudhwa National Park clicked by Shailendra Kumar Singh.

Divya Mittal, at present posted as vice-chairperson, Bareilly Development Authority, has clicked newly installed giant Jhumka. “It’s really nice to see my picture on the calendar. I am not an avid photographer as such but have realized that when a picture is clicked, there are many aspects that come to light not noticed with a naked eye. Bareilly’s jhumka was recently installed at a crossing in Bareilly. I will always remember this as it was installed when I was here,” she told TOI.

The troupe had displayed a board bearing their name at the rear of the vehicle and the name of their latest play on the front side, without any inkling that they are heading towards legal tangle.

However the motor vehicle officials led by the assistant inspector Sheebe from Triprayar intercepted their tempo traveller and first levied a fine of Rs 500 from the driver for not wearing the khaki uniform, according to Unni Jayanthan, the head of the troupe.

“Subsequently, the officials said we have violated the rules under the Motor Vehicle Act by putting up the boards on the vehicle and we have to pay a heavy fine for it. But we said we were not aware that this was a violation and all the drama troupes have been doing this for several years,” said Jayanthan.

PILIBHIT/ BIJNOR/AGRA/BAREILLY: Hailstorm and incessant rainfall caused by western disturbance in north India in the past couple of days have caused widespread damage to wheat, mustard-rapeseed and lentil crops in west Uttar Pradesh region. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath tweeted that district magistrates (DMs) of affected districts have been directed to assess the damage and provide timely assistance to farmers.

The agriculture department has also made available a toll free number, 1800909090, for farmers to share details about their losses.

In Bareilly division, crop losses have gone up to 80% at several places, bringing tears to farmers. District magistrates in the division have asked farmers to share details of losses and directed sub-divisional magistrates and tehsildars to conduct a survey for initiating compensation requests.

In Pilibhit district, Puranpur and Kalinagar tehsils are worst affected. Farmers here claimed that wheat crop suffered over 25% damage and mustard-rapeseed and lentil crops suffered over 60-70% damage.

In Bijnor district, nearly 15% crop losses have been reported from at least 12 villages. Muzaffarnagar district agriculture officer claimed that 5-10% loss in wheat and mustard crops were reported in the district, while in Meerut, the damage is estimated to be around 20%. Farmers here will not be able to make any insurance claim as at least 33% crop loss is required for the same, say officials. Besides, harvesting and sowing of sugarcane crop have been adversely affected due to water logging in the fields.

In Agra region, farmers claimed 60% damage to potato, wheat and mustard crops. According to the meteorological department, 6.6 mm rainfall was recorded till afternoon on Friday. Mohan Singh Chahar, regional president of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh’s Agra unit, said, “We have requested the authorities to conduct an assessment of the crop loss in a time-bound manner and provide adequate compensation to farmers.”

Agra district agriculture officer Rampravesh Verma said, “Our teams will start assessment of crop damage from Saturday.”

As per the official records of Pilibhit district agriculture department, the wheat crop in the current Rabi season was sown in 1.49 lakh hectares, mustard-rapeseed crop in 28,083 hectares and lentil in 2,210 hectares.

""As the wheat crop is at 'ear forming' stage, the grain’s growth in flattened crop will be retarded. The grain in affected parts will get shriveled. This will directly result in weight loss of grains by up to 25%, in addition to discolouring to it,” said Dr Shailendra Singh Dhaka, an agricultural scientist at Pilibhit Krishi Vigyan Kendra, a unit of Meerut-based Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Agriculture University.

“During spot inspection, I have observed that the maximum damage was done to mustard-rapeseed and lentil crops. As the mustard-rapeseed crop is almost at the harvesting stage, the rain and hailstorm ruptured the pods causing seeds to drop,” Dhaka added.

Pilibhit deputy director of agriculture, Yashraj Singh, told TOI that the district had 2.85 lakh farmer families, and only 25,034 had insured their crop under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. ""Farmers would be compensated by the respective insurance companies, provided the information about the loss was conveyed within 72 hours from the time of actual damage. Compensation to other farmers would be at the discretion of the revenue department and would depend on the allocation of relief fund by the state government,"" Singh added.

Bijnor deputy director of agriculture, JP Chaudhary, said, “We have asked our staff to conduct a survey to estimate the damage. As per preliminary assessment, around 15% of crops have been damaged. There are certain conditions for claiming insurance under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. Bijnor farmers had opposed the scheme and many did not pay premium. All farmers here are not covered under the scheme. Out of the total of 4.4 lakh farmers, only 1,402 had deposited the premium,” said Chaudhary.

Pilibhit deputy director of agriculture, Yashraj Singh, told TOI that the district had 2.85 lakh farmer families, and only 25,034 had insured their crop under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. ""Farmers would be compensated by the respective insurance companies, provided the information about the loss was conveyed within 72 hours from the time of actual damage. Compensation to other farmers would be at the discretion of the revenue department and would depend on the allocation of relief fund by the state government,"" Singh added.

Bijnor deputy director of agriculture, JP Chaudhary, said, “We have asked our staff to conduct a survey to estimate the damage. As per preliminary assessment, around 15% of crops have been damaged. There are certain conditions for claiming insurance under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. Bijnor farmers had opposed the scheme and many did not pay premium. All farmers here are not covered under the scheme. Out of the total of 4.4 lakh farmers, only 1,402 had deposited the premium,” said Chaudhary.

158,['7/03/2020'],40 per cent of seized hard disk contains porn: CBI to court,"CBI has chargesheeted more than 3,000 people in this case so far

BHOPAL: The hard disk seized from Nitin Mohindra, former chief system analyst of ‘Vyapam’, is loaded with pornographic material, CBI has said, while objecting to the demand raised by one of the accused in the recruitment and admission scam.

“As much as 40% of the hard disk contains porn, therefore it would be inappropriate, as per public policy, to give its clone,” CBI argued, while objecting to the demand made by Vyapam scam accused Pradeep Raghuvanshi . Special judge S B Sahu has asked CFSL experts to be present in court at the next hearing to decide the matter.

Raghuvanshi has asked for a clone of the hard disk. CBI opposed this and argued on Friday said it not only contains pornography but various other data unrelated to Raghuvanshi’s case and therefore a clone cannot be given to him.

“Since CBI has said that this hard disk has obscene contents, experts from CFSL will be present in the courtroom to show the files, its nature and authentication of facts,” the court ruled, posting the next hearing for April 6.

CBI has chargesheeted more than 3,000 people in this case so far and the hard disk seized from Mohindra is one of the most crucial evidences in the scam, although it had been in controversy from the very beginning. One of the prime allegations made by the petitioners in Vyapam scam was that the hard disks seized from Vyapam officials during investigation of case no 539/2013 of Rajendra Nagar police station, Indore was tampered by MP police then.

159,['7/03/2020'],Power thefts: One person is caught stealing electricity every six hours,"Representative image

BHOPAL: With long summer months poised right ahead, discoms are fretting over power thefts in the state capital. In a shocking information, official data reveals that at least one person was caught stealing power in the state capital, every 6 hours, in the past one year.

More than 1,600 people were caught stealing power from April 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020 in Bhopal itself. Officials are now making strategies to check these unaffordable power thefts and pilferage and reduce their losses.

CGM of Madhya Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company, Bhopal region, DP Singh Ahirwar said, “In the eight districts, which come under Bhopal region of discom , we have caught 16,147 people in connection with various power thefts. Recovery notices for Rs 39.59 crore have already been issued across the region for the power theft between April 1, 2019 and February 29, 2020. In the same period, 1,657 cases were reported from state capital Bhopal and recovery notices of Rs 6.64 crore have been issued against the accused.”

Ahirwar admitted that despite so many power thefts, situation has still improved in the past one year. “In the current financial year, per unit revenue in these 8 districts, has improved from Rs 2.44 to Rs 3.21 per unit,” he said. And during the same period, discom’s billing efficiency— the percentage of power billed to the power supplied—has also improved from 70% to 76%, but still a lot needs to be done, he added.

Now, individual targets have been fixed for each officer to ensure recoveries from non-paying consumers. “I personally took care of consumers who have dues above Rs 10 lakh pending, several of them have already paid up. Similarly for each officer, the category of the non-paying consumers has been fixed,” he said.

Talking about the modus operandi of power thieves, he said, “In several areas of state capital, it is done directly by hooking from the transmission and supply lines, which means here major type of theft is direct stealing of power. In some areas like Raisen, we suspect that power thefts are being done in a very organised way; we are taking action against those.”

To check power theft, the discom recently started a unique scheme, wherein people reporting power thefts will be rewarded with cash prizes. One of the officials said, if anyone is caught stealing power as per the information provided by an alert resident, the person who gives the information will get 10% of the amount recovered from the accused.

160,['7/03/2020'],AU brass steps up process to revive students’ union,"set for change

Prayagraj: Days after the varsity’s Academic Council (AC) gave the proposal for bringing back students’ union a green light, Allahabad University ( AU ) administration constituted an eight-member committee to speed up the process.

The committee would first consider the viability of electing a students’ union on campus and then submit its recommendations on how the university should go about it.

According to AU’s public relations officer Shailendra Mishra, the members of the committee are dean of faculty of arts Ranjana Bajpai, dean of faculty of commerce AK Mukherjee, dean of faculty of law RK Chaube, dean of faculty of science Shekhar Srivastava, chief proctor RK Upadhyay, PK Ghosh from department of economics, Rajeev Singh from department of electronics and communication and dean of students’ welfare KP Singh.

In the last meeting of the AC on February 27, the council members discussed the future of a students’ representative body on the campus and had agreed that there should be body for students’ union on the campus. It was also said that as a students’ council is not a permanent solution for addressing student’s grievances, direct elections cannot be avoided.

Hence, it was agreed upon that as there has to be an election on the campus in future and a committee shall be constituted by the varsity administration to recommend the modalities in respect to the future of student representative body in the campus.“The committee would be holding the meetings in the coming days and would formalise the future of the student representative body on the campus”, said the PRO.

“Whatever will be the shape of the student representative body on the campus, we have to abide by the recommendations of the Lyngdoh committee, will it be same as the previous union or there would be some middle path, between student union and student council, will be decided only after the members meet and discuss among themselves,” said chief proctor RK Upadhayay.

161,['7/03/2020'],New water reserves to quench thirst for 100 years: Report,"Representative image

JAIPUR: The discovery of 482 billion cubic metres (BCM) reserve (aquifer) in Jaisalmer and Barmer region will be able to provide drinking water to the entire western Rajasthan districts for the next 100 years, says a report prepared by the Union petroleum and natural gas (PNG) ministry, presented before the Jal Shakti ministry, PNG ministry and petroleum companies officials in Delhi on Friday.

Both the ministries along with the oil companies will work over the years to provide water in the water-scarce western Rajasthan region.

The report says that the discovered aquifers are part of Thumbli, Fatehgarh and Jagadiya water reserves with estimated availability of water in tune with 110, 82 and 290 BCM, respectively. The report further added that water contains Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)/Litre in the range of 1,000-10,000 while the maximum permissible limit of TDS for drinking water is 600 TDS per litre as per the standard rules.

“Thumbli aquifer is found to be the most suitable reserve for large-scale desalination project. The preliminary design says that reverse-osmosis based desalination technology is the most appropriate and cost-effective for the said purpose,” reads the report. In Thumbli, water is available at the depth of 100 to 1,100 metres, while at Fatehgarh it is available from 150 to 1,500 metres and in Jagadiya from 0-800 metres below the surface.

A feasibility report prepared by an oil company says that desalination from 5,000 TDS/L water to 1,000 TDS/L for a maximum of 15,000 KLD of water will come with an annual cost of Rs 14-38 crore. The biggest challenge is aquifer Jagadiya water reserve has a salinity or TDS in the range from 3,000-25,000.

PNG minister Dharmesh Pradhan has reportedly directed all petroleum companies to work with the Jal Shakti ministry in making the water available for end-users. In a press statement, Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said, “The discovery of water reserves will change the socio-economic landscape of people living in the desert districts in the arid region. The sustainable water supply for an estimated 100 years will create stable and consistent economic opportunities which will counter migration and preserve the cultural heritage of the region.”

ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad high court has set aside the decision of a five-member committee of the Allahabad University to cancel the result of interviews conducted for admission to the Ph.D course.

Disposing of a writ petition filed by one Amit Kumar and 34 others, Justice Ashwani Kumar Mishra directed that AU authorities to proceed in accordance with the law. “If authorities find any compelling reasons to cancel the process, the least that is expected of them is to indicate the reasons in the order and give an opportunity of hearing to the parties concerned,” the court said.

AU’s decision was challenged on the ground that no reasons were assigned for cancelling the interview results. The petitioners contended that the university had no jurisdiction to pass such an “arbitrary” order. However, AU counsel contended that a committee of all four deans of AU examined the process of admission to Ph.D course and decided to conduct fresh interviews.

Setting aside the AU order dated January 31, 2020, the court observed, “The minutes placed on record contain no reasons as to why the process of interview is being cancelled. Certain arguments in support of the decision is sought to be placed before the court by the AU’s counsel, but the court finds that no such material is reflected in the deliberation contained in the minutes of the meeting. It is, otherwise, not shown that this meeting has been held with reference to any specific provision contained in the statute of the university. In such circumstances, the decision taken by the university to cancel the interview for admission to the Ph.D course is not found to be sustainable, particularly as no reasons are contained therein.”

PITHORAGARH: A US woman of Pakistani origin was sentenced to four years of imprisonment by the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) in Uttarakhand’s Champawat on Thursday. She was found guilty of trying to “illegally” enter India from Nepal through the Banbasa immigration checkpoint in Champawat district on July 12, 2019.

Identified as Farida Malik, the 51-year-old woman, who claimed to be a singer and said to have visited India in the past, had reportedly left her passport back in Nepal and was on a bus which travels between Nepal and India. She did not have any valid travel documents and was held at the checkpoint. Notably, the woman’s Indian-born husband had deserted her in the US some time back.

According to police sources, a thorough investigation was conducted from all possible angles and nothing much could be established so far.

“Farida Malik is an American citizen. She was born in Karachi, Pakistan, in 1968. Her family migrated to the US in 1984. They got US citizenship later in 1992. She visited Nepal last year and on July 12 was caught travelling on a bus which runs between Kathmandu [Nepal] and Delhi,” said Lokeswar Singh , SP Champawat.

“The bus was checked at Banbasa and Farida was unable to produce her passport or visa. So, she was arrested. A case under section 3 of the Passports Act and section 14 of the Foreigners Act was registered against her. At the time of her arrest, the woman said that she was a singer and travelling to the NCR. Information of her conviction has been sent to the US Embassy in Delhi,” he added.

Meanwhile, GN Thwal, prosecuting officer, Champawat, said that Farida was kept in Almora jail and got bail in January this year on condition that she would not leave India until the court pronounces a final decision in the case. Thwal added that she was staying in Almora at that time.

“The CJM found her guilty of violating the Passports Act and the Foreigners Act and gave her a four-year jail sentence along with a fine of Rs 30,000. Also, if she fails to pay the fine, she’ll have to spend a month more in jail,” Thwal added.

On Friday, Farida’s lawyer Chandan Kargeti said, “We will file an appeal with District and Sessions Court, Champawat, against the judgment. The woman was married to an Indian man in the US. The man left her. She doesn’t talk much about her marital status.”

Kargeti further claimed that Farida suffers from bipolar disorder and “we have presented her medical history before the court”.

169,['7/03/2020'],Uttar Pradesh: BJP state executive churning after Holi,"Picture used for representational purpose only

LUCKNOW: The state unit of the BJP is expected to undergo a major churning in its executive committee comprising 16 vice-presidents and eight general secretaries after Holi. Sources said the party is expected to not only induct fresh faces, but also shunt out senior party functionaries who have been given a ministerial post or a seat in one or the other corporations or boards, in accordance with its principle of one-person- one-post.

To name a few, BJP MLC Ashok Kataria happens to be the transport minister besides occupying the post of state general secretary. Likewise, J P S Rathore is the chairman of UP Pollution Control Board as well as UP BJP vice-president. Similarly, Muzzaffarnagar MP Sanjeev Kumar Balyan is a minister of state in Modi cabinet in the ministry of animal husbandry and is also the vice-president of the state unit.

Sources said the party would soon hold a meeting to finalise the names of new office-bearers of the state executive as well as functionaries of various organisational wings. “This would allow accommodation of new aspirants to hold a senior post in the party organisation,” said a senior UP BJP leader. The new team, with a three-year tenure, is likely to keep caste and regional balances even as it gears up to take on the two regional satraps — SP and BSP — in the 2022 assembly elections, sources said.

A final decision, sources said, would be taken after due consultation with the BJP’s national president J P Nadda soon after UP unit finalises the list of its new top functionaries.

The decision on organisational churning comes almost two months after Swatantra Dev Singh was elected unopposed as UP BJP chief. An OBC leader, Singh is known to keep his fingers on the raw nerve of the grass-roots functionaries.

The new team, sources said, is also expected to bring in leaders who have been functioning at grass-roots level and would get key feedbacks.

170,['7/03/2020'],"Lucknow: We are sitting ducks &amp; can be lynched, cry those on ‘name &amp; shame’ hoardings","A hoarding at Clock Tower with names & photographs of persons against whom recovery notices were slapped

LUCKNOW: A day after district administration put up hoardings across the city with name, photographs and addresses of 57 persons against whom recovery orders of Rs 1.55 crore for damages caused by violence during December 19, 2019, anti-CAA protest were issued, the accused activists, cleric and commoners said on Friday they had been exposed to threats of ‘mob lynching’ and described the act of ‘naming and shaming’ as another tactic to create an atmosphere of terror and silence dissent.

The district administration, however, said the step had been taken as per law which provides for making public the names and identity of those damaging properties so that they don’t run away after selling their assets.

Retired IPS officer and dalit rights activist S R Darapuri, who was arrested on charges of instigating violence and later released on bail, submitted a memorandum to DGP, Lucknow DM and Police commissioner to get the hoardings removed as exposing names, photographs, phone numbers and addresses like this will put our lives in jeopardy. “We can be lynched and can be attacked by mobs at any public place as entire world can now identify us and knows our whereabouts,” he added.

Congress worker and social activist Sadaf Jafar, whose whereabouts have also been posted on the hoarding, said: “We got bail because prosecution said in the court that police have not been able to collect any evidence so far to show our specific involvement in violence.” She also said that she shot videos, which are a proof that she was asking police to take action against rioters and stopping her associates to go close to the place where stone-pelting was taking place.

“Even the faces of murders, rapists are not shown in public till they are convicted by any court of law. How the administration can put up photographs of those who have been given a bail and their cases are sub-judice,” she said. Activist and poet Deepak Kabir said recovery orders were issued without giving time to respond. “We were arrested and sent to jail where we received recovery notices. “I asked the jailer to grant me the permission to file my reply, but authorities turned a deaf ear. This is undemocratic exercise to terrorise people from exercising their constitutional right to protest,” he claimed.

Shia cleric Maulana Saif Abbas said the administration was unable to produce evidence against him. “We have faith in the constitution and judicial system and we will fight till the end,” he said. Echoing similar sentiments, Shia cleric Kalbe Sibtain Noori said, “We will move court for relief and then file a defamation case against police for framing us and portraying us like rioters.” Justifying the hoardings, additional district magistrate (trans-Gomti) Vishwa Bhushan Mishra, said “Law provides for making names public of those damaging public property so accused is not able to flee the country after selling off property. Also, people should not get cheated in buying these assets.” The law allows publication of advertisement in newspapers, putting up hoardings and public announcements, said Mishra.

Mangaluru: A few kilograms of home-grown vegetables to feed scribes and their families descending on this coastal city for the two-day 35th state conference of journalists’ commencing here on Saturday is certainly not enough. Yet making this small yet meaningful gesture to the conference that Karnataka Union of Working Journalists is organising was the School Development and Monitoring Committee of Government Upgrade Higher Primary School , Kuthloor , in Belthangady taluk.

Handing over an assortment of vegetables grown on the 0.5 acre school garden to the host association—DKWJU—on Friday, Ramachandra Bhat, SDMC member, said things have only looked bright for this rural school ever since DKWJU held a ‘grama vastavya’ there on December 23, 2018. “Ours was a school on the verge of closure with dwindling student strength, and fortunes changed since the union chose it for their village stay. We just wanted to repay their kindness,” Bhat said.

The school garden, thanks to the SDMC, is flush with 14 types of vegetables such as pumpkin, long beans, tomatoes and bitter gourd, all of which are used in the midday meals served to the 66 students studying there. Excess vegetables, if any, are sold to parents of students and the villagers, and funds generated used for betterment of the school, says assistant teacher Prashant. Students help Bhat in watering the garden prior to start of school, and even help him in this task on holidays.

Vegetables are organic and only cow dung slurry and green compost is used to grow them. Barring the cucumber patch that is old and needs replanting, other vegetable patches are thriving, he says. This in-house effort and campaign from SDMC has enthused villagers to enrol their wards to this school which has seen its strength rise to 66. The school has six staff and two honorary teachers that DKWJU is funding, and two others who take Kannada and spoken English classes for free.

The resurgence of this government school has also caught the attention of minister for primary and secondary education Suresh Kumar, who plans to visit it during the next academic year, and interact with students there, says Srinivas Nayak Indaje, president, DKWJU.

178,['7/03/2020'],Bhopalis throng Yes Bank to withdraw money,"People waiting outside a branch of Yes Bank in Bhopal

BHOPAL: Worried customers of Yes Bank thronged the bank’s M P Nagar branch on Friday morning following the Reserve Bank of India setting a withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 in a month from the bank for each customer.

Though there was no queue at the branch, one of the security guards on duty at the bank said that the turnout of customers on Friday was at least 10 times more than the usual.

Most of those who were coming into the bank were asking for withdrawal forms, some enquiring about procedure for closure of their account. A few of them were trying to figure out whether they should continue to have accounts with Yes Bank or snap ties. While there was an ATM in the corner, nobody was going there but heading straight to the bank. The bank officials had intentionally emptied trays of the ATM, sources said.

When asked about the reason for his visit, a young man waiting in the bank, said: “Obviously, I have come to withdraw money. I have my salary account here and have no other account in any of the banks. RBI’s announcement was sudden. I came here at 12 pm and have been here since then. The bank officials are saying I would get my money by 2 pm. Let’s see what happens, he said while refusing to disclose his identity. Another customer, Bhupendra, who had come for closure of the current account of M/s Ishan Builders, said he knew about the Yes Bank crisis. “I had told madam with whom I deal in the bank a fortnight ago, but she didn’t believe me. In fact, she asked me yesterday itself whether I needed an additional credit card.”

Bhupendra said he was contemplating closure of account in the Yes Bank. “It’s good that we gave cheques of a different bank to our employees as salary, otherwise all of it would have been dishonoured. We have current account in two-three banks, therefore, we don’t have a problem but those who have just one current account in Yes Bank would definitely face problems,” he said.

Bhupendra, however, said that he would wait for RBI’s action over next two-three days with regard to Yes Bank before deciding on whether to close the account there.

Senior citizen Ravindra Dhruv seemed quite assured that the crisis in the bank would be taken care of by the RBI. “I have come for withdrawal, but I don’t think there is any panic. After all, they are allowing you to withdraw Rs 50,000 in a month and not putting you in any kind of trouble. With RBI in the picture, we must remain assured,” he said.

Sunil Shrivastava, who operates the current account of M/s APO Agro Solutions in the bank, said: “It is not panic, but surprise as the RBI announcement came abruptly. I came to withdraw money because we tend to withdraw unnecessarily in such a situation despite assurances being given by the RBI and also the SBI chairman. In such situation, the money gets exhausted, thus aggravating the situation further. We have current accounts in other banks, too. Till the situation gets normal here, we shall transact in those banks.”

JAIPUR: Mild to moderate showers and hailstorm continued at many places in the state on Friday. Baffled with the crop damage that followed, the farmers are demanding immediate compensation, while administrations in many districts have already started the crop assessment work. The rainfall coupled with hailstorm has led to a dip in the day and night temperatures by almost 4°C. Bikaner remained the coldest in the state, where a minimum temperature of 12.2°C was recorded.

Attributing the hailstorm and rain to the active upper air cyclonic circulation and western disturbances, Jaipur Met office said that similar conditions will prevail in the state for the next couple of days. People in Jaipur woke up to showers and hailstorm, which guided mercury to dip, as a minimum temperature of 14.4°C was recorded in the city. Due to the poor drainage management by the civic authorities, many localities in the city witnessed waterlogging. However, the erratic weather did not impact the air, road and rail traffic from Jaipur.

Alwar received a rainfall of 70mm which was the highest in the state. Alwar district as a whole has been badly affected by the hailstorm and rain. “In past three days, there has been crop damage, especially of wheat and mustard crops,” said Ramesh Meena, a farmer from Macheri village in Alwar district. Alwar was followed by Pahari (Bharatpur) and Malakhera (Alwar) where a rainfall of 50mm each was recorded. Many places in Alwar, Bharatpur, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur witnessed rainfall varying from 30mm to 10mm.

On Thursday, chief minister Ashok Gehlot held a meeting and maintained that the state government is “sensitive” and will ensure timely crop assessment to give relief to the farmers. With the hailstorm and rain, majority of the places witnessed their minimum temperatures below 15.0°C, which compelled the people to bring out their woollens. In its forecast, Jaipur Met office said that mild to moderate showers will continue at some places in eastern Rajasthan including Jaipur, Dausa, Alwar and Bharatpur.

HYDERABAD: Congress party on Friday termed the address of governor Tamilisai Soundararajan as a speech far from truth without any mention of numerous poll promises made by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao which remain unfulfilled.

Congress floor leader in the assembly, Bhatti Vikramarka and former minister Mohd Ali Shabbir said governor’s address to Telangana legislature on the first day of budget session was completely silent on key electoral promises and missed several important issues.

“The governor’s address is considered as a progress report and vision document of a government. However, Soundararajan’s speech sounded more like a TRS pamphlet than an official document. It is highly unfortunate that CM KCR’s government made the Governor speak lies, tell half-truths and make false claims in her maiden speech,” Shabbir Ali said.

Shabbir Ali said there was no mention of contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizenship (NRC) or National Population Register (NPR) in the governor’s address.The KCR government should have announced through governor’s address that it was against the controversial law and it would not be implemented in Telangana, he said.

Bhatti said the governor’s address failed to give any clarity on irrigation projects, unemployment allowance, delivery of 2 BHK units, rythu bandhu and crop loan waiver.

188,['7/03/2020'],Tamil Nadu to up wind power generation by 440MW,"Picture used for representational purpose only

CHENNAI: After three years of stagnation, Tamil Nadu is under compulsion to install additional wind power generation capacity to comply with the renewable power obligation (RPO) norms prescribed by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission .

In line with the central commission’s norms, the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission recently gave its nod to Tangedco to purchase 440.64MW of wind power by floating tenders. It means additional wind power mills have to be installed in the state to meet the requirement. The state has 9,286MW wind power generation installed capacity. However, evacuation is only around 5,000MW.

The pace of growth has been slow in recent years owing to poor response to tenders floated by Tangedco to set up new windmills. A few tenders awarded to wind power companies in 2017 are yet to be commissioned. Moreover, only 70-75% of windmills are functional. The oldest ones with less than 1MW capacity are mostly non-functional and need to be repowered – replaced with higher capacity wind mills. Capacity of windmills in the state varies from 225KW to 2.1MW. Ones with low capacity are not being promoted now.

As per TNERC guidelines, the new tenders will be floated by Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) for Tangedco to meet the RPO for 2021-22.

The TNERC has approved a proposal to purchase 440.64MW of wind power through SECI for 25 years at Rs 2.84 plus Rs 0.07 as trading margin, totalling Rs 2.91 per unit to meet Tangedco’s non-solar RPO requirement from 2021-22, said TNERC in its order.

The rate at which Tangedco is set to purchase power now is much lower than what it had finalised with wind power generation firms in the past.

“Tangedco had floated a tender in Phase-I for 500MW at Rs 3.46 a unit as upper limit based on the all-India wind tender floated by SECI. Only 450MW of the 500MW was finalized then. PPA was signed with two companies for supplying wind power for 25 years at Rs 3.42 per unit,” said a senior Tangedco official.

But so far, one company has commissioned only 49.5MW of 200MW allotted to it and another company is yet to start the project. “There was lack of response from bidders even after extension of deadline twice for participating in the bid last year. Due to the poor response, further addition of 500MW could not be processed,” said the official.

“Since we have improved transmission facilities by adding new sub-stations, wind power evacuation will be substantially more in the coming years,” the official said.

Tamil Nadu is also the first state to use GPS in windmills. “With the new billing scheme, it is easy for us to know the wind power generation on a real-time basis. We depend on forecast for power schedule, but with GPS, we are able to know the wind generation live,” said the official.

GHAZIABAD: A lawyer has been booked for allegedly firing at his colleague on Friday morning after a heated argument between them on a WhatsApp group two days ago.

Both lawyers had been called to the office of the Bar Association president, on the district court ’s premises, on Friday morning, when the accused fired three shots. Fortunately, none of the bullets hit anyone. The accused lawyer has been identified as Rahul Chaudhary , a resident of Mehrauli in Ghaziabad .

Vikrant Tyagi, also a lawyer in the Ghaziabad court, alleged that on Wednesday night, Rahul had abused him on WhatsApp and threatened to kill his family following an argument over the Bar Association president. “Around 11.20 am on Friday, I had gone to lodge a complaint against Rahul with the president of the Association. Rahul arrived at his chamber and a heated argument ensued between us. He shot at me three times, but I dodged the bullets,” Vikrant said. Sunil Dutt Tyagi, the Bar Association president, said a meeting of all lawyers had been scheduled with the district judge on Friday. “I will write to the Bar Council to cancel their membership,” he added

SP (city) Manish Kumar Mishra said an FIR had been lodged against Rahul under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation). “An investigation is underway and action will be taken after a report is submitted,” he added.

A senior police officer said that a couple of years ago, Rahul had been arrested in the murder case of one Ishwar Tyagi, the father of an IPS officer. Even his younger brother, Johnny, was arrested in the same case.

192,['7/03/2020'],Rajendra Kumar takes charge as acting DGP,"Acting DGP Rajendra Kumar taking charge from VK Singh at the police headquarters in Bhopal on Friday

Bhopal: Rajendra Kumar took charge as acting Director General of Police (DGP) of Madhya Pradesh on Friday after his predecessor VK Singh took charge of his office at the directorate of sports and youth welfare.

Meanwhile, the new full-time DGP, Vivek Johri, would be taking charge after getting clearance from the Union home ministry. Sources say it would take minimum of two weeks for Johri to complete the formalities.

Amid political turmoil over ruling alliance MLAs going “missing” from Madhya Pradesh, the Kamal Nath government had on Thursday evening transferred DGP VK Singh and replaced him with 1984-batch IPS officer Vivek Johri, who is currently DG of BSF.

Rajendra Kumar, who is special DG (cyber cell), was been asked to take charge as acting DGP till Johri assumed charge in Madhya Pradesh after returning from central deputation. There were several reasons why the chief minister decided to get a DGP — one being the fact that he was reportedly unhappy with the current performance. CM was apparently also angry over alleged inputs that some of the IPS officers in the state government were put under constant surveillance by the counter intelligence (CI) cell a couple of months ago.

Johri, who was special secretary in Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), is now awaiting Union home minister Amit Shah’s nod to take charge as MP DGP.

195,['7/03/2020'],"No green nod for gas, oil digs in Tamil Nadu since 2015: Centre","CHENNAI: The Union government on Friday said environmental clearances were granted to 18 oil and gas exploration projects in the country between 2015 and 2019, but none in Tamil Nadu . This includes 14 new projects sanctioned in Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Mizoram, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, according to Union minister for environment, forests and climate change Prakash Javadekar.

He was responding to DMK MP A Ganeshamurthi, who sought to know the on-shore and off-shore oil and gas exploration projects permitted across the country. On the member’s query on whether the government exempted drilling, including the activity in the Cauvery delta, from the requirement of environmental clearance and environment impact assessment, Javadekar said in the normal scheme of things, any project proponent would have to apply to the State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) and the authority would take a final call on the matter.

“The final decision as to whether to allow any project in any particular region would continue to vest with the state government. Further, such projects are also required to obtain consent under Air and Water Acts from the state pollution control boards,” Javadekar said. In the midst of protests in various parts of Tamil Nadu, the environment ministry in January recategorized the on-shore and off-shore oil and gas exploration projects or activities from category A to category B2. All projects in respect of on-shore and off-shore oil and gas exploration have been brought under B2 and would not require environment impact assessment and public consultation.

The minister said the recategorization has been done on the ground that exploratory drilling was a temporary activity and would be completed in three to four months without having any permanent establishment or set up at the exploratory site. The exploratory wells are drilled only for appraisal without taking out any commercial production at this stage. It is in fact, a prospecting activity for ascertaining the presence of hydrocarbons. Drilling involves a small piece of land, which has limited scope of waste generation along with minimal environmental impacts for a short span. Also, there is no requirement of prior environmental clearance even in case of exploration of coal and other major or minor minerals, and consent to establish and operate shall still be required from the respective state PCBs or Union Territory pollution control committees.

UDUPI: A prolonged monsoon across Udupi district , which recorded second-highest rainfall in the state, has helped increase groundwater level and the water level at reservoirs in Baje dam and Shiroor.

The water level at Baje vented dam, which is one of the most-important water sources for the district, stood at 5.6m on March 4, as against 4.9m the same day last year. Though the inflow into Swarna river has stopped from February, the dredging work undertaken by the district administration and City Municipal Corporation at Baje dam and near Shiroor last year has increased the water storage here.

Udupi CMC commissioner Anand C Kallolikar said the situation is better this year. “However as a precautionary measure, necessary steps have been taken to face summer. Baje dam is the only water source for 35 wards coming under the municipality. We have categoised the wards under 24 zones to ensure water supply to even high-lying areas. There is enough water storage in Shiroor dam,” he said.

Water rationing was done to tide over crisis during March last year. “We do not see any need for such rationing this year. Udupi has always had enough water. However from 2017, it was declared as drought-affected district. Dredging, which is done at major parts of Baje and Shiroor dams, has increased storage of water. The CMC has also taken special care to fix leaks in the dam,” he said.

There are about 10,500 houses in Udupi city, 70-80 industrial units and 570 apartments in Manipal Industrial Zone. There are also about 1,000 commercial establishments, 600 hotels and 40 lodges. The city has a population of 1.6 lakh. Fourteen people are working at Baje dam in three shifts. “Special care has been given to protect the dam,” Kallolikar added.

199,['7/03/2020'],Cabinet approves formation of Ram Van Gaman Path trust,"Bhopal: In a step towards fulfilling its poll promise of tracing and developing the Ram Van Gaman Path (a path trekked by Lord Ram during his exile), the Madhya Pradesh cabinet on Friday approved the formation of a trust for the construction of Ram Van Gaman Path from Chitrakoot to Amarkantak.

“Chief minister will be chairman of the trust and chief secretary will be a member. Four MPs and MLAs will also be members while minister for culture and religious trusts will also be members. Eight non-government members will also be appointed,” minister for law and public relations PC Sharma said briefing mediapersons after the meeting.

He said chief minister Kamal Nath expressed displeasure with the Mandir Zameen Niti (Temple Land Policy) and rejected it. Last month, the policy was framed to use excess/surplus temple land for commercial purposes and raise revenue for the temple trusts. “Chief minister has rejected the policy and said that no temple land can be used by private parties,” Sharma made it clear.

State cabinet headed by chief minister Nath discussed and approved the budget proposals for fiscal year 2020-21. Council of ministers also discussed the Governor’s address for the Budget session and approved it. Though the government would not specify, sources said the budget size is estimated to be about Rs 2 lakh crore.

Chief minister Kamal Nath invited suggestions from ministers on the annual state budget.

In a major decision, the state cabinet also approved purchase of 1,320 MW power through a tender released by the Madhya Pradesh Power Management Company. Approval has been given for purchase of power from a new thermal power project to be set-up by Adani Power Limited.

Briefing the media after the cabinet meeting, minister for law PC Sharma said, “Tender was based on the DBFOO (Design Build Find Own Operate) model and the guidelines of the Union Ministry of Power. Cabinet approved the tender with minimum rate of purchase at Rs 4.790 per unit for the year 2026-27. The state Power Management Company has been authorized to initiate further action.”

Cabinet agreed to give a 2.5-acre land to the Mahavir Kirti Stambha Samiti in Bhind at an annual rate of Re 1 only.

Government decided to continue for another five years with six posts including director, deputy director and senior technical advisor of the CM Helpline operations under the department of Public Service Management. Three new posts of office assistant have also been approved.

CHENNAI: Punjab education and PWD minister and AICC head for protecting properties belonging to the Congress, Vijay Inder Singla, has directed the recently-revamped state committee for property protection and recovery to regularize papers of all properties owned by the Congress in Tamil Nadu. Singla was in Chennai to attend the first meeting of the 11-member property protection committee on Friday.

“The meeting was to take stock of Congress’s assets in Tamil Nadu. We are trying to do the paperwork, wherever we don’t have the papers or where property tax dues to state government are pending, besides identifying properties that have been encroached. It will be streamlined in a month,” Singla told TOI.

The mandate of the new committee is to regularise all properties belonging to the party and ensure there is no room for irregularities. “They will check the status of each property, physical possession and encroachments. We are trying to evaluate the worth of the properties and compile a list,” Singla said.

Referring to the dissent over dissolving the earlier committee headed by senior advocate R Gandhi, Singla said the members of the previous committee were invited for the meeting and they too participated. “We will all work together as the idea is to strengthen the party and its assets,” he said.

According to members of the earlier committee which was formed three years ago, they had travelled across the state for six months and had drawn up a list of 137 properties, with an estimated worth of Rs 689 crore. “We submitted a report based on our study to Singla about the status of those properties. We participated in the meeting based on his invitation,” the sources said.

He said the 10-day Pattana Pragathi programme was a big success and was able to bring a qualitative change in the lives of people. The programme was also helpful in creating awareness among people on the new Municipalities Act, he said.

The minister held a review meeting with additional collectors, who have been made in-charges of local bodies, here on Friday and said Pattana Pragathi was a stepping stone for the development of municipalities and urban areas. He said long-pending issues like sanitation that could be redressed without any delay were identified and resolved. “Some issues can be resolved with the help of ward committees. This process should continue,” KTR said.

The minister asked them to prepare a sanitation plan, green plan, water audit and other issue-based plans. “A detailed report should also be prepared on infrastructure in each municipality which will help in turning them into model towns,” he said.

JAIPUR: Four teachers of a government school at Raisinghpura village in Rajasthan’s Sriganganagar district were suspended and rest of the staff transferred after a preliminary probe revealed that the accused may have been showing obscene videos to girl students in their classrooms.

The principal of the school has also been suspended for failing to act on a complaint against the teachers by a group of villagers a month ago.

“Though the principal wasn’t directly involved in the crime, he didn’t take action against the accused when the villagers reached out to him. The teachers were able to continue with what they were possibly doing due to his negligent attitude,” secondary education director Sourabh Swami said on Friday.

The education department had set up a two-member probe committee after the local administration reported a protest by villagers on the school premises around a week ago.

Based on the preliminary probe report, the education authorities have filed departmental chargesheets against the teachers.

“If they are proven guilty, the department will terminate them from service,” Swami said.

While the education department is yet to approach the cops, a molestation case was lodged at the local police station last week on the basis of a complaint by a former sarpanch of Raisinghpura.

The complaint accuses unidentified teachers of forcing girl students to watch obscene videos on their mobile phones and molesting them. The police have, however, failed to make any headway with the investigation because the complainant has suddenly turned hostile and the girls’ families apparently wouldn’t let them speak out.

“Police teams have visited the village several times to ascertain the veracity of the allegations, but none of the students would talk about it. Senior officials have been trying to make them understand that we can take action only if we have evidence beyond doubt that such an incident did happen,” Sri Ganganagar SP Hemant Sharma told TOI.

Notices have been sent to the complainant and the school to share the objectionable content that the teachers are alleged to have shown the girl students.

Several areas in the city have been reeling under non-availability of water after KWA began stocking water at Iranimuttam tank and observatory lower-level tank for the pongala from Friday. Areas under the PTP and Thirumala tanks are the most affected.

S Sujith, secretary of Vellayambalam Residents’ Association, said high-level areas have been experiencing water shortage for the last 4-5 days. “Low-level areas have been experiencing water shortage for around 2-3 days only. KWA officials informed us that shortage is due to temporary diversion of supply for the pongala and it will be resolved by Monday,” he said, adding that water was supplied in tankers on Friday.

“We are also worried as we have planned an annadanam at Althara Yakshi Amma Temple on the pongala day. We are not sure whether water will be available for it,” he said.

Most of the areas affected include the areas where people assemble to offer the pongala. Senior officials of KWA said only partial water disruption will be experienced in the city due to diversion. “Effects of diversion are likely to experience by Saturday only,” the KWA officials said.

Meanwhile, the human rights commission has asked KWA superintending engineer to file a report within two weeks about the water supply disruption in Statue and Pulimoodu. This was based on a complaint filed by around 350 houses under Pulimoodu Residents’ Association. The residents complained that they were not getting water for the last 20 days. In the petition, association secretary P Sukumar stated that the KWA was claiming that the shortage was a result of diversion for the pongala. “However, we have not been getting regular supply of water after shutdown for renovation in January and February,” he said.

A bill to implement this scheme was passed by Lok Sabha on Wednesday with estimates suggesting that the government could mop up Rs 1.5 lakh crore from the latest project to settle pending direct tax disputes.

Chouhan addressed a gathering of several businessman explained the benefits of the scheme. Apart from reducing litigation, the scheme could help the government mop up additional revenue at a time when tax collections have been muted.

“This scheme has been launched with a sole motive of eliminating all kind of legal disputes at all judicial forum and giving a very big benefit of waiver of interests and withdrawal of penalties as well as immunity from prosecution,” Chouhan told TOI. “As far as MP and CG is concerned we have 32,070 appeals pending before commissioner appeals, 2,949 appeals before the ITAP and assesse, and 858 before high court and 59 in SC,” he added.

“For the two states, we would be implementing this scheme on the basis of a strategy which I have named as Vivad Se Vishwas safalta abhiyan. A complete data has been analysed in terms of ground of appeals and we have also identified target tax payers,” said the officer.

Under the scheme, a taxpayer who pays the disputed tax before March 31, will get complete waiver of interest and penalty. The scheme would remain open from March 1 to June 30, 2020, and those who avail of it after March 31 would have to pay some additional amount.

According to a press release issued by the Ministry of Finance, after the introduction of Vivad se Vishwas in Lok Sabha, several queries have been received from the stakeholders seeking clarifications in respect of various provisions contained in the Scheme. After considering various queries received from stakeholders, CBDT has clarified the same in the form of answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs).

The FAQs contain clarifications on scope and eligibility, calculation of disputed tax, procedure related to payment of disputed tax and consequential benefits to the declarant. These FAQs are available on the official website of the Income Tax Department.

Chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy has asked the officials to get ready to meet the new target and asked them to keep house sites and pattas ready for 26 lakh women across the state to be launched on Ugadi day this year.

The CM held a review meeting with the officials on the housing programme at the camp office in Tadepalli near here on Friday. He reviewed arrangements being made for the Ugadi event where the government would distribute house sites to 26 lakh women in the state.

The government is planning to build 30 lakh houses in the next four years. The CM enquired about the funds sanctioned in the urban and rural areas as part of the centrally-sponsored schemes and the funds that were to be sanctioned by the state government for the same.

He said houses have to be constructed for those who already have plots in addition to the beneficiaries who are going to be given pattas.

The officials said that the plan was ready for the construction of over 19.3 lakh houses to the beneficiaries in the limits of municipalities and urban development authorities.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even as people are worried over stories of kidnap attempts on little children , such a bid was reported in the state capital on Friday. The attempt was made on a one-year-old son of a deaf and mute couple residing at Thamalam under Karamana police stations .

Geetha, the mother of the child, said two men entered their residence by jumping over the periphery wall of the house and tried to kidnap the child, who was playing in the bedroom. However, while they were trying to escape through the same route, Geetha, who came out of the bathroom, confronted them. The men threatened her at knifepoint and escaped leaving the child behind. They also threw chilli powder at her face.

Geetha is the wife of Manoj, who works in a restaurant in a mall here. The couple has two sons. It was the younger son who faced the kidnap attempt. The family lived with Manoj’s father, Mohan, who is also deaf and mute.

The house that the family resided shared its rear periphery wall with a large plot where the crematorium of Konkani community in the city functioned. Geetha told the police that the two men came via the crematorium. She was in the bathroom then. The bathroom was also located behind the house, attached to the same compound wall which the kidnappers scaled.

After attacking her with the chilli powder, they escaped through the same route.

“The incident happened around 4pm. When she came to us, it was around 4.30pm. She was still under panic. There was chilli powder on her body as well as on the child,’’ said Ashok Kumar, her neighbour.

After she described to them what happened, Kumar contacted the city police control room. The police reached the spot and launched a search for the suspects. The local residents and the trade union workers at the junction nearby too joined the search.

A day ago, a similar kidnap attempt was reported at Karunagappally in Kollam in which the police detained a wandering woman. Two weeks ago, a 15-year-old boy from Karamana police station limits had gone missing and ended up dead in a river nearby with no clothes on. The police are yet to solve the mystery behind that death.

A stay on the HC division bench’s order by the apex court would mean that EC can go ahead with its plan to update the voters’ list based on the electoral rolls used in 2015 local body elections, for which it has the state government’s support.

Necessary steps will be initiated after we get the stay order. We have adequate time to revise the list after the scrutiny and finalizing of around 15.5 lakh fresh applications. There’s no room for concerns,” said state election commissioner V Bhaskaran on Friday. The schedule for preparing the voters’ list will be decided after EC receives the stay order, he said.

The stay order, Bhaskaran said, shouldn’t be seen as a victory or defeat of a party. “EC presented the practical difficulties in using the voters’ list (prepared by Election Commission of India ) of 2019 Lok Sabha elections for the local body elections before the apex court. The court seems to have considered EC’s concerns,” he said.

EC was also able to convince people in the state about the practical difficulties in using the electoral rolls of 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he added.

Bhaskaran, who is also the delimitation commission chairman, said that the first meeting of the commission will be convened next week.

“The delimitation processes are going on, and we have already appointed LSGD joint director S Jyotsna Mol as the commission’s secretary,” he said.

Meanwhile in Thrissur LSGD minister A C Moideen said that the Supreme Court order on Friday will create conditions that would be conducive for the smooth and timely conduct of local body polls.

“Of course, it is for the election commission to take a final decision. But, government will provide all support to the election commission’s decision to conduct the polls on time,” he said.

The minister said that UDF was now apprehensive of facing the local body polls. It seems UDF is worried that its wrong political approaches will boomerang on the front. That is why UDF has been trying to postpone the election by adopting various pressure tactics within the assembly and outside, and filing petitions in different courts, Moideen alleged.

The tenure of the present local self-government institutions will be over by November 11, 2020 and general election to constitute panchayats and municipalities will have to be held before November 11, 2020 so that new members can take charge.

214,['7/03/2020'],Alwar: Two minors convicted in Pehlu Khan lynching case,"Representative image

ALWAR/JAIPUR: The Juvenile Justice Board in Alwar convicted on Thursday the two minors accused of participating in the mob lynching of Pehlu Khan in 2017. The quantum of punishment is likely to be pronounced on Saturday.

On Thursday, the board had asked the two accused if they had anything to say in their defence in case they were found guilty, following which they were convicted.

Pehlu Khan (55), a dairy farmer from Nuh district of Haryana, his two sons and some others were intercepted and attacked by cow vigilantes near Behror on April 1, 2017. Pehlu succumbed to his injuries on April 4 in a private hospital in Alwar. Seven cases had been registered — one against Pehlu and his sons for transporting cattle and the other cases against the mob which lynched him. There were a total of nine accused in the case, including the two minors.

A chargesheet against five of the accused was submitted before the trial court on May 31, 2017 while the chargesheet against one more was submitted in January 2019. Another chargesheet was submitted in the matter in May 2019; this one named Pehlu and his two sons as well though the deceased’s name was later dropped.

The seventh person had claimed to be a minor but the JJB found him to be an adult. His trial is still underway in a Behror court.

On August 14, 2019, a trial court in Alwar had acquitted the six people accused of lynching Pehlu Khan while he and a few others were transporting cows from Jaipur.

The trial court had given the benefit of the doubt to the accused citing a botched investigation by the Alwar police and saying the prosecution had failed to furnish key documents in court to prove the charges.

The acquittal had created a hue and cry following which the state government formed an SIT and decided to appeal the decision. The government had designated additional advocate general R P Singh as the law officer to pursue the matter before the high court.

The SIT was constituted under the supervision of the state’s ADGP (crime). It was to identify lapses in investigation and fix responsibility on individual officers who had conducted the probe. The SIT later pinpointed many serious lapses in investigation. In October 2019, the Rajasthan high court received two petitions, one from Pehlu’s family and another by the state government, against the acquittal of the accused. In the same month the HC ordered the quashing of the FIR and the chargesheet filed against Pehlu Khan, his two sons and the vehicle driver on grounds of “abuse of law”.

215,['7/03/2020'],Strike: Notices served on KSRTC staff,"Picture for representational purpose only.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala State Road Transport Corporation ( KSRTC ) has served notices on more than 22 of its employees who had haphazardly parked buses leading to over five-hour long traffic disruption in the city on Wednesday during a lightning strike. The drivers and conductors were also asked to explain their part for joining the strike.

Minister for transport A K Saseendran said motor vehicles department (MVD) and police can initiate action and need not wait for directive from transport department to act.

“A preliminary inquiry report was submitted by collector and detailed reports from transport commissioner and KSRTC CMD will be filed on Monday. Principal secretary (transport) will codify the reports and they will be submitted to chief minister. After discussing with the CM, action will be taken against those responsible for the lightning strike. There exists a high court verdict against the conduct of lightning strike and legal steps will be taken based on the final report. As MVD do not need to wait for a detailed report, they initiated steps as per MV rules,” Saseendran said.

On a query about the delay on the part of the government and higher officials, the minister said they did not expect it to become a serious issue. “The government had taken the initiative and sent KSRTC officials to resolve the issue. The altercation was first between KSRTC and private bus crew, which later became a dispute between KSRTC employees and police. If conductors are found responsible for the strike, action will be taken against them too. Action will be taken against the private bus crew as well,” the minister added.

About a proposal to impose ESMA Act, Saseendran said, “The act is not applicable to KSRTC. The drivers could have parked the buses in garage before joining the strike. This led to traffic disruption, affecting a lot of people and unfortunately a person died. The government do not support lightning strikes and there are other modes of protest. It is not a right tendency from KSRTC employees and the government will not support such actions. Measures will be taken to prevent such incidents in the future.”

Meanwhile, MVD is collecting details of bus drivers involved in the strike from police and KSRTC. “After the list is complete, we will serve notices on the drivers to appear for hearing. Based on the communication, action will be initiated against them,” an MVD official said.

The reason: Yes Bank does not have major presence in the city with only around 16 branches in areas such as Somajiguda, Hi-Tec City, Siddiamber Bazar, Secunderabad and Malakpet, among others.At Secunderabad branch, around 40-50 people gathered in the morning to make enquiries and withdraw cash. “Our company has an overdraft account with balance of over Rs 4 crore and our staff too has salary accounts in the bank. We thought it was better to enquire about our accounts and withdraw some cash as we would require capital for small operations. We were told that withdrawal limit has been fixed at Rs 50,000 but we were not able to withdraw even that amount,” said an official of a company.A banking industry expert pointed out that the reason many of Yes Bank branches did not see too much rush is because most of its customers are HNIs and corporates, who generally do not queue up for enquiries.A Yes Bank official said that Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s statement assuring the public of the safety of their deposits and bank employees of a year’s salary is positive development. “The FM’s statement has given confidence to us as well as customers,” he said.In a statement, Prashant Kumar, who has been appointed by RBI as administrator for Yes Bank, said, “The current moratorium has been brought into effect keeping the depositors’ interest in mind and towards restoring their confidence. A solution is being worked upon to revive the bank well before the moratorium period of 30 days ends. The bank is also taking necessary steps to ensure seamless transactions for customers. We assure the depositors that their money is safe and there is absolutely no reason to panic.”",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74521051,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-331377,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/yes-bank-customers-worry-about-deposits/articleshow/74519195.cms
217,['7/03/2020'],"Is this the politics MP should be known for, asks Nath","Chief minister Kamal Nath addressing in state convention of ‘Yadav Mahasabha’ at Bittan Market Dussehra Maidan... Read More

Bhopal: With the ‘horse-trading’ political turmoil deepening in Madhya Pradesh, chief minister Kamal Nath on Friday said that his leaders are not for sale.

“Political persons of MP are not saleable. Should we be identified by the Bhopal gas tragedy, mafia raj or such politics that we should keep away from? What should be the identity of Madhya Pradesh? Should it be identified by the politics from which we should stay away,” Nath said at the regional convention of the Yadav Maha Sabha here on Friday. “There are principles in politics. Congress believes in the politics of principles and service,” he added.

Nath urged everyone in politics to say that they are not for sale. “We have to create an identity of our politics in the country. Such an identity that we can be proud of and firmly say that we are from Madhya Pradesh, and this is our goal,” said the chief minister, betraying no sign of the nerve-wracking battle of the last three days.

Nath’s remarks came amid a raging political storm over alleged poaching of MLAs from Congress and alliance partners by BJP. The Congress has alleged that BJP leaders Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Narottam Mishra offered bribes of Rs 25-35 crore to Congress MLAs to topple the Kamal Nath-led government in Madhya Pradesh.

Expressing distress over decline in political ethics, the chief minister said, “Every party has its own principles in politics. But, there has been a decline in politics too. Today we have to protect and ensure that the three is no decline,” he said.

The chief minister called upon people to “recognise the forces that are active in dividing the country”. “India is known for its culture of unity in diversity. Its true strength is its spiritual power, which binds the nation and helps it move ahead,” said Nath, adding that it is the duty of senior citizens and the young generation to recognise the values of the country.

“They must introduce the new generation to the cultural values of the country and keep them connected. India is the only country that stands united under one flag despite its diversities,” he said, remarking: “There is a lot of difference between the elderly and the new generation. The new generation has access to technology and knowledge. The new generation wants opportunities to move forward. They have both ability and talent. The challenge is to create a new Madhya Pradesh and its new identity. Every citizen should be proud of Madhya Pradesh’s new identity in every field, be it economic, social and political,” he said.

Providing employment opportunities to youth by increasing maximum economic activities is top priority, he said, adding that employment generation is only one dimension of economic activity.

218,['7/03/2020'],Witnesses turning hostile can no more be a ground for acquital; HC,"Chennai: Asserting that witnesses of a criminal prosecution turning hostile has become the norm of the day, the Madras high court has made it clear that it can no more be a ground to acquit the accused.

“The witnesses in a case are the eyes and ears of the justice system and any manipulation of those witnesses, including threat, coercion, intimidation, lure, would definitely adversely affect the prosecution case. However, a balanced approach by segregating the grain from the chaff would in effect unerringly point the finger on the accused, had the accused adopted such a course,” Justice M Dhandapani said.

Witnesses are being bullied or gained over by the lure or lucre and they, without any moral regret, retract from their statements made previously before the police. The upshot is the acquittal of persons responsible for commission of heinous crimes - triumph of the devils and sorrow for angels, the court added.

Weeding out the culture compromise (turning hostile) is the greatest test not only for the prosecution, but equally for the judiciary as that culture, in no way, should tilt the scales in favour of the accused, thereby allowing them to walk out scot free. The scales of justice should be maintained in balance so that the wrong doer gets punished and the innocent is freed, the judge said.

The issue pertains to an appeal moved by Radha alias Radhakrishnan challenging his convection and 10 years sentence imposed by a trial court for attempt to murder. In his appeal, he claimed that since three prime prosecution witnesses including a victim witness turned hostile, there is nothing more with the prosecution to prove him guilty.

Opposing the appeal, additional public prosecutor Iyyapparaj explained the hardcore nature of the appellant, who is a habitual offender and against whom 35 cases are pending at various stages. He contended that there is nothing sinister in the prosecution witnesses turning hostile.

Concurring with the submissions of the prosecutor, the court said, “In the case on hand, as held by the court below, such a course adopted by the accused cannot be completely overruled and in such a scenario, the justice delivery system should break itself from its self-imposed shackles with a view to uphold the truth and majesty of justice, lest the faith on the judicial system, by the common man, would start dwindling.”

The trial court, on the materials available on record, and further taking into consideration the hostile attitude exhibited by the eye witnesses has come to the right conclusion that all was not well between the time they deposed in chief and the time they deposed in cross and the intervening mid-day break has been utilised by the accused to his benefit, has analysed the whole scenario coupled with the evidence and has arrived at a just and reasonable finding, which does not warrant interference at the hands of this court, Justice Dhandapani concluded.

Assembly secretary and returning officer P Balakrishnamacharyulu, issued the notification to fill the four vacancies caused by the retirement of the members on April 9.

The returning officer said the election process has to be completed by March 30 as per the guidelines of the Election Commission. The returning officer would receive the nominations at Hall No. 201 of the AP Assembly complex.

However, there were no nominations on the first day. Nominations would be received till March 13, 2020, the returning officer said.

Meanwhile, the ruling YSRC has done the required exercise to nominate its candidates. As YSRC is set to corner all the four seats, chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy has reportedly finalised the candidatures of two ministers Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose and Mopidevi Venkata Ramana , who are representing the Legislative Council.

As the state government had recommended for dissolution of the Legislative Council, the chief minister is in favour of sending the two ministers to the Upper House. Both the ministers represent the BC community to which Jaganmohan Reddy had pledged his party’s loyalties and their candidature is expected to increase the party’s prospects in the impending local body elections.

The CM has also finalised the candidature of industrialist and YSRC leader Alla Ayodhyarami Reddy for the third seat while decision on the fourth seat is yet to be finalised. Sources said that the CM was in favour of fielding Reliance vice-president and sitting MP, Parimal Nathwani.

Reliance Group chief Mukesh Ambani had met the CM last week where it is said that the candidature of Nathwani was discussed.

Nathwani, who is representing Jharkhand in RS is retiring on April 9 and is seeking another term from AP. It is said that Nathwani and Ambani have promised more investments in the state if the Rajya Sabha seat is given.

However, the names of industrialist and former MP Gokaraju Gangaraju’s son Ranga Raju, former MP from Amalapuram and P Ravindra Babu are also doing rounds for the Rajya Sabha seats.

CHENNAI: In a small relief to a man whose wife was a schizophrenic, the Madras high court has refused to transfer their matrimonial dispute case out of a family court in Chennai.

Justice S Vaidyanathan, who had earlier sent the couple for counselling and the woman for medical examination by the Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF) on her consent to ascertain her health status, directed the III additional family court here to conduct the case on day-to-day basis and bring the issue to a logical end as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a year (on or before April 1, 2021).

In her petition, seeking transfer of the case to a court in Tuticorin or to any other court in the state, the woman had claimed that though she is perfectly normal and fit to lead a normal matrimonial life, her husband found ‘one reason or the other to break the marriage’. As for a medicine – Sizdone – she had been taking, she said it had nothing to di with mental illness and that she had never hidden it from him.

On the contrary, the man told the court that even prior to the marriage, she had been taking treatment for her mental block andgot married to him after hiding her illness.

He said that doctors opined that the medicine she was taking would disturb the process of pregnancy and the medicine could not be stopped immediately, as the dosage has to be reduced slowly.

In its report, SCARF clearly stated that the woman is indeed a schizophrenic, suffering from serious mental illness.

Taking note of the report, the high court dismissed her request for transferring the court out of Chennai, pointing out that the wife is a bank employee working in a branch in Chennai.

As per Section 19(iiia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the matter has to be heard in a court where the wife is residing on the date of presentation of the petition. Pointing out that the transfer request has come from the wife’s father, the judge said: “The object of the legislation is very clear that the matter can be transferred to the place, where the wife resides and not to the place where her father resides. Therefore, I find no merit and justification in the present petition, as no genuine ground is made out for transfer of the case.”

The judge also directed the court and SCARF to give copies of medical report on the woman to her husband if he applies as per law.

PUNE: Civic officials and elected representatives on Friday said the Supreme Court ’s ruling that land acquisition proceedings would not lapse if compensation was deposited in the treasury would work to the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) advantage in reclaiming acquired plots stuck in dispute over compensation.Municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad told TOI, “Most pending projects held up due to land acquisition issues will be cleared. The judgment is a landmark in this context and will benefit the civic body and the citizens considering that pending initiatives will see the light of the day.”One such initiative is the eco-park project on Taljai Hills, proposed and approved by the civic standing committee in 2002.Sitting corporator and former deputy mayor Ulhas alias Aba Bagul said, “On paper, the entire eco-park project land is currently under the PMC’s possession, but the civic body is not in physical possession of 5% of this land as it is encroached upon by illegal constructions. After the judgment, the land can now be reclaimed and utilised for the eco-park (oxygen park) project.”According to the PMC’s proposal, a significant stretch of the project land would be used for developing an Oxygen Park. It also includes a wide range of landscaping, small amphitheatres, and cultural and sports facilities such as a cricket stadium. Even some adventure sport facilities, such as a skateboarding ramp and a rock-climbing face are part of project. Besides, a bamboo park is included in the initiative.A three-judge Supreme Court bench, while dismissing appeals filed by Pune Municipal Corporation and 17 others, had held on January 24, 2014 that deposit of compensation amount in the government treasury cannot be held as equivalent to compensation paid to landowners/interested persons in land acquisition proceedings.The apex court held the PMC’s land acquisition proceedings for the forest garden project (under the Land Acquisition Act of 1894) as “deemed to have lapsed” under Section 24 (2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, which came into effect from January 1, 2014.This was because the compensation award was declared more than five years prior to commencement of the 2013 Act and the compensation amount, deposited in the government treasury, had neither been paid to the landowners/interested persons nor deposited in the court as mandated by the 2013 Act, the top court then ruled.Later, in 2018, another three-judge bench of the SC held that the 2014 judgment was per incuriam (characterized by lack of due regard to law or facts).",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74523691,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-384285,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sc-ruling-to-hasten-completion-of-eco-park-on-taljai-hills/articleshow/74519945.cms

KOCHI: In the wake of the recent controversies over the affiliation and recognition of CBSE schools in the state, the Kerala CBSE Schools Management Association will write to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and state government to take immediate action in the issue. They said that unaffiliated schools should either be given affiliation or shutdown but should not be allowed to function without any recognition or affiliation.

Officials said the affiliation issue is affecting the image of CBSE system in Kerala and parents will hesitate to enroll students in CBSE schools if the issue is not resolved. The unrecognized schools are creating confusion among students and the public and the existing affiliated schools are bearing the brunt. They alleged that the state education department is keeping mum and is not taking action against illegal schools.

“CBSE schools in Kerala are already facing financial and other challenges. With the state education system providing various attractive offers, the number of students in the CBSE stream has been reducing and many schools are running in losses. The affiliation controversy will worsen the situation. Hence the CBSE has to resolve the issue at the earliest,” said TPM Ibrahim Khan, president, Kerala CBSE School Management Association.

Referring to the role of affiliated schools illegally helping the unaffiliated schools by sponsoring the students for the board exam, Khan said that CBSE should take action against such schools.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala raised corruption allegations against the state police chief Loknath Behera , saying that he had purchased 145 vehicles worth Rs 26.40 crore, flouting stipulated norms and guidelines in the purchase manual.

The home department too did something unusual as it regularized all purchases made by the state police chief. Even after more and more corrupt deals of Behera are coming out, the chief minister has become his spokesman. CM is eager to save him from all allegations,” claimed Chennithala.

The opposition leader, who produced government orders that regularized the purchase of 145 vehicles and 30 multimedia projectors made by the state police chief, said that all these purchases were made without taking prior permission from the government.

Behera has no authority to sanction purchase orders over Rs 1 crore. But, he gave orders worth over Rs 20 crore, flouting norms. The home department saved him by regularizing all purchases. All these purchases were made without inviting tenders, he added.

Chennithala flayed the government decision to probe the leakage of CAG report. “Instead of investigating the irregularities found in the CAG report, government is eager to know who leaked the report. This is a move to cover up corruption to the tune of crores, which CAG unearthed,” he said.

COIMBATORE: Security was tighetened across Coimbatore in the wake of the strike call by Hindu Munnani. Police commissioner Sumit Sharan told TOI that as many as 1,500 police personnel and three companies of Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel will be deployed from Saturday morning.

“Those who force traders to shut shops will be arrested,” Sharan added. Coimbatore collector K Rajamani said government offices, schools, colleges, buses and shops will function as usual. “Legal action will be taken against people who disturb normal life,” he said.

HM had called for a bandh on Friday after the outfit’s district secretary, M Anand, was attacked by miscreants on Wednesday. Meanwhile, tension gripped Annur after a group of HM members forced a Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam (TPDK) member, Ananda Krishnan, to close his tailoring shop and also manhandled him. As many as 50 cops were deployed in the area.

CHENNAI: Police on Friday arrested a man after CCTV camera footage showed him breaking into a Tasmac outlet in Mylapore on February 24. C Kuberan, who had scooted with Rs 14.65 lakh, worked as a cook during the day and targeted Tasmac outlets at night, a police officer said.

Police recovered Rs 13.40 lakh from the native of Karukampathur in Vellore district before a court sent him to jail. He had been committing such crimes for the past seven years before luck ran out, the officer said.

In the latest case, CCTV cameras at the Tasmac outlet failed to catch him, but a special team found him at Chennai Central Railway Station, bus stop and later EMU station through other cameras. His image, travelling with a yellow bag, was found even at Tiruvallur station and later he was found travelling in a share auto without his trademark monkey cap. Police traced his address in Tiruvallur and came to know he worked as a cook at his brother’s restaurant in Vellore. He was nabbed there.

Joint commissioner of police (East Chennai) R Sudhakar said, “We are questioning him to se if he was involved in previous offences.”

Explaining his modus operandi, an investigation officer said Kuberan had been looting Tasmac shops all these years using tools that he always carried with him. He was very meticulous and followed certain rules to ensure he covered his tracks completely, the officer said. “He never carried his mobile phone to the Tasmac outlet he planned to burgle. A day before the crime, he would switch it off and leave it at home. He would either turn CCTV cameras away from him or make sure he was out of their range. He would sleep near the targeted outlet, making sure everyone took him for a drunkard. At 1am, by when all staff of the outlet would have left, he would put on his monkey cap, break in and walk out with the cash,” the officer said.

229,['7/03/2020'],‘23% habitations in Rajasthan have no access to secondary schools’,"Representative image

JAIPUR: The objectives of Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), launched by the Centre in March 2009 to make quality education accessible and affordable, have not been met, according to the 2017-18 CAG report tabled in the assembly on Friday.

The project had targeted students in the 14-18 age group.

While there has been steady progress in implementing the scheme during the 2013-18 period, the report noted that 22.55% habitations (34,065 out of 1,51,042) did not have access to secondary schools within the prescribed limit of five kilometres.

This shows that the objective of RMSA to ensure universal access to secondary education by 2017 has not been met.

In 44% (99 out of 225) schools, the pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) ranged between 31:1 and 190:1. This pointed to the asymmetrical distribution of teachers in schools and did not reflect the overall state-level PTR that stood within the prescribed limit of 30:1. The government has failed to provide basic infrastructure facilities in every school even after nine years of implementing RMSA, it said.

Though the gross enrolment ratio (enrolment in Class IX and X as a percentage of total population) in the 14-15 age group in the state increased from 71.12% in 2013-14 to 78.87% in 2017-18, it’s still far away from achieving the goal of universal access to secondary education.

However, none of the elected representatives from the district took part in the meeting even though the meeting to discuss consumer rights is convened only twice a year.

District collector S Sivarasu and representatives of consumer protection organisations participated in the meeting to discuss public demands. This is the second district consumer protection council meeting for 2019, as it was held after a long delay.

With various subjects such as consumer rights, basic amenities, health and transport discussed, the event saw a demand to establish the long-pending IBT for Trichy city at Panchapur. As the other sites chosen for two-decades-old project were shelved because they were found unviable, consumer associations pitched the state government and local body to allot land in Panchapur. Another demand was to operate city-suburban trains on a circular route.

“Introduction of circular train route from Trichy railway junction connecting Palakkarai, Fort, Mutharasanallur, Srirangam, Town, Ariyamangalam and Ponmalai railway stations will bring down traffic congestion on roads,” said M Sekaran, Tamil Nadu Consumer Federation president. They requested to forward the demand to the railway board through the consumer protection committee.

The circular train route suggestion linking the city and suburban railway stations will require a new bridge across Cauvery between Mutharasanallur and Srirangam. Sources said that the minutes of meeting and demands will be forwarded to the elected representatives to fetch solutions.

KOCHI: The high court has issued a stay on state government’s move to merge the Malappuram District Cooperative Bank with Kerala Bank. It is the only district cooperative bank that has opposed the merger of various district cooperative banks with Kerala Bank.

Justice AK Jayasankaran Nambiar issued a stay after considering a petition by Tuvvur Panchayath Service Co-operative Bank president Abdul Majeed. An ordinance brought in by the state government for the alleged forced merger of district cooperative banks has been challenged in the petition. The court has sought the views of Reserve Bank of India , state government, Nabard, and registrar of cooperative societies in the matter.

According to the petition, Malappuram district cooperative bank was opposed to the merger even though the remaining 13 district cooperative banks in the state accepted the merger proposal. Public meetings were held on March 7 and July 18 last year but the merger proposal was not accepted. Of the 130 cooperative societies under the district bank, 98 opposed the merger proposal while 32 were in favour. Government decided to bring in an ordinance to force the merger in the backdrop of not being able to get an approval from Malappuram District Cooperative Bank for the merger despite holding two public meetings, the petition said.

Through the ordinance, registrar of cooperative societies was given the power to order the merger in public interest if a resolution favouring merger could not be passed in public meeting within three months of the ordinance coming into being, the petition stated.

At the high court, the petitioner has contended that the ordinance is against the provisions of Kerala Cooperative Societies Act and takes away the powers of cooperative societies.

BHOPAL: BJP MLA Sanjay Pathak — who has been accused by Congress of trying to poach ruling alliance MLAs — on Friday refuted claims that he had called on chief minister Kamal Nath at his official residence at midnight on Thursday. Expressing a threat to his life, he said he would not quit BJP.

“It’s false and baseless that I discreetly called on CM Kamal Nath. I am a member of BJP and will always remain with BJP,” Pathak said in a video statement on Friday.

He said the picture being circulated to show that he visited the CM’s residence was fake. “The person with his face covered is somebody else. I am busy attending to my brother-in-law who is undergoing a major surgery in Hyderabad. I will not succumb to any pressure, come what may,” he said.

The BJP MLA from Vijayaraghogarh in Katni district told TOI that he sees a threat to his life. He is upset at the closure of his iron-ore mines by Jabalpur district administration citing Supreme Court orders. The government is indulging in political vendetta by “dragging him into the MLA poaching row”, he said, and shared his apprehensions in a video that is doing the round of social media.

“When I was coming from airport, three men in civil dress chased me up to Vidisha Road. I somehow managed to dodge them. These people can kill and throw me anywhere for their political gains. I fear that they could commit my political murder,” said Pathak, adding that he would very soon provide evidence of it.

238,['7/03/2020'],Sudhir Gadgil's untold stories of eminent personalities at Rupali 'katta',"Attn desk: It is Sankla Buildcoon

TIMES CELEBRATE PUNE

Pix by Sadanand Godse

Pune: Eminent Marathi anchor Sudhir Gadgil, one of the earliest founders of the 'katta' culture in Pune, has many precious memories of interactions with renowned personalities, such as Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar and melody queen Lata Mangeshkar, among others.

He shared some of his finest memories and some untold stories of these personalities on Friday in the Katta Unplugged segment of the Amstrad Times Celebrate Pune festival powered by Phoenix Marketcity and co-sponsored by Sankla Buildcoon. The katta session was anchored at hotel Rupali by Milind Kulkarni.

Narrating an experience, Gadgil recalled that Pt Bhimsen Joshi's musical programme 'Santwani' would take place late at night in the heart of Pune. ""One day, the programme got over around 2 am. Panditji used to signal the end of the concert by removing the shawl from his lap and people would get up and leave. But there were a few, including me, who would wait till he left. As he was about to leave, a labourer emerged from the street in Sadashiv Peth and told Panditji with much courage that there was this one line in one of the abhangas in his performance which was not up to the mark.""

After hearing this, Panditji at 2.30 am made all his musicians reorganise themselves and presented the 'abhang’ all over again, perfectly singing the line pointed out by the labourer!

Another incident that Gadgil fondly remembered was of former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh. Gadgil said that his 'kattas' had become famous then and he was friends with Deshmukh. Once the former CM asked Gadgil about 'Anil Paan Katta', opposite Abasaheb Garware College and said he wanted to join and experience it. Gadgil said that he would be permitted to join the katta if he was ready to let go of the protocol, convoy and bodyguards.

""He agreed and left his convoy at the Nal Stop chowk and walked towards the katta. There was a wall near the paan shop. Deshmukh hopped on it. Then he asked if the Janata Bank branch was still there. We were curious to know why he wanted to know about the bank. He said that when was studying in Pune, he would work as a demonstrator and deposited his salary in the bank. His bank account still had Rs 62 from his salary savings,” recalled Gadgil.

An unknown talent of Gadgil that very few knew about also came to light – of the numerous sketches he had drawn of the personalities he met. Gadgil said that many of the sketches were drawn at hotel Rupali as many people came and went there, so there were great variations which made his drawings different. Once, he even drew a sketching of socialist S M Joshi in 1988 which Gadgil showed to the participants of the 'katta'.

Gadgil said that he would travel to Mumbai for work daily for seven years and had bought a first class pass of Deccan Queen only because he would get to meet great personalities during the journey.

He narrated an incident from an interview with music legend Vasantrao Deshpande. Gadgil said that Vasantrao would work in the Defence Accounts and once humourist P L Deshpande called him at his office and said that a film shoot was going on just across the road where Vasantrao lived. Gadgil said, ""After the call from P L (Deshpande), Vasantrao hung his coat on the back of his chair to create an impression that he was around somewhere in the office. However, he had hopped on to his bicycle and gone to the shooting location. He even sang a song in six different voices there!""

Gadgil said that his career in anchoring had given him a lot of pride and respect but apart from that, he was also fortunate to meet important personalities from various fields. It also helped him build his vocabulary, enabled him to speak correctly and update his general knowledge.

Gadgil said that among all the personalities he had met and interviewed he cherished his interview with singer Asha Bhosale with whom he shared the stage on 29 occasions in India and abroad. Another was with former President APJ Abdul Kalam. He said that in his entire career he has conducted 4,000 interviews but the learnings and inside stories he got were over 8,000.

The 'katta' was joined in by former MP Pradeep Rawat, Sardar Ranjitsinh Garud, Rajabhau Bhanage and Shashi Shetty, the owner of Rupali.

A video clip of the incident went viral on social media soon after the incident. The commission took suo motu cognizance of the incident based on media reports and subsequently, the victim too petitioned the commission.

According to the petition by M Prakash (then 21), on April 2, 2018, police had intercepted his two-wheeler while he was riding back home from T Nagar after shopping. His mother and sister were riding pillion.

Prakash stated that police used filthy language about his family and when he took out vehicle documents, they demanded Rs 500. The complainant claimed that he told police that he would pay the Rs 500 if a receipt was provided and the latter denied.

Subsequently, one official tried to slap Prakash and when his mother intervened, she was pushed down by a lady constable. After this, the policemen ganged up and assaulted him, the video of which went viral on social media, according to the petition.

In response, the police personnel concerned sub-inspectors Suresh, Jayaram, Indumathi and Suyambulingam and inspector Prabhu attached to the Mambalam police station submitted that the complaint is false and concocted to conceal the complainant’s disobedience of traffic rules.

The policemen submitted that the response from them was in response to the complainant’s behaviour and even the CCTV camera footage proved the same and sought to dismiss the petition.

After perusing the submissions of both sides, SHRC acting chairman D Jayachandran held that police personnel had taken law into their hands and there was human rights violation too. He directed the government to pay a compensation of Rs 50,000 to the complainant’s family. The commission also held that the allegations against sub-inspector Indumathi and inspector Prabhu were not proved and dismissed the complaints against them.

The commission said the DGP should take steps to provide proper training to traffic police personnel so that during vehicle checks, they act in accordance with law and not behave rudely.

CHENNAI: Disapproving a government order declaring cooperative society employees as ‘public servants,’ the Madras high court has ruled they could not be brought within the bracket, as societies do not get financial aid from the state or the central governments and they could not be termed as public servants for prosecution under Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act.

The first bench of Chief Justice AP Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad made the clarification while quashing a circular issued by the registrar of societies making the PC Act applicable to the employees of co-operative societies on the ground that they are public servants within the definition of the act.

The issue pertains to an appeal by secretary of the Krishnagiri District National Engineering Employees Co-operative Thrift and Credit Society challenging the sanction by the registrar of societies to prosecute him under the PC Act. The petitioner claimed the sanction has been accorded in view of a circular dated August 11, 2018 by the registrar that PC Act is applicable to employees of the co-operative societies.

Allowing the appeal, the bench said: “The society in which the appellant is working is only for the employees working in private companies in Krishnagiri and is not open to public. The fact that the society takes loan from the central cooperative bank and repays it back does not mean that the state government grants any aid to the society. There is no material to even remotely suggest that the society in question receives any aid financial from the state or central government. The society therefore is neither controlled or aided so as to make its employees amenable to the provisions of the PC Act.”

THRISSUR: Veteran Left thinker and planning board former vice-chairman Prabhat Patnaik has termed the BJP regime at the Centre as a “fascist dictatorship privileging the upper caste sections”.

Simultaneously, Patnaik also criticised the LDF government’s decision to invoke provisions of the UAPA against two Kozhikode students who were arrested recently for alleged Maoist links.

Patnaik was here to inaugurate the state conference of the Association of Kerala Government College Teachers .

“UAPA should not be used at all, it is a draconian law. The Communist parties were opposing it in Parliament and outside. There are numerous other laws to deal with the current situation. UAPA should not be in the statute book at all. I stick to that position. The Congress had brought this, and I hope they sincerely regret it now,” he said.

He alleged that the present regime at the Centre was systematically trying to decimate reason and was promoting unreason. Our Constitution is a project of reason and that is why the present regime is against the Constitution, he said.

242,['7/03/2020'],Bhubaneswar: Cautious government keeping a watch on bank crisis,"File Photo

BHUBANESWAR: Officials of state finance department on Friday said they are keeping a close watch on the situation in the wake of the Yes Bank crisis. Finance department sources said several advisories have been issued to government departments not to deposit public money in any PSU, private sector or rural banks .

“We have been keeping an eye on the situation in the wake of Yes Bank crisis and its impact as far as public money is concerned. No government department should deposit public money in PSU, private or rural banks as withdrawal of government funds from the state treasury and parking the same in banks for a long period without adequate justification causes loss to the exchequer,” said a senior finance department official .

The official said if any department is found to be parking public money in banks after withdrawing it from the treasury, the concerned official will be held responsible and action taken accordingly.

The finance department is also likely to issue a fresh advisory to all departments in the wake of the Yes Bank crisis. “Consultations in this regard are on with the government. If needed, we will issue a fresh advisory,” the official added.

Asked about empanelling banks by the state government to handle transactions, the finance department official said it is done to handle transactions of public sector undertakings and autonomous bodies like universities and institutions. “We have a robust Integrated Financial Management System to handle transactions of departments,” said the official. For 2019-20, the state government has empanelled 17 public sector banks, eight private sector banks, including Yes Bank, one small finance bank and three regional rural banks or cooperative banks.

243,['7/03/2020'],Pune docs perform state's first small bowel transplant,"Pune: The state's first small bowel transplant took place at a Pune-based hospital on Friday. A brain-dead Mumbai woman's six-feet-long small intestine was successfully transplanted into a 27-year-old engineering student suffering from short gut syndrome at Jupiter hospital here.

The first small bowel transplant was performed at a hospital in the US in 1967. The feat was successfully performed in India at Medanta hospital in Delhi in 2013.

The transplant helps the patient to regain ability to digest food and come off parenteral nutrition. The small intestine, despite its name, is the longest part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

""We have successfully crossed the first step of transplanting the small bowel. Looking at the colour and movement of the transplanted bowel inside the man's body post-surgery, the transplant is a success. This is the 9th small bowel transplant in the country,"" the hospital's chief multi-organ transplant surgeon, Gaurav Chaubal, told TOI.

It takes three to four weeks for the full recovery post-transplant. ""There are two key things in recovery - avoiding rejection and weaning the patient from parenteral nutrition to enteral nutrition,"" he said.

""Right now, he is on parenteral nutrition. We will gradually bring down parenteral nutrition by giving him pre-digested food after a week from now. Then slowly we will start increasing the amount of pre-digested food and start shifting him to normal diet. This transition takes two to three weeks,"" Chaubal said.

Three months ago, the man, a Thane resident, had complained of acute abdominal pain and was diagnosed with intestinal gangrene. ""Doctors had to cut off his entire small bowel to save his life. Since then he had been surviving on nutritional given to him through a tube intravenously,"" Chaubal said.

Investigations revealed that the man had been suffering from a developmental anomaly called intestinal malrotation or midgut volvulus. It is a congenital anomaly that results when the normal sequence of rotation and fixation of the bowel fails. Its complications are usually seen in adulthood. If the condition is not diagnosed early, then the person ends up losing the entire small bowel.

""Ever since the resection of small bowel, he was on parenteral nutrition. As he could not eat, he lost 30kg of body weight in three months and was malnourished. His liver functions were also beginning to get derailed which is a known complication of prolonged administration of parenteral nutrition. He urgently needed a bowel transplant,"" Chaubal said.

Relatives of a 46-year old woman, a resident of Mumbai, who was declared brain-dead at Fortis hospital in Mulund consented to donate her vital organ late on Thursday evening. The man registered with the Jupiter hospital for transplant last month.

The other members of the doctors' team who carried out the transplant are surgeons Suryabhan Bhalerao, Aditya Nanawati, Apoorva Deshpande, Hunaid Hatimi, Abhijit Naik, gastroenterologist Pavan Hanchanale, nephrologist Shailesh Kakde, anaesthesiologist Amit Bhargava and Bhagyashree Arbhi.

""In the past, six small bowel transplants took place at hospitals in Chennai, while two transplants were carried out in Delhi. This is the ninth small bowel transplant in India and the first in Maharashtra,"" said transplant coordinator Aarti Gokhale of Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC), which oversees allocation of donated organs.

The Challenges

The main task was to find the right donor

Bowel donors have to be selected carefully

Usually, they need to be young individuals who are stable after brain death

The donor and recipient should be blood group and HLA compatible

The donor should be young and haemodynamically (blood circulation-wise) stable

Long term survival post-transplant is 75% to 80 %

Challenges in Post-transplant care

Usual challenges in the postoperative period is to manage the immuno-suppression effectively

Second challenge is to wean the patient from parenteral nutrition to enteral nutrition

Who needs small intestine transplant?

Patients who develop short gut syndrome due to various conditions such as necrotising colitis (in which portion of the bowel dies), midgut volvulus (twisted gut) and mesenteric ischemia (sudden loss of blood flow in the gut) and are dependent on an intravenous administration of nutrition, medically termed parenteral nutrition, are candidates for small bowel transplant

With the Reserve Bank of India capping monthly withdrawal to Rs 50,000, customers are in a fix how to manage their expenses.

As news spread of SBI’s proposed takeover of YES Bank, many rushed to the bank ATM to withdraw money. But they were met with either technical glitches or signs of no money. Those who tried online transactions were met with decline messages and logging into the system proved difficult. To make matters worse, card holders were unable to use it in other bank ATMs or POS machines.

As panic took over, customers rushed to the branches and were seen making a beeline at cash counters with the hope of withdrawing some of their hard-earned money.

“It was like a second demonetisation had hit us,” said Biraj Hota, an aggrieved customer, who was standing in a queue at a YES Bank branch in the city.

“I am here since morning with a cheque, but have not seen any person at the cash counters yet. The bank staff is saying there is no money and that they have gone to get the cash to disburse it among customers,” he added.

Sudhanshu Mishra, a customer at Bapuji Nagar branch said he had tried to transfer money to another account using the online banking system, but failed. “Despite having money in my account, I am unable to use my ATM card in any of the teller machines or POSs,” Mishra rued.

Mrunali Priyadarshini sounded desperate. “I have all my hard earned money in the bank and now they are saying they can’t give my own money back,” she said.

In Rourkela, the KJS Ahluwalia (KJSA) Group of Industries, Odisha’s largest mining company, faced a tough time arranging funds. Sources said, KJSA has all its business accounts in YES Bank branches in Rourkela and Bhubaneswar. The RBI decision has come as a bolt from the blue for the group. “We will suffer major challenges in depositing advance tax, since this has come ahead of the financial year end,” said Prasanta Aluwalia, managing director of KJSA Group of Industries.

“Like us, many other business houses, who have their accounts in YES Bank, will face crisis in depositing advance tax and in the process government will also suffer in tax collection,” he added.

DEHRADUN: After witnessing dry weather for the past few days, a fresh spell of rain lashed the plains and foothills while the higher reaches of Uttarakhand received light to moderate snowfall on Friday. High altitude places such as Auli, Chakrata, Gairsain and Mukteshwar received fresh spell of snowfall causing a dip in maximum temperatures, and a considerable drop was also witnessed in plains and foothills.

Regional meteorological centre also predicted heavy rainfall at isolated places especially in Dehradun, Tehri, Pauri, Almora, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar districts on Friday. Warning of heavy snowfall at isolated places above 3000m was also issued.

Bikram Singh, director of regional meteorological centre, said, “As predicted, rainfall lashed Dehradun and several other places in Uttarakhand throughout Friday. On the other hand, higher reaches also received snowfall. Similar weather is likely to continue till Saturday afternoon.” According to the Met office, Lohaghat and Champawat received 30mm rainfall each, while Pithoragarh and Haldwani each were lashed by 20mm rain. Mussoorie received 20mm rainfall.

Meanwhile, the Friday rains in Dehradun, exposed the condition of the newly constituted wards in the city where residents said that basic amenities such as cleanliness and road conditions are dismal. Residents of Vanasthali Puram Housing Society added that the situation gets worse when it rains.

RWA president Brijendra Singh Negi said, “Our problem is not limited to one particular department, instead the overall development of the society is in a mess. From cleanliness, potholes, leaking water supply pipes to foul smell from the open drain close to the houses add to our problems.” Residents added that the drain water is stagnant and pigs can be seen all around the place. Ganesh Gaur, a resident, said, “Sometimes, the smell from the drain flows with wind and engulfs the entire society making it unbearable. There is cow dung everywhere and this can lead to diseases.”

Mahesh Bhandari, president of Doon residents’ welfare front, said, “The newly constituted wards should be a priority for all departments. The drains in every area should be cleaned from time to time to avoid waterlogging and accidents. The government must also make a provision to increase the councilors’ fund, so that more development work can be carried out without any hassle.”

Talking to TOI, Chaktunwala ward councilor Pooja Negi said, “Development work in the ward is underway. If the residents raise any specific complaint, the matter will be resolved on priority basis.”

Accepting rejection with respect, learning to control emotions, understanding that it is not “okay” to share jokes or even “like” messages and links that debase or insult women on the social media are some of the topics to be touched upon during the week-long programmes.

The GR particularly emphasizes on discussions among all students from standards IX to XII to sensitize them about accepting rejection by a woman. Students from standards IV to VII have to be taught about good touch-bad touch and mental, physical or sexual harassment. The GR states that students of standards VIII to X must participate in discussions on respecting women.

The GR also favoured discussions between parents and the school management to shatter stereotypes. The schools have also been instructed to spread awareness about the abuse of the social media as a tool to insult women.

Manisha Gupte, founder and co-convener at the Mahila Sarvangeen Utkarsh Mandal, said, “It’s a welcome move, as it goes beyond what generally is done during Women’s Day celebrations.”

There have been many cases of violence against women in recent past after they refused advances by men. A stalker burned alive a 24-year-old woman when she rejected his advances in Hinganghat last month.

Recurring seizures are a risk factor for epilepsy. Medical experts from across the world are in Kochi to discuss epilepsy infants at a conference on epilepsy in neonates and infants which began on Friday.

The conference will cover a wide range of seizures and epilepsy attacks a child may suffer in the first year of its life. Dr Sanjeev Thomas, president of the Indian Epilepsy Society and head of the neurology department at Sree Chitra Institute of Medical Science, inaugurated the conference. A three-day course and workshop led by International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) titled ‘EEG in the first year of ife–from newborn to toddler” is the chief highlight of the event. This is the first-ever electroencephalopram (EEG) workshop for infants held outside Cambridge.

Dr Vinayan K P, course director and head of paediatric neurology and epilepsy at Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, said that the meet would discuss scientific advancements in EEG to track seizures in newborns. EEG records electrical wave patterns in the brain and its abnormalities for diagnosing different categories of neonatal seizures, he said. Dr Vinayan also serves as core member of the ILAE commission of diagnostic methods, neonatal seizure classification project and editor of Epilepsy India.

Dr Ronit Pressler, neurophysiology expert and international secretary of British Society of Clinical Neurophysiology, said that they are the most common neurological emergency in the neonatal period and are associated with mortality and long-term neurological disability.

“Most neonatal seizures being acute symptomatic, require immediate diagnosis and management. However clinical diagnosis is challenging because most have very little clinical manifestation,’ she said

To complicate diagnosis, both normal and sick babies often exhibit similar movements which may be mistaken as seizures. This renders clinical diagnosis unreliable in most cases. Further, seizures are always focal and are usually lasting less than a minute in preterm infant’s cases. Electrophysiological diagnosis is always the best option. Video EEG the gold standard in the diagnosis of neonatal seizures, Dr Pressler said. Besides sixty International faculties and experts from US, Europe and Asian countries , the conference is being attended by neurologists, neurophysiologists and neonatologists from different states in India.

255,['7/03/2020'],‘Bird’ that made a monkey out of Trichy corporation,"TRICHY: An ‘erroneous’ translation of a street’s name from English to Tamil has made Trichy corporation a laughing stock before the public as well as netizens. Though the corporation’s misadventure happened years ago, online trolls got a fresh lease of life recently. With the humiliation getting too much to handle, the civic body has agreed to change the street signboard now.

Cantonment vicinity in the city was once a core locality of the erstwhile Trichinopoly district in British India with roads and streets named after British bureaucrats. Thus, Williams Road, McDonalds Road and Warners Road were named after British officers who were then the administrators of the district. About seven years ago, the corporation relaid the roads in Cantonment and erected street signboards with reflective blue stickers naming the streets in English and Tamil.

Things were fine as far as the roads and streets bearing the names of Englishmen were written in Tamil as they sounded in English. But things took a different turn when it came to Birds Road, which was translated into Tamil as ‘Paravaigal’ Salai. History enthusiasts said that the street, connecting Bharathidasan road with Bharathiyar road, had been named after John Bird, a judge in Trichinopoly court in the early 1800s. A reference to John Bird as judge has also been made in the book “Engines of Truth” by Wendie Ellen Schneider. Multiple references to John Bird were found in online journals describing the man as an officer in the erstwhile Trichinopoly district.

Though the erroneous street signboard was erected before 2013, it was recently that pictures of the translation and their memes surfaced in social media platforms. “Apart from Birds road, people often wrongly translate East and West Boulevard roads in Tamil. The city being centuries old, the civic body or history enthusiasts should come forward to document the origin of the street names,” V B Jaganath, member of Trichy Intra-City Development Endeavours (TIDES) said. The corporation which found itself at the receiving end of the embarrassing translation said it will put up a new street signboard of Birds road in English and Tamil.

256,['7/03/2020'],Puri temple’s Rs 545 crore in YES Bank safe: Odisha,"Bhubaneswar: The Odisha government on Friday said the Rs 545 crore the Puri Jagannath Temple administration has in its two accounts with YES Bank ‘is safe’ and that the money would soon be moved to nationalised banks.

“The deposits of Jagannath Temple in YES Bank are safe. Two fixed deposits, totalling Rs 545 crore, will mature on March 16 and March 29, and will subsequently be deposited in nationalized banks through a tendering process,” state law minister Pratap Jena said while talking to the media on the sidelines of an event to release a comic book based on the life of former chief minister Biju Patnaik. This comes amid questions raised by opposition leaders and temple’s servitors about the safety of the funds.

Jena made it clear that the current restrictions on withdrawals of funds not more than Rs 50,000 a month from YES Bank would not come in the way of transferring the temple funds to a government bank.

Temple officials said till September 30 last, Rs 592 crore was deposited in YES Bank. “Recently, Rs 47 crore was withdrawn from YES Bank. The state finance department’s letters sent on October 10, 2018 and July 20, 2019 said YES Bank is one of the registered and empanelled banks to carry out transactions,” one of them added.

Senior BJD leader Maheswar Mohanty, who earlier represented Puri in the assembly, questioned the temple administration’s decision to deposit such a huge amount of money in a private bank. “I don’t think it was a wise decision to deposit temple funds in a private bank. Temple officials should discuss the matter with the RBI and ensure immediate shifting of the funds to nationalized banks,” he said.

Servitors, too, were unsparing in their criticism of the temple administration. “We had raised objections in the past when the temple administration decided to deposit huge sums of money in YES Bank just because it was offering better interest rates,” Binayak Dasmohapatra, a temple servitor, said. “It was only after the vigilance squad arrested an IAS officer and a YES Bank employee in a corruption case in Bhubaneswar that the administration woke up. Following this, the administration said it would transfer the money to nationalized banks. The IAS officer had shown undue favours to the private bank and deposited crores of rupees there,” he added.

Opposition BJP and Congress leaders questioned the manner in which the temple funds were deposited in YES Bank instead of nationalised banks. “We demand a thorough probe into how the temple funds were kept in a private bank,” BJP state president Samir Mohanty said. “I strongly suspect that some corrupt temple officials had deposited the money for personal gains,” Congress MLA Suresh Rautray added.

PUNE: The Yerawada police on Thursday booked a telecaller for allegedly demanding sexual favours from a 39-year-old woman who was unable to repay her bank loan. The incident occurred between December 28, 2019 and January 1.

Police said the woman had received numerous calls from the suspect who posed as a bank officer and sought reasons for the delay in repayment of the housing loan.

The suspect allegedly abused and misbehaved with the woman and demanded sexual favours from her, police said.

The woman, who was fed up with the regular harassment, later took a call to register an FIR at the Yerawada police station.

An offence of sexual harassment, stalking and criminal intimidation was registered under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.

An officer from the Yerawada police said, “We are conducting technical investigation to trace the tele caller.”

258,['7/03/2020'],Over 40 U-turns to set Delhi’s traffic in order,"NEW DELHI: To de-clog the busy roads in the city, the public works department will be opening U-turns at 43 major stretches. These include ITO, Delhi Gate, Rohini metro station, ISBT, Kanhaiya Nagar metro station and Begumpur metro station.Officials said that U-turns will be made only on the stretches that are wide enough to cater to the traffic capacity. A few U-turns that are problematic and cause traffic disruptions will be closed, they added.Most of these busy stretches see at least over 50,000 vehicles per day, which cause major snarls. The project will be undertaken jointly by Delhi traffic police, PWD, UTTIPEC and CRRI. They are presently conducting a survey to ascertain the exact number of U-turns that need to be made.A senior official said: “We have identified 43 most problematic stretches that need some sort of changes. Several plans of underpasses, flyovers and alternative routes have failed to materialise in the past. U-turns will help the commuters avoid travelling several kilometres just to get to the other side of the road.”One of the most problematic stretches in the city is the ITO traffic signal which at least 1 lakh vehicles cross every day. With every passing year, the condition has only worsened here. Some of the other stretches where U-turns will be made are Chirag Dilli chowk, Peeragarhi chowk, Sansad Vihar chowk and Palla Mor chowk on the outer ring road.“We have also asked the PWD to install boards indicating the U-turns. This will help the commuters identify them easily,” said a traffic police officer.Officials said that there are many points where U-turns have been unscientifically made. Those roads are too narrow to manage the traffic that accumulates due to the vehicles waiting to take a U-turn. The ripple effect triggers long traffic jams.“Some of these U-turns will be closed,” said an official.The official added that once they begin the work, they will take around six months to finish it. Before this year-end, the project is likely to be completed. The total budget is yet to be ascertained.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74520889,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-334502,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-40-u-turns-to-set-delhis-traffic-in-order/articleshow/74520014.cms

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Turning hostile to favour the accused in Barton Hill Anilkumar murder case proved costly for the prime witness in the case. The prosecution team has filed a petition before the additional sessions court-IV judge , seeking to initiate proceedings for perjury against Reghu , the prime witness. The court has admitted the petition in file.

The trial in the case began on Thursday and Ratheesh was the first person to be examined. The court declared him hostile after he retracted the statement he had given before the local magistrate earlier under Section 164 (5) of CrPC.

During trial, he told the court that he was forced by the police to give false deposition against the accused. This was in contradiction to his previous statement that he had witnessed the alleged murder.

Public prosecutor AA Hakkim stated in the petition that Ratheesh had told the court on Thursday that he had given a false statement before the local magistrate. He also admitted that at the time of making the statement he was lying after taking an oath before the magistrate.

The magistrate, prior to recording his statement, had asked him whether he was giving the statement voluntarily to which he had answered in the affirmative. As per his deposition before this court at the trial, he retracted his statement given before the magistrate and asserted that he had given a false testimony before the magistrate.

It is pertinent to note that if his above assertion is taken to be true, then he had intentionally and voluntarily given false evidence in a case where the accused if convicted by his testimony could be punished with death.

Anilkumar, a goon-turned-auto driver was murdered on March 24 last year by Vishnu alias Jeevan, Manoj, Maryrajan and Rakesh. The witnesses in the case had already alleged that they were being intimidated by the accused.

260,['7/03/2020'],"Economy in coma, no one in BJP knows how to revive it: Sanjay Jha","Bhopal: Congress’s national spokesperson, Sanjay Jha, said on Friday that data showing constant decline in Indian economy during Narendra Modi’s regime not only shows the inability of the Union government to revive the economy, but has shaken faith of the international community in great economic success story of India. This is the result of “politics of religion” being played out by the ruling BJP.

Stating that peace and social harmony was a prerequisite for economic growth, he said how could anyone expect the Indian economy to grow amidst a fractured society, riots, lynching, attacks on Dalits, public intellectuals and young students.

Addressing a press conference at Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) headquarters, here, Jha said currently India is in the phase of all-time lows- GDP (11-year-low), investment (17-year-low), manufacturing (15-year-low), private demand (7-year-low) and agriculture (4-year-low). The only staggering number is the highest unemployment rate in 45 years.

He said the data, despite being fudged by the Modi government, present a horrible picture of Indian economy and he has no qualms in saying that it is not in ICU but in coma and there is no expert in the BJP who could revive it. Union finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, might say that she can see the green shoots of economic revival but no one else can see it, he said.

Referring to Delhi violence, he said people from outside were involved in the incidents of killings and arson and if it is happening, it also has an economic reason. “What would a young educated man do if he doesn’t have a job and income?” he asked, adding, that in such a situation he is rendered vulnerable to forces who want to use them for such acts.

When two crore people including highly-qualified professionals and scholars apply for 1,100 jobs of clerks in Indian railways, one can understand the gravity of situation on unemployment front, he said.

261,['7/03/2020'],"BMC to snap power, water supply of tax defaulters","Bhubaneswar: With the current financial year drawing to a close, the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to crack the whip on defaulters of holding tax , which is a major component of tax revenue for the civic body.

Officials said the BMC will disconnect electricity and water supply to make the big defaulters pay up. The zonal deputy commissioners of the three zones will coordinate with the respective departments to snap the power and water supply, they added.

“We will disconnect power and water supply to the houses, buildings and commercial establishments if they fail to pay holding tax. In case they still don’t pay up, a case under the Odisha Public Demand Recovery (OPDR) Act, 1962 will be instituted to confiscate their properties and sell them to get the proportionate dues,” a BMC official said.

Once the OPDR Act is invoked, the BMC would have the power to seize the property of the defaulters. An officer is designated as “certificate officer”, who is empowered to order confiscation of the property.

The state government has set a target of Rs 60 crore holding tax for BMC to collect by the end of the current financial year. So far, the BMC has generated about Rs 20 crore of holding tax. It is collected after assessing the tax of the holdings (both commercial and residential buildings). There are different slabs of taxation for commercial and residential buildings.

The BMC had recently listed various central and state government offices, industrial houses, big private commercial establishments and top educational institutions as big defaulters of holding tax. Altogether, they owe Rs 57 crore to the BMC.

The BMC officials there would be about 300-odd big defaulters.

KOTTAYAM: A thief struck at the famous Thirunakkara temple here in the wee hours of Friday and decamped with money from four donation boxes after locking up the security guard in the strong room of the temple, police said.

The masked man broke open four donation boxes in the temple and attempted to break open a fifth one. According to initial assessments, around Rs 5,000 was lost from the four boxes.

The guard was locked in a room where many valuables, including gold jewellery, had been stored. Temple administrative officer T Radhakrishna Pillai said that a report has been submitted against the four security personnel on duty at the temple on Friday.

The robbery by a suspected migrant labourer took place around 1:30am. The robber entered through the north gate of the temple and reached the strong room first. The security staff who was sleeping inside the room was locked from outside.

He then opened the donation boxes using a weapon. Though he tried to break open the box near the flag mast, he failed in opening the lock of the inner box and abandoned the move. The thief had covered his face with a monkey cap and wore only a bermuda . He loitered around the temple for over 30 minutes before escaping through the same gate.

It was the priest who came to open the temple early in the morning who noticed the robbery. He soon informed the police. District police chief G Jayadev and West station house officer M J Arun arrived at the spot. The dog squad and fingerprint experts were pressed into service. The visuals of the robber walking through the temple premises have been captured by the CCTVs in the area.

Police have got the visuals of the robber walking with a bag around 3am. An FIR has been registered in this connection and a search is on for the culprit, police said.

264,['7/03/2020'],JNU pensioners left in the lurch,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Former Jawaharlal Nehru University teachers and staff members are in a lurch as they have not received pension for February. The JNU administration has written to the university’s bank to withhold the transmission of funds to the pensioners as UGC is yet to release funds.

In a letter to the State Bank of India’s JNU Campus branch, JNU deputy finance officer Anup Kuksai said due to “non-receipt of allocation of funds for payment of pension from UGC, it will not be possible for the university to pay the pension for the month of February.”

The JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) has expressed outrage at the decision. In its statement, JNUTA said pension was the source of sustenance for its recipients and “such sudden stoppage of its flow can have potentially serious consequences for them. What makes this even more alarming is that the university apparently has a large deficit in its salary and recurring heads and has not managed to secure approval for the Revised Estimates of 2019-20”.

Blaming JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar, with whom JNUTA has had several months of disagreement and tussle, the teachers’ association said “such a situation reflects the sorry state of the management of the university’s finances and the misplaced priorities of the JNU VC”.

They stated the VC had been responsible for the “prolonged disruption of academic normalcy and unprecedented violence being unleashed on teachers and students. He has been preoccupied with victimising teachers and lashing out at JNUTA and has failed in his basic duty of ensuring timely flow of funds for even entirely non-discretionary heads of expenditure from UGC, a commission of which he too has been a member.”

JNUTA informed that even the payment of arrears that became due on account of revision of allowances with effect from July 2017 is pending for more than a year. “JNUTA demands immediate release of pension and immediate steps on a war footing to ensure that the UGC and the university meet all their commitments and there is no disruption in salary and pension payments.”

Despite attempts made to reach them by phone call or text messages, the JNU VC and registrar were not available for a comment.

The UGC official did not respond to repeated calls and messages on the matter.

Petitioners D Premalatha, J R Rajendran and T Sam Rajasekar stated that they were working as teachers in government aided schools in Dindigul district. They were also appointed as office-bearers of a CSI church at Palani. Based on the complaint given by a person named Devasagayam, Palani block education officer sent a communication to the schools inquiring if these teachers have been serving as officer-bearers of a church. It said disciplinary action would be taken if it was found to be true. The teachers stated that subsequently the Dindigul chief educational officer sent a communication seeking an explanation in this regard. They were also asked to resign from church duties failing which disciplinary action would be initiated against them.

The petitioners stated that every citizen has a Right to Association, guaranteed under Article 19(1)(c) of the Constitution, to be a part of any association or religious body including CSI Church which is a legal body. The petitioners further stated that according to the provisions of Tamil Nadu Recognised Private Schools Regulation Act 1973, every teacher employed was governed by a code of conduct prescribed by the state and shall be liable for disciplinary action in case of any violation.

According to the code, a teacher is only prohibited from engaging in political activity, movement or campaign for any political election. There is no bar on private school teachers being part of any religious body or holding posts in a church without affecting the duties as a teacher. Hence the petitioners moved the high court Madurai bench seeking to quash the communications issued by the authorities and also to grant interim stay on these communications till the disposal of the petitions. While granting interim stay on the communication sent by the authorities, Justice J Nisha Banu also ordered notice to the authorities and adjourned the case to a further date for hearing.

The course’s main objective is to develop HR managers capable of excelling in any sector, the institute said.

Director Bhimaraya Metri said though the IIMs in Ranchi and Indore offer the program, curriculum and course structure of the one offered in Trichy will be unique.

Unlike other MBA programs where the course’s first year remains common and focus on specialization is brought in in the second year, this program will focus on aspects of human resource management right from the first year, he said.

Saying the new program is positioned in a different way, Metri said, every student in the program will have a mentor from the industry. They will be having real life experience as they will be mentored by senior people working in top positions in the industry.

The institute has close contact with national HRD network to rope in experienced industry people for mentoring, he said. While the HR program will start with a capacity of 30 unlike the usual 60, the entire course work will be on HR, but we are keeping avenues open for students from regular PGPM to take HR course as elective and vice versa, he said.

Metri said that the institute has plans to start e-MBA general and business analytics in coming months. The new online programs will start keeping in view the need for new generation courses.

While the institute has scheduled its convocation for next month, Metri said that among the outgoing students, 51% are women. He also noted that among the 230 students joined last year, 93 are women which is highest in any IIMs in the country.

Justice Cooper urged all to reaffirm these principles in the Constitution and move forward carrying bright the torches of democracy . He was talking after inaugurating a conference on the Rule of Law and Access to Justice, jointly organised by National University of Advanced Legal Studies, Kalamassery and OP Jindal Global University . High Court Justice A.K Jayasankaran Nambiar chaired the function.

In his keynote address, Prof Stephen P Marks, Francois-Xavier of Harvard University , USA highlighted the four intersecting elements that make the rule of law possible. The existence of a Constitution, the separation of powers not just on paper, but working in practice, the functioning of the police and law enforcement which is non-political and not subject to corruption, and finally the role of a professional civil service. These are enormous challenges that we face today, he said.

268,['7/03/2020'],Two Malayalam TV channels banned over Delhi riots coverage,"Picture for representational purpose only.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Union ministry of information and broadcasting on Friday suspended the transmission by two Malayalam television news channels for 48 hours from 7.30pm over their coverage of the violence in northeast Delhi.

The reports of Asianet News and MediaOne, the I&B ministry felt, could “enhance the communal disharmony across the country when the situation is highly volatile.”

The suspension was over the alleged violation of the provisions of the Cable Television Networks Rules, 1995, the ministry said in its order. The temporary ban on transmission or re-transmission of the TV channels on any platform throughout the country would end at 7.30pm on Sunday.

“It appeared that telecast of reports on North-East Delhi violence had been shown in a manner which highlighted the attack on places of worship and siding towards a particular community,” the order, which cited the violations, said.

Both the channels had earlier replied to the show-cause notices issued to them.

“Channel’s reporting on Delhi violence seems to be biased as it is deliberately focusing on the vandalism of CAA supporters. It also questions RSS and alleges Delhi Police inaction. Channel seems to be critical towards Delhi Police and RSS,” the order banning MediaOne said.

MediaOne management said it would legally fight the 48-hour ban. In a press release issued in Kozhikode late on Friday night, MediaOne editor-in-chief C L Thomas said the ban was an undemocratic move unheard of even during Emergency. “The action by the Centre for factually reporting the genocide attempt in Delhi is regrettable and highly condemnable. This is nothing but an aggression on the freedom of speech,"" the statement said.

Condemning the suspension, CPM general secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala of the Congress alleged that it amounted to the breach of media freedom. Kodiyeri said the BJP wanted to silence those critical of the central government. Expressing concerns over the future of India democracy, Chennithala said it was strange that the government order said that the two channels had reported against the RSS.

BJP state president K Surendran said it was serious to note that two Malayalam television channels, led by seasoned media persons, received a 48-hour blackout order.

A senior police officer said the deceased, R Rajamanickam, 48, had been teaching Physics at Ramakrishna Mission Matriculation Higher Secondary School for the past 20 years and lived with his family at Kamban Nagar in Villupuram. On Thursday, he hung himself at his house. Family members told police that he was stressed over excessive workload at school and a domestic dispute that ensued due to his hectic work schedule.

Teachers protesting on Friday demanded that two newly appointed executive members take responsibility for his death and added that it was since their appointment that faculty suffered burnouts. Students said the management refused to grant them a day’s leave or permission to pay homage to the senior teacher.

R Badsha, principal, told TOI, “The school is in no way responsible for the suicide. Even a suicide note confiscated by police from his house clearly stated he took the extreme step following some family dispute.” A case has been registered the Villupuram Taluk police. Further investigation is on.

The Salem police said the ornaments, belonging to a jewellery outlet, was brought by its employees from Hyderabad to Tirupur in an omni bus, when it was stolen on February 9 near Sankagiri in Salem.

According to Gautham, the employee of PMJ Gems and Jewels, seven diamond studded necklaces weighing 592g, 14 sets of earrings studded with colour stones and a ring weighing 11g with diamond stones were stolen. Gautham along with two other employees Sunil Kanth and Pradeep were travelling from Hyderabad to Tirupur. When the bus stopped for a break near Sankagiri around 9.30am on February 9, Gautham stepped out for a while. He returned to find the bag containing the jewellery open and the valuables missing.

Three special teams were formed to nab the thieves. The teams collected CCTV footage from the bus and commercial establishments where the bus was parked to identify the culprits.

“A team that visited Mumbai on February 19 traced the culprits to Madhya Pradesh,” a police officer said. Police identified the culprits as H Mustafa, A Akthar, B Muneer, N Ahmed Khan and N Ajay Rathore, all hailing from Manavar in Dhar of Madhya Pradesh.

Instead of rounding them up at Madhya Pradesh, police decided to draw them out and struck a deal posing as buyers through an informer. The gang fell for their act and came to Dharmapuri with the jewellery on March 2.

At Kalipavadi, police personnel in disguise met the gang and sought the jewellery to ascertain authenticity. “We matched the jewellery with the description given by the firm and we confirmed they were the stolen jewels,’’ the officer said.

But when police attempted to apprehend the gang, they managed to wriggle out and fled the place in a car.

274,['7/03/2020'],"Vadodara: VMC outsmarts Yes Bank crisis, withdraws Rs 265 crore","People queue up outside a branch of the Yes Bank

VADODARA: Vadodara Smart City Development Ltd (VSCDL), the special purpose vehicle floated by Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) for the Smart City project, managed to stave off a major fund crisis just in the nick of time.

VSCDL had a whopping Rs 265crore deposited with the beleaguered Yes Bank. However, the money was transferred on Tuesday to a nationalized bank, just two days ahead of the restrictions imposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Ever since its formation in 2017, VSCDL had maintained an account with Yes Bank as it was giving a healthy interest on the deposits as compared to other banks. But a controversy was raked up in November last year when spiritual leader and activist Jyotirnathji red flagged the deposits with Yes Bank.

The activist had argued that the bank was already under a cloud and it was risky to park funds there. He also pointed out that a government resolution (GR) had also stated that bank guarantees of only nationalized banks and 15 private banks should be accepted. The list did not name Yes Bank and Jyotirnathji argued that this in itself reflected the poor confidence of government in the private sector lender and the VSCDL was still keeping funds with it.

In November itself, the VSCDL board decided to withdraw its deposits with Yes Bank and transfer them to the Bank of Baroda. For reasons best known to the civic body, the funds were not transferred for almost three months.

“Three cheques – two of Rs 100 crore each and one of Rs 65 crore – were issued by us and the funds have been deposited in the new accounts on Tuesday. The delay was due to some negotiations with the new bank,” said S K Patel, VSCDL chief executive officer and deputy municipal commissioner .

Patel said that BoB had agreed to spend Rs 25lakh on projects in the city. Notably, the civic body has had the longest banking ties with BoB. Former mayor Bharat Dangar is also a director with BoB that has a branch in the Khanderao Market that also houses the VMC headquarters.

The teachers’ group, demanding an inquiry, wrote to Amit Khare, MHRD secretary, and stated if all advertised posts, including reserved posts, were to be filled, the proportion of SCs and STs in the professor and associate professor cadres would be well below the statutory requirement of 15% and 7.5%, respectively.

Citing two advertisements of 2019, the teachers claimed that these indicated that posts had been advertised in earlier years as reserved for a particular category but had not been filled, and now either they had been converted into unreserved posts or their reservation categories had been changed.

“However, an examination of these advertisements shows the number of positions reserved for SCs and STs as 24 in the professor cadre and 33 in the associate professor cadre. Of these, five positions are in the new schools that did not exist in 2017. Thus, the number now reserved for SC and ST candidates is more than 30 short of even the backlog,” the teachers said.

The city has bigger threats with events such as the IPL, which will have a gathering of more than 30,000 people at the Chepauk Stadium, coming up this month.There are no positive cases of Covid-19 in the state. Yet, the growing epidemic remains a threat. The only solution to manage the situation is aggressive preparedness. Even out-patient wards of public urban health care centres are not following basic infection protocol – disinfecting surfaces, encouraging patient and attenders to use sanitizers or display information about the virus. Many public places do not display information about the virus.“I don’t know if we are prepared for the epidemic yet,” said former city health officer Dr P Kuganandam. “A global emergency like this is everyone’s responsibility. If the response is inadequate, we must get the sanitary inspector and health inspectors on the field to ensure protocols are followed. And if that force isn’t enough, police help must be sought,” he said. “We must make use of every opportunity to tell people about this virus,” he said.So far, the health department has been screening people at airports and the port. Passengers walk past thermal scanners and are screened by a health desk. Airports have added new equipment, including air sanitizers. The government is keeping a track of people who are on home quarantine. “We may not be able to stop the virus. But we know this epidemic can be pushed back. Washing hands and cleaning surfaces will help us stay healthy. Collectors have been instructed to ensure standard hygiene protocols are followed,” said health minster C Vijayabaskar.Vijayabaskar said the government has called all stakeholders to be prepared for the virus. Some people who have been advised to remain in quarantine were reported to have left their houses – either to meet friends or seek medical information. “We have told people not to leave their homes. If they need help it will be sent to them. We have a special ambulance to transport people with symptoms,” said director of public health Dr K Kolandasamy.Public health officials have the authority to cancel big events, IPL included, if there is a risk of epidemic. “We are not there yet and I hope we will not be pushed to do that,” the minister said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74521639,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-118310,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/fighting-covid-19-are-we-prepared/articleshow/74520500.cms

The court ordered that Bhosale and three others — director Suryaji Jadhav, CEO Tanaji Padwal and chief accountant Shailesh Bhosale — be sent to judicial custody till March 19. All four were sent to the Yerawada central jail.On the lawyer Shivam Nimbalkar’s plea, the court directed the medical officer at the Yerawada jail to medically examine Bhosale, a blood pressure and diabetes patient, and allow him access to medicine and home food that was required to maintain his health.The police had arrested Bhosale and the three others on February 25 for an alleged Rs71.78 crore fraud after an audit report revealed that the money shown in the bank’s cash ledger was not actually available at the facility. Also, several depositors had complained to the police about the bank’s failure in returning their deposits. The following day, the court remanded them in police custody for nine days, which ended on Friday.Inspector Murlidhar Karpe of the economic offences wing and his team produced the four accused before the court and prosecutor Vilas Patare moved a report seeking three more days of custodial interrogation for all of them.Senior lawyers SK Jain and Harshad Nimbalkar, both representing Bhosale, and lawyers Rushikesh Ganu and Bipin Patole representing the remaining three accused, argued that there was nothing new in the remand report and the police did not justify what all was done during the nine-day custodial interrogation to deserve a further extension. Also, the entire case was based on documents and bank records, which were with the police.They argued that the police in their previous remand report did not mention about the auditor’s objection to the cheque discounting and bogus loan proposals despite the fact that they were in possession of the audit documents. As chairman of the bank, Bhosale was not involved in day-to-day affairs and had nothing to do with the cheque discounting matter, they submitted and added that barring the odd point, there was no ground to justify extension of custodial interrogation.Later, Nimbalkar and Ganu told TOI that they would soon take a decision on moving the bail application in due course of time for all the arrested persons.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74522375,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-158455,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/3-officials-aided-rs-80cr-cheque-discounting-for-rs-3-25-cr-deal-cops-tell-court/articleshow/74520037.cms

AHMEDABAD: City commissioner of police Ashish Bhatia on Friday told the Gujarat high court that the imposition of Section 144 of the CrPC, prohibiting large gatherings was aimed at preventing obstructions and annoyance as well as injuries and maintenance of law and order.

In an affidavit filed in the HC, Bhatia justified the imposition of Section 144 of the CrPC and Section 37 of the Bombay Police Act, which prohibit gathering of more than four persons in public places. Bhatia, however, has remained silent on the continued imposition of the restrictions measures for more than three years, as challenged by a petition, which termed the measure a violation of freedom of expression and fundamental rights. The petition was filed after the detention of people protesting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in December 2019.

The HC insisted that the police commissioner file a reply to the petition because the notifications imposing Section 144 across the city are issued by the commissioner. Justice S H Vora had rejected an affidavit filed by an assistant commissioner of police.

The earlier reply by police on February 5 maintained that they resort to these provisions to maintain peace in society. However, Bhatia added more words and stated, “The main intention is for preventing obstructions, annoyance, injuries as well as maintenance of public order in public interest… notifications are passed in public interest and are not for causing any harassment to any citizen or to curtail or curb any of fundamental rights of any citizen.”

Bhatia asserted that the petitioners can challenge the Section 144 notifications before the competent authority, which is a magisterial court, and the HC cannot be moved for remedy.

Bhatia said that he passed the notifications “either as preventive measure or as remedial measure and/or both”.

MADURAI: The Tuticorin consumer grievances redressal forum has ordered a post office in Kovilpatti to pay Rs 20,000 compensation each to two women for collecting Rs 2.50 more as commission for a transaction.

In the petition, G Suryakala, a resident of Tirunelveli district, stated that on February 3, 2017, she purchased an Indian postal order from a sub-post office situated at Lakshmipuram at Kovilpatti in Tuticorin district. She stated that she paid Rs 55 for the postal order including Rs 5 as commission. When she looked at the postal order, it said the commission was only Rs 2.50 and asked the post office to repay the balance amount, however, it was not repaid.

Due to this, Suryakala filed a petition before the forum seeking Rs 95,000 compensation since there was deficiency of service on part of the post office.

The postmaster in his counter submitted that there was no deficiency of service as the commission has been revised to Rs 5.

The forum observed that though the old postal order was given to the petitioner, revised commission of Rs 5 was charged instead of Rs 2.50. Hence, it directed the postmaster to pay a compensation of Rs 15,000 to the petitioner, Rs 5,000 towards the expenses of the case and repay Rs 2.50 which was overcharged from the petitioner within a month.

The forum also directed the postmaster of the same post office to pay similar compensation to another woman A Muthulakshmi of Tirunelveli district who filed a petition citing the same deficiency of service by the post office.

285,['7/03/2020'],Pharmacies run out of sanitizers as demand surges,"Chennai: As fear of contracting Covid-19 does the rounds, local pharmacies are witnessing a sudden surge in demand for hand sanitizers. While the sanitizers are quickly going off shelves, many shops are using this as an opportunity to stock up the commodity.

“Last week we had a customer who bought eight sanitisers. That was the last lot that we had,” said R Ajay manager of Central Pharmacy in Valluvarkottam. He said he has been struggling to find suppliers who would get him a new stock of sanitisers.

Nine pharmacies TOI spoke to had similar complaints. Commonly used hand sanitisers — that are perfumed and come in small bottles — are not available.

“It’s been over two weeks since we began our search for hand sanitiser suppliers. We are getting at least three customers a day asking for sanitisers. But we are forced to turn them away because we don’t have any,” said T Suguna from Muthu Pharmacy on Thirumalai Pillai Road.

Hand sanitisers are also sold out online on online pharmacies. At supermarkets, people are resorting to panic buying.

“We got 50 bottles of hand sanitisers yesterday and only 12 are left now,” said T Selvi at a Nilgiris supermarket. “People are buying five and even 10 at a time,” she said.

S Lavanya, store manager of Apollo Pharmacy on Greams Road, said the store sold 50 hand sanitisers on Friday. “The sales have doubled in the 10 days,” she said.

With demand unusually high, a pharmacy near Natesan Park has stocked up hand sanitisers of different brands and quantities. The store’s manager told TOI that most people are asking for sanitizers with 60% alcohol. “The sale of masks is also up. One customer came asking for a 100 masks,” he said.

288,['7/03/2020'],Proposal submitted to renovate Ambedkar College boys’ hostel,"Coimbatore: A few months down the lane , the inmates of Dr Ambedkar College boys’ hostel on Dr Balasundaram road in the city may not have to bear the stench from toilets or fear a building collapse. The district administration has a sent a proposal to the state government to reconstruct the hostel building that is in a dilapidated condition.

The Tamil Nadu Adi Dravidar Housing and Development Corporation Limited (TAHDCO) has sent a proposal to the state government to reconstruct the old building of the hostel at a cost of Rs 34 crores. The proposal is expected to be sanctioned in the coming financial year, said a source from the district administration.

The hostel, which is fully occupied by students of the college, was constructed over 30 years ago. Multiple complaints pertaining to the dilapidated state of the building had been received from the students, said the source. About 220 students are residing in the old building.

Welcoming the move, M Dinesh Raja from the Students Federation of India (SFI) said the building was crumbling and students are living under constant fear. “The sooner the building is reconstructed, the better for the students,” he added.

Due to lack of sufficient water supply and proper cleaning, most of the washrooms in the hostel are unclean and students are forced to bathe and wash clothes in the open, said one of the occupants on the condition of anonymity.

Officials both from the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department and the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) had visited the hostel several times. Follows the visits, talks had been held to renovate the building, but nothing has been implemented. At least now, the government should seriously consider renovating the hostel,” he added.

290,['7/03/2020'],"No transparency in revamp of Central Vista, say critics","NEW DELHI: Dozens of architects, historians and representatives from citizens’ groups raised objections to the Central Vista revamp project on Friday alleging that the government was not following “transparency” by not discussing the project in public and carrying out the massive work “in haste”.

They alleged the project was planned meticulously and the Centre withdrawing nomination of Delhi as the UNESCO World Heritage City in 2015 seemed to be a part of this bigger plan. The original proposal covered two main areas – Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone (LBZ) and Shahjahanabad in the old city including Red Fort and Jama Masjid.

Participating in a discussion by Lokpath, a collective of collective group of urban architects, planners and environmentalists, the experts alleged that the execution of this mammoth project will take out a large chunk of area from public use, which is visited by thousands everyday.

Bengaluru-based architect Prem Chandavarkar said nearly 80 acres are being taken out from public use by implementing this project or there will be restricted access, though the government has maintained that there will more space for public use after the project is completed. Though he said the plan includes constructing nine-storey office buildings, urban affairs ministry officials said that no building will be more than seven-storey.

Raising question on the plan to bring all central government offices closer, he asked, “Where is the need to consolidate all offices when we are in the digital era?” Planners have been objecting to the concentration of government offices citing the Delhi Master Plan provision, which advocates the need to decentralise government offices to decongest the city.

Environmentalist Kanchi Kohli asked why the government did not address environmental concerns before announcing the big project. Architect Madhav Raman, who has been associated with Lokpath alleged that the project would end up as a “large-scale land grab by the government, which was meant for people”.

Historian Narayani Gupta claimed that after the redevelopment of Central Vista, the “Rajpath will be reduced to a service road”. However, the government has said the width of Rajpath won’t be reduced, rather the stretch would be made more people-friendly.

KOCHI: Taking up the gauntlet thrown down by the state higher education department, 29 teams from various college across the state are participating in the Reboot Kerala hackathon, which began at Federal institute of science and technology ( FISAT ) on Friday.

Kerala’s biggest hackathon — organized by Additional Skill Acquisition Program ( ASAP ) — saw the teams converging to come up with innovative yet sustainable solutions to some of the most relevant concerns related to healthcare and social justice in the state today.

“The students have to come up with solutions to ‘concerns’ rather than ‘problems’ faced by the state today. We need practical solutions that are sustainable and visionary. The man in the street always complains about the hard realities of life-related government departments but they cannot suggest a practical and down-to-earth solution to the problem,” said Veena Madhavan , chief executive officer of ASAP. She said that knowledge becomes valuable not when it is gained, but when it is applied for the betterment of the society. She further highlighted the importance of team work and time management.

In her presidential address, assistant collector M S Madhavikutty said that people had a preconceived notion of engineers being mere technical enthusiasts. With such events, she said, engineers are bringing “subtle but revolutionary changes” to the society. She spoke on the transition from self-starting scooters to electric scooters, manhole cleaning robots and such innovations which have succeeded in making revolutionary changes in the engineering sector and society.

The final problem statements given to the students were:

1. Developing a technical system for informing the public about all facilities in the Department of Health , including the availability of blood in blood banks, specialists in hospitals, and related services.

2. Develop an app to help HIV patients book appointments with doctors. The system should be developed to enable patients to dispense medication to their place without revealing their identity.

3. Develop a system / app that warns office workers to sit too long and warns them to sit too long in one place. Must be able to provide suggestions for both healthy and scientifically correct posture, the computer screen and the person’s sitting position.

4. Develop a system to monitor emergencies in ICUs and NICUs and to automatically inform doctors and duty staff.

5. Develop an online platform to help users analyze their mental health status. Regarding solutions to their problems, the system should be able to provide instruction and online counseling.

6. Develop a mobile app / device that provides one-click trigger input to the nearest police station and highway patrol vehicles in the event of harassment or physical abuse, to ensure women’s safety.

Vadodara: After a search of nearly 24 hours, body of fifth member of Parmar family was fished out from Narmada canal on Friday morning. Trupti Parmar’s body was found five kilometres away from the accident spot at Shankarpura village by fire brigade men. Her body was brought to the city in the afternoon.

According to police, firemen had searched in about three kilometres radius of the accident on Thursday but on Friday they expanded the search area.

Kalpesh Parmar, his wife Trupti, two children and mother Usha had gone missing on March 1 after they visited the Statue of Unity (SoU) at Kevadia. The cops had begun search for the family a day later, but couldn’t get any clue for the next three days.

The cops checked CCTV footages of SoU and learned that the entire family left the premises at about 7pm. CCTV footage of Vadodara-Dabhoi highway was also scanned and we learned that the family had stopped at Jayveer Hotel on Dabhoi Road at about 9pm for dinner.

When the cops tracked Kalpesh’s mobile phone they learned that it was switched off near Tentalav in Dabhoi.

Dabhoi police then felt that the car may have slipped into Narmada Canal and asked firemen to conduct a search in the canal.

On Thursday morning, divers found the car and entire Parmar family inside except Trupti. Dabhoi police are now investigating if it was an accident or suicide.

296,['7/03/2020'],"‘India a Hindu nation, every RSS worker knows this truth’","Mohan Bhagwat, RSS Sarasanghchalak, and Union Minister Nitin Gadkari felicitated veteran journalist M G alias ... Read More

Nagpur: In a reaffirmation of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s (RSS) idea of a Hindu nation, the RSS sarsanghchalak (chief) Mohan Bhagwat said every worker of the organization knows the truth that India is a ‘Hindu rasthra’.

Bhagwat was speaking at a function organized to felicitate Madhav Govind Vaidya on his 98th birthday. The senior ideologue is the former editor of pro-RSS Marathi daily Tarun Bharat.

The RSS chief also said that if all the rest are gone and just one swayamsevak (RSS worker) remains, “he has the capacity to resurrect the fabric again”. “This is because each worker is an entire organization in himself,” said Bhagwat.

The programme was held at the Suresh Bhat auditorium near RSS Smruti Mandir complex at Reshimbagh. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari was also on the dais.

Citing lines from William Wordsworth’s poem ‘Skylark’, which describes the bird’s qualities for soaring high yet remaining grounded, Bhagwat said even a swayamsevak is like a skylark.

“A swayamsevak always has an eye on the supreme goal of protecting Hindutva and making of the Hindu nation. But, he is also connected with the Sangh at the grass roots level. A swayamsevak is a unit of the Sangh and should not be called a member,” said Bhagwat.

Referring to Vaidya as one such worker who has dedicated his life to the RSS motive, Bhagwat said, “Many had to even pay the price of sticking to the values.”

Earlier, Gadkari too praised Vaidya for spending his lifetime in spreading the RSS message of nationalism and Hindutva during times “when ideology did not have much acceptance”.

Even Vaidya, who cited some stanzas of Wordsworth’s poem, said it was the RSS that taught him to remain grounded no matter what heights you achieve like the skylark.

In a reference to Shiv Sena’s criticism of BJP leader Jay Bhagwan Goyal’s book that compared Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji, Vaidya said people must understand such comparisons do not insult the other person.

“If someone is compared to Shivaji, it is out of respect for the personality with whom the other person is being compared with,” he said.

COIMBATORE: BJP leader Subramanian Swamy has said that V K Sasikala, a confidante of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, would bring about changes in Tamil Nadu politics after her release from the Parappana Agarahara prison in Bengaluru.

Talking to reporters here on Friday, Swamy said Sasikala cannot be excluded from Tamil Nadu politics easily. Sasikala who is undergoing prison term after her conviction in the disproportionate assets case is expected to be released in February 2021.

“There will be changes in Tamil Nadu politics after her release. It will be difficult to exclude her from politics in Tamil Nadu once she comes out,” Swamy said. “She has experience, talent and a whole community behind her,” he added.

Swamy, however, pointed out that she cannot contest in elections for six years after being released.

Stating that there was no hurry in appointing the party’s state president for Tamil Nadu, Swamy said BJP is capable of winning the assembly election and forming a government in the state on its own. But no attempts have been made yet in that direction, he said.

Swamy dismissed a query on actor Kamal Haasan’s prospects by asking, `Who is Kamal?’ even as he expressed his willingness to support Rajnikanth given the actor stand on Hinduism. “I will support him if he stands for Hinduism. If he speaks the same way he spoke at Tughlaq anniversary event, I will help him,” Swamy said.

On the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Swamy said there was nothing which is anti-Muslim in the legislation. “There is nothing wrong in protests in a democracy, but lies should not be peddled to stoke fear,” he said.

MADURAI: The historical Tamukkam ground, a major landmark in the city, is all set to get a facelift. While this is good news, this year’s Chittirai exhibition, held during the Chittirai festival, will not be held on the ground which has been hosting it for nearly 50 years.

Sprawling over about 50,000 sq feet, the ground can hold about 1.5 lakh people at a time. It is said to have been developed by Nayank king Viswanatha Nayak to host royal entertainments including sports. The large ground which is under the control of Madurai Corporation is opposite to Gandhi Museum, which was the summer palace of queen Rani Mangammal. The existing auditorium called “Kalai Arangam”, which has an outward appearance of a temple tower, has a capacity to seat 20,000 people. Many of Madurai’s functions involving a large audience were held at this auditorium till some airconditioned facilities came up on the outskirts of the city.

Every year, the government organises Chittirai exhibition on the ground for 45 days drawing lakhs of people. On the day of the culminating event of the festival, when Lord Kallazhagar enters Vaigai river, the exhibition remains open throughout the night. This helps the crowds that come to witness the event spend the night there. Now the corporation is planning to develop it into a state-of-the-art auditorium at a cost of Rs 50 crore with a parking facility for 400 cars and 1,000 two-wheelers. The Tamukkam ground is to be closed for this work in the next one week.

City engineer S Arasu said preliminary work has started and demolition of the existing auditorium would take place soon. ``We have told the contractor that the work should be completed in 18 months and the ground should be ready for next year’s Chittirai festival,’’ he said. Meanwhile, the district administration is looking for open spaces near Tamukkam for this year’s exhibition and hoping to find one that would be closer to the route taken by the deity during the festival.

In reply, the court’s PIO, K H Dohre, wrote back that Fakir would require to furnish evidence of his Indian citizenship to get his RTI request processed further.

Fakir had pasted a stamp worth Rs 20, as it is required towards fee for an application under RTI laws in his application. The PIO pointed out that the amount was not sufficient. The Gujarat high court RTI Rules mandate an applicant to paste Rs 50 stamp. The official has asked the applicant to supply Rs 30 stamp in addition.

However, along with THE requisite fee, the PIO has told the applicant that Rule 7 of a Gujarat government notification published in March 22, 2010 gazette requires “declaration on part of the applicant that he is an Indian citizen, which you have not declared in your application. Therefore, supply the proof of your being an Indian citizen along with the requisite fee. On completion of your application, your application will be processed further”.

RTI activist Pankti Jog said that asking for an applicant’s citizenship proof is not a common practice. “The only thing that an applicant is required to state is to make a declaration that he/she is an Indian. The rule says that only in a case of doubt, the PIO can ascertain citizenship. But the PIO has to say why he has formed such an opinion or on what basis and logic he is seeking the document. The order has to be a speaking order with reasons properly explained in it,” she said.

Jog further said that the court’s PIO is not justified in seeking citizenship proof from an applicant under rules formulated by the state government, “There are separate RTI rules formulated by the Gujarat high court for applying and supplying information under RTI laws. The state government rules are not applicable to Fakir’s case. On one hand, the PIO is asking for fees fixed under the HC rules, but at the same time he is also citing the state government rules for citizenship proof,” she added.

KOCHI: The demolition of flats in Maradu was painful but it should act as an eye-opener to all to follow laws, particularly those related to the environment. After inaugurating the two-day state conference of Credai Kerala on Friday, Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan said everyone must adhere to rules and regulations formulated by authorities. The Maradu development has alerted builders to the interests of consumers, since they are the victims, he said.

He said real-estate developments have great potential in creating job opportunities, but lack of clarity in many areas and hostile regulations by central and state governments have created uncertainty in the industry. Credai has a great role in urbanisation and limited availability of experts is a challenge, Khan said.

In the technical session that followed developers urged the state government to resolve the uncertainties in the coastal regulation zone ( CRZ ) notification. A Senthilvel, adviser with the ministry of environment and forest and climate change, said that there should be a cordial relationship with investors in the real-estate sector and KCZMA . There should be a system of mapping and both these sections of people discuss about it and find a solution.

Advocate P B Sahasranaman, an advocate who specializes in environmental law, said that if mapping is not done in a systematic way, demolitions will continue in 2020 as well. There should be transparency in laws and rules and it is the role of the government to ensure it.

Meanwhile, chairman of Kerala Real Estate Regulatory Authority (KRERA) P H Kurian said that the authority will launch online registration facility from July. He said as the rules are newly introduced, he will hold further discussions with government on resolving disputes and confusion. He also said that there needs to be more clarification on villa projects.

305,['7/03/2020'],MP urges Tamil Nadu CM to take steps to open Trichy zoological park,"The MP said the park spread over about 62 hectares was to accommodate 24 wildlife species as in Vandalur zoo.

TRICHY: With no progress on the ground for the inauguration of the zoological park set up in Trichy in 2017 at a cost of Rs 2.40 crore, Perambalur Lok Sabha MP P T Pariventhar on Friday met chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami seeking speedy inauguration of the facility.

The MP said the park spread over about 62 hectares was to accommodate 24 wildlife species as in Vandalur zoo. Though the first phase of work ended in 2007 at a cost of Rs 2.4 crore, an additional one crore has already been spent on maintaining the existing facility. Demarcation of boundaries, fencing, entrance arch, pictorial sign boards and borewell with an overhead tank of 24,000 litres capacity had been established in the first phase.

Proposed in 2009, the park could be the fifth one under the zoo authority in Tamil Nadu if it becomes operational. However, the basic infrastructure was getting damaged as the zoo was not operational.

Central Zoo Authority of India (CZA) had a few months ago asked to make some changes to the park’s design, which were incorporated and CZA informed about it. Pariventhar mentioned in his letter that the forest department had planned to make the park operational two years ago by bringing animals from zoological parks in Vandalur, Ooty, Thanjavur, Coimbatore, Vellore and Thiruvananthapuram.

However, this has not materialised. The park’s inauguration was among the six demands that the MP submitted to the chief minister for consideration.

Speaking to TOI, Trichy district forest officer (DFO) D Sujatha said the government is optimistic about making the zoological park operational at the earliest.

Details related to it were sought from her office by the state government a few days ago, she said adding that the park may be functional soon.

These stocks are now coming in handy for the Indian drug industry , which would have otherwise been crippled as the Chinese industry has all but ground to a halt owing to the coronavirus outbreak.China celebrates its New Year on February 12 and the most important part of the celebrations is the family reunion. While many employees go on a long holiday, the supply chain market gets affected as almost all factories are shut for at least 10 days. For several years now, Indian drug manufacturers have been stocking up raw materials they import from China to ensure there are no hiccups for at least three months.Sunil Cajetan Attavar, president of Karnataka Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Manufacturers’ Association (KDPMA), told TOI most Indian drug companies usually stock extra materials to last till March and it has helped them this year. “Covid-19 has definitely hit our supply chain as we depend heavily on China for many of the starting materials and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs),” he said.However, several drug manufacturers said they may still face shortage of raw materials and drug prices may go up at least 60%. “The Chinese drug supply chain and industry are in turmoil and we need to address the situation at the earliest,” said an industry insider.Attavar said as of now, they have not faced any shortage of essential raw materials. “We have seen increase in prices of many raw materials,” he said, citing the example of paracetamol raw material which was priced at Rs 280-300 per kg before the Covid-19 outbreak and has now touched Rs 440.He said, “The industry is working very closely with the government to ensure all essential medicines are available. The government has taken proactive steps to monitor the stock and price of some key APIs and also restricted their exports.”In all, 58 APIs are imported from China. As an immediate measure, the Centre has restricted the export of 26 pharmaceutical ingredients and medicines made from them, including paracetamol.The department of pharmaceuticals in the ministry of chemical and fertilizers has formed a technical committee headed by S Eswara Reddy, joint drug controller (India), for the revival of fermentation industry and new technologies for manufacturing of APIs.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74522080,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-186734,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/chinese-new-year-saved-indian-drug-industry-from-covid-19-after-effects/articleshow/74519805.cms
307,['7/03/2020'],Sabar Dairy takes lead in making traditional veterinary medicine,"Vadodara: North Gujarat-based Sabar Dairy has become the only milk union in the country to have a dedicated supply chain facility to prepare ready-to-use ethno-veterinary medicine (EVM) for various ailments of animals.

EVM animal healthcare medicine made using traditional method and readily available ingredients in a farmer’s household like turmeric, amla, cumin seeds and herbs. These EVM is used to treat some of the most common ailments found in the animals.

The facility at Sabar Dairy has been set up in collaboration with the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB). It was inaugurated by NDDB chairman Dilip Rath on Thursday.

“Majority of dairy farmers in our country are small or marginal who find it difficult to afford a veterinarian or bear the treatment charges when their animals fall sick,” Rath said.

Adoption of alternative approach for common ailments especially through ethno-veterinary medicine would offer a very cost-effective and easy option to farmers with ingredients usually available locally, he said.

NDDB along with Sabar Dairy has been propagating use of EVM since 2014. It has been providing support to Sabar under the mastitis control popularisation project (MCPP). It has also provided a grant of Rs 28.4 lakh for establishing their EVP supply chain facility.

Through the facility, the plan is to propagate EVM concept by field training and motivating personnel involved in animal husbandry.

Sabar union is expanding to cover all dairy cooperative societies (DCS) to reduce the treatment costs and use of drugs and antibiotics. EVM is now being implemented as MCPP in around 25 milk unions covering about 1,500 DCS across nine states benefiting over one lakh farmers.

Sabar Dairy’s chairman Shamal Patel, vice chairman Jayanti Patel, board members of dairy along with NDDB’s executive director Meenesh Shah graced the inauguration ceremony.

BENGALURU: In good news for the transgender community, BBMP said its 169 e-toilets are gender neutral and can be used by sexual minorities.

Several community members had complained about the humiliation and sexual harassment they face in public washrooms reserved for men or women. A transwoman said some women in public washrooms scream on seeing them. “When I walk in, they yell at the security guard asking them why they allowed us inside,” Veena S said.

Transman Kiran Nayak said, “Since there are no proper facilities for us, I avoid consuming a lot of water during the day. The result: I’ve got kidney stones.”

Randeep D, special commissioner, solid waste management, BBMP, said: “Transgender persons are welcome to use public toilets. We will sensitise our service providers about the community and put up signages to indicate that public toilets are gender neutral. Any harassment or discrimination will be taken seriously.”

The Palike plans to open 18 more gender-neutral twin toilets in the city.

Transwoman Veena said, “All we’re asking for is a basic facility and a little acceptance.” Mallu Kumbar, a transman, agreed. “We are not requesting for a special washroom; we only need more gender-neutral ones.”

309,['7/03/2020'],Karnataka: 275 children escaped from government-run homes in 4 years,"TimesView The story that the data on children’s homes paints is obviously not a happy one. Children living is such facilities are already fragile at many levels, and more so psychologically. Picking them up from streets and bus stands is one thing. But giving them a second dwelling, which genuinely feels like home, is no easy task. Often, an alien space where they have to battle language barriers and live in the company of strangers can be overwhelming. These homes are obviously not where their hearts are. Such young minds need sensitive handling, where their hopes for a better tomorrow can be reignited.

BENGALURU: The government on Friday admitted that 275 children escaped from state-run children’s homes — Balamandiras — in the last four years. Karnataka has 60 such facilities.Of the 275, 150 have been traced and brought back. This amounts to just 54% of those who chose the escape route. Usually, most of these children are either missing or homeless, found at bus stops and railway stations. They are given care and protection at these homes before being reunited with their families.A look at the number, provided by the women and child welfare department and tabled at the legislative council suggests more boys than girls have slipped away from the Balamandiras. The report was tabled in response to a question raised by BJP MLC Mahantesh Kavathgimath.Among those who escaped from these homes, the highest are from Bengaluru (55). Incidentally, the state capital has seen only boys leaving these homes since 2016. So far, none of them have been traced.In Ballari, 25 boys escaped in the same period, of which 20 were found and brought back. Two girls too escaped and one was brought back in 2017-18.Mysuru saw 27 boys escaping in the last four years, of which 20 were found. The district’s girls home saw 19 inmates escaping, of which 15 were found.According to Nagasimha G Rao, child rights activist, many kids found stranded in Bengaluru come from different linguistic backgrounds and they need to be spoken to in their language.“Getting local language communicators is tough. But that’s the key to early repatriation. Some of them even run away thinking they may never get to go home otherwise. They could also turn into children in conflict with law,” said Rao.Mounesh Kouner, programme coordinator for an organisation that rescues missing children, says government homes can be made more child friendly. “If government homes are child friendly and if the kids are united with their families at the earliest, children wouldn’t escape,” said Kouner, adding some of these runaway kids are usually found in and around railway stations.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74521575,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-302683,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/275-children-escaped-from-govt-run-homes-in-4-years/articleshow/74519815.cms

A head master of a primary school in the Manjipura village of Bodeli taluka was found marking attendance in the school but actually doing his in his jewellery shop. What was more shocking is the fact that he covered his absence by asking the wife of a cluster coordinator of primary schools to teach in his place.

This came to light after primary and secondary education secretary Vinod Rao was tipped off regarding the state of affairs. Rao had visited schools in Chhota Udepur on February 25 when he came to know that the district primary education officer too was absent from duty without prior intimation and was also unaware of various initiatives for primary education. Rao’s examination of notebooks in schools had also revealed that the education being offered there was not up to the mark.

Chhota Udepur DDO Mihir Patel conducted a surprise check at the Manjipura school and found principal Trimurti Choksi attending his jewellery shop in Bodeli.

Choksi used to visit in the morning and evening only to mark his attendance. While he took care of business during the day, Payal Patel used to teach in his place at the school.

Payal, wife of Bodeli taluka primary school cluster coordinator Vipul, admitted teaching in Class V at the school.

While the test papers had been checked with a red pen, they were not signed. An offence as registered against Choksi, Vipul and Payal Patel at the Bodeli police station. Both Choksi and Vipul Patel were also put under suspension.

The in-charge taluka primary education officer Arvind Rathwa who is also the head master of Unchapaan primary school was also suspended. Block coordinator Dhiru Gamara was also suspended.

“We were told that HM had called for a protest on Friday from 6am to 6pm. But later, they postponed it to Saturday. But it was not communicated properly. So, more than 90% of shops at Karumathampatti and Somanur areas were closed. The shops opened only after 6pm,” said a bakery owner.

Tension gripped Annur after a group of HM members forced a Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam (TPDK) member to close his tailoring shop and also manhandled him. The HM members ransacked the shop of Ananda Krishnan and locked him inside. As many as 50 cops were deployed in the area after TPDK members gathered at the spot. TPDK members have lodged a complaint with the Annur police against the HM men.

Several shopowners in Karumathampatti and Somanur areas said they will not participate in today’s shutter-down protest.

The city police have tightened security across the district in the wake of today’s strike call. Police commissioner Sumit Sharan told TOI that as many as 1,500 police personnel and three companies of Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel will be deployed in the city from Saturday morning. “We will take strict action against those who force traders to close their shops.

BENGALURU: A 39-year-old film distributor has been arrested for allegedly sexually harassing and blackmailing a 35-year-old homemaker whom he met in Australia .

Roopesh N of JP Park in Yeshwantpur had befriended the woman in mid-2018 in Melbourne and had taken her photographs. Subsequently, he started blackmailing her by threatening to send the pictures to her husband. She claimed to have paid him Rs 5 lakh so far. But when he continued to demand more money and forced her to enter into a physical relationship with him, she lodged a complaint with Nandini Layout police.

Based on the woman’s complaint, Roopesh was arrested and remanded in judicial custody. Police said he’s married and has children. His wife is a dentist in Melbourne.

“Roopesh distributed Kannada films in Australia and Bangkok. He also organised events there. He had distributed movies like Rangi Taranga and Avane Srimannarayana in Australia,” police said.

“The woman lived in Melbourne with her husband, a software engineer. She met the accused at an event in 2018 and the two became friends. According to her, Roopesh took her to a restaurant and forced her to smoke hookah, after which he allegedly took advantage of her and took objectionable photos and videos of her with him,” police said.

BENGALURU: A newly sunk borewell at the onset of summer should be good news, but not in Banashankari II Stage where residents are cursing BBMP which took up this exercise. Reason: The borewell has been drilled bang in the middle of the road that links the locality to Thayagarajanagar.

Now left to negotiate the borewell casing pipe , that menacingly juts out of the road surface, residents say the protrusion will soon lead to accidents if the road isn’t relaid to cover it. Huge mounds of soil, removed while digging the borewell, still lie on either side of the stretch.

Kalpana Naganath, a retired bank employee, in front of whose house the casing pipe stands, is now regretting having gone for a movie on March 2 when the BBMP sunk the borewell. She was in the theatre when she received a call from her panicky neighbours.

Kalpana, who rushed home, saw Palike men drilling the borewell in front of her house and asked why this was being done in the middle of the road. “The officials rudely told me that Kuvempu Park across the road was drying up because of lack of water. They said they could strike groundwater source only in the middle of the road in front of my home,” she told TOI.

The officials assured Kalpana that they’d fix the road by evening. “It’s four days now and nothing has happened,” she said.

Local residents said they weren’t consulted by the BBMP before digging the borewell. “We are environment lovers and certainly want the park to look rich and beautiful, but not at the cost of damaging the road,” a resident said.

BBMP officials told TOI the local corporator, Lakshmi Umesh (Ganesh Mandir ward), was kept in the loop and she agreed to have the borewell in the middle of the road.

Residents, however, claimed the corporator was inaccessible and only a few days ago, they had to approach Bangalore South MP Tejasvi Surya to draw the authorities’ attention to uprooting of old trees in the area.

“We are done with our work and will fix the road soon. There are no labourers now. We will fix the road within two days,” a senior BBMP official said.

Corporator Lakshmi Umesh was unavailable for comments.

District collector Dr T G Vinay took part in the meeting at the collectorate. “The focus of the discussions was on preventive measures and creating awareness about spread of COVID-19 by spreading good hygiene practices. We are also urging private hospitals to alert us at the earliest in case of suspicions of the disease,” said Dr Priya Raj. About 25 people are currently being monitored in the district for COVID-19. However, so far none of them are symptomatic. The health officials later held a meeting with Madurai airport director V V Rao. Universal screening of all international passengers is being carried out at the airport while masks and hand sanitizers are also being used by officials as a precautionary measure, noted the director. Alert messages are being displayed prominently on banners and boards inside the airport. Between January 28 and March 5, a total of 15,432 passengers were screened at the airport for the disease, said health officials.

315,['7/03/2020'],Dempo likely to forge new partnership with FC Goa,"Panaji: Shrinivas Dempo may return to FC Goa but at least for now, it will be only a tie-up of his academy with the Indian Super League (ISL) franchise. Dempo was the original co-owner of FC Goa who pulled out in 2016. There have been talks that the owner of Dempo Sports Club will return to the ISL fold, but the club chairman said any tieup at this stage will be at the grassroots level.

“I have held a few rounds of discussions with (FC Goa president) Akshay (Tandon) and he is quite keen. So they (FC Goa) focus on the mainstream and we become the feeder. When their junior team starts playing, my wish list will be that at least 50% of boys should be from the Dempo Academy,” Dempo told TOI recently.

He appeared keen on the collaboration between Goa’s most successful club in recent times and the most popular one at the moment.

“It is advisable that one FC Goa thrives and we all have a role to play. That’s why I’m trying very hard with FC Goa for a collaboration. We want our Goan boys to do well. Off late, Goan boys are not doing that well, so we need to build that up again,” said Dempo.

FC Goa have been a force to reckon with and is the most consistent team in six seasons of ISL. Two years after its debut, their developmental team won the Goa Professional League title last season and the junior teams are doing reasonably well.

But the Goan franchise doesn’t have the infrastructure which Dempo have built after investing heavily in the academy at Ella, in Old Goa. The club chairman credits FC Goa for the fanbase they have built over the years and believes that a small state like Goa deserves only one club.

“I personally believe Goa deserves only one club (in ISL). We can’t have four and five clubs to develop a fan base. When you look at FC Goa, it is the club now that has got the fanbase. Where is the scope for another team to develop? So, when we are saying that FC Goa is the only franchise to operate in Goa with some viability, we have to look at our role in football ,” said Dempo.

The academy secured a three-star rating last year from the All India Football Federation (AIFF0 and are now focusing on improving that rating. They will soon have an artificial turf ground, a full-fledged physiotherapy room, recovery room and conference facilities.

If the tie-up between Dempo and FC Goa materialise, fans will get to witness more home-grown talent rubbing shoulders with experienced foreign players. FC Goa’s current captain Mandar Rao Desai is a Dempo product, while midfielder Lenny Rodrigues and defender Mohamed Ali have donned their colours.

MADURAI: Around 100 people, most of them women, who staged a protest at the district collectorate on Friday demanding that workplace be made better and safer for women, were arrested by the police and let off in the evening.

Members from the CPI-M, All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA) and Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) took part in the protest, led by J Loordhu Ruby and G Gowri under the banner of a union of working women.

Their other demands included providing job security for women, equal pay for both genders, pension for women after the age of 50 and making anganwadi workers as government employees. “Working conditions need to improve for women. Women are not safe at workplace and many of those accused of harassment often go scot-free. In some places, women are forced to work for more than 10 to 12 hours with low pay as well. In textile showrooms, salespersons, who are mostly women, need to stand for long durations. All these need to change,” said Ganesan, district secretary, CITU.

318,['7/03/2020'],Time to celebrate return of grassroot democracy: Bedi,"Puducherry: Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi on Friday hailed the Madras high court order, which upheld her decision on the mode of appointment of a state election commissioner in the Union territory of Puducherry.

Terming the high court’s order as ‘good news’ for grassroot-level democracy she said the order will ensure holding polls to the rural and urban local bodies by a ‘'duly-selected public official approved by the administrator’ and not merely nominated by the government without a selection process. “This augurs well for grassroot democracy and local management to be in the hands of men and women of Puducherry at grassroot-level, knowing their problems firsthand as well as the possible solutions. Also encouraging community, activism,” she said.

Welcoming the order Bedi said it is ‘time to celebrate the return of grassroot democracy to Puducherry’.

“Implementation of this judgment in letter and spirit will give active grassroot social reformers a chance to serve more. Puducherry UT can look forward to more young faces...Now they can be leaders in the change in their respective areas,” she said.

She appealed to the people to utilize the opportunity to serve their respective regions and develop their localities. “Hence, it opens up opportunities for people of Puducherry to take grassroot governance in their own hands and work together with the administration now,” she said.

She regretted that until now the commune commissioners have been deciding on behalf of the people without people’s participation. She said all the key public service needs of the community are ‘disjointed’. She expressed hope that women will participate in rural governance if the local bodies become functional.

“Several useful government schemes which have financial benefits are not available because we do not have elected local bodies,” Bedi said pointing out that Puducherry has always been asking for additional funds.

It may be recalled that Bedi did not approve the Congress government's decision of nominating a retired government official T M Balakrishnan as the state election commissioner and insisted the government select a state election commissioner by inviting applications from eligible candidates through an open all India advertisement.

Bedi had earlier constituted a committee headed by chief secretary Ashwani Kumar with two members – one official from the Union home ministry and other from Union panchayat raj ministry to hold selection trials to appoint state election commissioner. The committee issued an all India advertisement seeking eligible candidates to apply for the post.

Public works minister A Namassivayam moved the Madras high court praying to declare Bedi's move on the appointment of state election commissioner as 'arbitrary, ultra vires and unconstitutional'. The high court, however, dismissed his plea.

319,['7/03/2020'],"As coronanxiety spreads, it’s goodbye hands, hello elbows","New Delhi: On Thursday, Barack Obama tweeted that people should “stay calm, listen to experts and follow the science”. But in reality, people are doing just the opposite. Ever since the first novel coronavirus case was officially declared in India, anxiety is spreading faster than the wily pathogen that has so far infected 90,000 people worldwide. And it is making Indians do weird things.People can be seen pressing elevator buttons with their knuckles, opening and closing doors with an often clumsy, interplay of elbows , feet and the bum, and even cancelling cabs if the driver has a Uttar Pradesh and Haryana number because Gurugram and Noida have reported positive cases. A Delhi executive confessed that she tried to shut the cab door using a hands-free approach until the driver objected and said the door wouldn’t close properly by using elbows.“I have completely stopped touching any surface that someone else might have touched and using my elbow to push open doors or switch on lights at my office,” said Lata Sharma, who works for a private firm in Nehru Place.Parents, expectedly, are leading the paranoia. If it were possible they would wrap their kids in bubble wrap and send them to school with an oxygen tank. The next best option is sending them with masks or not sending at all. Even some schools have asked kids to come wearing masks. New mom Avisha Tripathi says she is determined to keep her toddler away from extra-affectionate family members. “Since my son is the first child in our family, everyone keeps touching him and showering him with kisses. I am very scared and am not allowing anyone to come close,” she added.Household staff say they are being doused with sanitiser before entering. Some have been asked to ditch auto and bus and go grocery shopping for the house in the family car. A help in Ghaziabad complained that her employer had stopped eating eggs for breakfast and she ended up making more time-consuming fare like parathas, puri, poha, etc.If shortness of breath is a symptom of the virus, holding the breath is a symptom of corona anxiety. It’s the best defence against dirty droplets if you don’t have a mask and are in a crowded place, like inside the Delhi Metro. Daily commuters report that a sneeze or a cough from a passenger immediately empties the space around him/her. Actually, it can be an effective ploy to get a seat.If the metro is less crowded, so are gyms. A gym owner in north Delhi’s Mukherjee Nagar, Khalid, says business has been hit. “Since the last two-three days, there are hardly any people turning up at the gym. Also, there are no new subscribers,” he said.Dr Sandeep Budhiraja of Max Hospitals Delhi says that people are bombarding him with questions… Should we go to the mall, travel in the metro? Should we wear masks? “People are rushing to the hospital with seasonal cough and cold asking corona toh nahi ho gaya,” said Budhiraja, adding that we just need to follow official advisories and be sensible.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-coronanxiety-spreads-its-goodbye-hands-hello-elbows/articleshow/74520067.cms

Healthy people should not start wearing masks.

322,['7/03/2020'],Ex-soldier wins battle against private hospital,"Representative image

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission has rejected an appeal filed by Apollo Hospitals International Ltd against the order of compensation for an ex-serviceman for denying him emergency treatment citing the non-availability of bed.

In 2017, a consumer forum in Gandhinagar had asked the hospital to pay Rs 12,500 to Prakash Sharma, a former soldier who had fought in three wars for India in 1962, 1965, and 1971. Sharma went to Apollo hospital near Bhat village on September 7, 2015, for treatment. The hospital’s urologist, Darshan Shah, advised emergency treatment, but the hospital did not admit him on the grounds that there was no bed available in the emergency ward.

The septuagenarian Sharma was a member of Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS), which had inked an MoU with Apollo hospital along with many polyclinics to ensure cashless treatment to its members. Denied treatment by Apollo hospital, Sharma went to another hospital and obtained treatment.

He sued Apollo Hospital in 2016 in the Gandhinagar District Consumer Redressal Forum complaining of deficiency in service and discrimination against patients who are under ECHS.

The consumer forum ordered the hospital management to compensate him. The forum had observed, “A hospital like Apollo with huge infrastructure and a nationwide repute showed negligence in providing emergency treatment on a frivolous ground that an empty bed was not available. A hospital’s primary objective and duty are to save a patient’s life. In the present case, the hospital could have given a bed in its lobbies or in a doctor’s chamber too.”

Apollo hospital challenged this order before the commission, which rejected its appeal and said, “As per sound principle of law, no interference (in the forum’s order) is warranted by this commission.”

The commission held that it was deficiency in service as well as discrimination against ECHS patient on part of the hospital. “On September 7, 2015, so many patients other than the complainant were admitted to the emergency ward. Therefore, it is crystal clear that the hospital [denied] the complainant medical service…Though the complainant was entitled to get emergency medical service, on baseless and untenable pretext, the hospital did not provide medical service in the emergency ward. It admitted general patients for treatment. This is nothing but discrimination against ECHS patients,” the commission’s order reads.

Later, they were requested to receive Holy Communion on the hand, rather than on the tongue.As coronavirus spreads, the Church is relaxing certain religious practices to fight it. On Friday, Archbishop of Bombay Oswald Cardinal Gracias issued an advisory to parishes in Mumbai to encourage temporary changes in age-old religious rituals While Gracias’ communication was only issued to churches and institutions in the Archdiocese of Bombay, he said that “after appropriate consultation, will send a similar note to the Church in India”. Gracias, who is also president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India, recommended that devotees exchange the sign of peace during mass with folded hands (namaste) instead of shaking hands.The Archdiocese of Goa and Daman hasn’t issued any such recommendations yet.However, some churches in Goa have already decided to follow Gracias’ advice — like the shrine of Our Lady of Fatima at Don Bosco Panaji. The celebrant assured devotees that the holy water fonts weren't empty by accident — he had asked for them to be removed. Later, during the homily, he read out Gracias' advice in full.In the note, Gracias advised priests to encourage people to receive Holy Communion on the hand instead of on the tongue, as is widely practiced.Fr Loddy Pires, in-charge of the shrine, requested that devotees at the shrine should only receive holy communion in the hand, reverentially. “You must consume the host there itself before going to your place,” he said. Pires also advised devotees not to touch the statues around the shrine. He stressed that the precautions are for the devotees’ own safety.In his communication, Gracias advised that the veneration of the cross on Good Friday doesn’t have to include kissing it. “The blessing with a raised cross would be adequate,” he said. “Those who desire, they could come in a queue make reverence with a bow and go back,” he advised.The unprecedented recommendations also include priests and ministers purifying their hands in a bowl of water or sanitiser before distributing communion. In Panaji, the Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima has provided sanitisers in the sacristy.These new norms are temporary, and valid till Easter , on April 12.“It there is any indication that an individual in the community is infected, parish priests can temporarily suspend meetings of cells, sodalities, associations, etc,” Gracias stated in his advisory. “Do advise people not to panic. Government authorities are doing their best to face this challenge.

NEW DELHI: Claiming to having busted an international cheating racket, Delhi Police’s Cyber Cell arrested three men who duped people on the pretext of offering them prize money from the popular TV show Kaun Banega Crorepati .

The accused, identified as Imtiaz Ali (20), Irfan Ali (20) and Santosh Kumar (22), belong to Bihar ’s Gopalganj.

Cops claimed to have used technical surveillance through which they captured photographs of Pakistan-based elements while they were chatting with the arrested men through an app-based calling platform called Imo. The Pakistan-based kingpin identified himself as Rauf, police said.

The accused had duped an Odisha-based man, who in January committed suicide due to his dismal financial situation. The victim had made a video before dying, wherein he had accused Rana of having ruined his life by falsely promising him a big amount as prize money.

In July 2019, police received another complaint from a Najafgarh-based woman who the gang had called to inform about a lucky draw amongst viewers of KBC, which she had won.

In order to receive the Rs 75 lakh winning amount, the woman was asked to pay processing fee and taxes. After entangling her in a web of lies, the gang members made the woman cough up Rs 25 lakh.

The three accused, meanwhile, shifted back to Bihar with the siphoned amount. “Recently, we received a tip-off and a team led by ACP Aditya Gautam nabbed the accused from their hometown,” said DCP (Cyber Cell) Anyesh Roy. Cops later tracked dozens of bank accounts belonging to the accused, and recovered Rs 70 lakh from unidentified sources.

According to police, the men had come to Delhi looking for jobs and were staying in Batla House. They got to know about this scam, which was being run from Pakistan as some of their friends/acquaintances were already associated with it. They got in touch with the kingpin, Rauf, a resident of Islamabad, through the Imo app and started working with him. The accused provided Rauf with logistical support in the form of different bank accounts, usually locally sourced for a commission.

Police said Manjunath’s family went in a car to Dharmasthala temple in Dakshina Kannada district on March 4 to have their 11-month-old son’s head tonsured. After completing the ritual, they began their journey back home on Thursday night.

When they reached Avaragere in Kunigal taluk in Tumakuru around 2.30am on Friday, a speeding car heading towards Bengaluru rammed their SUV. Police said the driver had lost control of the car, after which the vehicle rammed the median and collided with the vehicle Manjunath and family were travelling in.

TRICHY: A revenue assistant at the Ariyamangalam zonal office in Trichy corporation and his assistant were caught red-handed by sleuths of the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption ( DVAC ) while taking Rs 4,000 bribe from a resident on Friday.

DVAC, Trichy arrested the in-charge revenue assistant R Murugan, 45 of Bharathi Nagar in Sangiliyandapuram and his helper J Philip Kennedy, 27 from Mudhaliyar Chathiram.

Senthilkumar bought a house in Pavala Nagar last September. Subsequently, he applied for transferring the property in his name in the corporation records for remittance of taxes. Though he paid the prescribed fees, the transfer did not take place. Senthilkumar approached Murugan but there was no progress.

Police said that they will be produced in the court for remand.

334,['7/03/2020'],Transporters say higher rates to hit customers,"Pune: With the state government on Friday deciding to increase the VAT (value added tax) on the sale of petrol and diesel by Re 1 per litre, transporters said they would have no option but to pass on the hike to consumers.

Ali Daruwala, national spokesperson of the All India Petrol Dealers Association, told TOI that the increased cost of fuel would result in shifting of customers to other states. “The cost of a litre of petrol, including excise and dealers’ commission, is approximately Rs56 in Maharashtra. The VAT on this is 25%, which comes to approximately Rs 13 per litre. Also, the surcharge in Maharashtra is between Rs7 and Rs8 per litre. This clearly means that the price of fuel will increase. We denounce the move of the state government as increasing the fuel prices will result in our customers moving to other states. The cost of fuel in Maharashtra is higher compared to Goa or Karnataka,” Daruwala told TOI.

Currently, the cost of petrol in Pune city is Rs76.54 per litre and that of diesel is Rs65.55 per litre. Deputy CM Ajit Pawar, in his budget speech, said, “In order to create a special dedicated fund for implementation of the environmental projects, I propose to increase VAT on the sale of petrol and diesel by one rupee per litre, in addition to the existing rate of VAT. This will enrich the state exchequer by an additional Rs1,800 crore per annum.”

Baba Shinde, president, Maharashtra State Vahan Chalak Malak Pratinidhi Sanghatna, told TOI that the state government needed to think over the decision. “Since the last few months, our business has gone down by almost 40% due to the slowdown in the market. If the prices go up further under such circumstances, we will be in deep trouble. In Pune district, on an average, around 350 to 400 trucks carrying commodities such as vegetables, fruits, auto parts come and go daily,” he said.

Rajan Junavane, president, Pune Bus Owners’ Association, said they would be affected by the rise in fuel prices. “We have intercity , school and staff buses. The school and staff buses have a yearly contract. With the fuel prices rising, we will have to bear the hike in expenses from our own pockets. Thereafter, we will have to increase the charges. The business has been affected for some months. The Coronavirus outbreak has wrecked it,” he said.

336,['7/03/2020'],Renovation work on Kattalai canal to begin in a week,"KARUR: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Friday laid the foundation stone for the renovation of Kattalai high level canal (KHLC) of Cauvery river in Karur through video conferencing from Chennai.

The decades-old contour canal will be refurbished and modernised at an outlay of Rs 335.5 crore in two years, with a pause whenever water is released in the canal for irrigation in Karur and Trichy. Constructed in 1934, KHLC branches Cauvery from Mayanur in Karur district to irrigate 23,774 acres in Karur and Trichy.

The need for renovation arose several years ago after the water distribution system became old besides requiring repairs and replacement at many locations. Since there was largescale wastage of water caused by erosion of bund, the productivity also fell low.

As the major portion of the channel and its branches got eroded, the bed level also went down. Officials said that equal water distribution to the tail-end was impossible as the structure including sluice gates were in a dilapidated condition. A public works department (PWD) official said that the water failed to reach about 4,000 acres in the tail-end areas.

Under the renovation project, 174 structures will be taken up for renovation and modernisation, including regulators, inlets, outlets, pedestrian and vehicle bridges, sluices, siphons, masonry under tunnels. Among them, 25 structures will be repaired and 124 modernised. The project also covers a canal lining along the entire length except leading channels apart from modernising distributaries and drainage channels at vulnerable locations.

Since the water from Mettur was stopped in the end of January, the work would commence in a week. The work would be put on hold after the water is released from Mettur in June to facilitate the irrigation until the water is stopped from Mettur.

BHUBANESWAR: Women police personnel in the state on Friday demanded a new dress code for them. The female cops, who attended a conference on women in police in Cuttack, said the existing khaki trousers and shirts are gender insensitive.

In the conference, some women police personnel proposed introduction of salwar-kameez with a different colour. Some others proposed stretchable trousers and jerseys. “I am 42 and not at all comfortable with the khaki trousers and shirt on field. We face more discomfort and inconvenience during menstruation days. The existing uniform is comfortable for men only. Some cities have salwar-kameez uniform for female police personnel,” said a woman inspector.

DGP Abhay, who attended the conferences valedictory session, said the proposal of woman-friendly uniform will be examined. “We received a number of recommendations, including change of uniform for women police personnel, from the participants. The female personnel want modification in the design and colour of the existing uniform for their physical and biological comfort. We are committed to improve the service conditions and working environment of the women police personnel,” Abhay said.

The top cop said efforts are being made to recruit more women in Odisha police. Of the actual strength of 59,387 police personnel in Odisha, 5,730 are uniformed female police personnel, constituting 9.65 % of the total force. The state government has a 33 % reservation for women in recruitment in Odisha police.

“We are planning to recruit more than 50% women officers in police stations. Currently, there are around 122 women officers, who head police stations in the state. This is the highest in the country,” Abhay said.

Participants in the conference also deliberated on barriers they face in career advancement, sexual harassment at workplace, issues of women sportspersons in police and lack of infrastructure for women employees in police stations.

342,['7/03/2020'],Covid-19: Why it isn’t fit to hit the gym right now,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: With the novel coronavirus gaining ground in the city, Delhiites are concerned about the safety and hygiene in their fitness centres and gyms. Senior municipal public health officials advise citizens, for the time being, to refrain from going into closed spaces such as fitness centres whose surfaces are liable to be contaminated because they are touched constantly by people.

A South Delhi Municipal Corporation official said that it was advisable for people at this time to exercise or jog in the open. “Gyms have equipment whose surfaces are touched by so many people,” the official explained. “We would like the management of these fitness centres to regularly sanitise the premises. In the meantime, people should avoid crowds and exercise in open spaces like parks.” Another health official requested citizens with cold or flu symptoms to keep themselves at home for the sake of others.

The open gym equipment installed in parks, however, may not be safe or free of the coronavirus. The municipal corporations have no provision for disinfecting such equipment.

While those who can afford it are calling trainers home, many have decided to give gyms a break till the situation improves. Pinki Pradhan, a fitness enthusiast in Vasant Kunj, has skipped her gyms sessions since last week. “People are using the same cross-trainers, the same weights. And these are not sterilised,” Pradhan said. “With so many people sweating around me, I feel worried. And though the gym has placed hand sanitisers, I don’t think this can effectively stop infection.”

J K Francis, founder of a fitness group, claimed to be ensuring proper sanitisation of gym equipment before and after exercise sessions. “We have instructed all our trainers to avoid body contacts or touching the equipment,” he added.

Francis opined that in the current circumstances people can do squats and floor exercises at home. “Exercises are necessary because they boost immunity,” he said. “People can go for walks in open areas, though even then they should take precautions.”

Fitness trainers across the globe are suggesting alternative exercises that enthusiasts can do at home. On Thursday, one popular social media influencer, a regular gym goer, took this advice and declared she wouldn’t attend gym sessions before demonstrating the home exertions suggested to her by her trainer.

Khalid, a gym owner in north Delhi’s Mukherjee Nagar, admitted that business has been affected in a major way. He also said that he saw tougher times ahead as this seems to be only the beginning of the coronavirus’ spread in India. “The peak hours used to be in the morning and from 5pm to 9pm. In the last two-three days, things have changed,” Khalid said. “There are hardly any people turning up at the gym throughout the day. We’ve also had no new subscribers.”

Trainer Harish Chandra added, “I work at a gym in Dwarka in south Delhi and attend to at least 30 people every day. But it has been a week since I have been receiving calls from these people requesting me to go to their houses and provide them personal training. Some are asking me to send them personalised videos so that they can exercise at home.”

The World Health Organization (WHO) is working closely with the authorities in Hong Kong, World Organisation for Animal Health and the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization to determine its implication.According to Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical head of WHO’s emergencies programme, having one pet positive doesn’t drive the transmission channel in this outbreak. “We are only aware of this one animal that has tested positive and he is doing well,” Kerkhove said at WHO’s headquarters in Geneva on Thursday. There is no need for any special measure for pets as yet, she added.The current policy of WHO on pets spreading 2019-nCoV states, “At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus.” Its advisory, however, adds that it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after any contact with pets as it protects against various common bacteria such as E.coli and salmonella that can pass between pets and humans.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisory on pets and Covid-19, which was last reviewed on Tuesday, says while this virus seems to have emerged from an animal source (bats), it is now spreading person-to-person in China. “There is no reason to think that any animal, including pets, in the United States might be a source of infection with this new coronavirus. To date, CDC has not received any report of pets or other animals becoming sick with Covid-19. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets, can spread Covid-19,” it states. CDC also advises washing hands after being around animals.What if somebody is sick with Covid-19? CDC says such people should restrict contact with pets and other animals, just like they will do around other people. “Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with Covid-19, it is still recommended that people sick with it limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus.”CDC asks anyone down with Covid-19 to avoid “petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food” with pets. If contact can’t be avoided, “wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a facemask”, the advisory states.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74521848,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-188052,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-19-your-pets-no-need-to-panic-yet/articleshow/74520155.cms

PUNE: State finance minister Ajit Pawar on Friday announced an outlay of Rs 1,400 crore for various programmes, including development of the Shivneri fort in the district, of the tourism and cultural department.

An additional Rs100 crore allocation for the Panchgani-Mahabaleshwar development plan has also been proposed, keeping in mind environmental conservation and responsive tourism at these destinations.

Among other development plans are the Lonar crater in Buldhana, beautification of Murud Janjira beach, renovation and strengthening of three British bridges in Aurangabad, three stream waterfalls in Patan and upping the tourist safety measures in the state’s hill stations.

Sources in the tourism department in Pune said the development plan for Mahabaleshwar, Panchgani and the Shivneri fort was on paper and would receive a major push after the budget announcement. “Among other facilities, a tourism and visitor centre has been planned near the Shivneri fort. There’s a proposal to acquire 2 acre land. The development cost for Shivneri is over Rs820 lakh,” a Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation official said.

Around 15 days ago, the official said, a high-level monitoring committee meeting was held in Mahabaleshwar. “It was then decided to tweak the Tourism Master Plan for Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani Eco Sensitive Zone. The plan was earlier drawn up for the two destinations. The plan will be updated in accordance with the current situation in Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani,” the official said.

“Efforts are needed for complete re-orientation of the existing tourism products in Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani into those of new sustainable tourism. Villages such as Malsure, Taldeo, Hatlot, Hiroshi and Adhal have been proposed to be developed to fulfil the purpose of ecotourism,” he said.

“A method for dispersal of tourists to lesser known spots, such as Wai, Bannoli, Tapola, Mandhardevi and Mayani bird sanctuary, has also been suggested. The aim is to reduce the tourist pressure on the already burdened spots in Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani,” the official said.

Another tourism department official said a development plan of around Rs40 crore was in place for Lonar crater. The plan includes creating tourist amenities, such as toilets and roads for the visitors.

Backed by leisure and corporate travellers, Singapore and Bangkok have emerged as most desired international destinations to get air linked from Indore, claimed Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI), MP and CG chapter.

Industry and travel agent's associations are in talks with three leading air carriers to explore potential of international connectivity from Indore. Praveen Agrawal, ex-chairman, CII, Madhya Pradesh, “Initially a lot of impetus was to start Dubai flight from Indore. Now Singapore and Bangkok have come on the list of respondents that will help in connecting the eastern world and Indore has a lot of potential to generate air traffic.”

A feedback collected from industrialists and stakeholders from tourism, education establishments among others showed encouraging demand for direct international air connectivity from Indore to Singapore and Bangkok, said CII and TAAI, MP and CG.

According to CII, Indore has potential to generate an estimated 1.5 lakh international passengers every year led by leisure travellers, corporates, academic institutes and flyers from nearby cities and bordering areas.

In estimated international traffic, leisure travellers is anticipated to contribute around 50 per cent, corporates 20 per cent and others 30 per cent, said CII.

Vast wild cover, wild life, heritage sites and agriculture belts will play as catalyst for outbound international tourists, said CII.

Agrawal said, “Now as Dubai flight has been repeated in winter and summer schedules, we have started approaching other air carriers. State and airport are ready in all aspects and now the new carriers have to get seat allocation.”

Airlines have raised concerns over seat allocation and that is being worked upon, claimed CII. Though some industry officials said outbreak of Coronavirus may push back talks of introducing new flights from city.

Hemendra Singh Jadon, chairman, Travel Agents Association of India, MP and CG, chapter said, “Dubai flight is doing well and looking at the number of flyers from Indore opting flights from Mumbai or Delhi, we are pressing for Singapore and Dubai destinations. Airlines are already in talks and gauging local air traffic and largely targeting business and students' class.”

BHUBANESWAR: The SUM Hospital in Bhubaneswar with the help of Yashoda Hospitals in Hyderabad performed the state’s first successful liver transplant on a 55-year-old teacher. His 19-year-old son donated the organ.

Directorate of Medical Education and Training (DMET) director CBK Mohanty confirmed that it was the first liver transplantation in the state.

“We performed the transplant on Thursday starting from 3pm and continued till midnight,” said Manoj Kumar Sahu, head of the gastroenterology department of Institute of Medical Sciences and SUM Hospital, SOA deemed to be university.

The teacher, Jayanta Biswal, a native of Kantiatikar village under Oupada block in Balasore district, works as a primary schoolteacher at Pandesara in Surat of Gujarat. He has been suffering from liver ailment since 2016.

Jayanta had been suffering from cryptogenic cirrhosis of liver and it was decided to conduct the transplant to save his life, a doctor said. Cirrhosis of liver is the end stage liver disease with an invariably progressive course.

Sahu said both the receiver and donor were kept under observation in the ICU. They are doing fine after nine-hour marathon surgery on them. The receiver will be in ICU for five to seven days before being shifted to ward. But the donor will be discharged after six days. “We took right lobe of liver from Jayanta’s son Saumya Ranjan, a bachelor of commerce student, and transplanted it in receiver’s body. Saumya’s liver will regenerate itself within three months,” said Sahu.

Pusparaj Samantasinhar, medical superintendent of IMS and SUM Hospital, said the first such procedure conducted in SUM was done for free. Such transplant surgeries cost anything between Rs 20 lakh and 25 lakh in other hospitals but it can be done at Rs 10 lakh in SUM, he added.

Samantasinhar said his hospital had signed a memorandum of understanding with Yashoda Hospitals one and half years ago for undertaking liver transplantation in SUM Hospital. “We had also received due approval from the statutory authorities of the state to conduct both live and cadaveric transplantation,” he added.

He said gastro-intestinal surgeons, anesthetists, nurses and paramedics from his hospital had visited Yashoda Hospitals for training. “We first started liver donor transplantation because the patient needed an immediate transplant. We will also conduct cadaveric transplantation in the coming days,” he added.

“Most of the hospitals in and outside Odisha advised me for liver transplantation of my husband. I could not decide for the transplantation because they were asking me between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 25 lakh for this. I requested SUM Hospital for help. They took initiative and performed the transplant for free,” said Jayanta’s wife Anita.

P Balachandran Menon, chief liver transplant surgeon from Yashoda Hospitals assisted by his hospital colleague G V Prem Kumar, director, Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, along with gastroenterologists Manoj Kumar Sahu and Premananda Pattnaik of SUM Hospital led the 40-member team during the surgery.

SUM Hospital had conducted the state's first Bone Marrow Transplantation on January 27, 2013. Several BMT had been conducted by the hospital since then.

Dr Saurabh Srivastava, who runs a private clinic on Bistan Road at Khargone, claims that he has recently removed a tooth of an engineering student measuring a 39 mm which is the longest so far.

He said that the record as of 2017 was held by a doctor based in Vadodara who had extracted a 36.7 mm long tooth. The record was broken by a German dentist Dr Max Lukas who removed a 37.2 mm long tooth. Till 2009, 32 mm was the longest tooth pulled by a Singapore dentist.

He said, “A 20-year-old engineering student named Pawan Bhawsar came to me with aesthetic concerns, had a lot of problems due to big teeth and he had been hurt many times following recurrent traumatic ulcers occurring in labial mucosa which could have led to cancer.” He said, “I examined it thoroughly and found that he has giant maxillary canines in healthy condition, highly placed in the buckle vestibule. I advised him orthodontics treatment which could have lasted for two years, but he refused,” he added.

Because of this, I decided to remove two teeth with the consent of the student. To everyone’s surprise, the first tooth measured around 39 mm as normal canines are a maximum of 28 to 30 mm long. The second tooth which was removed was about 36 mm long.

He said that Pawan’s height was 6 feet 6 inches and his other family members were taller than average as well.

Dr Shrivastava said that the tooth was measured by various means and cross-checked by seniors dentists at the district hospital. “I am now submitting my claim to the Guinness Book of World Records with proof,” he said.

Khargone district hospital resident medical officer Dr Dilip Septa told TOI, “After watching the unbelievably long tooth, I measured it along with the curvature and it seemed to be the longest. Then I advised him to apply for the Guinness Book Of World Records.”

Dental Council Of India, Madhya Pradesh registrar Dr Amit Rawat told TOI that he was happy that Dr Shrivastava was able to successfully extract such a huge canine without breaking it.

He congratulated Dr Shrivastava and said that the exact length could have been measured by diagnostic CBCT but the gauged length seems to be quite correct. TNN

AHMEDABAD: The decision by city-based SH Kharawala, AG & LD Primary School (SHKAGLDPS) to double the fees of primary-level students created a strong backlash from parents on Friday.

What seems to have put the school in a tight spot is that the hike comes at a time when the Fee Regulatory Committee (FRC), Ahmedabad’s decision on A G School’s fee revision proposal is still pending. The school, which is under the aegis of Ahmedabad Education Society , has submitted a proposal for the next three years from 2020-22.

The district education officer (DEO), Ahmedabad, R C Patel, has issued show-cause notice to the school authorities and a hearing has been fixed on Thursday.

“This is gross violation of the FRC law. As a rule, the school needs FRC clearance for any revision in the fees. The school has announced 100% hike in the annual fees from Rs 20,000 to Rs 40,000. We have strongly condemned the decision,” said Himanshu Patel , a parent of a class V student.

The school issued a circular to the parents announcing a 100% hike in the fees for Class I to Class VIII. The parents were asked to pay the fees in four parts, amounting to Rs 10,000 per quarter. The school also threatened to cancel the admission of students who failed the pay the revised fee amount.

A large number of parents gathered at the school campus on Friday to protest. They approached authorities who claimed that the fees would be later adjusted in accordance with the FRC decision and any extra amount would be refunded, said sources.

“We feel that this is a stunt by the school authorities to create panic for reasons best known to them. The school officials are not willing to even disclose how much fee hike they have proposed before the committee,” said a parent who took part in Friday’s protest.

DEO Patel said that they have received many complaints from parents about the fee hike by the school. “We have issued notice to the school authorities and a hearing will be held on Thursday. After this, we will decide what necessary steps need to be taken to resolve the matter,” said Patel.

358,['7/03/2020'],"Coronavirus scare: Bhutan shuts doors on foreigners, 1,200 tourists cross over to West Bengal","The gateway to Phuentsholing

KOLKATA/SILIGURI: Bhutan on Friday slammed its doors on foreign tourists, including Indians, to shield the Himalayan kingdom from the Covid-19 that has so far infiltrated 93 countries. Coming a day after Sikkim announced a ban on foreign tourists, including Bhutan nationals, the move has delved yet another blow to the tottering travel trade industry.

Around 150 tourists from Kolkata travel by flight daily to Bhutan. Another 350-odd enter through Phuentsholing, bordering Darjeeling. On Friday, around 1,200 tourists crossed over to Darjeeling across this border following the ban on foreigners.

Bhutan said on Friday it had banned the entry of tourists for two weeks after it confirmed the first coronavirus case in a tourist who arrived from India. The 79-year-old American had flown in on March 2 and had thereafter tested positive for Covid-19.

“The government will impose a two-week restriction on all incoming tourists with immediate effect,” the health ministry said in a statement on Friday morning.

However, by the time the order was made public, the Bhutan Airlines flight to Paro from Kolkata had taken off with 70 passengers. There were apprehensions that foreigners would be sent back in another flight. But the passengers were allowed in after thermal screening.

While Bhutan Airlines is set to cancel daily flight operations, Druk Air, which also operates a daily flight, is yet to firm up its plan. A source said that while the Airbus A319 may be operated for a few days to evacuate tourists who are already in the country, it would make little sense to continue with it and Druk Air could fly the ATR that has a smaller capacity.

Tour operators in the region have set up helpdesks and circulated emergency numbers for tourists stranded in Sikkim and Bhutan. State tourism minister Gautam Deb said the government would extend help if a tourist is stuck anywhere. “We had a word with tour operators and have instructed them to take proper care of tourists,” he said.

Himalayan Hospitality & Tourism Development general secretary Samrat Sanyal is hopeful the curbs will be lifted after a fortnight. “That will save the peak tourist season. Otherwise, there will be major cancellations,” he said.

On Friday, travel agents managed to stave off cancellation requests for holidays booked beyond two weeks. But they aren’t sure how long they can ask the customers to wait. “We are trying to tell tourists to travel within India as there are no curbs yet except for travel to Nathu La,” said Sanyal.

The peak tourist season begins in April and continues till June.

This model village school had few takers 7 years ago

PUNE: A rather brusque notice outside this zilla parishad (ZP) school at Wablewadi village reads: “Admissions are full. Please do not enquire.” But that still doesn’t stop people from trying to get a seat for their wards here.For, the school has gone from having two crumbling classrooms seven years ago to a fully renovated set-up now, replete with 3D printers in its lab, a tablet in the hands of each student and solar panels outside to generate electricity. The clamour for admissions here far outstrips that for CBSE schools. On an average, the school turns away at least five sets of parents each day.The school, located in Shirur sub-division, around 50km from Pune city, has 600 pupils studying up to Class 9 and a waiting list of over 4,000 applicants stretching three years. Visitors stream in from across the country to sample the school’s functioning, but there’s a waiting list here too — all Saturdays until April are full.After visiting the school in December, the state’s chief secretary had written to all schools in Maharashtra urging them to replicate the model. In his budget speech on Friday, state finance minister Ajit Pawar called the school the “best in the state” and allocated Rs 500 crore for building at least four such schools in every taluka of Maharashtra.The first bell is an hour away at 10am, but a group of Class 7 students have already gathered around their assignment for the day — an old scooter.“Our Sir brought this abandoned scooter to the school and told us that whoever opens it should be able to put it back and make it work,” says a student. Within minutes, the excited children have picked the scooter apart using tools from the school’s laboratory.The story of change began in 2012 when Dattatray Ware joined the school as its second teacher. Back then, it had 32 students from Class1to 4. “The two classrooms in the decrepit structure would leak during the rains. The school was one of the worst in the region — hardly anyone wanted their children to study there,” says Tejaswi Pawar, a resident of a nearby village.Ware went about his work, starting with boosting academic performance and general behaviour among students. Parents were soon convinced and asked if they could help.“The school needed money and labour for an overhaul. I called a gram sabha, spoke for two hours and, at the end of it, villagers had pitched in with Rs 4 lakh,” Ware says. He made the school’s management committee open a bank account and deposited the money there.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74522214,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-787153,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/states-best-school-had-few-takers-for-admissions-7-yrs-ago/articleshow/74520182.cms

Sharma’s office is in Navrangpura and that is where he received the call. After giving his details to the caller, Sharma ended up losing Rs 32,461 from his account.

In his FIR, Sharma stated the he had first told the caller that he won’t update his KYC over the phone and had then disconnected the call. However, the man called him again and warned him that his Paytm account will be closed. At that time, the charge in Sharma’s cellphone battery dropped, forcing him to call the man from another phone. Sharma then told him that he will follow his advice.

The person told Sharma that he will receive a UPI ID on which he will have to pay 1 Re. When Sharma did the transaction, the caller took remote control of Sharma’s phone and withdrew Rs 32,461 from his account.

“Following Dang’s resignation, local party workers and office-bearers organized a meeting to discuss his decision and decided further course of action,” said Suwasra block Congress president Parmeshwar Patidar. He added that participants unanimously decided to urge Dang to reconsider his decision while a letter has also been written to chief minister and other senior leaders of the party requesting them not to approve the MLA’s resignation. “Congress should constitute a high-level committee to resolve public-centric issues raised by Dang and he should also be given a ministerial post,” the letter read.

Local Congress workers also slammed BJP’s attempt to destabilize Kamal Nath government, Patidar told TOI.

During the day, Dang’s father Sharan Singh talked to media and said, “The MLA is a well-educated person and whatever he is doing is right.” He added that Dang was unhappy over delay in distributing compensation to flood-affected people of Mandsaur.

“We are not in contact with him but are not worried (about his whereabouts) as we are getting regular updates about him through news channels,” he said.

The MLA’s father added that his son can better tell the reason behind his resignation.

Meanwhile, local BJP workers and party leaders have welcomed Dang’s resignation and celebrated it at different places. They also slammed Congress government for showing apathy towards the only Congress MLA of Mandsaur-Neemuch district.

Special medical camps are also being held for officials. The Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port Trust (SPMPT), meanwhile, will continue to screen all seamen arriving at the ports of Haldia, Kolkata and Budge Budge.

“The measures are important as many employees are constantly on the move and come in contact with people who may be carriers. There will also be announcements at stations to create awareness among passengers. ‘Dos and don’ts’ stickers will also be pasted inside trains,” a railway official said. While it may not be possible to screen all rail passengers, officials have been directed to keep a lookout for people displaying symptoms either on trains and at stations and isolate them.

SPMPT medical teams, meanwhile, have screened over 6,500 seamen aboard nearly 400 ships. Many seamen have been denied shore leave though they are not displaying symptoms. Till date, only one sailor from a ship that anchored at Budge Budge was sent for tests to ID Hospital. His test results were negative.

“We started scanning all ships from the start. While ships coming from China, South Korea, Iran and other countries are being checked even before they enter the port confines, those arriving from other places are being screened at the ports. There is 100% screening on our part,” a SPMPT official said.

On Friday, Turkish Airlines offered exactly that with a 75 minute layover in Istanbul. Generally in March, Mumbai-London return fares on direct flights would cost over Rs 80,000 just 24 hours in advance.On Friday, you could have also booked a Delhi to New York flight, fly out with a cabin bag and land in the US before Saturday midnight (local time) and return after Holi for as little as Rs 58,000. In March any other year, such a last-minute trip would cost over Rs 80,000.In the “extraordinary circumstances” that international airlines find themselves in, under the cloud of Covid-19, even dirt cheap fares are finding only few takers. So, when a Singapore flight took off from Mumbai this week, the 256-seater plane had just 25 passengers. Similarly, a London-Mumbai flight landed in the city with only 60 passengers in economy class. The coronavirus outbreak has hit airline bottomlines like nothing has in the past two decades since 9/11, say industry insiders.Besides East Asian destinations, flights to West Asia, such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi, have also been hit severely. On Friday, a Mumbai or Delhi resident could have booked a return flight to Dubai or Abu Dhabi for travel this weekend at Rs 13,200.On Friday, TOI found cheap return airfares for travel the next day (Saturday) and return, say next Wednesday. From Mumbai, fares were low for trips to Paris (Rs 40,000 on GulfAir with a two-hour layover in Bahrain), Istanbul (non-stop for Rs 42,000), Berlin (Rs 59,000 on SwissAir with a one-hour layover) and Zurich (Rs 47,000 on Turkish Airlines with four-hour layover in Istanbul). From Delhi, fares were low for trips to Moscow (Rs 32,500 on Aeroflot) and Paris (Rs 48,000 on AI, Rs 38,000 on LOT Polish Airlines with a four-hour layover in Warsaw ). “Depending on the destination, a last-minute airfare to Europe would cost between Rs 65,000 and Rs 90,000 this time of the year,’’ said a travel agent.“An economy class return fare on direct flight from London to Mumbai, bought just 24 hours in advance this time of the year would cost anything over Rs 80,000. What's on offer now is the lowest sub-class of fare,’’ said the agent. On Friday though, the cheapest fare on direct flights to London from Mumbai was Rs 53,000 and from Delhi was Rs 58,000, both on Air India.Like many airlines the world over, Air India too has begun curtailing flights.

NEW DELHI: Saniya, a student of Modern School, walked out of her board examination centre with a mask on her face on Friday. And she was not alone. With the board examinations being held at a time when the entire city is in the grip of the coronavirus scare , students of Classes X and XII have to carry extra items to their exam centres in the form of masks and hand sanitisers, apart from notes, hall tickets and other stationery items.

“My mom was insistent that I wear a mask. It is uncomfortable, but it is also important to wear it these days,” said Saniya.

Several candidates, who walked to appear for the board exams, were seen wearing masks on Friday. Recently, CBSE permitted its students to wear masks and carry sanitisers to the exam centres in the wake of the coronavirus threat.

“So many things are happening during the board exam this year. After confusion over the dates due to the riots, now there is the coronavirus outbreak. I hope no student appearing for the board exam catches this,” said Harshita, a student of a government school in east Delhi.

A centre supervisor said that most of the candidates have been writing exams wearing a mask. “We have also told our invigilators to take precautionary measures,” said the principal of a government school.

The Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) has also issued an advisory to all the centre heads. “In light of the ongoing board examination, the centre heads are requested to make available hand sanitisers, soap and water at the examination centres located in the schools,” it reads.

However, a few students kept their masks in the bags and did not wear them as instructed by their parents. A few others had handkerchief tied around their faces.

CHENNAI: M Mohammed Rafiq has literally been giving voice to his dreams by conning people with his mimicry skill. The 50-year-old small-time hotelier from M K B Nagar, who successfully cheated victims by mimicking ministers S P Velumani and Sellur K Raju and former Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan in 2014 and 2017, ran out of luck on Friday as he tried to imitate fisheries minister D Jayakumar over phone and attempted to dupe a city businessman.

Rafiq landed in police net after Duraisamy, managing director of a private firm in Guindy, approached police over a suspicious call from minister Jayakumar’s office demanding Rs 80,000 for celebrating former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s birth anniversary.

According to police, Duraisamy received repeated calls to his office on Tuesday claiming that minister Jayakumar wanted to talk to him. Since he was not in office, his staff took the caller’s mobile number. When the businessman called back, the man on the other end introduced himself as the minister, and asked him to ‘donate’ Rs 80,000 for Amma’s birth anniversary celebration.

After much haggling, Duraisamy agreed to pay Rs 30,000. The caller gave him a bank account number to transfer the money. Since the account was in the name of Mohammed Rafiq, Duraisamy got suspicious and called up the minister’s office only to find that the ‘minister’ who had asked for donation was an imposter.

Duraisamy lodged a complaint and a Guindy police team nabbed the caller with the help of his mobile number.

Interrogation of the accused, who runs a fast food hotel in M K B Nagar, revealed that he had indulged in more than 15 such cases, and had been detained twice under the Goondas Act. In 2014, the Gandhipuram police in Coimbatore had arrested him for using minister Velumani’s name. In October 2017, he was arrested again for mimicking former union minister Pon Radhakrishnan’s voice and conning a businessman in Anna Nagar of Rs 20 lakh by promising to give him a coal mining contract in Chennai Port. He took the sum in person introducing himself as PA to Pon Radhakrishnan.

Rafiq, who was also arrested in Madurai for mimicking minister Sellur Raju, has pending cases in Nagapattinam, Virudhunagar and Vellore. The Guindy police have booked him on charges of impersonation and extortion and remanded him in judicial custody.

376,['7/03/2020'],Delhi: How a policy change is behind your bumpy ride,"The entities digging up roads are not releasing the money for road restoration to the road-owning agencies in ... Read More

NEW DELHI: While Delhi Jal Board completed the laying of pipes in south Delhi’s South Extension D Block last month, the road there has turned into a trap for unwary users. Sand was used to fill up the dug-up portions and has sunk in the rains, causing vehicles to become stuck in the depressions.

“The sand hardened in the few days of sunshine, but when it began raining, potholes appeared,” said a resident of D Block South Extension-II. The road near O Block in Chittaranjan Park also lies in a state of disrepair. However, these places aren’t the only ones facing road problems.

Bhupender Gupta, chairperson of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s standing committee, himself confirmed such problems. “In my ward alone, 80% of the roads are affected,” he claimed. “The problem is that the entities digging up the roads are not releasing the money for road restoration to the road-owning agencies in time. We estimate that more than Rs 100 crore in such costs are owed to SDMC alone.”

The change made in 2017-18 to the road restoration policy is being blamed for the current mess. “In the previous regime, road-cutting agencies like DJB, Indraprastha Gas Ltd, MTNL and BSNL sought no-objection certificates from road-owning agencies for digging roads to lay pipelines or wires. They had to deposit the road-repair fee before starting the work,” a PWD official explained.

The new policy approved by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal in 2018 changed the process and required merely intimation to the civic authorities rather than an NOC. The contractors undertaking the digging, it is alleged, are negligent about the need to restore the roads. Even when repairs are carried out, the claim is that sub-standard materials are used. “The poor quality of the restoration frequently results in cave-ins and easily eroded patches,” said an engineering department official.

A DJB official contended, “Under the new road digging policy, we intimate the road-owning agency about the project. Sometimes, we repair the road ourselves, but mostly the restoration is carried out by the road-owning agency though we pay the repair charges. We try to get the roads repaired as soon as possible.” He, however, added that there sometimes were practical and administrative difficulties in releasing the road-restoration fees.

A PWD official remonstrated that the problem lay with the entities like DJB and IGL who have become lax about paying the money required of them to restore the roads they dig. “Bodies like DJB are notorious. Sometimes when permission is granted to them for just 30 days, they keep working for months altogether,” the official said. “This leaves us with no option but to keep delaying the repair because our work can start only when they finish theirs.”

A state government official maintained that the new policy was the best possible solution to the regular tussles between road-digging and road-owning parties over the quantum of restoration fee.

378,['7/03/2020'],"After 10-yr wait, 100 AC buses join cluster fleet","New Delhi: After a decade, new airconditioned buses hit the roads of Delhi on Friday. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal flagged off 100 low-floor, airconditioned blue buses under the Cluster scheme while 300 more will come by June.

The last time Delhi inducted airconditioned buses was at the time of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Till now the city had 1,275 airconditioned buses, all run by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC).

“I’m very happy that today 100 more low-floor AC buses have been brought on the streets of Delhi under the Cluster scheme. In the past few months, many buses have hit Delhi’s roads and I have been told that AC buses have been procured in Delhi after 10 years,” Kejriwal said in the presence of transport minister Kailash Gahlot. “Some people were saying that buses were arriving only for the elections. I would like to tell them that buses are arriving after elections too,” Kejriwal added.

After Friday’s induction, the capital now has a cumulative 6,293 DTC and Cluster buses. The CM assured that by next year, the number of buses would touch 9,000. “Delhi’s transport sector will be made an example for the entire country. It will be a model and modern transport system and we are working day and night for that,” Kejriwal said, adding that since the formation of the new government, he had held several meetings on the transport sector.

The government also plans to induct 1,000 electric buses under the Cluster scheme, but a tender for 300 buses has failed. “The tender for electric buses failed for some reasons. By March-end, a tender will be issued again and buses will start arriving in the next few months,” the chief minister said.

The new AC buses, with 37 seats each, have been manufactured by JBM Group and are painted blue to distinguish these from the non-AC orange Cluster buses. The buses are equipped with features like fire-detection systems, remote-monitoring systems, GPS trackers, panic buttons, CCTVs, and hydraulic lifts and wheelchair ramps.

“JBM CITYLIFE low-floor AC buses focus on women’s safety and each vehicle is fitted with six CCTV cameras along with panic and safety buttons,” said Nishant Arya, executive director of JBM Group. “The buses will also have wheelchair ramps, mobile charging points and cantilever mounted seats for more storage space,” he added. There will also be pink seats reserved for women.

The routes on which these buses will ply are Kendriya Terminal to Shahdara, New Seemapuri, Nand Nagri, Sultanpuri Terminal, Mayur Vihar phases I and III; Sarai Kale Khan ISBT to Shalimar Bagh and Karampura; Nizammudin Station to Azadpur Terminal, New Seemapuri and Uttam Nagar Terminal; Kamla Market/Ajmeri Gate to Trilokpuri 31-Block and Mehrauli Terminal; and Shivaji Stadium to Shahdara and Najafgarh terminals.

380,['7/03/2020'],HC reserves judgment in Auli wedding case,"Representative image

NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Friday reserved its judgment after the arguments in Public Interest Litigation (PIL), alleging ecological damage done as a result of the lavish weddings in Auli, were completed.

The high-profile weddings of sons of South Africa-based businessmen were performed at Auli from June 18 to 22. The weddings, however, have been mired in controversy after activists alleged that the event caused substantial damage to the sensitive environment of the hill town of Auli which is located in the upper reaches of the Himalayas.

The Bench of Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia and Justice NS Dhanik was hearing the PIL filed by local lawyer Rakshit Joshi . Joshi has alleged in his petition that the weddings caused not only severe but irreparable damage to the meadows of the only ski town in the state. “The lavish weddings of the sons of the businessmen have damaged the very sensitive ecology of Auli. The weddings not only caused ecological damage but the entire town was littered with waste and human faeces which was finally disposed of by the administration,” Joshi said.

The Gupta brothers have already paid an amount of around Rs 50 lakh as compensation for the damage and the losses incurred by both the administration and nagar palika. However, the HC is now expected to deliver some guidelines for holding such events in the future. “The weddings damaged the meadows in Auli and therefore we have appealed to the court to lay down guidelines for the state so that if any lavish events were to take place in the upper reaches of Himalayas, the state could make the hosting party adhere to the norms and to also penalise them if damage was caused to the environment,” Joshi said.

The state, meanwhile, has argued that there are no bugyals (meadows) in Auli and that such events are a major contributor to tourism activity for the state which is the backbone of its economy.

381,['7/03/2020'],"Speeches ‘harmless’, being browbeaten: Mander to SC","New Delhi: Faced with judicial scrutiny of his speeches allegedly deriding the authority of Parliament and the Supreme Court, social activist Harsh Mander on Friday engaged senior advocates Dushyant Dave and Rajeev Dhavan who said the speeches were “harmless” and attempts were being made to “browbeat” him. The court asked Mander’s counsel to file a response and adjourned the hearing to April 15.

Moments after solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant that Delhi Police had found yet another speech of Mander similar to the earlier one in which he was seen telling Jamia Millia Islamia students that the country’s future would be decided not by Parliament or the Supreme Court but on the streets, Dave said it was an extract of the speech made to look objectionable.

“Please go through the entire speech. I have gone through it and can say with all the authority at my command that it is neither contemptuous, seditious nor malicious. The filing of the application by Delhi Police against Mander is an attempt to browbeat him. The govt is trying to shoot the messenger. He is being put in the dock for nothing,” Dave said.

“I have gone through the entire speech word by word and can say that there is nothing in it that would bring the Supreme Court into disrepute. I will be the last person who will allow anyone to bring this court into disrepute,” he added.

A quick repartee from Mehta — “you are usually the first person to do so” — fired up Dave who challenged the SG by saying, “If that is what you think, the solicitor can bring a contempt of court case against me. I challenge you.”

As the arguments became louder with the intervention of Dhavan on behalf of Mander in addition to counsel Karuna Nundy, Mehta opposed a single client engaging so many counsel and cited the one client-one counsel rule. But the irrepressible Dhavan brushed aside Mehta’s objections and said, “Initiation of suo motu contempt proceedings is a rare phenomenon in the Supreme Court. That arena is not for the court to enter in this case.”

Finding that the arguments were getting shriller without Mander filing a reply affidavit, the bench asked Dave whether he had filed a response to Delhi Police affidavit accusing Mander of giving the contemptuous speech. The CJI said, “We do not appreciate counsel interrupting us and not allowing us to complete a sentence.” The bench then adjourned the hearing to April 15.

On February 4, the SC had refused to hear Mander’s petition seeking registration of FIR against BJP functionaries who raised “desh ke gaddaron ko...” slogans and had asked him to respond to Delhi Police’s allegation that he had given a speech deriding the authority of Parliament and the SC. “We will not hear you till this issue is sorted out,” the SC had said.

383,['7/03/2020'],Uttarakhand high court to hear Harish Rawat sting operation case on May 1,"File photo of Harish Rawat

NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Friday deferred the hearing in the sting operation case of former chief minister Harish Rawat to May 1. The sting allegedly found Rawat to be involved in horse-trading of MLAs while the state was under presidential rule.

The deferring came after assistant solicitor general Rakesh Thapliyal informed the single judge bench of Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia that counsel appearing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) could not be present in the court due to unavoidable reasons. “The government informed the court that the CBI’s counsel couldn’t be present on Friday therefore the case should be deferred. The court then set May 1 as the next date of hearing,” said a source close to Rawat.

As reported by TOI earlier, the CBI has booked Rawat along with present cabinet minister Harak Singh Rawat and CEO of news channel in alleged horse trading of MLAs when the state was under presidential rule. A sting operation of Rawat had surfaced in March 2016 where he was allegedly found to be trying to buy MLAs. Under the governor’s rule, a CBI inquiry was ordered in the case.

However, the Congress government which was reinstated after the orders from HC and Supreme Court (SC), tasked a SIT to investigate the matter and withdrew the consent given to the CBI to investigate. Rawat has challenged the legality of this FIR.

The government, however, has argued that once an inquiry has been ordered by the governor it cannot be taken back. In October, the HC allowed the CBI to file an FIR against Rawat but prevented it from arresting him. An FIR was later filed October 24 in which Harak Singh Rawat and the owner of a private channel was also named. Meanwhile, the HC in February this year, further said that the CBI should inform the court before filing a chargesheet in the case.

On the fifth day of the festival, Mooji Baba, a Jamaican spiritual teacher, conducted a special spiritual session and Dr Madan Kataria, a medical doctor from Mumbai who is popularly referred to as the “Guru of Giggling”, held a session for participants. Like the previous four days of the festival, Friday also started with “Ganga Aarti” in the morning.

Tim Jonas, 38, who has come from Poland to attend the festival, told TOI, “There is hardly any event in the world which is attended by revered gurus like Yogini Usha Mata, Mooji Baba, Shri Shri Ravi Shankar, BK Shivani, Gaur Gopal Das, Swami Atma Swaroop, and others. We have been blessed to be a part of this week-long yog festival.”

The festival was launched by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat along with his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath on March 1. Since then, the festival has been welcoming around 3,000 visitors (on an average) every day.

“The response has been very good. The yoga and spiritual knowledge seekers are thronging the festival to attain physical fitness and mental peace and we are successfully delivering on their expectations,” said Dileep Jawalkar, secretary of tourism department.

The festival has so far been attended by several prominent personalities, including Shri Shri Ravi Shankar, Juna akhara's Avdheshanand Giri, former South African cricket star Jonty Rhodes, Grand Master Akshar, and others.

The event offers yoga, spiritual sessions, medical therapies, ancient therapeutic healing like gong bath, and musical evenings — all under one roof.

Iva Ashish Shrivastava, MD of GMVN, said, “We want yoga to be a self-sustainable model. This event is already bearing fabulous results. We are confident that in the coming years, yoga will be seen as a treatment for physical and mental issues. Also, yoga will provide job opportunities to many.”

On Saturday, the concluding day of the festival, visitors will get to enjoy a musical performance by renowned singer Anuradha Paudwal and a special spiritual session by Yogini Usha Mata.

385,['7/03/2020'],"Vidarbha ignored in MVA’s 1st budget, Pawar puts focus back on Mum, Pune","Mumbai: The Maha Vikas Aghadi’s first budget turned out to be a big disappointment for Vidarbha, Marathwada and North Maharashtra regions, as it was loaded towards western Maharashtra. In his entire speech, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar failed to mention Vidarbha even once.

The opposition led by leader Devendra Fadnavis lashed out at the Maha Vikas Aghadi government for its failure to allocate substantial funds to backward regions like Vidarbha, Marathwada and North Maharashtra.

Without naming places, Fadnavis claimed that only two cities (Mumbai and Pune, strongholds of CM Uddhav Thackeray and Pawar) had benefited in the budget.

“It’s totally a disappointing budget as Vidarbha, Marathwada and North Maharashtra are entirely neglected. No new schemes too have been proposed in entire budget,” he said.

Former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar didn’t mince words while saying Pawar allocated an agriculture college to Sakoli — the constituency of speaker Nana Patole, but neglected the paddy farmers of Vidarbha. “The government has miserably failed to maintain regional balance. In our tenure, we had controlled deficit and had a surplus amount at the end,” he said.

The region had enjoyed the best of the budget under Fadnavis and Mungantiwar.

Accusing the MVA government of misleading the people, leader of opposition in council Pravin Darekar said there was nothing new in the budget. “After initially flaying the one-time settlement scheme for farmers brought by BJP government, now they have reintroduced it. They’re also showing training programme of 11 months as employment,” he said.

Denying their allegations, Thackeray and Pawar said the budget was made for the entire state and not for any particular region. “We’re happy that we have completed our 100 days and presented put first budget on the same day. It's inclusive of education, health, water and sanitation. In spite of global recession and threats due to coronavirus, this budget would show the way for the next five years of the government,” said Thackeray.

Pawar shot back on opposition claims pointing out that Rs200 crore has been allocated for Marathwada water grid. “The loan waivers offered to farmers would benefit everyone from the state. Similarly, the benefits of crop insurance scheme would be applicable to all. All social welfare scheme would be applicable for citizens across the state,” he clarified.

WHAT’S IN IT FOR VIDARBHA

386,['7/03/2020'],Two-day drive for quicker disbursal of claims to riot victims: Manish Sisodia,"The govt has received 1,700 compensation forms from the victims so far

NEW DELHI: To ensure faster verification of documents and quick disbursal of compensation to the riot victims, Delhi government will run a special two-day drive under the supervision of senior IAS officers, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Friday. The disbursements are likely to begin from Monday.

“We want to complete the verification process at the earliest so that full compensation is released to the affected families,” Sisodia said. He also visited the Eidgah relief camp and interacted with the victims. The government has identified about 700 properties — shops and houses — completely or partially burned by the rampaging mobs. A trade body estimated the loss at Rs 25,000 crore.

Sisodia said six senior IAS officers assisted by sub-divisional magistrates would look after the verification process. The government has, so far, received 1,700 compensation forms from the victims. “We are facing the issue of duplication. Some people filled up and deposited compensation forms at more than one place. The verification drive will be an important exercise to closely scrutinise each form. Our effort is to give full monetary relief to the people as soon as possible so that they can get their lives back on track,” Sisodia said.

The government has already released almost Rs 1 crore — Rs 1 lakh to the families of deceased and Rs 25,000 to the injured and towards damage to properties — as immediate cash relief.

Delhi government has so far given interim relief of over Rs2.15 crore to 209 people whose houses were burnt, 29 families who lost their kin and 45 who received serious injuries, said an official.

Sisodia said each floor of a house would be treated as one residential unit and get Rs 5 lakh as relief, which included Rs 4 lakh for restructuring of the house and Rs 1 lakh for the belongings if the entire house was burned. In case of substantial damage, Rs 2.5 lakh will be provided. “Monetary relief of Rs 5 lakh will be given to schools with less than 1,000 students, while those with more than that, will get a cash relief of Rs 10 lakh,” he said.

Sisodia said the government had also held parent-teacher meetings on March 4 and 5 in the riot-affected schools to encourage people to start sending their kids to school again. It witnessed a turnout of about 55%.

Meanwhile, environment minister Gopal Rai said about 90% of the riot victims had already filled up the compensation forms. “About 20 teams of AAP volunteers have been working on the ground. The remaining 10% whose forms have not been filled up seem to have been shifted elsewhere,” Rai said.

After visiting the riot-affected areas, Rai said some people had been finding it difficult to register FIRs for their loss of property or injury. He said had spoken to SHOs and DCPs of the police stations concerned to accelerate the process.

388,['7/03/2020'],Artist’s brush adds a dash of colour to abstract paintings,"Three-day solo painting exhibition ‘Euphoria’ by Prakash Betawar got under way at Darda Art Gallery, Wardha Ro... Read More

Nagpur: Fine strokes of brush drawing multi-colour layers with blue in the background, blended well with various hues, gave a breathtaking view and caught the eye of art lovers at ‘Euphoria’, an exhibition of paintings, at Darda Art Gallery, Wardha Road.

The three-day exhibition of artist Prakash Betawar, that got under way on Friday, gives a fine example of abstract painting made with a degree of independence from visual references in the world and a glimpse of beautiful texture. A total of 90 paintings are on display, each one different and creative from the other.

Sharing his thoughts, Betawar said, “Abstract paintings allow an artist to play with colours, imagination and bring them on the canvas. These paintings are abstract, and each one is colourful and vibrant.”

Each painting tells a story as the colours used are deep, bold and catchy. Abstract paintings are all about deriving elements such as colour, shape, line texture and space, he said.

It takes him around 15-16 days to make a big painting while two to three days for a small one. “There are no boundaries when it comes to expression of an art through painting. Once the brush strokes start, there is no looking back,” he said.

The most expensive 6x6 ft painting at the exhibition is valued at Rs1 lakh.

But he seemed to be a bit disappointed when he said the citizens are not much into paintings and art. “There is lack of encouragement and enough awareness in the city. We should bring budding artists together so that authenticity of this beautiful art is preserved,” he said.

However, there appeared to be a ray of hope for him as many young students and visitors showed up and appreciated his paintings.

Unnati Agrawal said, “I am an architect by profession and my love for the art is real. These paintings are made with precision and I wish more people visit the exhibition.”

Jayesh Dupare, also an architect, was mesmerized by the use of bright colours. “I liked the exhibition. Betawar is a famous painter. I believe more opportunities should be given to artists to exhibit their talent,” he said.

Manjusha Taksande, a housewife who was accompanied by a painter friend, was happy to see the unique and creative works of Betawar.

The exhibition will be open to public till Sunday.

BICHOLIM: A resident of Gauthan in Sakhali, Navnath Gaonkar, 33, was arrested on Thursday as the prime suspect in the murder of Dhanashree Morajkar, 44, whose body was recovered from a canal of the Anjunem dam on February 28.

Police had detained 10 suspects on Monday, including Gaonkar. On Thursday evening, Gaonkar escaped from custody, but was caught the next day.

Police said their suspicion was raised because during initial interrogation Gaonkar told them he was at home on February 27, when Morajkar was killed. However, CCTV footage showed his car travelling back and forth between Sakhali and Bicholim between 12pm and 5.30pm. His wife, too, on initial questioning had maintained that Gaonkar was at home, but on sustained interrogation revealed that he had not been at home, police said.

Later Gaonkar told police that he had picked up Morajkar in his car on February 27 around 12pm and that the two had gone for a drive to Banda in Maharashtra. He allegedly dropped her off at Sakhali at 9.30pm, police said. Police suspect that Gaonkar killed Morajkar between 5.30pm and 9.30pm and dumped the body in the canal.

The action against Asianet News and Media One follows the ministry’s accusation that both channels flouted the programme code and “highlighted the attack on places of worship” and sided with one particular community.

In its order on Media One, the government has also said the channel deliberately focused on vandalism by CAA supporters. “It also questions RSS and alleges Delhi Police inaction. Channel seems to be critical towards Delhi Police and RSS,” the ministry’s March 6 order says. The ministry also showcaused Media One, but remained dissatisfied with the channel’s response.

In the case of Asianet News, the ministry has taken exception to the channel alleging that the “central government did not act to control the riots, and central forces reached the riot hit areas after long hours of the meeting of Union minister Amit Shah.”

Both channels were issued show-cause notices by the ministry, in which they defended their reportage and asserted the coverage was not contemptuous of any of any religious group.

392,['7/03/2020'],"Low, middle income group will benefit: Builders","NAGPUR: A 1% cut in the stamp duty is expected to bring a major relief for low and middle income home buyers.

The average price of flats for the segment in the city is in the range of Rs25 to 30 lakh. Now, the buyers in this class will be able to save as much as Rs25,000 to Rs30,000 which “will make a major difference for the group”, according to builders.

Concerns were raised about the ready reckoner rates which, a builder said, are much higher than the market price of real estate. As the stamp duty has to be paid at the ready reckoner rate, this leaves buyers at a loss. This is because many properties are not even fetching a price equivalent to the ready reckoner.

The cut brings stamp duty to 6% from 7% now in the city. At present the basic stamp duty is at 5% for properties within city limits which is loaded with 1% each of metro and corporation cess. Outside the limits, it is 5% duty and 1% cess. The basic duty has been now reduced to 4%, taking the gross impact to 6% and 5%, respectively.

Gaurav Agrawala, the city secretary of Confederation of Real Estate Developers ’ Associations of India’s (CREDAI), said in Nagpur a majority of the flats are priced in the range of Rs30 to 60 lakh. A reduction of Rs10,000 per lakh gives enough leeway for the buyer under this category.

“Certainly, higher the cost more would be the benefit,” said Agrawala.

“Often purchases are held up for small amounts like Rs25,000 to 50,000. The duty exemption may make it easier for the lower end buyers for whom even small amounts matter. Even in Nagpur, a majority of supply and even demand is of the low to mid-priced realty,” said Sunil Duddalwar, a former secretary of CREDAI’s Nagpur branch.

Anil Pillai, of M/s Pioneer Constructions, said that the move is expected to boost the sentiment.

Tejinder Singh Renu, who too is a builder, said the real solution lies in readjusting the ready reckoner rates which are not at realistic levels. Citing his own example, Renu said it was difficult to get even a price equal to ready reckoner rates while selling a property. “However, the stamp duty has to be paid according to the ready reckoner which is taken as the minimum level,” he said.

Real estate research agency Knight Frank has maintained a bullish outlook. “The last couple of years have been full of stress owing to demonetization and the implementation of new RERA regulations. With interest rates gradually reduced over the last year, the added reduction is expected to improve sales,” read its statement.

393,['7/03/2020'],Cong-NCP hail MVA govt’s 1st budget; peanuts for Vidarbha: BJP,"Finance minister Ajit Pawar and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray (left)

NAGPUR: Change of guard in Maharashtra has cost Vidarbha dearly as the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has not given much allocation or projects to the region in the state budget presented in Mumbai on Friday, claimed the opposition BJP.

While multi-crore projects like Mumbai-Bengaluru and Nashik-Aurangabad-Bengaluru corridors, International Sports Institute at Pune etc have been announced for western Maharashtra, the only projects worth mentioning for Vidarbha are a medical college at Amravati and an agricultural college at Sakoli.

In his entire budget speech, finance minister Ajit Pawar failed to even mention Vidarbha, say opposition leaders.

Former CM and opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis lashed out at the government for failing to allocate substantial funds for backward regions like Vidarbha, Marathwada and North Maharashtra. Without naming places, Fadnavis claimed that only two cities (Mumbai and Pune) would benefit from the budget. “The MVA has given peanuts to Vidarbha,” he said.

Former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar charged Pawar with allocating an agriculture college to Sakoli, which is constituency of speaker Nana Patole, but neglecting paddy farmers of Vidarbha. “The MVA has miserably failed to maintain the regional balance. During our tenure, we had controlled the deficit and had a surplus funds at the end,” he said.

Accusing the MVA government of misleading people, leader of opposition in the council Pravin Darekar said there was nothing new in the budget. “After criticizing the one-time settlement scheme for farmers brought by the previous BJP government, now they (MVA) have reintroduced it. The MVA leaders are also claiming training programme of 11 months as providing employment,” he said.

Refuting the opposition charges, CM Uddhav Thackeray and his deputy Pawar said the budget has been drafted for entire state and not for particular regions. “We’re happy to present our first budget on a day when the MVA government has completed 100 days. It’s inclusive of education, health, water and sanitation,” Thackeray said.

Slamming the budget, former BJP minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule said, “This budget has nothing for dryland farmers, who are mostly situated in Vidarbha and Marathwada. There is no allocation for providing help to unseasonal rain-hit farmers. The allocation for installation of agricultural farm pumps is meagre.”

BJP MLC Anil Sole said the budget has done injustice to Vidarbha and the state’s second capital, Nagpur. “The government had sent a team for setting up a medical college at Gadchiroli, but nothing came out of it. Will the tribal district remain permanently neglected,” he questioned.

Ashish Jaiswal, independent MLA from Ramtek, said the budget is a mixed bag. “The government has done enough for farmers and women’s self-help groups, but reduced allocation for district plans. Vidarbha has not got its due,” he added.

Parinay Fuke, BJP MLC from Bhandara -Gondia, claimed the budget has meted out injustice to Vidarbha and made a mockery of people of Marathwada and North Maharashtra.

Mayor Sandip Joshi said the budget has nothing for municipal corporations. “Vidarbha has been shortchanged,” he said.

BJP MLA Krishna Khopade said, “There is nothing for Vidarbha other than a medical college, whose date of completion is not mentioned.”

However, Congress and NCP legislators praised the budget. Energy minister Nitin Raut said the government has allocated Rs10,000 crore for providing solar farm pump connections. “Not a single connection had been given in the last two years of the previous government,” he said.

Praising the budget, NCP MLC Prakash Gajbhiye said, “The government has allocated large sums for weaker sections. Rs3,000 crore has been allocated for welfare of OBCs.”

Amit Zanak, Congress MLA from Risod, refuted BJP’s charge that the budget was unfair to Vidarbha. Manohar Chandrikapure, NCP MLA from Arjuni-Morgaon, also voiced similar opinion. Kishor Jorgewar, independent MLA from Chandrapur, praised the budget.

What’s In For Vidarbha

* Innovative energy park at Koradi temple

* Govt Engineering College and Govt Polytechnic in Nagpur to be centres of excellence

* Funds for completion of Dr Ambedkar convention centre in Chicholi in Nagpur

* Allocation for setting up sewage treatment plant & Sulabh toilets on Nag river

394,['7/03/2020'],"BJP threatens legal action against Mundhe; sticking to rules, he says","NAGPUR: Reiterating that general body’s decision to resume works is not possible, municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe said it will also not be feasible to issue new work orders given the financial crisis. Irked by the decision, leaders of BJP, the ruling party in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), has warned of initiating legal action against Mundhe.

In reply to mayor Sandip Joshi ’s letter seeking a decision on general body’s resolution, Mundhe said, “I am reviewing the financial condition. Bills are pending and there is a huge liability. Sufficient money is not available to clear pending bills. It will not be appropriate to create new or increase existing liabilities. It is also not appropriate as per canons of financial propriety. Revenue is not at par with budgetary provisions. Therefore, it will be possible to execute works only as per the revised budget,” he said.

In reply to the general body’s decision to send back chief accounts and finance officer Mona Thakur to the state government, Mundhe said, “The CAFO post is vacant. Thakur has been given additional charge. Budget is under preparation. Therefore, Thakur is having additional charge till alternative arrangement for which I have put in a request,” he said.

BJP corporator Dayashankar Tiwari and ruling party leader Sandip Jadhav later held a press conference. “Mundhe is violating the rules. He has stopped works in which work orders are already issued. Mundhe has also stopped work orders and approval to new works given administrative approval,” they said.

As per rules, it is mandatory to spend 5% of total budget in backward class areas. “Accordingly, the backward class committee approved works of Rs56 crore in current fiscal. Mundhe had stopped works orders of Rs30 crore approved by the committee,” they added.

The Act says an official cannot join back as CAFO a second time. “Accordingly, the general body took a decision for sending back Thakur. But Mundhe said he will not release her until alternative arrangements are made. It is a brazen violation of Act as he should have relieved her and given additional charge of CAFO to any of the available officials. We will seek legal advice on all these issues and take appropriate action soon,” said Tiwari and Jadhav.

Asked whether he meant action as per Atrocity Act, Tiwari said, “We will take action on the basis of legal advice.”

Mundhe told TOI, “I am working and taking all decisions as per norms.”

Tiwari added that Mundhe has also stopped works approved under mayor and deputy mayor funds. “Mundhe should have either implemented or sent general body’s resolution to the government if it felt the need to quash it. But Mundhe avoided the necessary process and gave reply refusing to implement general body’s resolution. It seems Mundhe is not aware of rules,” he said.

The senior corporator also said the ruling party is preparing a list of Mundhe’s violations and will also take it up with the government. “Mundhe is regularly mocking rules. After getting elected, standing committee chairman Vijay Zalke sent a letter to Mundhe asking him to be inducted as Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) trustee. NIT Act says standing committee chairman is ex officio trustee of NIT board. In past, all civic chiefs did it. Mundhe replied that he would not convey it until government issues notification. There is no need for notification in this regard,” said Tiwari.

NAGPUR: The prompt Yes Bank had to say no to many of its depositors on Friday. After the RBI imposed a restriction on withdrawals beyond Rs50,000, anxious depositors from businessmen to salary earners, whose pay was deposited in the bank, thronged the six branches at Nagpur.

As cash was limited, many had to return empty-handed. The bank’s officials, who refused to give an official comment on the cash position, however, maintained that the situation was under control. The bank’s ATMs had run dry and all electronic mode of cash transfer, including use of the Yes Bank cards, had come to a standstill.

Apart from retail depositors, the crisis has also affected government bodies like the Nagpur University , cooperative banks and mutual fund investors. Brokers said a number of retail investors also rushed to buy the falling Yes Bank scrip, hoping to make a windfall gain after the crisis ends. But many of them have also ended up losing their money since last one week, said a broker. On Friday, the stock closed at Rs16.60.

A number of cooperatives use the Yes Bank route for electronic transfer of funds. Some of cooperatives had their surplus liquidity in the bank’s branches too. “The money has been blocked now,” said sources in the cooperative banking sector. Mutual funds had invested into Yes Bank’s perpetual bonds whose value has been downgraded to nil after the crisis. “This has led to a straight drop of 1% in the investment portfolio of many mutual fund holders,” said investment advisers.

“A day ago, the Yes Bank executive visited our office and insisted to buy the investment plans. This gave an impression that things are fine even as bank was sinking,” said Ayush Srivastava, who runs a start up venture.

“As much as Rs12 lakh of deposits, which includes funds of my family, are stuck up in the bank. There are Rs3 lakh in my business account. I was planning to withdraw that for paying salaries. The plan was to pay before March 10 considering the Holi festival but now I am helpless,” he said

Sanjay Gawande, a chemical trader, said that there was Rs1 lakh in his daughter’s account and he needed the money for her education but now he cannot withdraw more than Rs50,000. “Another Rs75,000 are in my account,” he said.

“Thankfully, we paid the last instalment of my daughter’s fee recently. Still, around a lakh are held up in the bank now,” said Alfiya Bangali, a depositor.

Kailash Agrawal of Vidarbha Urban Cooperative Banks Federation said a large number of cooperative banks have their funds in the bank as its services are used for electronic transfer. Now, as a revival on the cards, the crisis is expected to end soon, he said.

Ravindra Durugkar, chairman of Gandhibagh Urban Cooperative Bank , said a list of 132 bank having cooperatives having funds in Yes Bank has been released. Cooperatives park at least Rs2 to Rs2.5 crore in Yes Bank for facilitating electronic transfer which has now come to a standstill. Durugkar said some of the cooperative had deposits in Yes Bank too. He hoped the crisis will end in could of days.

Investment adviser GV Iyer said investors in Nippon and UTI’s mutual funds have taken a major hit due to the funds’ exposure into Yes Bank’s bonds. The value has dipped by 12% straight. “Other mutual funds have been affected too,” he said.

PANAJI: The state government has assured the high court of Bombay at Goa that the use of loudspeakers will not be permitted between 10pm and 6am at two night markets at Arpora unless special permission is obtained.

Additional government advocate P Arolkar told the court that police sub-inspector concerned will monitor the situation at Saturday Night Market and Saturday Night Bazar to ensure that noise rules are complied with.

On February 21, the court in an interim order had directed the policenot to permit loudspeakers or public address systems at night except in closed premises for communication within, for example in auditoria, conference rooms, community halls and banquet halls.

The court asked for noise pollution rules to be enforced on both the markets after petitioner Charmaine Braganza filed a case earlier this year alleging that the Saturday Night Market wasn’t complying with noise pollution rules.

Counsel for the Saturday Night Market, A D Bhobe told the court that the petitioner is the sister of the Saturday Night Market’s organiser who is on inimical terms. He also said the petitioner has sided with the organisers of the rival Saturday Night Bazar located 500m away from the Saturday Night Market.

Bhobe told the court that Saturday Night Market strictly complies with terms and conditions of permissions and has never breached rules. He submitted that necessary directions be issued to police authorities to ensure that the Saturday Night Bazar, organised by the competitors, doesn’t breach any rules.

Counsel for the petitioner Carlos Ferreira said there was no connection between the petitioner and the organisers of the Saturday Night Bazar and stated that the petitioner has no objection if directions are issued to the police authorities to enforce rules as far as the Saturday Night Bazar is concerned.

After the assurance that PSI will monitor the situation at both the night markets, the division bench comprising Justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar disposed the petition.

The WRD was supposed to commence releasing water from Tuesday, but was delayed as the overhauling of valves of the pipeline was pending. The trial was conducted after the servicing and repair of the valves.

Officials at the Opa water works said that water would reach the Khandepar river by next week as it takes time to spread into the six bandharas along the Kalay river before reaching Khandepar river.

399,['7/03/2020'],"Coming near your place: Astro turf, jogging tracks","Representative image

NEW DELHI: A ground, which was earlier used for practice during Commonwealth Games 2010, has been redeveloped by New Delhi Municipal Council as a full-fledged sports complex, complete with astro turf , jogging tracks and outdoor gyms, among other facilities.

The complex at Mandir Marg, developed at a cost of Rs 2.5 crore, can be used by schoolchildren as well as the public. The work on the site had been completed and it would become operational soon, an official said. The ground had remained unutilised after the 2010 Games. The redevelopment project was taken up on the directions of the then NDMC chairman, Naresh Kumar, last year and took 10 months to be completed. Among the facilities available are a third-generation synthetic football turf, two synthetic lawn-tennis courts, jogging tracks and an outdoor gym. Synthetic turf is basically a layer of matted earth formed by grass and plant roots. The football ground will be maintained by the firm that has supplied the turf.

A senior NDMC official told TOI that the football ground would have a “world-class” academy to provide youngsters with quality training and advanced infrastructure.

“In the morning, the football ground and the lawn tennis courts will be used by state or national-level players as well as students from the NDMC schools. However, for optimum utilisation of these facilities, coaching will be imparted to the students and players through professional academies that operate during the evening. Outsiders, too, can enrol themselves for these sessions,” the official said.

The civic agency will invite tenders to select the coaching academies for this purpose soon. A revenue-sharing model will also be worked out.

“The idea of redeveloping the complex is to promote sports,” said the official. Already, the civic agency is imparting football training to 30 girls from NDMC schools, he said.

The equipment installed at the open gym and the jogging tracks can be accessed by the residents through the day. “These facilities have been created outside the tennis and football grounds.

400,['7/03/2020'],Delhi sees highest 24-hour rainfall for March in 5 years,"NEW DELHI: Delhi on Friday recorded its highest 24-hour rainfall in the month of March since 2015. India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that the Safdarjung observatory, which provided representative figures for Delhi, recorded 20.4 mm rainfall till 8.30am. On March 2, 2015, it had rained 56.8 mm in the national capital.

The weather station at south Delhi’s Palam logged 15.3mm rainfall, Lodhi Road 20.6mm, Ayanagar 19.1mm and the Ridge station 18.6mm.

Meanwhile, the rain that lashed the national capital overnight and also on Friday afternoon brought the mercury down. Till 5.30pm, Safdarjung recorded 16.8mm rainfall, Palam 22.3mm, Lodhi Road 17.8mm, Ridge 24.8mm and Ayanagar recorded 17.2mm rain.

On Friday, the capital recorded a minimum temperature of 14 degrees Celsius, one notch above normal. The maximum temperature was 22.4 degree Celsius, six notches below the normal.

“There was moderate rainfall both overnight as well as in the afternoon. It was also a windy day with an average wind speed of 30-35 km per hour and gusty spells up to 50km per hour. Another western disturbance is also coming on March 10 and drizzle is expected in the night. On March 11 and 12, light rain is expected,” a Met official said.

On Saturday, partly cloudy sky is expected with possibility of very light rain or drizzle. The maximum and minimum temperatures would be around 25 degrees and 13 degrees Celsius, respectively.

The strong winds and overnight rain also helped the pollution levels in the city stay in the satisfactory level as the 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) clocked 64, a marginal improvement from Thursday’s 79, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)’s 4pm bulletin.

An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, between 201 and 300 poor, between 301 and 400 very poor and between 401 and 500, it is considered severe.

As per CPCB, Delhi-NCR’s average PM2.5 levels were recorded at 20.1 micrograms per cubic metre at 8pm on Friday, well within the safe standards. The average PM10 levels were recorded at 41.4 micrograms per cubic metre the same time. The “emergency” benchmark for these pollutants under the Graded Response Action Plan is, respectively, 300 and 500 micrograms per cubic metre, while the safe standards are 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metre.

According to SAFAR, the regional air quality has improved significantly owing to the aerosol washout process. “An improvement in AQI to the lower end of satisfactory to the good category is expected for tomorrow. The AQI is likely to stay in the satisfactory category for Sunday. It may marginally deteriorate and enter the moderate category on Monday,” a SAFAR report said.

401,['7/03/2020'],Drill tests preps for air crashes at sea,"Panaji: In light of recent incidents of passenger airliners crashing into water, the Indian Coast Guard on Friday conducted India’s first every mock drill simulating such an incident just off North Goa’s coast.

The mock drill saw 220 flyers stranded in deep waters and several coastal agencies rushing to their rescue.

“It is for the first time in the country that we have undertaken such an exercise. This search and rescue exercise has been utilised to join hands with the aeronautical and maritime agencies,” director general of Indian Coast Guard Krishnaswamy Natrajan said.

An Indonesian airliner crashed into the sea with 189 people on board in October 2018. Prior to that, in 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared at sea. US Airways Flight 1549, which lost all engine power and ditched into the Hudson river in 2009, is one such incident where no lives were lost. In such an accident, passengers need to be rescued “with utmost alacrity,” and this requires “full coordination” between search and rescue agencies, the Indian Coast Guard said.

“In this operation, there were large number of air passengers and these were rescued by various agencies and taken for treatment. We have utilised the facilities of ISRO to obtain satellite imagery of the accident site. There were observers from 19 countries,” Natrajan said.

Natrajan was in Goa to oversee the two-day HAMSAR (Harmonising Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue) exercise. Two days earlier, defence secretary Ajay Kumar had said that national and international search and rescue agencies (SAR) need to enhance coordination in order to respond to such accidents.

“Maritime search and rescue construct continues to remain a challenge amid increasing maritime and fishing activities, which is further convoluted by frequent cyclones in Indian waters as well as incidents of plane disasters overseas,” Natrajan said.

The mock exercise began with a distress message to authorities. A Coast Guard Dornier aircraft on patrol was diverted to assess the incident. Coast Guard and Indian Navy ships in the area were diverted to the accident site to rescue the passengers of the mock-up aircraft.

405,['7/03/2020'],Addl VAT on fuels to burn hole in citizens’ pockets,"Aurangabad: The proposal to increase the value added tax (VAT) on fuels by Re 1 per litre is likely to burn a hole in the pockets of citizens here who already pay 2% extra on petrol and 3% more on diesel as part of the beautification tax.

During the budget presentation on Friday, state finance minister Ajit Pawar said that in addition to the existing tax and cess, Re 1 per litre will be charged for both petrol and diesel in the state. This, he said, would add Rs 1,800 crore into the state exchequer.

This implies that there will be an additional expenditure for people in Aurangabad as a beautification tax imposed by the state government is already in place for the last 12-13 years.

On Friday, the rates of petrol and diesel, without the additional VAT of Re 1, were Rs 77.9 and Rs 67.9 respectively. Aqueel Abbas, secretary of the Petrol and Diesel Dealers Association, Aurangabad district, said that the total tax for diesel and petrol across the state was 21% and 24% respectively. However with the introduction of the beautification tax in Aurangabad, citizens had to pay 24% tax for diesel and 26% for petrol respectively. “The state also charges VAT of Rs 7 on per litre of petrol which is applicable across the state,” he said.

The tax on fuels was simultaneously introduced in Nagpur, Dhule, Nandurbar, Amravati and Aurangabad. According to Abbas, the state has done away with the tax in some of the cities while Aurangabad is still being made to pay the tax. Incidentally, the tax was introduced stating that it would be used for infrastructure development in the cities.

According to Syed Asif Ali, a working professional, people in Aurangabad were unnecessarily paying the beautification tax for more than a decade. “Oil prices have dropped due to developments in the international markets. The benefits of low rates should be passed on to the commoners,” said Ali.

When asked, deputy mayor Rajendra Janjal said that there was no proposal to jettison the beautification tax. “We are following up with the state government to release part of the collected beautification tax to the civic administration. We can carry out several development works,” said Janjal.

407,['7/03/2020'],Waterlogging takes a toll on traffic in Delhi,"NEW DELHI: Along with the relief from sudden heat, the daylong showers on Friday also brought inconvenience for the commuters in the capital as traffic snarls were triggered by waterlogging at many arterial roads such as Mathura Road, Ring Road, Outer Ring Road and Mehrauli-Badarpur Road. Police said waterlogging was widely reported from the low-lying areas and the stretches where construction work was under way.

Commuters complained about waiting for more than one and a half hours for travelling 2km between Pragati Maidan and ITO in the evening. “It took me a long time even to cross Pragati Maidan after being stuck in the jam for hours. Two of the three lanes were filled with water due to the construction work on both carriageways,” said Jaspreet Singh, whose office is near ITO.

Major snarls were reported near Pragati Maidan, Maharani Bagh, Ashram and New Friends Colony and traffic was diverted in central Delhi at Thimaya Marg since the morning after a tree got uprooted in the night rain .

Snarls were reported near the IIT Delhi campus and the Munirka flyover due to waterlogging near a construction site on the way to the airport. Rao Tula Ram Marg also saw massive jams. Some other affected areas were Lala Lajpat Rai Marg, Sarai Kale Khan, mouth of Signature Bridge, Bharthal Chowk on Dwarka Link Road, Wazirabad Road, Apsara Roundabout, Mandoli, Rajokri flyover, Model Town, Nigambodh Ghat and IP flyover. Traffic was also affected on NH-24. Slow traffic movement was reported on Ring Road near AIIMs after a truck broke down near Safdarjung Hospital.

Some sewer lines were repaired before the Delhi assembly elections in Defence Colony Block-A but the road was not properly repaired, leading to cave-in at various places during the rain, alleged area councillor Abhishek Dutt.

NDMC received two complaints of waterlogging till 7pm due to overflowing of drains near Taj Mahal Hotel and opposite Aradhana Enclave near Moti Bagh flyover. Felling of trees was reported in Lajpat Nagar I under the south corporation.

PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday sought clarification from Union minister of state for civil aviation Hardeep Singh about the norms restricting construction around Goa International Airport , which is a defence airbase.

On February 29, the high court of Bombay at Goa directed the Navy and director general of civil aviation (DGCA) to initiate action against unauthorised constructions around the Goa International Airport within nine months and submit a compliance report by March 31, 2021.

Sawant met Singh and updated him about the construction of the greenfield international airport at Mopa . He also appraised him about the problems faced by construction industry at sites around the Dabolim airport.

During the meeting, Sawant asked the exact permitted height and distance of a structure from the airport. He said he would write a letter to the ministry seeking detailed clarification.

Sawant will also take up the issue with the ministry of defence as Dabolim airport comes under it.

The high court order had come in connection with a writ petition challenging the construction of around seven high-rise structures around the airport and naval airbase at Dabolim.

The court also took serious note of the resolution passed by Mormugao Planning and Development Authority (MPDA) on November 18, 2019, rejecting the Navy’s colour-coded zoning map (CCZM).

The court said aviation safety is paramount and thus provisions of the Aircraft Act, the 1994 Rules, the 2015 Rules and the CCZM prepared by the Navy take precedence over MPDA’s resolution.

While light rain was recorded on Friday morning, the second spell of showers around 4pm was accompanied by gusty winds. A met official stated that the high wind speed made it difficult for flights to land at the airport. The thundershowers, however, subsided by around 6.30, the official added.

Both arrivals and departures at IGI were impacted for two hours. While for arriving flights, landing during strong cross-winds is dangerous and difficult, the departing flights got delayed due to the adverse weather conditions.

Sameer, an Air India passenger, tweeted saying his flight had been delayed by over three hours, with no clarity from the airliner. “…flight waiting for refueling and hence delayed. Captain is saying delay because of airport congestion,” read his tweet.

Airlines also took to the social media, asking passengers to arrive at the airport keeping in mind the weather condition and to check the latest status of their flights.

Cops from Lalbazar, led by additional CP (I) Jawed Shamim, met 20 religious preachers and took their suggestions to spread social peace and harmony across the city that has witnessed multiple protests against the CAA, NRC, NPR and Delhi violence. The police started the drive on Friday when there were complaints of water balloons being hurled at bus passengers. At Lalbazar, joint CP (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar said that no miking would be allowed due to the ongoing board exams.

“Anyone throwing colours at someone against his or her wish will face legal action,” he added. The arrangements will be in place till Tuesday while the maximum deployment of cops will be done on Monday. There will be mobile patrol, foot patrol and police pickets across the city. This year, certain sensitive areas will also be under the scanner of cops.

Police sources said, “Our main aim is to maintain law and order on roads where no type of hooliganism will be tolerated. We have been asked to keep in touch with senior citizens and help them out.

412,['7/03/2020'],Re 1 per litre VAT hike on petrol and diesel could fuel price rise,"Mumbai: Brace for a hike in petrol and diesel rates as the state budget on Friday proposed an increase in the value added tax ( VAT ) on both by Re 1 per litre.

The VAT on petrol and diesel is already high in Maharashtra, with Mumbai recording the highest price of petrol across all cities in the country. The state collects as much as 26% VAT on petrol and 24% on diesel in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai; elsewhere in the state, it is 25% on petrol and 21% on diesel. This is besides the central excise duty, cess and dealer commission. Over the basic price of petrol, the Centre and the state together impose taxes and levies totalling around Rs 40. The current rates of petrol and diesel in Mumbai are Rs 76.83 and Rs 66.82, respectively.

Deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar, though, said the Re 1 per litre hike in VAT will enrich the state exchequer by Rs 1,800 crore per annum. “The government will create a special dedicated fund called ‘Green Fund’ and the additional collection of VAT from the proposed levy will be transferred in this fund,” he said while reading out his budget speech. “The special fund will be utilized for conservation of environment, specifically for projects related to sewage disposal and waste management and such other projects,” said Pawar.

Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis opposed the move. He told mediapersons after the budget that it was “a huge burden on not just the common man, but also transporters and farmers. Diesel is an important component in the operational costs for those transporting goods while it is also relevant to those in agriculture (equipment, vehicles, etc). So it will be a major setback to scores of citizens across the state.”

Pawar, though, said, “Given issues like climate change, I hope people of the state will support the move. Petrol prices in the previous government’s tenure were much higher than today and so it will not be like we are introducing a huge hike.” When asked if hike in fuel prices will have a cascading effect on food prices and other goods, he said the government will review these regularly.

Petrol Dealers’ Association secretary Chetan Modi said the VAT of 26% in Mumbai is the highest in the country and this tax is in the range of 20-22% in other cities. “The state government earns maximum revenue from VAT on petrol and diesel and does not share a single paisa with the Centre. Our association has repeatedly petitioned the government to reduce VAT in Maharashtra, and an increase is unwarranted,” he said.

He said the dealer commission was a paltry Rs 1.82 per litre and not even Rs 2 a litre as should be the case.

NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to confiscate moveable properties like mobile phones, cars and refrigerators for non-payment of property tax . While the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act contains this punitive provision, it has never been enforced earlier and only immoveable properties such as houses and shops were taken over in the past.

Jai Prakash, chairman of the corporation standing committee, said all property tax offices would remain open till 7pm for collection till March 31. The offices will also be open on all Saturdays in March and collect tax only through cheques from 9am to 7pm with a lunch break from 1pm to 1.30pm. The property owners can also pay through www.mcd-online.gov.in and www.mcdpropertytax.in, Prakash added.

Anyone failing to pay the tax for 2019-20 by March 31 may have to face legal action as per the DMC Act like penalties with interests, attachment of account/movable or immovable property that may also be auctioned. People are advised not to wait till the last date, an official said.

Till now the corporation used to seal immoveable properties such as houses and shops, which were returned to defaulters on the payment of penalties.

415,['7/03/2020'],Bambolim ‘Gomecothon’ aims to drive up organ donor count,"Panaji: Despite the state-run Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital at Bambolim seeing two to three brain deaths a month, it has not yet succeeded in getting a deceased organ donor even as 20 patients are on its waitlist for kidney transplants.

The State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (Sotto), which was recently set up in Goa, has not received much of a response in terms of getting people on board to pledge their organs. Only 25 donors are registered with it till date.

To create more awareness about organ donation, Sotto will organise a marathon, ‘Gomecothon 2020’ on Sunday, which will begin at 6.15am at the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Indoor Stadium, Taleigao.

GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar said they have received a huge response.

“We have asked all heads of departments to participate and have got at least 950 participants,” Bandekar told reporters on Friday.

Also present was joint director of Sotto-Goa, Dr Preeti Varghese.

Bandekar said that the GMC has conducted 20 live donor kidney transplants till date. No cadaveric transplant has been carried out since families of the deceased are reluctant to donate the organs.

The GMC dean said five lakh patients die every year in India while waiting for an organ transplant, and that someone gets added to the waitlist every minute.

“The organ donation rate is just 0.8 persons per million in India as against 46.9 persons per million in Spain,” Bandekar said, adding that the demand and supply gap in India is huge.

Sunday’s event is to create awareness to understand the gravity of the problem among people and convince them to pledge their organs, he said.

Bandekar said other proposed transplants other than kidneys will take place in the state after the superspecialty block at GMC is made functional.

This marks the begining of traditional Shigmo festival in Goa that lasts till the eve of Hindu New Year, i.e. Gudi Padwa.

Priol MLA and minister for Art and Culture Govind Gaude, Ponda MLA Ravi Naik, former MLA Lavoo Mamledar in the presence of hundreds of citizens from Ponda and surrounding villages offered ‘Oti’ (a tray full of coconuts, flowers and a blouse cloth piece) to goddess Mahalasa and invoked her blessings.

The members clad in traditional attire with Maratha turbans set out with festive mood with torans, and Abdagirs visited the temple in a procession on Friday afternoon. Gaude, Naik and others offered the ‘Oti’ to the deity.

Though the traditional Shigmo festival of Ponda begins with this ritual, a spectacular display of Goan Hindu ethnicity and mythology with artistically designed tableaus and folk dances would be held in the Ponda town on March 10.

417,['7/03/2020'],Stakeholders to iron out issues to help city breathe clean air,"NAGPUR: At a meeting of stakeholders who need to join hands to implement the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) in the city, what came to fore was that lack of coordination among civic agencies and no structured hierarchy are proving to be stumbling blocks to the execution. While only 5 of the 20 members met, they were unanimous that all issues must be ironed out to ensure citizens breathe clean air.

At a consultation meet on held at the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) on Friday, the institute’s director Rakesh Kumar presented a detailed explanation of the programme. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has sought Neeri’s expertise for preparing action plans for the 18 non-attainment cities of the state. These cities have consistently witnessed deteriorating air quality when compared to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards .

The clean air action plan for Nagpur has been approved by the Central Pollution Control Board subject to some compliances in a specific format.

Highlighting the agenda of the meeting, head of Air Pollution Control Division at Neeri KV George stated that civic agencies are struggling with the structure of implementing the plan. “While the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is the main implementing agency, it can’t issue orders to other departments,” he said.

Lack of coordination is the main obstacle in implementing the plan, stated Leena Buddhe, of NGO Centre for Sustainable Development which facilitated the meet. “The concerned departments are working in isolation and there is no consolidation of data. NMC is writing to other departments in this concern but many are not responding,” she said.

During the consultation, it was decided that every department will appoint a nodal officer for implementing the plan. “The review meetings have been witnessing poor attendance. There is a clear absence of shared responsibility,” said Buddhe, adding that all stakeholders have decided to meet on second Friday of every month.

The attendance sheet and minutes of the meeting held on Friday will be submitted to the MPCB’s head office in Mumbai. “The departments are not treating air pollution as a health emergency. Rather than indulging in blame games, we will documents everything and leave it to the higher authorities,” officials present at the meeting stated.

The next meeting will be held at MahaMetro’s office in April in which stakeholders are expected to present their individual plans to curb pollution.

The city’s action plan focuses on curbing air pollution from different sources including vehicles, burning of municipal solid waste at landfill site, road construction, industries, domestic fuel burning, hotels and crematoriums.

418,['7/03/2020'],College St roadblock lifted after 24 hrs,"Kolkata: A 24-hour sit-in by a section of Presidency University students demanding better hostel facilities finally came to an end on Friday afternoon, but not before they had tested the patience of daily commuters and others heading to Sealdah or Howrah stations to catch trains and traders trying to make most of the Holi weekend .

Even though the students withdrew their sit-in for an hour in the morning and allowed traffic movement on MG road for over another couple of hours, before blocking the College street-MG Road Crossing again, they got into verbal altercations with bus passengers asking them to call off the agitation.

Cops at Lalbazar claimed that DC Central Sudheer Kumar Neelakantam had been heckled when he had tried to intervene and requested the students to withdraw the agitation.

Vice-chancellor of Presidency University, Anuradha Lohia, said there was little point meeting the agitating students who were mostly from the hostel and were of various political affiliations. “We have repeatedly requested them to withdraw the agitation and sit for a discussion in order to arrive at a solution. But they have not responded. Dialogue is a two-way process and can’t happen at their whim and fancy. It is not a one way street,” said Lohia.

Atanu Gupta, a Presidency alumni, who was stuck at Bowbazar after his bus was diverted from the MG Road, said that while he supports the students’ rightful demands, the issues were “essentially internal, for which common people were not supposed to be harassed for an entire day.” However, the students said they would continue with the protest as the VC is not meeting them. “The blockade was temporarily withdrawn as it was affecting traffic movement. But the agitation has not ended. The next course of action will be decided soon,” said Rimjhim Sinha, an agitation student.

419,['7/03/2020'],Proposal to set up safari park at Mitmita gets green light,"Aurangabad: The proposal for construction of the ambitious safari park at Mitmita has been approved by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA).

This development clears the way for the tendering and development of the safari park project which is to be carried out through the smart city funds.

Brij Raj Sharma, former member secretary of the CZA, said that in the final approval received two days ago, the master plan submitted to the CZA by the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) in August 2019 has been approved without any changes. “The project is ready to be tendered out,” Sharma said.

Incidentally, the AMC had appointed a project management consultancy comprising experts, including Sharma, to prepare the master plan of the safari park. The master plan prepared by the consultancy proposed for the development of the zoological park over an area of 50 hectare land earmarked for the project in Mitmita in the outskirts of the city. The design was made to house around 500 animals of over 60 species.

Subsequently, it was decided that funds from the smart city project would be used for raising the safari park. The proposal stated that the cost of developing the park would be Rs 145 crore. The Aurangabad Smart City Development Corporation Ltd. (ASCDCL) will be carrying out the implementation of the project.

According to Pushkal Shivam, senior consultant at ASCDCL, the tender for the safari park project is ready. “The tender can be floated any time now. The tendering process will take 30 to 40 days following which the work order will be issued. The tender document states the project has to be completed within three years of the issuance of work order,” he said.

It is expected that the tender will be issued before the model code of conduct for the civic elections which are set to be held in April.

420,['7/03/2020'],IPS officer suspension: CAT reserves verdict,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: The Central Administrative Tribunal ( CAT ) at Hyderabad on Friday reserved its judgement in a petition filed by Andhra Pradesh’s former intelligence chief AB Venkateswara Rao , currently under suspension, effected by the state of AP.

Arguing his case, senior counsel G Vidya Sagar urged the court to set aside the suspension order. He said that the state has failed to keep the centre informed within 48 hours even though it is mandatory for the state to do so whenever it resorts to suspension of central employees working with it.

The state , it can be recalled, placed Venkateswara Rao under suspension citing his ‘undue efforts’ to secure a drones procurement contract to an Israeli firm through his son’s enterprise.

While Vidya Sagar argued that there can be no question of any loss to the state because the state nullified all the orders issued in favour of the firm in question in December 2018, the state, through senior counsel D Prakash Reddy, contended that Rao did not stop his unlawful efforts even after the cancellation of the order.

The state also contended that this is a matter pertaining to the purchase of sensitive security equipment, that too from a foreign country, and hence proper care has to be exercised while dealing with the issue but the conduct of Rao was running contrary to the security interests of the state.

We did inform the centre about his suspension, Prakash Reddy said, adding that Rao should have first preferred an appeal before the central government rather than coming to CAT directly.

421,['7/03/2020'],Goa CM Pramod Sawant urges Centre not to allow Karnataka’s project,"Chief Minister of Goa, Pramod Sawant (File Image)

PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday urged Jal Shakti ministry and environment ministry not to permit Karnataka to carry out any construction on the Mhadei till Goa’s side is heard.

Sawant met Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh and environment minister Prakash Javadekar over the water diversion issue in New Delhi. He was accompanied by Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Tendulkar .

“We have urged the Union ministers not to entertain any proposal by Karnataka on the Mhadei without keeping Goa informed,” Sawant said, adding that both Singh and Javadekar agreed to Goa’s request.

Singh has assured the chief minister to protect Goa’s interest in the matter, the Rajya Sabha MP said.

A day after the Supreme Court rejected Goa’s plea to stop Karnataka from starting work on the Mhadei, Sawant on Tuesday said the state would approach the Centre and request it not to permit Karnataka to begin any work on its projects.

On March 2, the Supreme Court had rejected Goa’s plea to stop Karnataka from starting work on the Mhadei, but said Karnataka can begin construction after getting permission from the central government and preparing a detailed project report.

The apex court said that the 2014 interim order of the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal will remain in force. This means that Karnataka can go ahead with its projects provided it gets permission from the wildlife board and environment ministry, besides other agencies.

The tribunal’s interim order on April 17, 2014, stated that Karnataka could not start work without a revised DPR that had to be approved by the Centre or the Mhadei Water Management Authority.

However, Karnataka has already got the Centre’s nod as Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar in a letter on December 24, 2019, clarified that the state doesn’t need any environmental clearance and requires only wildlife and forest permissions for the Kalasa-Bhandura drinking water project.

After Goa did not object to Karnataka’s plea to notify the tribunal’s August 14, 2018, award, the Supreme Court had directed the Centre to notify it. On February 28, the Centre notified the tribunal’s final award.

422,['7/03/2020'],Delay in new HSC books worries students opting for competitive exams,"Picture for representational purpose only.

NAGPUR: Many students, coaching classes and junior colleges are fuming over the delay in getting access to new HSC textbooks as they feel it is hurting students going for competitive exams. Academicians say this delay is making it difficult for them to plan out academic schedule as the students have to appear for their board exams next year along with the competitive exams.

Zafar Khan, president of School Headmasters Charitable Association (SHCA), said, “For 2020-21 academic session a new curriculum with updated books was to come in, but till date not a single book is available in the market. It’s already March and we have to plan the academic schedule. But with no new books that cannot be done.” He added that new chapters, additions have to be combed in detail by teachers. “Teachers need to go through this so that they can plan their class and get clarity over added topics,” Khan pointed out.

“Students appearing for competitive exams are the biggest losers, said Rajnikant Bondre , director of Sneha Classes. “Such students have to prepare for HSC exams while simultaneously focusing on their medical/engineering syllabus which is according to NCERT. Hence, we try to synchronize the topics of both the syllabuses to maximize students’ efforts. Common topics can be marked and covered at one time while different topics can be handled separately,” Bondre added. New Std XI books are already in the market, he said. “But the crucial Std XII books are still not available. It is a big problem every time the state board goes for an upgrade. Hence, I believe there should be one-nation-one syllabus policy,” Bondre added.

Panini Telang, director of Pioneer Study Centre, pointed out that anxiety levels are high among students appearing for competitive exams. “The academic session for Std XII starts in July so there is ample time for books. But for those appearing for competitive exams the ‘session’ has already commenced as coaching classes start preparations very early. So, the problem is encountered by specific section of students, not all,” Telang said.

TOI tried to get a statement from Balbharti, the publishing arm of state board, but the official concerned did not respond to calls. A source in the department, however, said that books will be in the market by March end.

NASHIK: Burglars struck at an ATM kiosk in a commercial complex in the Nashik Road area and uprooted the machine using a gas cutter but fled the scene without the booty, apparently after hearing the siren of a police patrol vehicle around 5am on Friday.

Footage of the CCTV cameras installed at the ATM kiosk captured three thieves in the act but all of them had covered their faces and cannot be identified, said police, adding that the trio have been booked and a hunt launched for them.

Police said that the suspects may have fled without the machine after hearing the siren of a police van that was passing by the area at the time of the incident.

Senior police officers said the exact amount of cash in the ATM is being ascertained, but added that there could be at least Rs 10 lakh in the ATM. The kiosk is located in a secluded corner in the commercial complex along the Jail road.

Police learned about the attempted burglary only around 7am. A security guard of the commercial complex saw the uprooted machine and immediately informed his seniors, who contacted police.

According to police, the CCTV cameras inside the ATM kiosk captured the three suspects uprooting the machine using a gas cutter between 3:45am and 5:10am.

Police said that the suspects spent at least one hour trying to uproot the machine. “The patrolling police did not notice anything unusual on the road and did not suspect any attempted burglary.”

Senior police inspector Suraj Bijali of the Nashik Road police station said, “Police were informed about the attempted burglary around 7.20 am. The security guard of the commercial complex noticed the attempted burglary around 6.15 am, following which he contacted his superiors, who then informed us about an hour later.”

“Neither the ATM had an independent security guard nor an automatic alarm system through which police and bank officials could have been alerted while the machine was being uprooted. The kiosk did not have a smoke detected either,” added the officer.

JAIPUR: The first day of every month will be celebrated as ‘No Vehicle Day’ in all government colleges of the state. This advisory was issued by the college commissionerate on Thursday and colleges have been asked to follow this.

Commissioner, college education, Pradeep Borad told TOI, “It is an advisory issued to the administration of government college. This will inspire students to come on bicycle instead of riding motorcycles. We expect it to create a sense of awareness in the students regarding the environment.”

A similar order was issued by transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas in which all the officials of the transport department have been asked not to arrive on vehicles on the first day of every month. Officials of the department were asked to either come via bicycle or use public transport.

These orders are appreciable, but their implementation should also be kept in mind. An education officer on the condition of anonymity said these orders or advisory will not be implemented until the transport in the city is improved. “Students in government colleges come from far off places. Students can’t entirely rely on public transport. In Jaipur, many students have to travel nearly 10km to reach college. It is not feasible for them to travel on bicycles. Especially for girl students, this is not practical,” said the education officer.

NAGPUR: City police chief BK Upadhyay has issued instructions to start special sessions twice a month to address the grievances of women and girls to mark International Women’s Day on Sunday.

This is perhaps the first such measure in the state under which a time slot will be allotted to them every fortnight. Upadhyay has directed the in-charge of police stations to reserve time between 11am and 2pm on every second and fourth Tuesday of the month to receive, redress and register complaints related to atrocities on women and girls.

Upadhyay said women and girls can approach police personnel and seek help at any point of time. But special time will be allotted to them to ensure that genuine grievances are not missed out due to miscommunication or in the absence of senior officials.

“The idea is to ensure maximum complaints of women and girls are heard by seniors like police station in-charges, assistant CP or zonal DCPs,” said Upadhyay.

It’s learnt that display board mentioning the time and days for special grievance redressal for women and children will be put up at police stations to create awareness.

“Our aim is to increase accessibility of senior officials to women and girls. At some police stations, senior PI or the ACP and zonal DCP concerned will be present,” said Upadhyay.

Upadhyay had in the past introduced ‘home drop’ facility to help women and girls reach home with police escort late in the night. The scheme was started in the backdrop of Hyderabad gang rape and murder case. “Home drop facility is likely to be introduced in rest of the state too,” he said.

Upadhyay stated the new system will be started with women and girls, but plans are afoot to extend it to children and senior citizens.

429,['7/03/2020'],Coronavirus scare: Seminar bar for South Korean professor at IIT-Kharagpur,"Professor CD Kong

KOLKATA: A leading aviation expert from South Korea, who has been teaching at IIT-Kharagpur for a month and a half, was refused permission to attend an international seminar on Friday after the hosts developed cold feet over his nationality in the backdrop of the novel coronavirus scare in the Republic of Korea. Ironically, Prof CD Kong was the chief guest at the prestigious event organised jointly by the Aeronautical Society of India and IIT-Kharagpur’s aerospace department.

Techno Main, the institute hosting the prestigious event, informed its decision to bar Kong from the Salt Lake Sector V campus late on Thursday night, barely hours before the seminar’s inauguration. Shocked and embarrassed, functionaries from AeSI and professors from IIT tried to reason with the institute’s officials and even requested MP Manish Gupta, a past chairman of the eastern region chapter of AeSI, to intervene. But the institute’s authorities refused to budge.

“Kong had arrived from Seoul on January 18. So he has been here for over a month-and-a-half, well past the maximum quarantine period of 28 days,” said IIT-Kharagpur’s aerospace engineering professor DK Maity.

Techno Main principal Avijit Kar said the institute did not wish to take a chance after a government advisory against Chinese, South Korean, Iranian and Italian nationals who had arrived in India recently. “There is a lot of scare over nCoV. At a time like this, one has to be extra-cautious,” said Kar.

Forced to remain couped in a guest house, Kong addressed the seminar over Skype and gave a talk on urban aerial mobility. “It would have been nice to be present with everyone,” he said, before leaving for Seoul via Delhi on Friday afternoon.

430,['7/03/2020'],Rajasthan cops’ use of film title to denounce domestic violence gets support from Twitterati,"Representative image

JAIPUR: Rajasthan Police ’s tweet about domestic violence inspired by the latest Bollywood flick ‘Thappad’ has gathered over 2,500 likes and over 500 retweets.

The tweet in Hindi says that ‘Domestic Violence is Thappad, Mental Abuse is Thappad’. The tweet gives out the helpline numbers to report such cases and is accompanied with a picture of actor Tapsee Pannu from the movie with a line ‘just a slap, par nahi maar sakta’.

The tweet was appreciated by many, including the lead actor of the movie Tapsee, who shared it on her timeline. The movie’s director Anubhav Sinha also retweeted it and actor Rahul Dev called it a ‘great initiative’ on social media.

The tweet from Rajasthan Police’s verified account also said that domestic abuse can be reported at helpline numbers 1090 and 112 as well as at the nearest police station. The tweet was posted on Thursday and within 24 hours received thousands of mixed reactions. The post used multiple hashtags and tagged not only the moviemakers, but also organisations working for women.

While most of the replies to the tweet were appreciable and talked about the influence of cinema in today’s age, there were a few Twitter users who questioned it and claimed that even men are victims of domestic violence, but cops never mention it. Some of them said while police are campaigning against domestic violence, in many instances, action is not taken despite cases being registered. Those trolling the tweet claimed that the laws were gender-biased and no action is taken in those cases where women are the perpetrators.

Sinha’s latest movie is centered around the normalisation of domestic violence in India which inspired the state police to take to social media to urge people to report such matters.

431,['7/03/2020'],Tribals to benefit from proposed medical college in Nandurbar,"Nashik: The tribals from Nandurbar district and the adjoining areas are likely to benefit from the state government’s announcement to start medical college at the civil hospital there.

“It has already been decided to start a government medical college at the Nandurbar civil hospital for which the infrastructure is being readied. The government today announced that the college will commence operation from the academic year 2020-21, which means provision has been made for construction of the building and staff arrangement,” Raghunath Bhoye, civil surgeon, civil hospital, said.

According to the state government, it intends to start the college from the forthcoming year – as announced by the state finance minister Ajit Pawar on Friday while announcing the state budget.

The government medical college coming up at Nandurbar will be a boon for the tribals here who have to rush to Surat, Dhule or Aurangabad for medical treatment.

“The medical college will have experts on various faculties. Services will be available round-the-clock. Thus, patients will not have to travel to other cities, which necessitates having to make arrangements for food and stay,” another senior officer from the district administration said.

The officials pointed out that the medical college here would help students to get exposure to sickle cell, anaemia, malnourishment and other diseases, commonly found in the tribal belts.

“This increases the chances of the medicos finding out solutions to the common problems of the people here and also a chance to carry out research in the subjects,” the officer said.

The medical college will come up on the premises next to the civil hospital for which the construction is likely to begin any time soon. The budgetary allocation means that the government is all set to spend for the same.

Meanwhile, the civil hospital at Nandurbar will be handed over to the medical education department till the time the medical college is readied and commissioned.

“This is generally expected to take up to three years after which the medical college will start functioning independently and the civil hospital will be back with the public health department,” the officer added.

432,['7/03/2020'],West Bengal: Yes Bank clients in shock as cards stop working,"Pedestrians walk past Yes Bank branch, at Dalhousie square in Kolkata, on Friday. (PTI)

KOLKATA: More than 40,000 customers of Yes Bank in Bengal were shocked to find their debit and ATM cards not functioning. Their cards have reportedly been blocked after RBI limited cash withdrawal to Rs 50,000 and Rs 5 lakh for emergency. Assurance from the RBI could do little to allay fears among customers and even the 1,000 employees of the private bank.

Yes Bank has 20 branches in Kolkata and around 10 in districts.

Arindum Dutta, a senior executive at a finance company, has his salary account with Yes Bank. Besides, Dutta has his home loan with the bank. “I am distraught after the development. Yes Bank officers told me everything would be fine in a fortnight but until it actually happens, there’s no certainty,” he said, adding he hoped SBI would take over Yes Bank. He said he had been sensing something was amiss with the bank’s functioning, but whenever he asked the officers, they told him otherwise. “I applied for a cheque book almost a year ago but it never arrived. I applied a second time but to no avail,” he added.

Sankhadip Banerjee, a senior executive at another firm, tried to withdraw money from his account but could not do so in the past 24 hours. “We are facing a terrible problem. I have my salary account with the bank. Though the amount was credited to my account earlier, I had not withdrawn anything in the first few days of the month. But now that I need to withdraw money, I can’t. I do not know what to do,” he said. D Bagchi, another customer of Yes Bank, has a fixed deposit of a couple of lakhs with the private bank. “Let’s hope for the best,” he said, his fingers crossed.

Malay Biswas, a top executive at a finance company, had taken a loan from the bank to buy a car. “The bank debits EMI from my salary account every month. Now, my concern is what would happen from April, because without any fault of mine, I might default on the payment because of technicalities,” he said.

A senior employee of the bank is, however, optimistic that RBI and Centre would not let the bank fail. “The impact of a bank failure is huge on society. In the next one week, the situation would be clearer,” he said. The president of All India Bank Employees Association, Rajen Nagar, demanded immediate takeover of the bank by the Centre. “It should be nationalised for the interest of employees and customers,” he added.

433,['7/03/2020'],"Rs4,000 crore budgetary provision for industrial estate in western Maha","Kolhapur: A provision of Rs 4,000 crore in the state budget for setting up a modern industrial estate in Satara district is expected to boost development of drought-prone areas in Satara, Sangli and Solapur districts in western Maharashtra .

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who also holds the portfolio of the finance ministry, has been keen on setting up an industrial estate in Satara district as part of the Mumbai-Bengaluru industrial corridor. Pawar held pre-budget meetings with officials and elected representatives in Satara district to give the proposal a push.

The seven-year-old proposal, which was shelved due to some reasons, will be revived because of a budgetary provision of Rs 4,000 crore. In the last week of February, Pawar had asked the district collector to prepare a technical and feasibility report to finalise land for the project. Pawar had then specifically asked for selecting a land which would be close to Sangli and Solapur district. Solapur is known as the gateway to Marathwada as districts like Beed, Osmanabad, Latur in the backward region are geographically connected to it.

The meeting, called by Pawar in Mumbai, was attended by industries minister Subhash Desai, Satara district guardian minister Balasaheb Patil, additional chief secretary Nitin Karir and a team of officers from the National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation. The final decision on the land in Satara district will be taken after the receipt of technical and feasibility report by the collector.

The government had decided to float a separate company for the purpose. The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) and National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation will have 51% and 49% stakes in the proposed company.

The Union government has decided to develop two special zones along Mumbai-Bengaluru national highway. It will grant Rs 3,000 crore to the state government. Karnataka has already selected Dharwad district for setting up a special zone. Two states are expected to develop industrial zone at respective sites.

The proposal was moved in February 2013 by then chief minister Prithviraj Chavan. According to the proposal, the Maharashtra government was intending to develop subsidiary corridors along the lines of Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor to attract the investors in the industrial and agriculture sector. The proposal had then suggested that Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur , situated along the national highway 4, be connected.

The proposed corridor covers Maharashtra and Karnataka and is expected to be spread over 1,000 km. In Karnataka, it covers districts of Davangere, Chitradurga, Hubali-Dharwad and Belgavi. In November 2013, the UK had evinced interest in developing the corridor much like the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor, which has received assistance from Japan.

Sources in the industries ministry said that the government was keen on an area near Phaltan or Karad in Satara district. Phaltan is already being developed for industries. Karad is close to Sangli and Solapur districts and has ample water supply because of the Krishna river. Karad also has an air strip, which can be developed, sources said.

The plan includes giving a new lease of life to Eshwara statue and construction of Pergola with a capacity to accommodate 150 people, which can also be used to perform yoga.

Cheluvamba Park, spread in more than nine acres, is one of the best maintained parks in Mysuru. Because of its good maintenance, it has become an ideal place for regular strollers as one can see hundreds of people making best use of it by taking up a stroll almost every day.

For many of them, especially retired persons, it is also a meeting spot. Apart from taking up regular walks, many of them are also into yoga. One can see people doing various yoga asanas in the mornings and evenings.

Though hundreds of people make use of this park for their wellbeing, the park does not have a shelter if it rains.

Noticing the issue, MLA Nagendra decided to come out with a proposal to revamp the park and construct a pergola.

The pergola, with a capacity to accommodate 150 people, will be a reality in few months’ time.

BV Ravindra, corporator of Ward No 18 (Yadavagiri) said: “With the help of our MLA Nagendra, we are able to take up various developmental works in Yadavagiri. The renovation work at Cheluvamba Park will be taken up at a cost of Rs 50 lakh.”

Apart from Cheluvamba Park, the second main road will be renovated at a cost of Rs 40 lakh, storm water drain will be constructed at Medar block for Rs 50 lakh, Bayalu Rangamandira at Yadavagiri will be renovated at a cost of Rs 10 lakh, and Rs 25 lakh will be spent for taking up repair work of underground drainage line at Girisdarshini Park in Yadavagiri.

“Yadavagiri is one of the old areas in Mysuru. It should have been well developed by now. The park does not have a shelter to those who come for a stroll. The proposed shelter can accommodate nearly 150 people,” said MLA Nagendra. He said that the renovation work would be completed in six months.

435,['7/03/2020'],Police register another case against Telnade brothers,"Kolhapur: The Ichalkaranji police have registered another offence against Telnade brothers , Sanjay and Sunil, for trying to extort money from a woman.

The brothers have been booked under Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime (MCOCA) are on the run for around a year now. Apart from Telnade brothers, an offence has also been registered against three others — Ramesh Dhondiram Shirgure, Sanjay Rajaram Jadhav and Yuvraj Patil.

The complainant, Ambubai Arjun Baddi, approached the police on Thursday and narrated her ordeal. Following this police detained Shirgure, Jadhav and Patil late on Thursday.

According to the complaint, her later husband owned a property at Trishul chowk in Ichalkaranji. “A man associated with Telnade approached them in the year 2004-05 and expressed interest in buying the property for Rs 3.30 lakh. An initial payment of Rs 1.30 lakh was made. When the couple approached the man for the remaining payment, they were given Rs 3,000 and told not to come back again,” a police officer said.

“The woman said that Patil, who is associated with the Telnade gang, forcibly took possession of the property. The family later shifted to Hubli in Karnataka because of fear. However, they were continuously threatened by the gang,” he added.

Baddi, in her complaint, said that Patil met her in January when she had come to Ichalkaranji. He demanded her to pay Rs 20 lakh if she wanted her property back. She was given the same threat over the phone in February.

The woman has also demanded a fresh probe into the death of her husband, Arjun, who died in August 2007 after falling from a train while he was travelling from Hubli to Sangli.

Telnade brothers are wanted by the police over their allegedly involvement in various crimes. Sanjay has 17 offences registered against him and is the member of Ichalkaranji municipal council. His brother Sunil has seven offences registered against him.

MCOCA court in Pune has set the deadline of March 16 for Telnade brothers to surrender before police or their properties would be seized.

SECUNDERABAD: As many as 8,798 persons in the Cantonment limits were identified as illiterates in a literacy survey conducted by the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB). The survey has been initiated across the state as part of the Telangana government’s effort to eradicate illiteracy.

The SCB conducted the literacy survey in all eight civilian wards across the Cantonment by deploying enumeration teams.

A total of 200 workers, including women’s groups from the Cantonment ‘Mission for Elimination of Poverty in Municipal Areas’ (MEPMA), Anganwadi workers and resource persons (RPs), have been appointed to conduct the ‘survey of illiterate persons above 18 years’ between February 24 and March 4.

HYDERABAD: Though the Companies Act mandates the appointment of at least one woman director on each company’s board, a majority of them end up having bringing on board their female relatives or friends who do not add much value, said women leaders.

“By virtue of my position, I have been an independent director on many company boards and have often seen that women tend to keep quiet. But when I speak out, many people feel that I am talking too much...which is unfair,” Anju Sharma, principal secretary, higher and technical education, Gujarat, said while addressing participants at the ISB Diversity Inclusion Summit here on Friday.

She pointed out that there is no effective inclusion as most of these women board members are family or friends who often do not even turn up for meetings. Some of the women leaders pointed out that having a gender balanced board helps companies more when gender diversity is an accepted notion in a society. “If a culture accepts diversity, it will accept diverse ideas and innovative flows …,” Srividya Ramakrishnan, senior director, head (process engineering API), Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, said.

Even WE-Hub CEO Deepthi Ravula pointed out that an enabling environment has to be created for women to work and grow in their careers. “Many of the government schemes offer incentives and subsidies for women but they have been unable to avail them,” she said, adding that the idea of setting up WE-Hub was to creat a space where a woman can comfortably walk in and pursue her entrepreneurial ventures.

Sangeeta Kumar, senior vice-president (operations) Bank of America, stressed the importance of providing flexibility to women and creating a support ecosystem for women to able to grow in an organisation.

The injured people have been admitted to a government hospital in Satara, two of whom ae reportedly serious. The accident took place at the “S” spot in the ghat, which is on the steep slope and has a sharp turn. Police are yet to record statements of the victims as there are no eye-witnesses. Police have got some preliminary information about the accident from truck driver Teldurai.

Satara police said that the truck, which had a borewell machinery installed in it, was going from Wai to Khandala. When the truck was crossing a tunnel at the Khambataki ghat, the driver lost control of the vehicle. The truck dashed into the protection wall in the ghat and turned turtle.

While the driver sustained minor injuries, others in the truck—mostly the workers— got trapped under the heavy pipes and the borewell machinery. Inspector at Khandala police station Hanmant Gaikwad said that driver had claimed that the gear box of the truck unexpectedly stopped working. Preliminary investigation suggests that most of the injured workers are from Tamil Nadu. Police are trying to contact their family and relatives.

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has proposed a tunnel at the Khambatki ghat, which will eliminate the treacherous “S” curve situated on a steep gradient, which has earned the dubious distinction of an accident spot. The tendering process of the work is in the final stage. Around 30 hectare of land will have to be acquired for the proposed tunnel.

Most of the land needed for the tunnel is used for agricultural activities. The Satara district administration has initiated the process for land acquisition.

The head of Aurangabad Smart City Development Corporation Ltd. (ASCDCL), Astik Kumar Pandey, briefed Kunal Kumar, joint secretary and mission director of Smart Cities Mission Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Government of India, on Thursday about various projects and decisions, taken for the smart city project.

Among other details, the ASCDCL informed Kumar about the decision taken to cover the bus service against any financial crisis. The Smart City Bus Service introduced by the ASCDCL comprises 100 buses and caters to to the areas under the municipal corporation.

Considering the gap between the income and expenditure in the operation of the service, the funds have been set aside for the operation and maintenance of the 100 buses.

In addition, 150 bus shelters are being established in the city under the Smart City Bus Service through a private-public partnership model for which ASCDCL had to make no capital expenditure. These shelters are estimated to earn revenue of Rs 10 crores over 15 years.

BIJNOR: Over six years after a man threw acid on a minor girl’s face, a court here has sentenced him to life imprisonment. The additional district and sessions court also imposed a penalty of Rs 25,000 on the convict, Kapil, and directed that Rs 20,000 from it be given to the victim, whose face has been completely disfigured. According to the victim’s family, Kapil was following and harassing the girl for several days. And when she spurned his advances, he attacked her.

On the night of February 11, 2014 Kapil scaled the wall of the girl’s house in Dudhali village when all the members of her family were sleeping and threw acid on her. The girl’s face, chest and eyes were burnt in the attack and she was admitted to Bijnor’s district hospital. Later, she was shifted to a Meerut hospital for advanced treatment. But her face was disfigured permanently, a family member said.

During the course of investigation, the girl alleged that Kapil raped her with help of his wife Bala Devi. It prompted police to press rape charges against Kapil and he was also booked under POCSO Act.

Vinish Kumar, special public prosecutor, said, “After hearing the case, justice Om Prakash Verma took a serious view of the crime and awarded life imprisonment. However, the judge acquitted Kapil of rape. His wife Bala Devi was discharged of all charges.”

In a similar case, additional district and sessions judge Baljore Singh awarded 10-year imprisonment to a man convicted for throwing acid on a girl.

According to the prosecution, Arjun Kumar threw acid on a girl in Bijnor’s Suhagpur village on October 16, 2016. He was booked and arrested on a complaint filed by her brother. Additional district government counsel Ritesh Kumar said, “Apart from the sentencing, the court also imposed a fine of Rs 16,000 on the convict.”

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

445,['7/03/2020'],Maharashtra: ‘1 per cent stamp duty cut likely to push up property sales’,"Finance minister Ajit Pawar

MUMBAI: In his maiden budget on Friday, finance minister Ajit Pawar announced 1% concession for the next two years in stamp duty and registration of documents to 5% from 6%. The concession will be applicable in Mumbai Metropolitan Region and civic corporation areas of Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Nagpur.

The decision, which will result in a Rs 1,800 crore decline in revenue for the state government, comes on the back of an increase in revenue collection from stamp duty and registration.

While the government had set a target of Rs 27,000 crore for 2019-20, it managed to collect Rs 29,500 crore—a jump of Rs 2,500 crore. The increase is despite the slowdown in real estate.

Pawar said the cut would encourage citizens to buy property and the government may collect more revenue through increase in sales.

Niranjan Hiranandani, president, NAREDCO, said this would effectively result in 4% stamp duty and 1% Metro cess. “Any cost reduction is welcome, though the industry bodies had sought a 50% reduction. This move will positively impact home buyer sentiment. I appreciate the concern shown by the state government to help home buyers as also the real estate Industry,” said Hiranandani.

The developer said the shortfall in state revenue should be recovered via alternative avenues as also the impact of expected multiplier sales.

Nayan Shah, president, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India-Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry, said though the reduction was marginal, it was a welcome decision. “It will benefit the middle-class segment in buying properties and even boost sales,” he said.

Sunit Gupta, an expert in property valuation, said the reduction is a mild benefit and is unlikely to boost sales.

“Between 2003-13, prices of properties have shot up 10 times while incomes have grown two to three times. How many people earn enough to buy a Rs 1.5-Rs 2 crore property?” Gupta said the government must appoint contractors and build affordable housing to bring down prices and boost sales.

Nashik: The Bombay high court on Wednesday will decide on the unopposed election of BJP candidate Ganesh Gite as standing committee chairperson of Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ).

As per norms, the result should be declared immediately if there is only one person in fray for the elections. However, the returning officer clarified that since there is directive of the court to send details of the elections in a closed envelope, he will follow the order.

Of the 16 new members of the standing committee, 12 members were present — 9 from BJP and one each from NCP, MNS and Congress. Four members from Sena, however, remained absent.

447,['7/03/2020'],Farmers get Rs156cr from insurance,"Nashik: District farmers , who had insured their crops, have got Rs 156 crore from insurance companies after their crops were damaged during monsoon.

“Insurance companies have settled the claims of the farmers. The claims were raised with the company due to heavy rainfall that damaged the kharif crop during monsoon,” a senior official from the district administration said.

“The district administration has been appealing to the farmers to insure their crop by paying a paltry premium. The central and state governments pay a larger share of the premium,” he added.

During monsoon, the district received very heavy rainfall owing to which most of the crops were damaged. Following this, the revenue and agriculture departments of the state government conducted panchanama and the reports were presented to the state government and insurance companies.

The state government had also announced an aid of Rs 8,000 per hectare for farmers whose crops were damaged by rain.

With Rs 39.2 crore for 35,000 farmers, Baglan tops the list of farmers getting the maximum insurance money.

Over 28,000 farmers in Malegaon taluka got Rs 26.86 crore is second on the list followed by Sinnar taluka where Rs 15.04 crore has been disbursed to around 16,000 farmers.

“Every farmer on an average received Rs 10,000. The insurance company takes into consideration the climate and other issues before deciding on the claim,” the official said.

“Generally, the farmers turn a blind eye towards crop insurance as premium is high and they hardly get anything in return. This year, however, proved to be different. Hence, more of us will now opt for crop insurance. We requested the government and the companies to settle the claims faster so that farmers can take the insurance on priority,” Ramesh Kale, a beneficiary from Malegaon, said.

NAGPUR: An artist is endowed with the quality of visualization of an object not many posses, and translate it into an artwork, said writer Vasant Abaji Dahake on Thursday.

He was speaking at the annual exhibition organized by Government College of Art and Design (GCAD), Laxmi Nagar, that was inaugurated by mayor Sandip Joshi .

Dahake said turning even a not-so-important article into a beautiful piece of art is the hallmark of a good painter. “Looking and watching are two different things. An artist’s look is different. A layman just looks at what is happening around while an artist’s observation is minute that gives shape to his imagination on the canvas,” he said.

To watch is to churn and perceive things in a different way. It is important to look at a painting beyond the work of art, colours, lines and shapes. It is time to appreciate creativity and the thought process that goes into the making of an artwork, Dahake remarked.

At times, paintings look simple but the vision behind it is impeccable. Paintings explain the pains or beauty of life, depending on how it is perceived, he said.

In his address, Joshi said, “We all are artists in some way or the other. Some are born talented while others cultivate the art by overcoming the bane of lack of confidence. Budding artists should never lose sight of their goal to become successful.”

Much to the delight of artists and art lovers, the mayor announced that the entire passage of Suresh Bhat Sabhagruh will be provided to display their works. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation will extend every possible help to nurture talent in the field of art, craft and design, he said.

On display at the exhibition are handwork, caricatures, illustrations, photographs and paintings, besides others, all prepared by the students of various departments of the college. The exhibition will conclude on Sunday.

Nine students of GCAD, each from the branches of applied art, paintings, and art training, were felicitated for their contribution to the field.

GCAD dean Vinod Mankar, Kalavrunda chairman Sanjay Jathar, exhibition in charge Santosh Khadse , lady representative Vidhi Khandelwal , general secretary Pratik Kumbhare and cultural head Aniket Amle were seated on the dais.

The programme was conducted by professors Vikas Joshi and Mrunal Johrapurkar.

450,['7/03/2020'],"Global growth may be cut by up to 0.4%, warns ADB study","(Representative image: Reuters)

NEW DELHI: The coronavirus outbreak is likely to have a global impact of $77 billion to $347 billion or 0.1% to 0.4% of world GDP (gross domestic product), a study by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has shown. Two-thirds of the impact will be felt by China, the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak.

The outbreak will have a significant impact on developing Asian economies through numerous channels, including sharp declines in domestic demand, lower tourism and business travel, trade and production linkages, supply disruptions, and health effects, according to a new analysis by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

In a moderate scenario, where precautionary behaviors and restrictions such as travel bans start easing 3 months after the outbreak intensified and restrictions were imposed in late January, global losses could reach $156 billion, or 0.2% of global GDP. China would account for $103 billion of those losses—or 0.8% of its GDP. The rest of developing Asia would lose $22 billion, or 0.2% of its GDP.

“There are many uncertainties about COVID-19, including its economic impact,” said ADB chief economist Yasuyuki Sawada. “This requires the use of multiple scenarios to provide a clearer picture of potential losses. We hope this analysis can support governments as they prepare clear and decisive responses to mitigate the human and economic impacts of this outbreak.”

The demand shocks can spill over to other sectors and economies via trade and production linkages. China is now the world’s second-largest economy, and accounts for one third of global growth.

“Thus, a drop in demand for goods and services from China is likely to be felt widely. Shocks to final demand—in this case, tourism demand and domestic consumption—are transmitted across sectors and borders via trade and production linkages,” the report said.

Tourism arrivals and receipts in many developing Asian economies are expected to decline sharply, as a result of numerous travel bans as well as precautionary behavior. One of the most significant travel bans is the one imposed by China itself. This ban, which remains in effect, affects 55% of China’s total outbound tourism.

In addition, at least 47 economies have imposed bans on travel to and from China, including Australia, the United States, and the Russian Federation.

Many airlines have suspended or sharply curtailed flights to China as well. It is likely that China will see a decline in tourist arrivals by at least as large as the 7.7% year-on-year decline it experienced in 2003 during the SARS outbreak.

As for the rest of developing Asia, even without explicit bans on travel to other Asian economies, non-Chinese tourist arrivals are likely to decline as tourists avoid traveling in the region. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, for example, Southeast and East Asian economies such as Indonesia, Thailand, and the Republic of Korea all saw declines in arrivals from economies outside Asia.

The total outlay of the development plan of Mahalaxmi temple is Rs 79 crore. Earlier, the state government had released Rs 8 crore through which the work of the multi-level parking system near the temple has bee taken up. The development plan also includes construction of Darshan mandap, multi-level parking facilities and developing sanitation and lodging facilities for worshippers.

District guardian minister Satej Patil said, “The allocation of funds for several works has been approved and will be released as and when the works are taken up. At first, we are trying to take up those works which have a clear blueprint. Since some people have opposed to the site proposed for the construction of the Darshan mandap, we have decided to shift its location. In the coming year, we will initiate the work of the multi-level parking facility proposed at Venus Corner.”

He further said that he would ensure that the funds allocated for restoring the roads damaged by the floods last year were released at the earliest.

Patil said that he had proposed a memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar at Mangaon village where Shahu Maharaj had introduced the social reformer to people 100 years ago. He added that the state government was going to release funds to celebrate the centenary year of the historic Mangaon Parishad.

The design of the memorial complex of Shahu Maharaj at Shahu Mill’s abandoned site in Rajamrampuri is ready. The estimates have to be freshly worked out. However, the administrative issues such as transferring the land from the textile corporation to Kolhapur Municipal Corporation would have to be worked out before starting the work.

BIJNOR: The Allahabad high court on Friday stayed a Bijnor ADM court order directing administration to recover Rs 2.2 lakh from four persons accused of damaging properties in clashes which erupted during protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the district on December 20 last year.

A division bench consisting of Justices Manoj Mishra and Deepak Verma also issued notice to the UP government and fixed April 20 as the next date of hearing, said VM Zaidi, senior lawyer representing the four accused.

Former Bijnor civic body chairman Javed Aftab along with three others Parvez Aftab, Shahadat Ali and Mirza Zeeshan Beg had moved the high court against the recovery orders. They were asked to pay Rs 2.2lakh collectively after being “found guilty” of damaging properties in an investigation. Zaidi argued in the court that additional district magistrate (ADM) does not have the power to issue such a recovery notice.

Earlier, the high court had granted anticipatory bail to Aftab. Police had announced a reward of Rs 25,000 on him. Protesters were booked under various sections of IPC, including sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 323 (causing hurt), 353 (assault to deter public servant from discharge of duty), 336 (endangering life or personal safety), 427 (mischief causing damage), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance), 307 (attempt to murder), 188 (disobedience to order by public servant), and 120-B (criminal conspiracy).

In February, the court had stayed a similar recovery notice issued to a Kanpur man for damages done to public property. A bench of Justices Pankaj Naqvi and Saurabh Shyam Shamshery gave petitioner Mohammad Faizan interim relief in the case and stayed the notice issued by the ADM.

According to officials, 61 protesters were identified through videos and CCTV cameras and served recovery notices in Bijnor.

Bijnor’s ADM Avadesh Mishra, who issued the order, had earlier said, “We have passed the order to recover damages from 61 troublemakers in Bijnor. They were given several opportunities to prove their innocence. But, their arguments were hollow. We have now asked them to deposit the money to compensate for the losses within 15 days. Copies of the order have been provided to superintendent of police and SDMs to comply with.”

The development has seen NMC stopping its online property and water tax paying services.

The civic body had tied up with the bank for all its online tax payments being deposited in the private bank account. “Hundreds of taxpayers opt for payment of their taxes online. NMC is not keen to continue its tie-up with the bank and we have decided to immediately stop the online payment services for the brief period during which we shall work out a tie-up with another bank, preferably a state-owned one,” said an NMC source, who didn’t wish to be named.

The body has 22 civic facility centres (CFC) with Yes Bank for their online tax paying services. These CFCs, which were manned by the bank employees, too were involved in the collection of property and water taxes and deposit it in the civic body’s account.

According to the NMC sources, Rs 135 out of Rs 310 crore are the payment from their online services. The remaining Rs 175 crore are funds from various state and central government schemes like Amrut, Prime Minister Awaas Yojana and Mukane dam scheme.

After the RBI’s ruling, NMC has now started deploying its own manpower for collection of the taxes from customers.

With the last month of the present fiscal on, there is huge pressure on the civic officials to speedily garner property and water taxes so that the civic body could meet its target for tax collection for 2019-20. “The Yes Bank issue will be important for us to collect taxes as much as possible. But we will tackle this problem fast,” said the NMC official.

With RBI putting a moratorium on the bank, it would be an anxious wait till April 3 for both bodies. “Fortunately, the NMC withdrew its fixed deposits worth around Rs 200 crore some time back. Or else this substantial amount would have also stuck in the process,” the NMC official said.

According to sources in NMSCDCL, Rs 14.71 crore that is stuck in the bank is mainly used for disbursement of salaries of its staff and other establishments costs. “Earlier, funds meant for smart city projects amounting to Rs 450 crore was also in the bank account. But we had withdrawn that amount and opened a new account in State Bank of India (SBI). Had this money still stayed in the account it would have become difficult to pay to the contractors for different smart city projects,” said officials.

Thousands of panic-stricken Yes Bank customers made a beeline in all the five branches of the city to withdraw their money. “I have around Rs seven lakh in my savings accounts. I had to use this amount for my business, but sudden restrictions on transactions have put me in a tight spot. I hope restrictions will be lifted soon,” said Makrand Joshi, a customer.

457,['7/03/2020'],KMC may revoke ban on construction in previously flooded areas,"Kolhapur: The ban on construction might be revoked soon, however, only after the projects are studied properly.

The construction have been banned since the floods last year.

Civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti said, “We have not yet taken the decision to revoke the ban. We have listed the hearings with the developers. We will ensure that the people coming to live there will not face inconvenience during unprecedented incidents such as floods.”

According to the civic officials, over 86 projects, for which the layouts were approved, have been stuck and it is affecting the developers who want their projects to be completed within the deadline. The investors also want housing units on time.

The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) is going to mark the new flood lines fixed by the irrigation department on its development plan. According to the civic officials, several hectare of the land is added under the new blue line. It is the line at the side of the river bank where no construction is allowed

The flood lines—blue line and red lines—depicts the extent to which the floods have occurred. The KMC gives permission within the blue line and the red line, but with several conditions to ensure the safety of the inhabitants.

The irrigation department has marked the green line considering it as the extent to which the floods have reached in August last year. The developers have said that the green line is not a part of the government rules and have been introduced for the first time which may complicate things.

Dipak Mhaisekar, the divisional commissioner, has said that he will refer to the satellite images of August and check the extent to which the floods had reached. Corresponding the images with the flood lines marked by the irrigation department, Mhaisekar will present his report to the state government.

458,['7/03/2020'],Centre for excellence to be set up in Aurangabad’s govt engineering college,"Aurangabad: In the financial budget, the state on Friday announced the setting up of a centre for excellence (CFE) at the Government Engineering College, Aurangabad (GECA).

Authorities said that it will be one of the 12 centres of excellence to come up at the government engineering, polytechnic and ITI colleges across the state.

Sources in the technical education department said that the sanctioning of CFE is the result of GECA sending a proposal in this regard to the state government through the Director of Technical Education.

With the sanctioning of CFE, the GECA will get an independent building and the CFE would act as a nodal centre for different streams and colleges from across the region inclined for carrying out inter-disciplinary project.

GECA principal Pranesh Murnal told TOI, “CFE will be an inter-disciplinary centre for research, development, innovation and incubation, involving inter-disciplinary traits of mechanical, civil, electronics and computer science.”

He further said that the research areas and research projects will have ‘condition monitoring of plant machinery and structures’ aimed at getting defined outcome.

GECA has a strength of about 2,200 undergraduates, post-graduates and research scholars, assistants and fellows.

Faculties at the college believe that with the setting up of CFE at GECA, it will attract research talent that otherwise used to go elsewhere for carrying out research studies.

As per the plan drafted by the GECA, professional industrial houses keen on carrying inter-disciplinary research and development would be roped in by creating win-win situations. “R&D is a costly affair. Having a tie up with GECA will bring down the research cost to an all-time low and, at the same time, the research students will also get to work on the same,” said a faculty member of the GECA.

Other colleges from the region, too, are excited about GECA bagging CFE and are looking at it as an opportunity for not only promoting research and innovation but also for producing highly qualified and skilled manpower. Maulana Azad college’s head of M.Sc (industrial chemistry) department, Dr. Mohammed Asef said, “Having CFE at GECA will act as a game changer. It will give edge to the entire region by readily providing research and development for the industries and also providing researchers to the multi national companies investing in Aurangabad.”

KOLKATA: Rabindra Bharati University vice-chancellor Sabyasachi Basu Ray Chaudhury resigned on Friday evening after the university landed in a controversy over photos of youngsters with cuss words painted on their bodies during Basanta Utsav on its BT Road campus. The photos were uploaded on social media.Education minister Partha Chatterjee , however, said he would not accept the resignation . “The RBU vicechancellor has committed no mistake,” he said. Sources said Chatterjee was trying to reach the VC with a request to withdraw his resignation.Within hours of the celebrations, photos were uploaded on Facebook and other platforms, where young girls and boys were seen with cuss words—one even distorting a Rabindranath Tagore song—written on their back and body in aabir. A video showing them dancing to a vulgar parody of a Tagore song added to the controversy.A source said the VC emailed his resignation to Chatterjee following an altercation with other university officials on Friday evening over security lapses during the celebration. Though the university had issued 50,000 passes, a far larger crowd reportedly entered the campus. Matters were compounded when Trinamool students’ and staff union members entered his office and allegedly questioned the university’s decision to lodge an FIR against the students. Earlier in the evening, the VC had said he would place the matter at the executive council meeting to decide whether the university would allow outsiders on the campus from next year or not after RBU students alleged outsiders were involved.RBU authorities were flooded with complaints on Friday morning, forcing Basu Roy Choudhury to decide to lodge a complaint at the Sinthee police station. RBU registrar Subir Maitra lodged the complaint, detailing the incident and stating how “the miscreants had no respect for Gurudev and his creations” and that the incident was “tantamount to violation of modesty” of other women at Basantotsav. The university, the complaint stated, was ready to help police, even with CCTV footage of campus. “We are trying to check whether the photos are original or morphed. So, we had to file an FIR,” Basu Roy Choudhury said. Joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma confirmed about the RBU complaint and said they were looking at legal angles.By afternoon, three girls and two boys, all of them from Hooghly, visited the university, claiming the authorities had summoned them. RBU officials and cops, however, remained tight-lipped about their identity, though some claimed they were from Chandernagore, Serampore and Bandel and studied in colleges there. The five, accompanied by their parents, were taken to the Sinthee police station, where their statements were recorded. Sources said while one girl reportedly apologized, another claimed several others were on the spot and that she did not get anything obscene written on her back. One who spoke to media said they were sorry but that several others had obscene words written on their back. “We became viral may be because our photos were shared online. We should not have been singled out,” she said.Linguist and educationist Nrisingha Prasad Bhaduri described it as “an act of perversion”. “This cultural decay is leading to social disintegration. This form of exhibitionism is an insult to our rich culture,” he said. Educationist Amal Mukhopadhyay called the incident unfortunate, especially since it happened during Dol utsav. “They have been disrespectful towards Tagore, who was the founder of Basanta Utsav,” he said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74521174,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-881132,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rbu-vc-resigns-after-basanta-utsav-row/articleshow/74520292.cms

Jaipur: Panic-stricken Yes Bank customers on Friday rushed to ATMs and tried to make online transfers, but to no avail.

Some who could make it early to bank branches with cheques could get the monthly limit of Rs 50,000, but several others were not as lucky despite the government assuring that their money in the troubled bank is safe.

Long queues were witnessed in some branches with frantic customers cursing their decision to put the money just for an increased amount of interest on savings accounts.

In Ashok Nagar branch, the situation was like everything was sold off, and the shopkeeper throwing off the hands as if there is nothing more left. The bank staff were not even willing to listen to people and willing to answer their desperate questions.

Siddharth Sharma, who works in a private hospital and has a salary account in the beleaguered bank, said that his colleagues were anxious as to what will happen to their money and how to meet immediate expenses.

“Fortunately, I could withdraw the fixed Rs 50,000 limit from a Tonk road branch. A long queue was already there and I had to wait for half an hour,” Sharma said.

Many returned empty handed. A customer in the Ashok Nagar branch of the bank said it was like a shop closed. “Nobody was even willing to answer the queries,” said the customer.

The bank officials were also not available for comment and they said they have nothing to add to what has already been announced by the government.

464,['7/03/2020'],Roads in markets likely to be revamped,"Aurangabad: The allocation of Rs 1,000 crore for Urban Road Development for improving roads in market areas has come as a fresh ray of hope for Aurangabad city.

The commercial areas of Aurangabad, especially Gulmandi and Shahgunj, where the roads are in a sad state, are likely to look different in the future.

In his Friday’s budget speech, state finance minister Ajit Pawar said the government will carry out construction of 40,000km of roads under the rural road development scheme with an outlay of Rs 1,501 crore over a period of four years.

Pawar said that the roads in market areas under municipal corporations, municipal councils and in small cities will be improved under the state’s urban road development scheme, for which Rs 1,000 crore will be set aside.

Incidentally, the old and traditional market areas of the city including Aurangapura, Gulmandi, Rangargalli, Kumbharwada, City Chowk, Shahgunj and Roshan Gate area are suffering for bad roads for the last several years. The businessmen in these areas say that due to potholed roads, the residents are not willing to visit the market which eventually affects their clientele.

When reached out for reaction, city mayor Nandkumar Ghodele of the Shiv Sena, which is the ruling party in the state, said Pawar announced the scheme while keeping Aurangabad city in mind.

“We will definitely make the most of the scheme and get sufficient funds from the government for improving the roads,” said the mayor.

According MNS functionary Nutan Jaiswal, the market areas have long been neglected for long by the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and that immediate attention is needed.

“The Aurangapura vegetable market road and the road in front of Pranav Plaza have been constructed around four decades ago. A year-and-a-half ago, we had held an agitation asking the AMC to construct the road, but they carried out temporary repairs,” he said.

Jaiswal added that roads in almost all the main markets in the city need to be repaired.

BIJNOR: The bail application of a man booked and put behind bars for his alleged role in clashes and vandalism during anti-CAA protest in Nahtaur on December 20 last year was rejected by a court on Friday.

Over 1,000 people were booked after the violence which had left two protesters dead in the district.

The accused, Qamar Ahmed , has been lodged in Bijnor jail. He moved the bail application before the additional district and sessions court a few days ago. The hearing took place on Thursday and order released on Friday.

Arguing in the court, additional district government counsel public prosecutor Sanjeev Verma said, “The accused was arrested from the spot and illegal weapon and sword were recovered from his possession. He was part of the mob which attacked Nahtaur police station on December 20 and burnt police jeep, a car and vehicles here. The mob even opened fire and their bullet killed Anas. Therefore, crime is serious. That is why bail should be rejected.”

On the other hand, lawyer of defendant argued, “All the facts have been fabricated. He was trapped in false cases. Several serious sections of IPC were included in the FIR during investigation. Defendant is innocent.”

After hearing both the sides, judge Sanjeev Pandey rejected the bail pleas of the protester. Last month, the court had rejected the bail pleas of 37 protesters in Bijnor and Nahtaur.

HYDERABAD: The high court on Friday concluded the hearing into various PILs questioning the proposal to demolish the existing Secretariat and build a new one in its place. A division bench, comprising Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy, has reserved the judgment.

Congress leaders Jeevan Reddy and A Revanth Reddy, Padmanabha Reddy from Forum for Good Governance and professor P L Visweswara Rao from Telangana Jana Samithi had filed the pleas, contending that the state is planning to spend Rs 400 crore for raising new Secretariat when the current buildings are strong enough to last for another five decades.

State, on its part, contended that the existing Secretariat buildings are devoid of many essential safety requirements and are not capable of reflecting the stature of the new and dynamic State of Telangana. We will have an iconic structure, a modern administrative complex that will have state of the art facilities in tune with the modern day administrative needs,” said advocate general BS Prasad.

This is a key policy decision of the state and hence courts should stay away from reviewing it as long as they do not offend the spirit of the constitution, he said, urging the court to allow them to go ahead as they have already vacated the current structure.

Senior counsel S Satyam Reddy, advocates Chikkudu Prabhakar, B Rachna Reddy and Rajnikanth Reddy argued the cases of the petitioners contending that this is waste of public money. The judgment was reserved.

Nashik: City-based developers questioned the alleged discrimination by the state government after the latter announced 1% reduction in stamp duty registration to boost real estate sector in four cities — Mumbai, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Nagpur.

The builders have expressed disappointment over Nashik not being part of the list and reminded that the real estate sector in Nashik is also going through a rough patch.

Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (CREDAI), Nashik, has now decided to meet district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for including Nashik in the list of beneficiaries.

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar announced 1% reduction in stamp duty while presenting the state budget for the financial year 2020-21 on Friday. He said that this benefit is being given to promote realty sector in the four aforesaid cities.

“The slowdown in realty sector is across the Maharashtra and not in any particular region. We are not against the move, but it should have been applicable for entire Maharashtra,” Umesh Wankhede, president of CREDAI Nashik, said.

“Nashik’s realty sector is passing through a very bad phase due to economic slowdown and various other reasons. At this juncture, excluding Nashik from such benefit is harassment and injustice,” he added.

Wankhede said that every time injustice is meted out to Nashik due to lack of political mileage. “We will immediately meet district guardian minister (Bhujbal) and urge him to look into the issue and ensure that Nashik also gets benefit of stamp duty reduction,” he said.

The state president of Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture Santosh Mandlecha also expressed disappointment over Nashik being excluded from the stamp duty reduction benefit. “It is really unfortunate that the finance minister has ignored Nashik,” he said.

Last year, during floods, textile mill owners incurred damages around Rs 125 crore after over 400 textile units housing around 4,000 power-looms were shut down.

Satish Koshti, president of Ichalkaranji power-loom association, said, “The sector is going through the worst phase since last six years due to the bad policies such as demonetisation. Earlier, the subsidy grant was reduced by Rs 1.22 per unit which further affected the sector badly and investment was totally stalled further causing job losses in the sector which provides huge number of employment to people. With increase in the subsidy, more money will be saved.”

Meanwhile, industrialists are not happy with reduction in duty on power consumption from 9.3% to 7.5%. Energy minister Nitin Raut has claimed that it will lead to loss of Rs 2,500 to the state exchequer, but will help the ailing core industries.

Atul Patil, president of Shirol Manufacturers Association, said, “Reduction in duty will not lead to overall savings in power bill. We expected reduction in the tariff charges which stands at average Rs 12 per unit — highest in India.”

KOLKATA: Five of the seven people arrested by Kolkata Police for reportedly shouting the “Goli maaro” slogan while walking to the Amit Shah rally last Sunday were granted bail on Friday.

While one of the seven will appear before court on Saturday, another person was granted bail the very next day of being arrested on the grounds of his advanced age and poor health. An eighth person was also arrested by the Howrah Police.

Defence lawyer Subhajit Ball said bail secured by almost all the accused only showed the case was “politically motivated” with no evidence that they had said anything provocative in nature.

But investigator, however, pointed out that the accused getting bail would not affect the overall probe. “All the accused arrested are active BJP workers. They had attended the Sunday rally and were clearly seen shouting the “Goli maaro” slogan,” an officer said. Kolkata police had earlier released foottage, in which where several people were reportedly seen raising the objectionable slogan. According to sources, police have identified around 25 people shouting the slogan.

State general secretary of Bengal BJP Sayantan Basu had earlier criticised the arrests, claiming that the word “gaddar (traitor)” was not aimed at any particular community. “Why are they being prejudiced in thinking that the word, ‘traitor’, was aimed at one particular community? We believe in calling a spade a spade,” he had said.

479,['7/03/2020'],State earmarks Rs 200cr for water-grid project in region,"Aurangabad: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who also holds the portfolio of finance, said that the state government has earmarked Rs 200 crore for the Marathwada water-grid project during the presentation of the annual budget on Friday. The corpus allocated by the state government is much lower than the estimated cost of the project, which is around Rs 22,000 crore.

Upset with the paltry amount sanctioned by the government, BJP leader and former water supply minister Babanrao Lonikar has threatened to move the court. He told TOI, “Allotting a meagre sum of Rs 200 crore against the total requirement of about Rs 22,000 crore for the water grid project is injustice to both the farmers and residents in the region.”

During a high-level review meeting at the Aurangabad revenue divisional commissioner office on January 30, Pawar had expressed concerns about the feasibility of the project running into several thousand crores. He had specifically raised questions about the exorbitant power bills that commoners and farmers would have to pay for getting water.

Former professor at the Water and Land Management Institute and water expert Pradeep Purandare said that previously, Pawar had some scruples about the practicability of the water-grid project. Speculations were rife that the state government may scrap the project like the Jalyukt Yojana.

The success of the water grid project critically depends on getting water from Nandur Madhyameshwar & filling of 11 dams, which have been proposed for interlinking. There was no clarity in the finance minister’s speech about this factor.

“The provision made for the water-grid project is too meagre compared to the estimated cost. It appears to be a political allotment to buy time and keep politicians from Marathwada in good humour. The finance minister would do well if he stated things in a matter-of-fact way. Playing to the gallery ultimately proves costly both economically & politically.”

Lonikar has already executed a part of the water-grid project in and around his hometown. Of the 300 villages identified for the pilot project in Jalna district, 100 villages spread over Partur, Mantha and Jalna tehsils have started receiving 1,000 litre of filtered water for Rs 7. The money is collected by the respective gram panchayats and used for paying the power supply bills. The project also aims to set up solar power panels spread over 2,200 acre of land to bring down power bills.

Israel-based national water supply firm ‘Mekorot’, which has expertise in dealing with water crisis and droughts, studied the statistics of the last 35 years to check taluka-wise rainfall as well as availability of water in each of the medium and large water bodies across eight districts of Marathwada.

This was followed by a preparation of a detailed project report (DPR), for which a sum of Rs 22 crore was paid to Merokot. An MoU was also signed between then chief minister Devendera Fadnavis and the Israeli government.

Days before going for the assembly elections in August 2019, the BJP-led state government had cleared Rs 4,802 crore for the water-grid project in Beed district.

Recently, the Israeli firm submitted the DPR for Parbhani, Nanded and Hingoli districts to the state government but nothing concrete has been done in this direction

State finance minister Ajit Pawar’s announcement of one-time settlement scheme for farmers who had obtained crop loan of more than Rs 2 lakh between April 2015 and March 2019, is seen as a relief for several marginal farmers who have been stuck in the debt cycle.

Farmer activists demanded concrete steps to address the issue of farmer suicides, which seem to continues

Several of them from the region questioned the consecutive governments failure in fulfilling their promises of ensuring minimum support price (MSP) for agriculture produce. “Ensuring MSP to the farmers should resolve the majority of the financial problems faced by the farmers,” said Deepak Joshi, a farmer who is a part of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Shetkari Mandal.

Citing that about 80% of the state’s farmland is rain-fed, Joshi said, “Majority of the farmers from across Marathwada are rain-fed. Failing to address the key issues will fail to stop farmer suicides in the state.”

The announcement of giving Rs 50, 000 to the farmers punctually paying crop loans up to June 30, 2020, has brought relief to some farmers as well. “

We appreciate the government’s move of announcing Rs 50, 000 to the farmers punctually paying the crop loans. This should motivate more farmers to repay the amount, but there is still the question about making the farmers self-sufficient,” said farmer leader Jayajirao Suryawanshi, who heads Annadata Shetkari Sanghatna.

The farmer leader said that due to the frequent crop failures which often results from erratic climatic conditions prevent farmers from repaying the crop loans.

The farming community expected the government to announce about fulfilling their the promise of making farmers’ 7/12 extracts free of hypothecation (where a debtor gives collateral to secure a debt) , but there was nothing specific spoken about it, said the farmers.

NAGPUR: With artificial intelligence (AI) gaining ground it is important for the new generation to embrace it else face the possibility of being left out of the loop of this domain that is brimming with information, said Sheela Siddappa, chief adviser of Bosch, on Friday.

She was delivering the inaugural address on the first day of two-day International AI Summit 2.0 organized by the Centre of Excellence of GH Raisoni College of Engineering (GHRCE) on AI and machine learning (ML) at its Hingna facility.

Analytics director at Cognizant Technology Services Satish Raghavendran, Ajay Chaudhary, Rahul Deshmukh, GHRCE director Sachin Untawale and event coordinators professor A Thomas and Prashant Borkar were present. Manish Nair and Priyanka Sharma were the anchors.

Siddappa focused on expanding the sphere of AI and why one should adapt to it. She said, “AI is certainly not that field which is going to die down soon. There is no dearth of opportunities for the next 50+ years. Once you enter this area, you can have access to latest information.”

She encouraged students to discover existing problems and innovate solutions from their own base.

Raghavendran exhorted students to build intellectual muzzle to generate ideas that would provide a breakthrough. “Look for problem statements in your areas of work. You need to possess the knack of focusing on right problems and have abundant curiosity. Keep it alive and kindled to be supremely successful in future,” he said.

Workshops, panel discussions, keynote speeches and power talks were the among the sessions lined up on the first day of the summit.

In his welcome address, Untawale said, “We have seen a transition from telecommunications to AI. Being a mechanical engineer, I was always fond of various technologies being developed in the society. Through this summit, the experts will guide us on where the world is heading in terms of AI.”

“We are shifting from an outcome-based education system to an evidence-based structure of education. The basis of the former constitutes how a graduate is nurtured in an institution. The latter will have all these parameters of AI and data sciences which will be required for the education of a student based on the evidence observed in teaching and learning processes,” he said.

Reading the preamble of the event, COE AI/ML in charge Gopal Sakarkar said there has been participation of more than 50 students from across Maharashtra. “The objective of holding the summit is to bring together industry, academia and research organizations to share knowledge and opportunities available in the emerging area of AI,” he said.

A book titled ‘Introduction to machine learning’, authored by Sakarkar, Nilesh Shelke and Narendra Chaudhary , was released by the guests.

HYDERABAD: The high court on Friday closed two pleas filed separately by Congress MP A Revanth Reddy and his brother following an assurance that the state would follow due process in respect to the 6.5 acre land at Gopanpalli of Ranga Reddy district being claimed by the brothers.

Citing media reports, the brothers said the state may dispossess them from the land any time.

They claimed that they had bough the land from third parties and are in possession of it since 2005. They also admitted in their petition that there are disputes over the title of the land and some cases are pending before a civil court on the same.

Advocate General B S Prasad told Justice A Rajasheker Reddy who was hearing the pleas that the brothers came to court with mere apprehensions. The state has not contemplated any such action as of now. They are referring to an internal communication sent by the RDO to the district collector over the status of the land and their fears stemmed from this communication.

This is an internal communication and this cannot be the basis for the current litigation, the AG said. If the state prefers to act on the land, it would certainly notify the petitioners since they are claiming to be owners of the land, he said.

Recording this assurance, the high court closed the writ petitions.

PUNE: Panic and furrowed brows were on display as depositors besieged Yes Bank branches and ATMs from Friday morning following the Rs 50,000 cap on withdrawals imposed by the RBI.

With heavy online traffic as well, the bank’s servers were down, rendering facilities like NEFT, RTGS or even UPI inoperable. Before long, the branches and ATMs ran dry.

Worried depositors were seen arguing with bank staffers over the restriction on withdrawals, while also complaining about the non-functional internet banking services.

The bank’s Aundh branch, had a heavy crowd inside the premises as well as outside. Staffers tried to assure the crowd that the situation would normalize in a month. One ATM there was non-functional, while others had run out of cash. “It is the beginning of the month and our salaries have just been credited. My expenses are greater than Rs50,000 — I have EMIs and other bills to pay,” one depositor said.

An elderly depositor was unable to check her pension account balance, since the servers were down. “I only wanted to check my account balance but they are saying that servers are down. There is a frenzy here and people’s hard-earned money has been blocked for no fault of theirs,” she said.

It was a similar story at the Prabhat Road branch, where bank staffers had to down the shutters after cash supply ran out by lunchtime. “The ATM is not working either. No one is able to withdraw money. We are being told it will take a week for people to get their money,” a depositor said.

Staffers also tried to assure the depositors that the bank wouldn’t shut down. “But we are unsure about their promises,” the depositor added.

At the Dhole Patil Road branch, several bank staffers and security guards had formed a cordon around the premises. Guards were instructed to prevent people from going inside. “I have an account with the Market Yard branch. While I did not visit the branch, I did try to transfer money through UPI, but the payment failed as the servers were down,” Shaheen Ghasia, an NIBM Road resident, said.

Depositors of other banks too were affected, as they could not receive payments due to them. A depositor of Vishweshwar Sahakari Bank Limited said, “I had received a cheque from a Yes Bank depositor as payment against some goods. When I tried to deposit it in my bank, it was rejected. The staff told me that Yes bank cheques cannot be passed. I will have to ask for cash payment now.”

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation , which has deposits of over Rs 800 crore stuck in Yes Bank, on Friday said its operations would not be impacted.

Addressing a news conference on Friday, municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar said, “The civic body has deposits worth Rs4,000 crore in other banks. We keep the money in banks that offer the maximum rate of interest. We have reduced bank deposits in YES Bank from Rs1,100 crore to Rs800 crore. We have enough money to pay the bills at the end of the fiscal,” Hardikar said.

He said the civic body immediately stopped depositing civic money in Yes Bank after the Reserve Bank of India restrictions were announced on Friday. “We have routed the online transfer and cash collection to our principal banker — Bank of Baroda — from Friday,” said Hardikar.

On allegations by the opposition that the civic body’s decision to park its money in Yes Bank — after BJP came to power — has endangered the exchequer, Hardikar said, “PCMC had invited bids from various banks to know the rate of interest and other facilities. Yes Bank gave the maximum rate for swipe-in and swipe-out and also said that they will immediately conduct online transfer of money at the best terms. So an agreement was signed.”

He said PCMC had taken steps to limit their financial exposure after the RBI had imposed restrictions on the bank earlier. “In phases, the total deposits (in Yes Bank) have been reduced to Rs800 crore,” Hardikar said.

“The civic body should have deposited the taxes in nationalized banks. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had withdrawn its deposits from Yes Bank a month ago, when restrictions were first put on withdrawals.,” Shiv Sena corporator Rahul Kalate said.

486,['7/03/2020'],"Sequoia says Covid-19 “Black Swan” event, cautions founders","New Delhi: World’s top venture capital investor Sequoia Capital has cautioned its founders across the globe that the outbreak of Covid-19 is a “black swan” event, which could lead to slowing down of internet businesses across the world and also lead to a more cautious fundraising environment. The note by Sequoia, which has some of the top startups across the world like messaging application WhatsApp and payments player Stripe, is reminiscent of its RIP Good Times note to entrepreneurs in 2008 after the financial crisis post-Lehman bankruptcy.

“Some companies have seen their growth rates drop sharply between December and February. Several companies that were on track are now at risk of missing their Q1–2020 plans as the effects of the virus ripple wider……..In downturns, revenue and cash levels always fall faster than expenses,” said Sequoia in a Medium post on Thursday.

Sequoia is also the top venture capital firm in India with assets under management of over $4 billion. The firm is also in the process of raising its new pool of capital for India and Southeast Asia of about $1.2-1.3 billion, as TOI reported on January 24.

The firm has advised portfolio companies to extend their cash runways and to be prepared for a tougher fundraising cycle. “Private financings could soften significantly, as happened in 2001 and 2009,” said the firm.

Sequoia has suggested to its portfolio companies that they start cutting down on marketing expenditure, hedge their sales forecasts as customers might being cautious and control headcount to see if they can “evaluate critically whether you can do more with less and raise productivity.”

487,['7/03/2020'],2 cops held for bid to foil police action,"Aurangabad: Two police constables have been arrested by the Pathri police, Parbhani district, for allegedly opposing an assistant police inspector’s action against illegal sand trading.

Parbhani superintendent of police Krishnakant Upadhayay initiated the action against the policemen after the matter was brought to his notice. He suspended the constables, Haribhau Pawar and Bhagirath Jadhav, on Friday.

Purna Parbhani Pathri revenue circle has considerable amount of sand, resulting into illegal sand mining and trading by local mafia.

According to Pathri police authorities, assistant police inspector BR Tippalwad of Pathri police station had seized a heavy vehicle illicitly carrying sand in the wee hours of March 1. A panchanama was carried out and while the process for registering of offence was under way, the two constables requested the officer to not register the offence.

“After the requests of the constables were ignored, they allegedly started pestering the officer, resulting into a heated argument. The assistant inspector immediately made a station diary entry about the incident. This was followed by registering of offence against the owner of the heavy vehicle,” said police.

The station diary entry came to the notice of SP Upadhyay, who immediately ordered registration of offence against the constables for trying to shield sand mafia as well as attempting to prevent registration of offence against the suspects.

Police said that following directives of the superintendent of police, the cops were booked and immediately arrested. They were on Thursday produced before a court, which remanded them in a day’s police custody. The constables were again produced in court on Friday and remanded in judicial custody.

Sources said that taking cognizance of rising incidence of illegal sand trading in the district, the higher-ups in the police department have asked the police station chiefs to go all out against them and register offences, which are cognizable and non-bailable.

NAGPUR: Doctors of the city have suggested it will be better to opt for a dry Holi celebration this year, to avoid any viral infection, including novel coronavirus “I would advise skipping celebrating Holi this year,” said physician Dr Manish Jadhav. “Holi is a social festival. Large groups play colours together, but it takes just one infected person to start off the transmission,” he said, sounding caution.“It’s not just about playing with colours. I would suggest avoiding unnecessary trips to malls, markets, conferences, or any crowded public spaces during these holidays. We can’t keep track of all those we come across at public places, and infection can be transmitted by those exposed to the virus anywhere,” he added.Ayurvedic practitioner Vaidya Swanand Joshi said those who can’t skip Holi celebrations should get themselves ready with immunity boosters.“Having gulvel, ashwagandha, turmeric, olive, and other such medicines ahead of Holi may boost your immunity a bit. Simply adding a bunch of neem leaves to warm water while taking a bath could also be a good option,” he said.“Regarding playing Holi, I will still suggest not to use water, and instead playing only with dry, natural colours. Celebrating with known friends in close circle can keep us away from infections,” he added.Dr Manish Patil , president of Orange City Homeopaths Association (OCHA), also appealed to keep Holi eco-friendly and dry. “There is currently no vaccine to protect against COVID-19. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Asymptomatic people can also spread the infection, which is why social distancing and personal hygiene is important,” he said.“It is important for everyone to take precautions but there is no need to panic. The infection rate of coronavirus is very high but the mortality rate is very low compared to the regular flu virus. Everyone has to follow basic cleanliness and maintain good hygiene. It is important to follow a healthy diet and stay indoors if you are unwell,” said Dr Sameer Arbat, interventional pulmonologist.Large Holi gatherings and going house to house increases risk of infectionKeep celebrations within the family where no one has any symptomsDon’t involve anyone displaying signs of cold or fever in Holi celebrationsPractice personal hygiene and maintain distance from those who appear sickDon’t eat or drink water from unhygienic food joints, avoid non-veg foodAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74523400,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-284657,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/just-play-it-safe-doctors-prescribe-a-dry-holi/articleshow/74518897.cms
489,['7/03/2020'],Nagpur principals demand authority to change TCs,"NAGPUR: School principals are urging the government to grant them authority to amend details on transfer certificate (TC) for ex-students, as there is a ‘rush’ to do the same due to Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

On March 2, the deputy director of education (DDE) office too forwarded their request to its Pune headquarters, requesting appropriate action.

Principals say the current system, in which the education officer is the authority, is extremely tedious and cumbersome from an administrative point of view.

Zafar Khan, president of School Headmasters Charitable Association (SHCA), said, “We are witnessing a steady flow of ex-students coming to schools and seeking a change, mostly in their date of birth, while some seek spelling correction in names.” He added that the current guideline stipulates that schools prepare the application in a specified format and then forward the same to the district education officer.

“Then the education officer will give a date when the original school register has to be taken to his office, and that too by a staff member. The protocol is in place as the register is a very sensitive document and cannot be ferried by unauthorized personnel,” said Khan.

Office bearers of SHCA approached the DDE office in Nagpur, saying the only solution to this is to grant them the authority to make changes. “We cited a 2019 judgement of Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court, which mentions that principals can make the changes in TC. Hence, the state government must issue a GR based on the ruling and ensure that the process is simplified,” said Khan.

DDE office noted in its letter to Pune HQ that there seems to be a rush at schools for such changes due to CAA and NRC issue, hence the SHCA’s application may be acted upon appropriately.

My department is taking a report from the affected districts on an hourly basis. I assure the House that no affected farmer will be left unattended,” said Meghwal. He said that the Met department has predicted heavy rain and hailstorm in the next 48 hours, which may cause more damage.

Reacting on the statement, leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria urged the government to release the compensation amount to the affected villages in 15 days. “State has to set the deadline for Girdawari and the release of funds. I also urge the lawmakers who will be visiting their respective assembly segments during the Holi break, to visit the affected areas and collect information on the damaged crops,” said Kataria.

Jaipur: CM Ashok Gehlot has directed the minister’s incharge of districts affected by the hailstorm to meet the farmers on March 8.

The chief medical superintendents of two government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a report.Three doctors and two paramedic staff — the advanced life support (ALS) ambulance driver and the emergency medical technician (EMT) — had, at various stages, come in the chain of contact with the patient, a 57-year-old businessman who had returned from Iran. He tested positive for the novel coronavirus infection at RML.One doctor from District Combined Hospital in Sanjay Nagar has quarantined himself after he found out that a ward boy from his hospital was in the ambulance that had carried the patient from his home in Raj Nagar Extension to MMG District Hospital in Ghaziabad. The two other doctors, both from MMG District Hospital, have written to the chief medical superintendent and the chief medical officer asking if they should also go into isolation.The paramedics also have not been quarantined yet. Depending on how many patients they have attended to since, or people they have interacted with, several layers would have potentially got added to the chain of contact.“No norms were followed while moving the patient, who had recently returned from Tehran and had fever.

I am not staying with my family and have taken a room in the hospital,” he told TOI.Chief medical officer NK Gupta, however, said PPE kits were “not needed” in this case. “The ambulance staff was provided with N-95 masks because it was a suspected coronavirus case.

AMARAVATI: In what could be a perfect women’s day gift, the state government has reserved seven out of 13 Zilla Parishad chairperson posts to women.

Women were given six district ZPs when reservations were proposed based on 59% quota for reserved categories. The share of women has gone up in the new quota which was capped at 50 percent.

Ahead of the release of the election schedule, the state government has finalized reservations to the coveted Zilla Parishad chairperson posts on Friday.

Interestingly, three Rayalaseema districts--Kadapa, Chittoor and Kurnool--will get ZP chiefs from unreserved categories. This means that all the three districts will go into dominant upper caste groups. Ananthapuram district in the region has been reserved for BC woman.

Surprisingly, the home district of chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy and municipal administration minister Botcha Satyarayana were retained in the same categories--Unreserved General even in the new notification.

Panchayat raj commissioner Girija Shankar had issued the gazette notification of reservations on Friday.

Politically sensitive for YSRC, Krishna district has once again gone into the kitty of women (unreserved). The post was reserved for women (general) even in the previous elections . Although Krishna ZP chief was proposed for the BC category in the initial proposal when the total quota was 59 percent, it has gone to women (general) following the change in the quota.

The reservations to the top posts in rural local bodies were completely changed in a span of few months as the government had to trim the total quota for the reserved categories to 50 percent from the 59 percent following the high court verdict.

The state government on Friday finalized the reservations to all 13 ZP chief posts after district collectors completed the process of reservations to the ZPTC and mandal parishad president posts.

The government also published the gazette notifying the reservations. Prakasam ZP chief has been changed to unreserved woman from the unreserved general quota while Nellore ZP’s reservation was changed to unreserved woman from ST.

AMARAVATI: The State Election Commission (SEC) is likely to hold elections to rural local bodies in two phases and to municipal bodies in a single phase to effectively manage the poll process.

The government had proposed to the SEC to conduct the elections to all local bodies in a single phase. The SEC has, however, agreed to complete the elections before the March 31 deadline as wanted by the government.

Sources said the SEC has taken stock of the availability of the police forces in the state before deciding to go for a two-phase poll for rural bodies.

Sources said the SEC is planning to conduct MPTC, ZPTC elections on March 21 and March 24.

While notification for the first phase would be issued on March 7, for the second phase it would be issued on March 10.

Sources said that total number of MPTCs and ZPTCs in every district would be split into two groups to hold the elections in two separate phases. However, the SEC would take a final call on the issue late on Friday night.

Sources said that the SEC is planning to conduct municipal elections in a single phase on March 27. Interestingly, the counting of votes for both rural and urban local bodies would most likely be held on March 29. The SEC might wrap up the process by going for mayor, deputy mayor, ZP chairperson, Mandal parishad chairperson elections on March 30 and 31.

Meanwhile, the SEC has requested Telangana government to spare about 40,000 ballot boxes for the elections in the state as the elections to the local bodies would be held on ballot paper mode. The SEC is also procuring another 5,000 ballot boxes from Odisha. Since 1.2 lakh ballot boxes were available in the state, the SEC has decided to take the support from the neighbouring states keeping in view of the plans to complete all the elections by the month end.

State Election Commissioner Dr N Ramesh Kumar met governor B B Harichandan on Friday and explained to him of the measures taken for the smooth conduct of the elections. He said that the administration was ready to conduct the polls to rural and urban local bodies within a short span.

Meanwhile, the SEC directed the district collectors and SPs to set up inter-state and inter-district check-posts immediately. The SEC asked district collectors and SPs to take stringent measures to curb down the anti-social elements during the polls. “AP has a wonderful history of conducting the elections without giving scope for violence. We need to protect it,” Dr Ramesh Kumar told the collectors and SPs.
