0,2020/03/08,Slow progress in clearing encroachments on drains,"Surveyors have marked 348 buildings as encroachments

Buildings, roads, open spaces and sites, compound wall/fencing are just some of the encroachments on stormwater drains (SWDs). But the encroachment removal drive of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has slowed down after hitting a few road blocks.

The stormwater drain network in the city measures around 842 km. The BBMP, in a statement submitted to the Karnataka High Court recently, had claimed that there were initially 2,626 encroachments on the drains. Of these, it claims to have cleared as many as 1,890 encroachments while 736 are yet to be cleared. Of the 736 encroachments, there are as many as 348 buildings and 19 compound walls/fences.

According to sources, these encroachments have already been marked for demolition by officials from the Department of Survey, Settlement and Land Records. The survey of the remaining 369 encroachments is under progress.

Sources said that the encroachment removal drive began around four years ago with much gusto. This followed flooding in many areas of the city after heavy rainfall. Encroachments, including buildings, were cleared in Avani Sringeri Nagar, Saraswathipura, Kodichikkanahalli, Halegevaderahalli, Doddabommasandra, Dasarahalli, Kalkere, and Kasavanahalli.

However, after owners went to court and got a stay, the drive slowed down considerably. Officials pointed out that even buffer zones around drains had been encroached. As per the National Green Tribunal's directive, the buffer zone ranges from 15 to 50 metres for stormwater drains. “Several buildings have come up even in the buffer zones,” said an official.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar admitted that the encroachment removal drive had slowed down. He, however, maintained that the civic body had issued notices to owners of buildings that had encroached the drains, and was clearing encroachments wherever already marked.

Mr. Anil Kumar said that the BBMP is working on getting the stay vacated. “If people are living in some building marked as an encroachment, we have to give them time to vacate the premises. The BBMP cannot just raze a building,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/9j0qk8/article31017030.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BgDrainscol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/slow-progress-in-clearing-encroachments-on-drains/article31017031.ece
1,2020/03/08,Infrastructure projects add to traffic woes,"Fifteen roads across the city have been dug up

Bengaluru’s journey towards becoming a ‘smart city’ is resulting in inconvenience to citizens. Fifteen roads across the city, including Raj Bhavan Road, Brigade Road, and Infantry Road, will be converted to smart roads under TenderSURE specifications. These roads have now been dug up and the side-effects of the work have not been easy for citizens.

Regular commuters said apart from the dust, traffic congestion has increased multi-fold. “These are busy roads and with this project, the road has become narrow, increasing congestion. Also, it gets difficult to wait in the traffic jam owing to the dust,” said Kavya K.V., who travels through the CBD every day.

The dust and debris from the work have serious implications. A security guard at one of the buildings near Brigade Road, Karam Chand, said, “I stand by the roadside for more than eight hours every day. Within one week after the work began, I developed a cough. Now, I am forced to wear a mask to work.”

The small businesses around the areas have also had a tough time keeping up with this work. “As the pavement outside my shop has been dug up, my customers find it difficult to walk to the shop. Many of them now go to other shops,” said Asnam, who runs a tea shop near Brigade Road.

Pedestrians are facing difficulties as footpaths have disappeared owing to the ongoing work.

Hephsiba R. Korlapati, Managing Director of Bengaluru Smart City Pvt. Ltd., said that they have taken a number of precautionary measures. “We have installed barricades on the site and we remove debris daily. We have instructed workers to use water to prevent the dust from blowing over. We have also intimated the police to take necessary actions to regulate traffic,” she said.

White-topping woes

On the other hand, white-topping work has also claimed footpaths. For example, white-topping on Indiranagar 80 feet road has reduced the size of the footpath considerably.

It has also damaged trees, residents complain. The white-topping process began with digging around trees for underground repairs.

Razi Abbas of I Change Indiranagar said, “There seems to be no work done to revive the trees that are damaged. In some places where white-topping work is completed, there is no ground space for the trees. Hopefully, the BBMP will be cautious about the trees in their future projects.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/qf8msi/article31017004.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGSMARTCITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/infrastructure-projects-add-to-traffic-woes/article31017005.ece
2,2020/03/08,Karnataka warns action against pharmacies selling drugs that claim to prevent COVID-19,"When The Hindu visited some medical shops, the shopkeepers were selling these medicines claiming that they are ‘safe’ and will ‘ensure’ people do not get affected by COVID-19.

As more people are getting increasingly anxious about COVID-19, many medical stores in the city are using this opportunity to sell medicines claiming they would help prevent getting infected.

When The Hindu visited some medical shops, the shopkeepers were selling these medicines claiming that they are ‘safe’ and will ‘ensure’ people do not get affected by COVID-19. One of the shops even had a separate rack labelled “Prevention of corona”.

While some of these medicines come in the form of pills that do not have labels, some stores are also selling ‘Arsenic Alb 30 P’ and made tall claims that it would ensure that people who consume it would be safe from the virus.

Arsenic Alb 30 P was even handed over to people in Telangana by the Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy department, which had claimed that it could stop the spread of the virus. The move had drawn flak from several quarters.

Some other tonics are also being sold and customers are being asked to mix three to five drops of these with one teaspoon of water and consume them thrice a day. The cost of these medicines range from ₹100 to ₹350. A store manager claimed that they were selling at least 15 bottles of the tonic each day.

The State Health Department has clarified that the Union government has not issued any advisory on the use of homeopathy drug Arsenicum Album 30 CH for prevention of the disease.

Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said that the State government would initiate action against such pharmacies. “It is illegal to mislead the public and there is no medicine that can prevent COVID-19. The pharmacies are inviting trouble for themselves as it is illegal to sell medicines by making such false claims,” he said.

C. Nagaraj, Director of Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases, said that there was no drug or medicine that was approved by the government of India to prevent the spread of the virus. He said that a case would be filed in the jurisdictional police station against such pharmacies.

Six in isolation

The Health and Family Welfare Department, in a bulletin, has stated that a total of six people are under isolation across the State. One person in Dakshina Kannada district was admitted to a hospital on Sunday. Four patients have been discharged, the bulletin said.

Meanwhile, the bulletin stated, that those arriving from COVID-19 affected countries such as China, Iran, South Korea, and Italy, need to stay in their accommodation for 14 days. The department has said that if they notice any symptoms of the disease, they should immediately seek medical attention.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ouxnqa/article31021303.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/corona-scam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/pharmacies-sell-drugs-that-claim-to-prevent-covid-19/article31016068.ece
3,2020/03/08,COVID-19 takes the colour out of Holi,"Many apartment complexes have cancelled parties citing safety concerns

Fears over COVID-19 may leave the festival of colours less colourful this year. Apartment complexes are cancelling events on Monday while event management companies are slashing ticket prices to attract people to participate in celebrations.

An apartment complex in Whitefield decided to cancel their annual Holi party after one person who had travelled from Bengaluru to Hyderabad tested positive for COVID 19. “Some of the residents in the apartment work in IT parks, and some travel abroad frequently. We sent notices to all the houses, took a poll, and a majority voted against having a party,” said the head of the residents’ association.

Many others have cancelled Holi parties citing safety concerns. The head of an apartment complex in Bellandur said, “There are 250 residents here. During Holi parties, it is the children who will play the most. A majority of the residents felt it was unnecessary to put them at risk.”

But not all apartment complexes in the city have restricted celebrations. A society near Jalahalli issued circulars to its residents, urging everyone ‘to play with colours in designated locations’ and maintain hygiene around the society.

Event prices slashed

On the other hand, event organisers are being forced to cancel their events or slash prices as regular party-goers are avoiding crowded areas. Entry fee for events at hotels, which would cost around ₹600 for example, is now priced at ₹250.

Raajesh Sukumar, the founder of an event management company, said, “There have been only a handful of bookings and enquiries for Holi parties. It is not the same as last year.”

Rahul Verma from another event management company said they almost had to cancel the Holi party at a nightclub as ‘the party scene is very dull this Holi’. “Most party-goers are corporate employees and their companies have sent emails requesting all of them to avoid gatherings of any kind,” he said.

For some people, it is a matter of being cautious.

Akshaya K., who has not made any plans for Holi, said, “I’ll stay in and celebrate with a few friends. I usually enjoy going to parties during Holi, but this year I am having second thoughts and so are my friends.”

Doctors prescribe celebrations in small groups

Doctors are advising people to refrain from celebrating Holi in large groups. “Since the infection can spread through those who have been exposed to the virus and Holi is a festival that involves a lot of human contact, it is best to celebrate with a small group of known people. That way, the odds of catching the infection are less,” said Dr. Raja Selvarajan, a consulting physician.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/uli4n3/article31016037.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGHOLICELEBRATIONS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-takes-the-colour-out-of-holi/article31016038.ece
4,2020/03/08,Twenty seconds: from Stayin’ Alive to Eena meena deeka and more,"Happy Birthday To You. Sing that twice while washing your hands to put in the requisite 20 seconds to fight the coronavirus.

Stayin’ Alive by the Bee Gees works too, even if it does go on for four seconds longer. It is the most health-conscious of songs, best known for being the rhythm for CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). The pace is exactly right. As, of course, is the title.

It is useful to keep that song in mind as both handwashing and CPR might play key roles in the days and weeks to come.

Another One Bites the Dust has been recommended for CPR too, but there’s something about that name…

What of Indian songs as an aid for handwashing? The introduction to Kishore Kumar’s Eena meena deeka is terrific, but you have to remember a whole lot of nonsense words. Chaiyya chaiyya from Dil Se, repeated six times, might be recommended by doctors if they are not too young or too old.

For evergreen types, there is Bar bar dekho hazar bar dekho/ ke dekhne kee cheez hai hamara dilruba,/Talee ho, talee ho talee ho. Sing that twice each time. You can even pretend to be Shammi Kapoor prancing around in the movie.

For those who prefer something classical, Krishna nee begane baaro suggests itself. You need to sing those four words in yaman kalyan five times. More, and you will be wasting both soap and water.

Song writers are probably bemused at the idea of their works being put to medical use. Immortality is just a handwash away.

For those who find both Bollywood and the classical a strain on their voices and nerves, there is always poetry. John Donne’s No Man is An Island and Shelley’s Ozymandias fit the bill. Importantly, they remind us of the times we live in, our inter-dependency and what happens to all egomaniacs.

For those wanting something contemporary and relevant to the virus, playwright and poet Poile Sengupta has written the wonderful ‘Prohibitory Orders’, which goes like this:

This virus called corona

Doesn’t like us to have fun

It doesn’t want us to party

Or befriend anyone.

If we do meet, we are told,

We must stand a metre away,

We cannot shake hands or hug

And kiss? No! Never! Nay!

We must follow a certain lady

Who washed off bloody tints

I’ve scrubbed my hands so often

My fingers’ve lost their prints.

So I’ll wear a mask and go out,

I shall defy all orders,

No virus can pick me out

Or stop me crossing borders.

Stick that over your basin and read through. It should take 20 seconds, and by the end of the day you will be rid of that wishy-washy feeling.

7,2020/03/08,B.S.Yediyurappa flags off train to Karwar from Bengaluru,"He said that the State government would bear 50% of the railway projects in the State

Karataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Saturday flagged off the Yeshwantpur-Karwar-Vasco Da Gama Express. The introduction of train service between Bengaluru and the coastal cities will reduce travel time.

With this, a long-standing demand of the people living in the coastal districts of the State had been fulfilled, Mr. Yediyurappa said. He also said that the State government would bear 50% of the railway projects in the State that would help in providing more metro lines and services.

Minister of State of Railways Suresh Angadi and Udupi-Chikkamagaluru MP Shobha Karandlaje were present on the occasion. Ms. Karandlaje said that the new train service between Bengaluru and the coastal districts would reduced the travel time by two and a half hours. Ahead of International International Women’s Day, which falls on March 8, the train was handled by woman loco pilots.

Mr. Yediyurappa also also flagged off Train No.06541/06542 Yeshwantpur-Vijayapura-Yeshwantpur Tatkal Special Express with Modern LHB (Linke-Hofmann-Busch) coaches.

8,2020/03/08,International Women’s Day: ‘Bilal Bagh is growing into a movement’,"The anti-CAA protests on Tannery Road began on Feb. 8

‘Hum Kagaz Nahi Dikhayenge’ and ‘Inquilab Zindabad’ rent the air as hundreds of protesters, mostly women, shout slogans against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens, National Population Register. This is around 9.30 p.m. when there is maximum crowd and maximum energy.

This is the women-driven protest at Bilal Bagh, which has been going on continuously from February 8 on Tannery Road in Bengaluru.

“The Bilal Bagh protest has revolutionised our lives. We are determined to stay on the streets until the discriminatory CAA is repealed,” said Warsi, social worker and the force behind the protest.

Many women, whose lives were restricted to their homes, friends and relatives have now earned a public space where they are seen and heard. There are women from all walks of life – rich to poor, educated to illiterate.

There are homemakers as well as working professionals. “I look after my family, finish all the work as soon as possible and rush here. I make it a point to be here all evening,” said a protester, adding that women occupying streets for days and months is a rare sight. “Not only women, such sustained, constructive protests are rarely organised,” she said.

The protest itself is innovative: painting classes for students, dance and music. “People are getting involved and contributing in their own way. A few of us knit blankets and taught others as well. We are planning to send them to our sisters in Shaheen Bagh,” said a woman protester.

A small library has been set up to inform and educate people while dinner is served every day. Eminent personalities like Medha Patkar, Ramachandra Guha, Naseeruddin Shah, H.S. Doreswamy, are among those who have attended the protest so far.

Abigail Silversmith, a transwoman, who has been actively attending protests every day, said ‘Draconian laws’ like the CAA, NRC and NPR are detrimental not only to the poor and downtrodden, but also to sexual minorities, as most of them are disowned by their families and their new identities are not documented.

Sai Adrian, a student and a transman, said he was elated that the women of Bilal Bagh had included sexual minorities in their fight against CAA.

“We have created a beautiful, inter religious space. We have become a community now. Bilal Bagh is no more a protest, it is a family and is growing into a movement,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/international-womens-day-bilal-bagh-is-growing-into-a-movement/article31012448.ece
9,2020/03/08,Now acute gastroenteritis surfaces in east Bengaluru,"90 patients admitted in State-run Epidemic Diseases Hospital

Amidst fears of COVID-19, Bengaluru has now reported an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis (GE) and at least 90 patients — including 10 children — have been admitted in the State-run Epidemic Diseases Hospital on Old Madras Road in the last one week.

Almost all the cases are from low-lying slums in east Bengaluru, mainly from Marathahalli, K.R. Puram, Mahadevapura, Electronics City, HAL, Vijinapura and surrounding areas.

GE is most often caused due to infection by bacteria such as E. coli and Vibrio cholerae or by certain viruses and parasites such as Giardia. Although sporadic cases were being reported from the first week of February, there has been a sudden spurt in the last 10 days and the hospital is seeing nearly 40 outpatients every day, of whom at least eight require admission. The outbreak, even before the onset of peak summer, has baffled doctors who are seeing such an outbreak after six years.

The hospital, which has a designated isolation ward for COVID-19 cases, is already seeing a rush of patients anxious to test themselves for the coronavirus. With people also flocking to the hospital with acute GE, doctors and paramedical staff are on their toes.

Hospital Medical Superintendent Ansar Ahmed, who is also the Bengaluru District Surgeon, told The Hindu that although a few stool samples of the patients tested positive for cholera in the hanging drop test, done for the presumptive identification of Vibrio cholerae, they tested negative after a cholera culture was done.

“Although it is not cholera, we have geared up to deal with the situation as the numbers may swell in the coming days. We are monitoring the situation round the clock, and are maintaining utmost hygiene in the hospital to avoid cross infections,” he said.

Suspecting that the outbreak may be due to water contamination, the doctor said food poisoning is also a concern in this season owing to contamination of food with salmonella, shigella, E-coli, rota virus, and entamoeba histolytica.

“In cases of acute gastroenteritis, if patients are not given adequate fluids and rehydrated immediately, there are chances of renal failure,” the doctor explained.

People should avoid roadside food and cut-fruits. The best way to keep these diseases under check is to consume properly and freshly cooked food and boiled and cooled water, the doctor advised.

People should be careful about water contamination as there is a possibility of sewage getting mixed with drinking water in low-lying areas, especially during summer and rainy season, he added.

B.G. Prakash, State Joint Director (Communicable Diseases), said no such outbreak has been reported from elsewhere in the State.

Some confirmed cholera cases

A few confirmed cases of cholera have been reported from at least three private hospitals in the city in the last one month, said sources in the State surveillance unit.

“We have reports from St. John’s Medical College Hospital, Manipal Hospital and Baptist Hospital about confirmed cases of cholera. We have asked the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike to take up testing of water samples in the areas from where cases have been reported,” a senior official said quoting anonymity.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/now-acute-gastroenteritis-surfaces-in-east-bengaluru/article31012433.ece
10,2020/03/08,Police to open ‘Hello Africa Desk’ in Bengaluru,"It will work with Foreigners Regional Registration Office to resolve the issues faced by African nationals

In a first, an exclusive grievance redressal desk for African nationals in the city will be set up by the Bengaluru City Police. The ‘Hello Africa Desk’ will be opened at the ACP office in Banaswadi.

Participating in a ‘Hello Africa’ interaction here on Saturday, City Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao said the police will work with the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) to resolve the issues faced by African nationals in Bengaluru.

The interaction was organised by the East Division police at Kasturinagar. A majority of the participants were students.

“The Hello Africa interaction is aimed at having a better understanding with African nationals, and there should be more such interactions. The police have decided to open a desk to address their grievances and they can also approach higher officials in the department,” Mr. Rao said.

Issue of overstaying

During the interaction, participants apprised the officials of various issues they face. A participant requested the officials to be compassionate while dealing with cases of overstaying.

“We have come here for educational purpose. After completing the course, we do not get certificates from the university in time. It takes months. How can we back without a certificate and convince our parents that we have a degree? In the case of students having back papers, the educational institutions do not give bona fide certificates despite clearing all the dues. We can’t spend lakhs to travel to our country and return to clear the papers,” said a participant.

In his reply to the questions on overstaying, Mr. Rajshekar, assistant FRRO, maintained that in genuine cases, permission is granted for extension after verifying the certificates from the educational institutions. “We advise you not to violate the visa regulations. If there are genuine reasons, we are ready to address them,” he said, also advising African nationals nationals not to approach middle men and fraudulent institutions and get into problems.

S.D. Sharanappa, DCP, Bengaluru East said 23,000 foreign nationals are living in the city out of whom 750 to 800 have been overstaying on an average every month. Of the foreign nationals overstaying in the city, 50% are African nationals, he said. “A majority of African nationals living in the city are law-abiding. A few indulge in antisocial activities bringing a bad name to the countries they are representing,” the DCP said.

‘Difficult to get a rented house’

Many of the participants told officials that it is difficult to get houses on rent. “Some house owners say they do not want to give on rent to African nationals since neighbours object. In many cases, they demand hefty deposits and don’t return it while vacating the house,” said a participant.

Another person alleged harassment by police. She complained that she was beaten up by a police personnel while returning from a food joint in Banaswadi. To this, Additional Commissioner of Police S. Murugan promised action. In his address, the officials said greater sensitivity will be adopted by the police while dealing with cases of African nationals.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/qasc58/article31012336.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGAFRICANNATIONALSINTERACTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/police-to-open-hello-africa-desk-in-bengaluru/article31012337.ece
11,2020/03/08,COVID-19 scare: Only 20 students per hall for SSLC exam,"COVID-19 scare has impacted the seating arrangement for the Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) examination that will begin later this month.

The Department of Primary and Secondary Education plans to ensure that only 20 students sit in a hall for the examination. Normally, around 30 students sit in one classroom during exams.

Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar made this announcement after visiting second pre-university examination centres in Bengaluru on Saturday. He said the department had allowed students to write the ongoing II PU exam wearing masks.

The Minister said school managements had been instructed to send students with cold, cough or fever on leave so that other students are not affected. “If students in the hostel are sick, they should be sent back to their homes,” Mr. Suresh Kumar added.

Meanwhile, several private schools have decided to start their summer holidays early amid fears of COVID-19 as a precautionary measure. They said they took this decision following requests from parents.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-scare-only-20-students-per-hall-for-sslc-exam/article31011742.ece

13,2020/03/08,Farmers receive training in maize pest management,"Maize fall armyworm destroyed a majority of crop in 2018-19 in Vellore

During the year 2018-19, an invasive pest — maize fall armyworm (FAW), or spodoptera frugiperda — destroyed a majority of maize crop in Vellore district and brought down the area of maize cultivation. Maize is cultivated in over 3,000 hectares in the district in all seasons. In order to contain the pest and encourage maize cultivation, front-line demonstrations and implementation of the technology capsule developed by Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) were being done in the Agaramaru sub-basin by scientists of Agricultural Research Station, Virinjipuram under Tamil Nadu Irrigated Modernisation Agriculture (TNIAM) project.

Under this, a one-day training programme, attended by more than 50 farmers from Madhanur block, was conducted at Gollamangalam village.

In commemoration of the World Diabetes Day, the Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at Christian Medical College has been conducting a series of events targeting school and college students around Vellore city since October, 2019.

As part of the valedictory programme for the World Diabetes Day 2019-20 celebrations, a dance competition was organised for school and college students on Saturday. The theme for school students was ‘How can diabetes affect the Heart?’ and for college students, the theme was ‘Is diabetes associated with depression?’

The bharatanatyam dance performance by Bannerjee, a class II student from West Bengal, was a highlight of the competition.

Dr. Lakshmi Seshadri, former head of obstetrics and gynaecology, Christian Medical College, highlighted the importance of exercise in the prevention of lifestyle diseases. “Dancing is an intense form of exercise which is also culturally enriching,” she said.

Dr. Lakshmi said that despite Tamil Nadu having one of the better primary care and government health systems in the country, patients with grossly uncontrolled sugar levels were a common phenomenon. She said that early detection and intervention along with patient education on coping with the disease were the solutions.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mwys9q/article31017362.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08DIABETESAWARENESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dance-music-competitions-mark-diabetes-awareness-programme/article31017363.ece

18,2020/03/08,Govt. adds a third site to options for developing city’s second airport,"Location near Cheyyar in contention

In a development, the State government is now looking at a new site, between Cheyyar and Kancheepuram, for Chennai’s second airport.

The site is around 75 km from the existing airport, and it will take nearly two-and-a-half hours by road.

According to highly-placed sources, the file that had a shortlisted site for the second airport was sent to a top authority in the government, but it came back unsigned.

“Now we have been asked to inspect the new site between Cheyyar and Kancheepuram,” a source said.

Preliminary land survey

“We have alerted the Tiruvannamalai Collector to do a preliminary land survey,” he added. When asked whether the other site, Parandur, had been rejected, he said: “I can’t say that for sure, since the file has also not been rejected. But there seems to be an inclination towards the new site between Cheyyar and Kancheepuram now.”

To a query as to why this new site was now being considered by the government, sources said that they had about 1,500 acres in Cheyyar already.

“We want to acquire as less land as possible from private owners. So we want to explore the possibility to see how much land would have to be acquired if we choose the site between Cheyyar and Kancheepuram. We will ask the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to conduct another study to see if it is feasible and see the number of houses that would be affected if we were to choose this site,” another source told The Hindu.

The Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) has already said that the second airport would require about 3,500-4,000 acres to be able to handle the growing passenger traffic for a substantial amount of time.

AAI officials said if they are informed by the State or the MoCA, they would carry out another study for this site as well. The AAI had recently submitted a study weighing the pros and cons for the two sites for the second airport.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/2o2ylg/article31012518.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8THMARCHENNAIAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/govt-adds-a-third-site-to-options-for-developing-citys-second-aiport/article31012519.ece
19,2020/03/08,Coronavirus | Contacts of infected man in Tamil Nadu traced,"Home quarantine for 27; Health Dept. to take samples of some of them for tests

With a 45-year-old man testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Tamil Nadu, the Health Department has gone on a heightened state of alert.

The Department, in a press release, said it was fully prepared to handle the situation and urged the public not to panic.

Health Department officials have traced 27 contacts of the person who had reached Chennai on February 28 by Air India from Muscat. An official said eight of those traced were high-risk contacts and the remaining 19 were low-risk contacts.

“They are under home quarantine. As a precautionary measure, we will be lifting samples from some of them on Sunday,” an official said.

The man was initially treated by his family physician. As his symptoms persisted for three days, he was referred to the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital. From there, he was shifted to the isolation ward of the RGGGH, in a 108 ambulance, on the night of March 4.

He underwent clinical examination, blood investigation, chest X-ray and a CT scan. Blood, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were lifted and sent for testing to the King Institute of Preventive Medicine, Guindy. As the test result was inconclusive, the samples were subsequently sent to NIV, Pune, the official said.

Now he has recovered, and is asymptomatic and stable, authorities said.

Till date, a total of 1,13,106 passengers have been screened in airports in Chennai, Tiruchi, Madurai and Coimbatore. Of them, 1,077 persons are under home quarantine for 28 days and three are under hospital quarantine, according to the Health Department bulletin.

The Department’s earlier travel advisory continues — people are advised to refrain from travelling to China, Iran, South Korea, Italy and Japan, and avoid non-essential travel to other COVID-19-affected countries.

Those with a travel history to these countries should remain under strict home quarantine or hospital isolation for 28 days from the date of arrival in India, the bulletin said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dqmdru/article31012498.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08MARTHSPECIALWARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/contacts-of-infected-man-traced/article31012499.ece
20,2020/03/08,Women’s Day celebrations held,"Governor shares his message

Several events were held in the city on Saturday to celebrate women and their achievements, and contributions marking International Women’s Day.

Rajan Eye Care Hospital private limited launched a special project — Women Vision 2020 — that aims to provide special eye care to women in rural areas.

Speaking at the launch, singer and entrepreneur Chinmayi Sripaada stressed on the need to have an open dialogue and not shroud child sexual abuse or workplace harassment in secrecy.

“We need to create an environment which keeps the dialogue alive. The #MeToo movement, for instance, became a part of drawing room conversations. We also need to shift the blame from the person who suffered to the perpetrators,” she said.

Ms. Chinmayi also urged more women to pledge to donate their eyes. While she had pledged to donate her eyes several years ago, she once again officially signed a declaration to pledge her eyes to Rajan Eye Care, on Saturday.

Sujatha Mohan, executive medical director, said that of the 100 staff members at their hospital, around 70 were women. “The dedication they have towards our patients is phenomenal and these women deserve to be celebrated every day,” she said.

In a message shared ahead of International Women’s Day, Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit said that it was important to recognise the contributions of women in different facets of life, whether personal or professional.

“Women are the source of indomitable spirit, determination, dedication and inspiration for their families and our nation. Let us work to a future where every Indian woman gets what she deserves- equal treatment under conditions of equality,” he said.

At the Madras Medical Mission, International Women’s Day was celebrated on Saturday with the theme ‘Each for equal’. The programme was jointly organised by the Department of Dietetics, College of Health Science, Department of Nursing Madras Medical Mission and the Indian Dietetics Association, Chennai Chapter.

Overcoming barriers

Latha A. Kumaraswamy, managing trustee, Tanker Foundation, said that women had excelled in a number of fields. “Although there are many challenges and hurdles in a woman’s life, we need to strive to overcome all barriers. Today’s women understand their strengths and abilities and step out to contribute to the society and the world, consequently. Every woman is special, whether she is working at home or at the office or doing both,” she said. Dr. Usha Sriram, consultant endocrinology, VHS, spoke about the importance of women’s health.

The Tamil Nadu Domestic Workers’ Welfare Trust launched a Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) campaign against sexual harassment in Perumbakkam.

At the Asan Memorial College of Arts and Science, ‘Asan Mahila 2K20’ was held on Friday to mark women’s day. Jothilakshmi Sundaresan, advocate, Madras High Court, spoke to the students about the various laws that they needed to be aware of.

21,2020/03/08,CM hints at withdrawal of cases filed against ryots,"Farmers confer ‘Guardian of Cauvery’ title on him

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Saturday hinted that cases filed against farmers in the delta region for staging protests against hydrocarbon exploration and other projects will be withdrawn.

Addressing the gathering at a thanksgiving meeting in Tiruvarur by farmers of the Cauvery delta for the enactment of a law declaring the region a protected agricultural zone, the CM said the plea for the withdrawal of cases filed against farmers will be “considered positively” and necessary steps taken, since the issue over which they had protested had been resolved.

He was conferred the title ‘Cauvery Kapaalar (Guardian of the Cauvery) by farmers on the occasion.

The Protected Agricultural Zone Development Act will protect the delta region forever, the CM said. The validity of the Act was endorsed by the Union government in Parliament when an MP from Tamil Nadu raised doubts over its legality, he claimed.

Stating that the initiative taken three decades ago by S. Ranganathan, general secretary of Tamil Nadu Cauvery Delta Farmers’ Welfare Association, had formed the basis for all subsequent developments pertaining to the Cauvery issue, he said he was proud to move the draft Bill to protect the Cauvery basin in the Assembly, which was also the first Bill that he had moved in his entire political career.

Thanking the farmers for giving him the title, he said the government would ensure that the river was protected forever.

He also listed the slew of projects implemented by the present government for improving the infrastructure and agriculture in the Delta region.

The inauguration of GA Canal Modernisation project, to be implemented with assistance from the Asian Development Bank, would be held soon, he said.

Mr. Ranganathan recalled his meeting with former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran, who conceded to a request from farmers to ensure that the case filed by the ryots at the Supreme Court remained alive.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ful427/article31022285.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MEDICALCOLLEGEjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/cm-hints-at-withdrawal-of-cases-filed-against-ryots/article31012376.ece

23,2020/03/08,India is now building a terrific team: Charlesworth,"The legendary Australian feels that the future of the sport lies in the future of Indian hockey

He was among the first high-profile foreign names to be associated with Indian hockey and even though Ric Charlesworth left on a bitter note, his association with the country and its hockey seems unbreakable. The former Australian coach believes the current Indian team is on par with the best in the world.

In the country to develop a high-level hockey academy in Chandigarh as consultant with Round Glass Sports, which has a football programme and is a part owner of I-League club Punjab FC, Charlesworth, in an exclusive interaction with The Hindu insisted that the biggest change in the Indian players was at a psychological level.

“I think the future of hockey is intimately involved with the future of Indian hockey and so I want to see India do well. There was a period when we couldn’t beat you and then there was a period when you couldn’t beat us. Now I think there is parity and that’s good for the competition,” he said.

The catalyst

“When I was here 10 years ago, I believed it was a 10-year job for India to climb back to the top. More than anything else, I think the Hockey India League (HIL) was the catalyst. It brought international players here, the locals played with and against them, and realised that the international players only had two arms and two legs just like everyone else. Psychologically, it was an important barrier to be broken for India,” he added.

Asked about the one thing that has changed in Indian hockey, Charlesworth said it was belief. “You were always technically good and physically too. I think it’s the psychological shift that has occurred which has been the crucial thing. There is more belief and they understand that they can compete at that level. India has always had fantastic players, now they are building a terrific team. I have seen that happen with your cricket teams too,” he said.

Australian influence

He added that the Australian influence on Indian hockey was part of knowledge-exchange that happens everywhere. “I think you learn from everybody, you take resources and get contributions. We did that, taking knowledge from people who left India after partition. All our coaches were from the sub-continent, perhaps you are simply seeing the reverse of it now,” he said.

Asked his prediction for the Tokyo Olympics, Charlesworth was non-committal. “For me, the ideal game would be an Australia-India final. I think both are capable of winning a medal but the Olympics can be capricious. When it will happen is a question now, so let’s see what happens,” he said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/361ac3/article31016933.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09RIC,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/india-is-now-building-a-terrific-team-charlesworth/article31016934.ece

Asian champion Pooja Rani (75kg) and the seasoned Vikas Krishan (69kg) on Sunday became the first set of Indian boxers to qualify for this year’s Tokyo Olympics by advancing to the semifinals of the continental qualifiers here.

While fourth-seeded Rani notched up a facile 5-0 win over Thailand’s Pornnipa Chutee, Krishan endured a tough one against third-seeded Japanese Sewonrets Okazawa before also prevailing in a unanimous verdict against the Asian silver-medallist.

While Rani secured her maiden Olympic spot, Krishan will be making his third successive appearance at the quadrennial showpiece, scheduled in July-August.

“I had never fought against this girl before today and honestly, I was a bit scared. I had told my coaches about it before the bout. They instilled confidence in me and I could pull off a one-sided result. I am happy,” said the 29-year-old Rani, who fought career-threatening shoulder and hand injuries before her gold at last year’s Asian Championships.

Rani will next face the reigning world and Asian champion Li Qian of China, who has the top billing in this category. Qian had no trouble beating Mongolia’s Myagmarjargal Munkhbat 5-0 in the opening bout of the day.

Taking full advantage of her longer reach, Rani outpunched the inexperienced but determined Chutee. The Indian is a three-time Asian medallist, besides being a former bronze-winner at the 2014 Asian Games.

Krishan, however, had to slog hard against a brilliant boxer, whose performance was eye-catching despite the loss. Okazawa, a gold-winner at the Olympic Test Event last year, kept Krishan on his toes with his right jabs being particularly effective.

What worked for the Indian was the consistent straight punches to the body, which fetched him the bulk of the points.

26,2020/03/08,United colours of divided neighbours,"Pakistani cities erupt in colours during Holi, with the day off for students to celebrate the festival

A few years ago, at a college in Chaklala, a suburb and cantonment of Rawalpindi, I was greeted with gulaal (colour powder) on Holi. The college management declared a holiday, and the students played Holi. The lecturers joined the celebration.

In India, there is a perception that Hindu festivals are banned in Pakistan. They aren’t.

Often, I plan my trip to Pakistan during Holi to celebrate the festival at the Senate Hall of Lahore University, where it is still played with much fanfare.

The warmth of Lahoris (Lahore ki zindadili) can sweep you off your feet. I regularly interact with retired Brigadier Hasan Altaf and Professor Rashid Ahmad. I am unable to travel to Pakistan this time around, but I got gulaal and sweets from there. The management of Lahore University couriers these to me on Holi when I can’t make it to Pakistan.

I had celebrated Holi and Deepavali many times in different cities of Pakistan, and contrary to the feeling that our neighbours hate India and Hindus, I have always found Pakistanis open and warm to Hindu festivals.

I can write reams on Lahore. If you have ever visited Amritsar, Lahore is just its extension. They are like twins.

Travelling to other countries makes you knowledgeable and considerate about their culture, cordiality and ethos rather than rely on half-baked pieces of prejudicial information about them. In Sargodha, Rahim Yar Khan, Sialkot, Faisalabad (erstwhile Layalpur), Sahiwal, Bahawalpur and Jhelum in Pakistan’s Punjab Province, schools are even today closed on Holi.

During his cricketing days in England, present Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan had played for Oxford County and university against Warwickshire with Holi colours smeared on his white flannels. He destroyed Warwickshire by taking a fifer and scoring an unbeaten 154. While receiving the man of the match award, he said, “Colours pepped me up, today!”

A student in Lahore

In these divisive times of us and them, I wistfully remember my doctoral and post-doctoral research days in Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad universities and how my Muslim friends and professors celebrated Holi and Deepavali with gusto and gaiety. This I remember all the more when people frown upon me after knowing that I often go to Pakistan to teach Islamic theology.

While studying Islamic theology and Koranic studies at Oxford, I once wrote to one of the greatest modern Urdu poets, Ahmad Faraz, of Pakistan and sent my published article on his poetry. It was in Urdu. We started corresponding and when he visited London in 1998, I met him. He taught Urdu and Persian at Peshawar University.

Faraz suggested that I pursue my M.Phil. on writer Firaq Gorakhpuri and Ph.D. on singer Mohammed Rafi from premier Pakistani universities. I had already taken a doctorate on musicality in Koranic verses from Al-Azhar, Cairo, guided by an exiled Pakistani Professor, Zaifa Ashraf.

Faraz and Professor Ashraf introduced me to the late Fahmida Riaz and Asma Jahangir, and I travelled to Pakistan for the first time in 1999 to deliver a lecture on “The religious correlation among the three Semitic faiths”.

After that, there was no looking back and I started visiting Pakistani universities at regular intervals. It is a country I feel home at.

27,2020/03/08,Anger has unhappy consequences,"The first outcome of anger is the harsh words that will affect the other person deeply. The injury never heals

Anger is the most dangerous emotion as we lose control of ourselves when in its grip. The consequences of such behaviour will be more than what we fear.

The first outcome of anger is the harsh words that will affect the other person deeply. The injury never heals.

Many relationships are affected only because of anger. Most probably, the family gets to experience the worst form of anger, causing rifts and hatred.

What are we gaining from anger? Nothing. But you lose the love of your loved ones. Getting angry will spoil your peace and that of the people around you. All will be stressed. Anger may become your biggest weakness, and you are allowing others to take advantage of it.

Sometimes, you may get angry for a reason, but guard against speaking unfair words which affects the mental well being of others. You cannot justify unfair words.

Anger is an unstoppable emotion. You cannot live without getting angry but ensure that you are stable when in anger. The younger ones in the family are influenced by the elder ones in the family. The way you behave with them has a greater influence on them.

It is of no consequence if your anger results in a positive influence, but if it is negative, the impact will be hard to rectify. If you behave in a wrong manner in anger, your child will behave in the same way. Your anger may make your child do unimaginable things. There is no use in regretting after getting angry.

If you get angry even for small things, your children will hesitate to share problems with you out of fear. This will affect them psychologically, and they end up doing the wrong things. It’s not that you should not get angry at your child’s mistake, but your behaviour should be within limits.

Every person should control anger. Otherwise, you will end up losing your loved ones.

28,2020/03/08,The beauty of everyday moments,"How cancer gave lessons in cherishing life and finding happiness in little things

Let me start with the conversation a Yaksha had with Yudhishthira. The greatest wonder of the world, the eldest of the Pandavas said, is man’s belief that he will go on living, despite knowing that death is the only truth on earth.

I am sure Yudhishtira had not met a cancer patient or survivor in his life.

Almost a year ago, diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer, I just went numb. My family went into shock, as if a powerful bomb had been thrown inside our home. But each of us learned to rise with strength.

I learned to cherish life once the treatment was over. I learned to let go of the horrible experience of cancer treatment. Learned that life will go on even without me. My house would run, if not smoothly, at least with a lurch.

Sudden changes

My partner suddenly was struggling to become a hands-on husband. With a wrench in my heart, I watched him wade through the daily chores and trying to keep me in good spirits. The children were a revelation. Living in two countries thousands of miles away, they rushed to my side during treatment and now I know what it means to be pillars of strength because that is what they were and are. My son took charge of the fear-stricken house and made it strong. He became my mother, cooking me healthy meals and coaxing me to eat (with chemotherapy, I would throw up).

My daughter, even with a toddler son, rushed to my side during surgery and kept my mood up with her funny anecdotes. Behind all this I knew they were going through a tough time but they would never show it. Now it is more than a year, and I am struggling to stay fit and come out of it. Not a day goes without my children talking to me and making me do something to regain my health. My two-year-old grandson is my greatest healer. Every day, I see him having breakfast before going to the day-care centre while my daughter gets ready for office. I started living for these moments. He listens to my stories and his little pranks and baby talk are the things I look forward to every day.

As a family, we have become more health- and fitness-conscious and have emerged stronger and closer.

Now while sipping green tea, I feel happy to see the little sparrows pecking at the rice that I scatter on my wall. I feel immensely happy. Maybe, I learned to cherish these moments only after my cancer.

Yes Yudhishthira, I know there is a sword dangling above my head, but I chose to feel happy seeing these sparrows today.

Every day is precious to me. I have learned the beauty of moments and the world around me. After all cancer is not that bad, isn’t it?

29,2020/03/08,The vicissitudes of a lovely day,"A bright, happy morning is followed by the roller coaster of life and work

Some may say that all days are lovely. I agree, but do I have a choice?

It was a late January morning, and I was not woken up by the mobile alarm, my wife or even the cuckoo’s song. The winter in Hyderabad is pleasant, and our house is in a beautiful area with many species of birds, other creatures, plants and trees.

A cuckoo pair lives on a neem tree adjacent to my bedroom. I am a nature lover, but a late riser. And the birds are raucous in the morning. But today, I got up on my own.

Then I went for a walk and was at peace with myself. The sun was just about to appear on the horizon, the various hues in the sky announcing it. Would you believe I could spot a grey hornbill? The flame of the forest was with the first flower of the season. I simply love to look at the palash flowers. Its flowering reminded me that the flowering of samel, or silk cotton, is about to follow. Again a lovely red flower which turns cotton-like. The tree in full bloom has no leaves but only flowers.

I went on thanking god and saying my morning prayers and after visiting a temple, came back home refreshed.

There was a bounce in my gait on the way to office as I was happy and content. As I wished good morning to my boss, he said I would have to write for the house magazine. I was more shocked than surprised as I had never written a word earlier.

One thing I must credit my boss with is his capability of making things sound so easy that one may agree to anything he asks for. And repent later. As I did.

That was the end of my lovely day.

When I reached home in the evening, the world had again become a cruel place. I was admonished for reaching home late, as usual. I worried about the assignment and being tired. It cut no ice with my wife. She told me to go and buy groceries, vegetables and fruits.

But till this day, after getting many reminders for submission of the article, I am still thinking what to write. I am yet to find another lovely day. Some day. Let’s hope.

30,2020/03/08,Cholera in a temple town,"With a floating population and many hotels and food joints, the situation had to be contained as quickly as possible

With COVID-19 sending shivers down our spine, India is getting ready to face the dreadful virus.

This reminds me of a similar situation at a micro level in the temple town of Tirupati. My father had joined government service as a young doctor and was posted to remote villages in Tamil Nadu. So father’s transfer to Tirupati came as a welcome change as the famous temple invited pilgrims from all over India and abroad. Our home was a stopover for many of our relatives who came for darshan of Lord Balaji.

Father’s transfer to Tirupati was not only to a different place but to a new culture altogether. He learnt to speak a smattering of Telugu and often made people laugh when he mixed up his words. But he managed fine with his patients and won their hearts with his skills and million dollar smile.

His tenure in this town was especially remembered for a particular incident. A terrible epidemic of cholera broke out one summer. With a moving population and hotels and food joints springing up everywhere, the situation had to be contained as quickly as possible. The young and the old, health workers and visitors were all affected badly and quickly fell prey to the dismal situation. Many people died and hospitals were full of patients. There was a shortage of doctors, nurses, medicines and life-saving IV drips. Vulnerable people fled the scene out of fear and distress.

When medicines did not arrive on time, my father took matters into his own hands. He set up tents to isolate the patients, made saline solution with the help of a few loyal staff and treated hundreds of patients who recovered quickly because of the timely intervention.

My mother would wait up till the late hours of the night worried about her husband. He would soak all his clothes in disinfectant and take a bath before entering the house for fear of carrying the infection on him. The next day he would rush to the makeshift hospital and continue his mission, working all through the day and night in spite of splitting headaches and long hours of continuous monitoring of patients and staff. Soon the situation was well under control and father became a hero.

31,2020/03/08,Staying happy after retirement,"People die not because of illness or injury — they die because they simply lose the will to live

Advances in geriatric care have prolonged the lives of senior citizens but many of them seem to be ruing this fact. The truth is that family members find it difficult to take care of them and they increasingly experience a sense of isolation and despondence. After a frenetic work pace extending to close to 35 and 40 years that saps one’s energy, individuals often look forward to retirement to enjoy a relaxed and peaceful life.

But after retirement, they capitulate to a routine and humdrum life. If the elderly are confined to their home due to mobility issues, then this can become a bane.

A renowned Hindi story tells us about a stationmaster who gets an extension after retirement. The man is so excited to be home he even rejects the offer for extension. His family has got used to a life without him, while he has been away for so many years. So, when he returns home, he feels sidelined and soon enough he realises that he is considered more of an intrusion in the lives of his family members. Curiously enough, his wife chides him for making unreasonable demands, and asks him to help in the household errands. After thinking for a while, the stationmaster decides to accept the extension and he leaves home once again. The happiness on the faces of his family members assures him that he has taken the right decision.

Such a glum scenario is one of the reasons old-age homes have mushroomed across India. When senior citizens are treated like a liability after their assets (home, lifelong earnings, savings, etc) are siphoned off by their progeny, they get hurt by such a cavalier attitude and realise that they have nowhere to go.

People die not because of illness or injury, they die because they simply lose the will to live. Many senior citizens resent the fact that debilitating illnesses have made them dependent on others and they wait for the final denouement. This mental agony adds to their cup of woes. Often they need psychological counselling — but they are afraid to say so for fear of being ostracised. The sagacious of the lot realise that retirement is another phase of life that heralds a new beginning in life — it is the freedom to do things that one loves that enlivens the spirit and keeps one going.

It is important for family members to empathise with senior citizens (parents, grandparents) and make them feel wanted. A regular conversation with them will help alleviate the huge load that they often carry within their hearts. Many senior citizens will be more than happy to walk down memory lane and regale you with incidents from a bygone era. Often children expect their parents to be more understanding of the challenges that they face, but old habits die hard. Parents seldom change. Children have to change their approach. It is a frustrating experience to handle adamant and recalcitrant parents who are unwilling to listen to or understand any sagely advice that is in their interest.

Many individuals struggle to communicate their opinions to their parents for fear of hurting them, but it is better to keep communication channels open with parents. On the flip side, there are individuals who are aggressive in their communication and hurt their parents with harsh words. Maintaining a salubrious climate at home is essential for harmony and peace.

Leaving senior citizens idle can often be a death knell for them. As we all know, an idle mind is the devil’s workshop. Smaller tasks can be assigned to them. Their grandchildren can be encouraged to sit and listen to their stories. The time the youngsters spend watching inane stuff on the idiot box can be severely curtailed. Senior citizens who are mobile can not only help in household errands willingly but they can also take up part-time work — the business world needs to leverage this opportunity. They can also take up writing as an alternative career.

In a digital world that is marked by increasing entropy — chaos, risk and uncertainty — the interests of senior citizens need to be protected. Those senior citizens who do not have children are subject to greater abuse. They get cheated of their assets. There are also exceptional cases when children cause irreparable hurt to their parents’ psyche. The trick is to ensure that senior citizens are engaged in some activity or other.

Generation X will retire in a few more years. It is a warning signal for them that they have to plan their life after retirement in an intelligent manner and take care of their health. Retirement is all about opening a new innings in one’s life. While embracing it with open arms, it is important to stay active, alert and happy.

32,2020/03/08,Battle against COVID-19,"It’s not just a health crisis but also an economic and national security emergency waiting to strike

The international financial order, governments across the world and societies in affected countries are all grappling with the panic over the global spread of COVID-19. Companies across Europe are sending employees on unpaid leave. In Tokyo, officials are battling the most credible threat to the Olympics since the World War. The U.S. and South Korea have called off their joint military exercise. The Iranian Deputy Health Minister, who assured the country that the virus is not a major threat, tested positive himself the next day.

China has quarantined millions of people in entire provinces, and is supposedly using Artificial Intelligence to surveil body temperature and deliver goods, a move that is both unprecedented and unimaginable in any other country.

International responses to the SARS-Cov-2 spread bring up questions about whether India is ready to face a coming pandemic.

India currently has no national strategy to deal with a pandemic in the way that the U.S., the U.K., Japan and Israel do. Unfortunately, pandemic preparedness is not something that can be created overnight when a crisis is knocking on the doors. It requires years of investment in building up a comprehensive health care system, institutes for vaccine research, infrastructure for manufacturing of vaccines, on-ground supply chain measures, a coordinated effort of the private sector, the armed forces and research institutes and a coordination strategy for the Centre, the States and neighbouring nations. While the need for investment in pandemic preparedness is a debate that should have already taken place, the need of the hour for the government is to recalibrate its strategy.

Currently, organisations such as the National Disaster Management Authority, the National Crisis Management Committee and the Health and Family Welfare Ministry are responsible for dealing with public health emergencies. However, a pandemic represents a global emergency which requires wide-scale international coordination, and we are yet to create an agency which can handle the demands for such coordination.

The government has created a Group of Ministers (GoM) which has released a four-pronged strategy: a risk advisory, travel screening, lab testing and quarantine facilities. The problem with such a strategy is that the government is under the misconception that it can prevent the outbreak from even taking place in India. It is still operating under the NDMA’s Disaster Management Cycle, which sees prevention and mitigation as the first steps before even considering responses.

Though SARS-CoV-2 is not as deadly as SARS or MERS, given its contagious transmissibility, it has already claimed more lives. There is the possibility of the virus mutating into something more deadly in the future.

Given these facts, the government urgently needs to do a few things. First, prepare not just for the prevention of an outbreak but for its inevitable spread. That SARS-CoV-2 will spread in India should not be a question dealt with through ‘ifs’ but by ‘when’. Second, our strategy requires having an integrated approach not just on mitigation but also response. While scientists have started clinical trials, even if a vaccine is discovered immediately, its availability and distribution for the public will take at least 12-18 months.

Therefore, in the meantime, the government needs to consider the virus threat not just as a health emergency but as an economic and national security emergency waiting to strike; in China alone, factory output has plunged and the country’s service sectors have contracted.

Separate strategies will be required for inducing greater cooperation among the government, non-governmental organisations and the private sector, between the Union and the State governments, and intergovernmental research coordination. The government needs to increase immediately the mandate and funding of the NCMC, which has the relevant Ministry actors, to deal with all of these issues more effectively.

The effectiveness of the Kerala government in containing the virus creates false hopes that the rest of India will be able to do so as well. While Kerala’s response is commendable, it is also India’s best State when it comes to healthcare infrastructure. For an epidemic outbreak, a nation’s security depends on the strength of its weakest link. In the absence of reliable health infrastructure, the government needs to include the armed forces in all of its preparedness plans. COVID-19 is a wake-up call for our policy makers that health needs to be understood in broader terms as a security issue as well. For a country with borders as porous as ours, where large parts of the urban population live in slums, and with an average population density of 21,000 people per square kilometre, quick transmissions are inevitable. Most Indians are covered, or not, by an overstretched and underprepared healthcare apparatus; the COVID-19 threat is an existential one waiting to fly in through airports, swim through ports, or ride across the country on our trains and wreck havoc.

The government would therefore do well to remember Louis Pasteur’s advice: “Gentlemen, it is the microbes who will have the last word,” and plan for the inevitable, instead of deluding itself that immigration checks can prevent the disease from entering.

39,2020/03/08,Pre-Independence Holi tradition endures in Khar Danda,"‘Divine command’, and a punishment behind the ritual

Residents of Varni Pada area in Khar Danda celebrated holika dahan — the traditional burning of a bonfire to mark the festival of Holi — on Saturday. The ritual is performed in the locality two days before the actual festival, keeping with an age-old custom dating back to the British Raj.

Local residents, predominantly from the fisherfolk community, said while the practice was introduced by the British government before Independence, it has persisted due to the mythology attached to it.

“In earlier times, we celebrated the festival on the same day as the other communities. However, in one particular year, there was scarcity of wood and our ancestors stole the logs that were placed near wells to help draw water,” Prasad Chavri, a Varni Pada resident said. Legend has it that goddess Holi appeared in dreams to some of the ancestors and reprimanded them for their sin. As penance, she commanded them to light the bonfire two days before the festival.

Meanwhile, a complaint was filed with the local government about the theft of wood. The then administrator, after finding out the truth and hearing about the ‘divine command’, decided to implement an official rule commanding the residents to celebrate Holi two days early every year.

Even today, the festival is celebrated two days early at the Holi maidan in Varni Pada. Residents of the area worship three different types of tree branches and then light the bonfire.

“It has become a huge festival for the residents of Varni Pada. People from all koliwadas in the city come to attend the festival. We also invite our relatives and friends from our native villages to be a part of the ocassion,” Mr. Chavri said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/gowwi5/article31012368.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8BMHoli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pre-independence-holi-tradition-endures-in-khar-danda/article31012369.ece
40,2020/03/08,Women lead the way in neighbourhood safety,"Slowly, but steadily, young volunteers are making a difference in 15 neighbourhoods in Mumbai

Young women in 15 neighbourhoods in the city have become the de facto liaisons between citizens and the local police when it comes to highlighting issues of women’s safety.

Thanks to a year of training by Mumbai-based NGO Aangan Trust, the volunteers, who include teenagers and young women, now hold monthly meetings in their localities to keep abreast of latest challenges faced by girls and women, and bring them to the attention of the authorities. So far, the initiative has been conducted in 15 areas in and around Colaba, Cuffe Parade, Govandi and Wadala.

Aangan Trust members said the process has been slow but steady, and the first issue that needed to be addressed was the fear of the police in the minds of the people. Aangan Trust conducts various initiatives aimed at safety of children in the city, and volunteers were hand-picked from the initiative based on earlier interactions for the project.

“We had to first understand the problem ourselves and there was no one better than the girls staying in these areas to help us do that. Over a period of several months, we drew up a list of all the spots where girls feel unsafe while passing through. These included stretches that have a large number of liquor bars, public toilets and places with inadequate lighting,” Smita Dharmamer, associate director, Aangan Trust, said.

The study, Ms. Dharmamer recalled, was an eye opener. “For instance, in Wadala, we found families that would not feed their girl child at night because they did not want to take the chance of her having to visit the public toilet after dark. The extent to which eve teasing and other crimes against girls was normalised was worrying,” she said.

The Trust, and the volunteers drew up a map of each area they were working in, marking out the problem spots and discussing possible solutions. The areas with the highest number of incidents were marked in red.

The next step was to make the volunteers comfortable and confident enough to approach the police without having to rely on the NGO every time.

Frequent meetings were held with senior police inspectors of the local police station for the volunteers to get familiar with them and vice versa. After the problems in each area were spelt out before them, the police conducted a survey based on the maps drawn by the volunteers. Patrolling was increased wherever necessary and informal meetings were held with residents to increase the visible police presence. The police also helped the volunteers approach the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation so that street lights could be installed. Last month, the civic body issued work orders for two street lights, one each in Colaba and Cuffe Parade.

‘Heartening results’

“The results were nothing short of heartening. At a time when every other person wants to talk about how the police do nothing, it was inspiring to see how proactive they were. The Wadala TT police even allowed the volunteers to indulge in street art about addiction one one of the walls of the police station compound,” Atiya Bose, executive director, Aangan Trust, said.

Now, the volunteers hold monthly meetings at the police station, give updates to the police about the state of the problem spots on their respective maps.

They are also training other women on issues like domestic violence, importance of education, and triple talaq. With great joy, the volunteers have been observing the number of red spots on their maps decrease every month.

“The initiative is a positive one and we are only too happy to play our part in something that boosts our citizen outreach and lets us ensure their safety. The police-public relationship is a symbiotic one, and participation of both parties is equally important for a safe and crime-free environment,” Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Vinoy Kumar Choubey said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3k8fks/article31012352.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8BMGOVANDISLUM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/women-lead-the-way-in-neighbourhood-safety/article31012353.ece
41,2020/03/08,Construction worker dies of electrocution,"A 50-year-old construction worker died of electrocution on Saturday while doing renovation work at a residence in Chembur.

The Nehru Nagar police have arrested the house owner for carrying out renovation without legal permission or putting in place safety measures for workers.

According to the police, the accused, Balkrishna Gangaram (61), had hired five workers for renovating his room in Lane No. 1, Varshatai Naik Nagar, Chembur.

During the work, one of the workers, Gaurang Gouda, got electrocuted and died on the spot. The police found out that Mr. Gangaram had started the work without legal permission.

“Mr. Gangaram had retired and was living alone in his house, while his family lives in their village in Uttar Pradesh. Four days ago, he hired three labourers and two carpenters. On Saturday, when Gouda was working at the site, he accidentally touched a live wire and died,” said police sub-inspector Sambhaji Kamble, Nehru Nagar police station.

“A case has been registered against Mr. Gangaram for causing death due to negligence.

42,2020/03/08,Doctors call for more awareness of spina bifida,"Birth defect impedes bladder control; superstitions are hurdles in rural areas

Dombivli resident Khushi Ganatra has never attended school or done the things any teenager would consider normal. She never went out, never played sports and never socialised with boys and girls of her age, all because of a congenital condition that did not even get diagnosed till three years ago.

“I had bladder control issues and due to this reason no school was willing to give me admission. Even my mother was not aware about why I was suffering from this condition and thought it was a tumour. I even underwent surgery for the same. I studied using my brothers’ books and only went out to appear for exams,” said Ms. Ganatra.

With no other contact with the outside world, she turned to the parallel universe of social media, and three years ago, made a friend on Facebook, which changed the course of her life. Through this friend, she became part of a basketball group and here she met some people who helped her understand that she was suffering from a condition called spina bifida.

According to Dr. Santosh J. Karmarkar, chairman of the Spina Bifida Foundation, four out of every 1,000 children born in India have spina bifida, a common birth defect that often goes unnoticed due to lack of awareness.

“This rate in India is four times that of western countries. An important fact that people miss is that it is preventable,” said Dr. Karmarkar. His foundation has been working on prevention and treatment of spina bifida and rehabilitation of patients in Mumbai.

Dr. Karmarkar as well as other experts in the field and patients suffering from the condition came together at a conference, organised in collaboration with Meyer Organics, to spread awareness of spina bifida at Nehru Centre earlier this week.

Uma Kalekar, director of Meyer Organics, said a major cause for the occurence of spina bifida is poor nutrition, specifically low levels of folic acid in pregnant women, which contributes to this birth defect. Meyer Organics, a U.K.-based neutraceutical company, provides healthcare solutions in the form of nutrient medicines to both men and women which, when taken in advance, can prevent the incidence of the condition.

Experts said the condition is more acute in families from low socio-economic backgrounds. Dr. Ramdas Marad, who runs a hospital in Jawahar district in Maharashtra, says parental counselling proves to be most difficult in rural areas due to the prevalence of superstitions and traditional beliefs.

“They prefer going to a tantrik and only go to a hospital if specifically told to do so. This is the biggest hurdle. Illiteracy and early marriage with no gaps between child births also lead to problems,” Dr. Marad said.

While the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram, a scheme under the National Rural Health Mission, has done significant work in recent years in identifying and ensuring free treatment of spina bifida in rural areas, Dr. Karmarkar said it is being wound up.

Doctors say there is a dire need of better allocation of resources as the incidence of common birth defects in India is staggeringly high and the country has a long way to go in this regard.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/doctors-call-for-more-awareness-of-spina-bifida/article31012289.ece
43,2020/03/08,Palghar policewoman survives attempt on life,"Masked assailants open fire on highway

A woman officer with the Local Crime Branch (LCB) of the Palghar police survived an attempt on her life on Saturday night.

According to the Palghar police, unidentified assailants opened fire at Assistant Police Inspector Siddhawa Jaybhaye while she was driving her car on the Virar stretch of the Mumbai–Ahmedabad highway.

“The two assailants, who were wearing jackets and masks, pulled up on a Bajaj Pulsar and the pillion rider fired one round at the car before they sped away. Ms. Jaybhaye immediately stopped her vehicle and found that the round had hit the bonnet,” an officer with the Palghar police said.

Ms. Jaybhaye informed the police control room about the incident and a team was sent to the spot to conduct inquiries. An FIR on charge of attempt to murder was filed against unidentified persons under the Indian Penal Code.

Ms. Jaybhaye was recently in the news when her team foiled an attempt by seven accused to hack into an account of Tata Sons. The accused are now under arrest. Investigating officers said it was too early to comment on whether the attack was connected to the case.

The Palghar LCB has also initiated parallel inquiries into the matter. An LCB officer said, “Multiple teams are combing the highway for any CCTV cameras that might have captured the assailants. We have let the word out on WhatsApp groups asking anyone who might have seen which way the assailants went to inform us immediately.”

The officer said repeat offenders with a history of assault with firearms are being picked up. “We are also making inquiries with illegal arms dealers of record to find out if they sold a handgun to anyone over the last few days,” the officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/palghar-policewoman-survives-attempt-on-life/article31012258.ece

45,2020/03/08,"Man steals power to keep dogs in AC, fined ₹7 lakh","Accused is a Nerul-based businessman

A businessman based in Nerul ended up paying a fine of ₹7 lakh after the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) caught him stealing power from the meter room of a housing society.

The Bhandup zone office of the MSEDCL had received a tip-off that a resident of a flat in Twinland housing society in Sector 1, Nerul, was pilfering power. The information was relayed to Rajaram Mane, the Vashi Circle Superintendent Engineer. Mr. Mane then instructed Nerul division executive engineer Sinhaji Gaikwad to look into the matter.

On February 26, Mr. Gaikwad and his team conducted an inspection of the accused’s house and found that the flat consisted of two 2-BHKs with four air conditioners. “One air conditioner was dedicated to his three foreign breed dogs and was kept running 24x7. The dogs needed the room temperature to be at 15 degrees Celsius and so the air conditioner was kept always on. To reduce his bill, he diverted wires from the housing society’s meter room to his flat,” the public relations officer of MSEDCL said.

The accused used to get an average monthly bill of ₹3,000 and the team calculated the loss incurred by MSEDCL over two years. The sum came up to ₹7 lakh and he paid the fine as per the Electricity Act, 2003. As per the rule, MSEDCL does not calculate fines for more than two years.

The power connection, which had been disconnected on February 26, was restored on February 28 after the accused paid the fine.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pdimoz/article31014384.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/dogjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/man-steals-power-to-keep-dogs-in-ac-pays-hefty-fine/article31012210.ece
46,2020/03/08,"Mumbai's firefighters: Risking life and limb to save people, properties and pets","Firefighters in Navi Mumbai responded to 1,780 calls for help in 2019; highest incidents of fire reported in Vashi

Last year, of the 1,780 calls made to fire stations, 611 reported fire incidents under the jurisdiction of the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC), which includes nodes from Ghansoli to CBD Belapur. The highest incidents of fire, which stood at 237, were dealt by the Vashi fire station.

‘A social service’

Amrutanand Borade, an officer at Nerul fire station, said, “Fire officers basically do social service. Apart from dousing fires, we rescue living beings, be it a human, animal or bird. Even when a snake is spotted, we are called in. When a child gets stuck in a room or locks in a parent, we come to their rescue.”

In cases of suicide, if a latch has to be broken, fire officers are contacted. After road accidents, when people are stuck inside mangled vehicles or an oil tanker leaks, calls are made to the fire station. “In drowning cases, whether the person is alive or dead, we have to retrieve the body. Any incident that requires saving life or property, we can be called in. We do not take any call lightly and do our best to reach the spot quickly,” Mr. Borade said.

During the monsoon, when trees fall and block roads, fire officers are called to remove barriers. Every housing society is expected to renew its no objection certificate (NOC) twice a year, while hospitals, hotels, pubs have to renew it once a year.

“A contractor with government license is hired by housing societies to apply for the renewal and maintain the fire equipment. We regularly send notices to societies that flout rules and fail to renew their NOC,” said another fire officer.

NMMC has fire stations at Airoli, Vashi, Nerul, Koparkhairane and Belapur and two more have been proposed. The civic body has one a 68-metre-long Bronto skylift to douse fire in high-rises and a proposal to purchase another one has been tabled.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/daf6vy/article31012182.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8bmfirecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/risking-life-and-limb-to-save-people-properties-and-pets/article31012183.ece

A special thanks to all my coaches, right from my school days to professional cricket, for helping me polish my skills. A heartfelt thanks to the selectors who showed faith in me.

My gratitude to all the captains I played under and all my colleagues from whom I learnt so much about the game and shared some lifelong memories. I would also like to thank all the support staff who were a constant pillar of support in my long journey.

Thank you to the BCCI, Mumbai Cricket Association and Vidarbha Cricket Association for giving me the opportunity to represent them.

My corporate team Indian Oil Corporation Ltd that has looked after me for 20-odd years. My school Anjuman-e-Islam from where my journey to become a professional cricketer began. Sudhir Naik sir for giving me the opportunity to play for the National cricket club.

I’d also like to thank all the bowlers who bowled tirelessly for me to improve my game and to my well wishers, who have always prayed for me to do well.

Among moments I will cherish the most is getting my India Test cap, scoring 202 vs Pakistan, 212 vs West Indies and winning the Test series in West Indies and England 2006-07.

I am honoured to have shared the dressing room with the likes of Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, Anil Kumble, VVS Laxman, Virender Sehwag, and MS Dhoni to name a few.

What can I say about Sachin? Icould go on and on about him. He was my role model. Feel really blessed to have watched him play from such close quarters. In my opinion he was one of the best players of that era along with Brian Lara.

My longest association was with the Mumbai team and it’s here that I learned about the khadoos nature of cricket that Mumbai players are known for.

Represented the 41-time Ranji champions from my under-16 days till 2014. Sanjay Manjrekar was my first captain. I feel privileged to have shared the Mumbai dressing room with Tendulkar, Vinod Kambli, Zaheer Khan, Amol Muzumdar, Nilesh Kulkarni to name a few.

After becoming the captain in 2008, I hope I passed on some legacy to Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane, Surya Kumar Yadav, Aditya Tare and others.

I would also like to thank Chandrakant Pandit for showing faith in me when no team showed any interest to have me as a professional for 2017-18 season. It is because of him that I got a chance to play for Vidarbha again and create history of winning a Ranji Trophy and Irani Cup twice.

My father wanted one of his sons to represent India and I feel proud to have fulfilled his dream.

After all these years in cricket, it is time to move on. But just like the red ball format which is very dear to me, it’s the end of only the first innings. I am looking forward to the second innings in any capacity, be it in coaching, commentary, etc. As long as I stay involved with the game as this game has given me so much.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/6jd44h/article31012142.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8BMWASIMJAFFER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/its-the-end-of-only-the-first-innings-i-am-looking-forward-to-the-second-innings/article31012146.ece
48,2020/03/08,Cilic proves too strong for Nagal,"Paes-Bopanna had won the doubles to provide some hope

Leander Paes and Rohan Bopanna kept the Indian team’s hopes alive by winning the doubles 6-3, 6-7(9), 7-5 against Mate Pavic and Franko Skugor of Croatia in the Davis Cup qualifier tie here on Saturday.

But, Marin Cilic proved too strong for India No. 1 Sumit Nagal, who came in for Prajnesh Gunneswaran for the reverse singles. The former US Open champion and World No. 3 won 6-0, 6-1 against Nagal to seal the tie for Croatia.

After the superb performance of Ramkumar Ramanathan in the second rubber against Cilic — he lost two close tie-breakers in both sets — there was hope that India could put up a fight on the second day.

Cilic may have slipped to 37th in the rankings, but showed a lot of resolve to close out the tie, after Skugor and Pavic had run Paes and Bopanna close after saving two match points in the second set tie-breaker.

The Indian pair was in a spot of bother when Bopanna’s serve was broken in the fifth game of the decider, but the two broke Skugor’s serve in the eighth and 12th games to pull through.

Bopanna hit a magnificent backhand return while Paes made a smashing forehand return on the next. Facing a third match-point, Skugor delivered a double fault.

Interestingly, it was the 45th doubles victory for the 46-year-old Leander, and third on the trot following the wins against China and Pakistan, partnering Bopanna and Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan respectively.

Leander also took his overall win-loss record to 93-35 in Davis Cup.

It was the unfancied Borna Gojo, ranked 277th in the world who had laid the foundation for Croatia’s triumph with a 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 win over the 132nd-ranked Prajnesh in the first rubber.

That victory, followed by the fighting performance from Cilic, had put the Croats in the driving seat.

In the previous tie against Croatia in 1995, Paes had won all his three matches, including a five-set win over Goran Ivanisevic. But India did not have any such magician this time around!

The results:

Fifth seed Zeel Desai missed a match point and was beaten 5-7, 7-6(7), 6-2 in three hours and 55 minutes by top seed Sandra Samir in the final of the $15,000 ITF women’s tennis tournament here on Sunday.

In a see-saw battle in which she recovered from being down 0-3 in the second set, saved two set points and missed a match point at 7-6 in the tie-breaker, Zeel was overtaken in the one- sided decider.

Sandra fired two aces in the end, one to save a break point and the other to seal victory in the eighth game of the third set, in which she led 4-1 to wrest the initiative. The 22-year-old Sandra served four aces in the match and converted eight of 16 break points that she forced.

Zeel converted seven of 16 break points in the match, and won 119 points to 133 by Sandra.

It was a commendable performance by the 21-year-old Zeel who had earlier lost the doubles final.

She had won a singles title in the ITF professional circuit in Gwalior in 2017. She has also won four doubles titles on the Tour.

In the $108,320 Challenger in Mexico, fifth seeds Sriram Balaji and Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan, occupying the position of the top seeds in the draw, went down 7-5, 6-4 in the doubles semifinals by Brazilians Orlando Luz and Rafael Matos.

The Indian pair collected 35 ATP points and $2,160.

Sania Mirza and Ankita Raina combined strong to help India to the World Group play-off as they won the decisive doubles as India beat Indonesia 2-1 in the Fed Cup Asia-Oceania group-1 women’s tennis tournament in Dubai on Saturday.

It was the fourth win for India, after the tough start against China which qualified as the No.1 team, winning all its league matches in the six-team competition.

It was a heady climax after the power and craft of Sania and Ankita swung the contest in favour of India 7-6(4), 6-0 against Priska Madelyn Nugroho and Aldila Sutjiadi.

Rising to the occasion

Sania played her part well and pulled her weight when required to help the team progress to the play-off for the first time in the history of Indian women’s tennis.

Ankita had earlier risen to the occasion to keep the Indian hopes alive as she beat Aldila Sutjiadi 6-3, 6-3 to put India on par 1-1 against Indonesia.

It was possible because of the superb performance of Rutuja Bhosale and Ankita Raina, who kept the team afloat against tricky opposition.

51,2020/03/08,"Not just computers, even your cars aren’t safe from hackers","Study reveals how criminals manipulate key-fobs with ease

If you thought only your computers and cell phones were under threat from hackers, think again. A recent research has revealed that not even your cars are safe from cyber attacks.

A joint study was conducted by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven) in Belgium and the University of Birmingham in the U.K., the results were made public earlier this week. The research paper describes how electronic key-fobs, which are used to lock and unlock cars, can be hacked by cyber criminals with surprising ease, and millions of cars are at risk.

The key-fob, or immobiliser, enables the user of a vehicle to lock or unlock their car with the touch of a button. The system was invented to try and control car thefts, which are traditionally executed by bringing together certain wires in the ignition, known as “hot-wiring” a car, which starts the ignition without a key. The research paper points out vulnerabilities in the immobilisers of several models of Hyundai, Toyota and Kia.

Also Read Hackers may have access to your smart device

RFID device

According to the report, all a hacker has to do is to use a radio frequency identification (RFID) device within close range of a key-fob, which exploits the vulnerability in the immobiliser system and downloads its secret code to the hacker’s device. Using this information, the hackers can clone the target’s key-fob, use it to unlock the car and drive away without raising any alarm whatsoever. The only challenge that remains after hacking the key-fob is to override the ignition, but car thieves had surpassed that hurdle way back when they invented hot-wiring.

The car models named in the research report include Auris, Camry, Corolla, FJ Cruiser, Fortuner, Hiace, Highlander, Hilux, Land Cruiser, RAV4, Urban Cruiser and Yaris by Toyota, and I-10, I-20, Veloster, IX20 and I-40 by Hyundai.

The report describes how the research team obtained a large number of electronic control units used in immobilisers of several cars and reverse-engineered their firmware — the permanent software programmed in devices — which enabled them to spot the vulnerabilities.

DoS attack

Apart from car thefts, the other possibility pointed out in the report is that of a denial of service (DoS) attack, where hackers can take over a large number of key-fobs and simply not let users unlock their vehicles. On a large enough scale, such an attack could be chaotic.

The report states, “Performing this type of DoS attack can be automated by building a device which repeatedly broadcasts the required commands. While there might be little incentive for someone to do this type of attack, it could lead to bad publicity for the affected car manufacturers and increased revenue for local garage owners.”

“Such hacks prove that cybersecurity is a separate discipline, which is difficult for the IT infrastructure provider to fathom,” Special Inspector General of Police Brijesh Singh said.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ejmvtk/article31010752.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8bmcar-thief,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/not-just-computers-even-your-cars-arent-safe-from-hackers/article31010753.ece

U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden added to his list of endorsements from high-profile Democrats on Sunday with a nod from Senator Kamala Harris, a former rival for the nomination to challenge President Donald Trump in November.

The backing of the black Senator, who clashed with Mr. Biden sharply during debates, could give Mr. Biden a boost as he campaigns ahead of the next round of presidential nominating contests.

Mr. Biden, 77, and his progressive opponent Bernie Sanders, 78, the Senator from Vermont, are competing for their party’s delegates in six States on Tuesday.

“I have decided that I am, with great enthusiasm, going to endorse Joe Biden for President of the U.S.,” she said in a recorded message on Twitter. “I really believe in him and I have known him for a long time.”

Ms. Harris, a first-term Senator for California and the State’s former Attorney General, was considered a top-tier contender when she launched her quest for the presidency with a rally in Oakland, California, that drew 20,000 people.

She also received attention for a blistering attack on Mr. Biden over his civil rights record in one of the early presidential debates. But her campaign ultimately struggled to build on early support and raise money.

62,2020/03/08,UN Afghan mission calls for including women in peace talks,"The UN mission in Afghanistan marked International Women’s Day under the global theme of “I Am Generation Equality: Realizing Women’s Rights” to leverage individual and collective efforts to make gender equality and women’s rights a living reality, the statement said.

The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) on Sunday called for inclusion of women in peace talks.

Marking International Women’s Day, the UNAMA said in a statement that with anticipation building that the door for intra—Afghan peace talks will open, women’s advocacy groups and activists across Afghanistan have focused on developing strategies to protect and advance the gains they have made in social, political, civic and economic life, reports Xinhua news agency.

“These strategies, backed by the UN and coupled with the growing recognition that women must be included in any formal peace negotiations, are expected to yield results: country—wide and community—level ownership, along with the full and meaningful participation in political decision—making among all members of society,” the statement said.

The UN mission in Afghanistan marked International Women’s Day under the global theme of “I Am Generation Equality: Realizing Women’s Rights” to leverage individual and collective efforts to make gender equality and women’s rights a living reality, the statement said.

“To create a peaceful and inclusive society, it is essential that Afghan women have access to education, healthcare and decent work, and that they are fully represented in all areas of political decision—making, from parliament to the peace table,” Tadamichi Yamamoto, special UN envoy and head of UN mission, was quoted in the statement as saying.

“While we have seen significant progress on women’s rights in Afghanistan, including formal legislation and national action plans, we continue to see powerful social and political pushback,” he said.

“This situation must change for Afghan women, and for the benefit of Afghanistan as a nation,” Ms. Yamamoto noted.

Recognizing that Afghanistan will be more resilient in the face of conflict when gender equality is prioritized, the UN will continue to support all efforts toward gender equality and all opportunities for women to reclaim their rightful place in all areas of society, the statement said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/5fm7eq/article29482534.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23-KUGELMAN-UN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-afghan-mission-calls-for-including-women-in-peace-talks/article31014597.ece
63,2020/03/08,Maldives confirms first two coronavirus cases; two resort islands locked down,"The two infected people, who are both staff at the Kuredu Island Resort, tested positive late on Saturday. They are believed to have caught the disease from an Italian tourist who has returned to Italy and tested positive there.

The Maldives has curbed movement on several resort islands, authorities said on Sunday, after the country reported its first two cases of coronavirus.

The two infected people, who are both staff at the Kuredu Island Resort, tested positive late on Saturday. They are believed to have caught the disease from an Italian tourist who has returned to Italy and tested positive there.

There are more than 1,400 people on the island, split equally between guests and staff, according to the tourism ministry.

“These two cases which tested positive are from a resort. They are employees of the resort and are now quarantined,” said Ali Waheed, the tourism minister of the island nation, the economy of which is heavily dependent on foreign tourists.

“The period for the temporary restrictions will be decided by the medical teams. Right now, we have identified people who were in contact with the patients and they are in self-isolation along with secondary contacts. At this time we can say that these individuals will be monitored for fourteen days.”

Mr. Waheed said the country was still deciding whether tourists who were not in contact with the patients would be allowed to leave.

It has banned passengers originating from or who had transited through or spent any time in Italy in the preceding 14 days, effective from Sunday.

Officials at the Kuredu Island Resort were not immediately reachable for comment.

The Maldives Health Protection Agency (HPA) said on Sunday it had introduced “temporary restrictive measures” on a second island after an Italian national developed symptoms at the Sandies resort on Bathala island. It was unclear how many people were on the island.

It added two French nationals on a third island who showed symptoms of the disease had tested negative, and restrictions on travel there had been lifted.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kpano1/article31014469.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MALDIVES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/maldives-confirms-first-two-coronavirus-cases-two-resort-islands-locked-down/article31014470.ece
64,2020/03/08,"Two more succumb to coronavirus in U.S., New York declares state of emergency","In New York, the number of COVID-19 cases jumped by 21 overnight to a statewide total of 76 people, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday. He issued a declaration of emergency.

Two more people succumbed to the novel coronavirus in Washington state, officials said on Saturday, bringing the nationwide toll to 19, while the number of confirmed cases in New York jumped by 21 overnight and a cruise ship with infected passengers remained stranded outside San Francisco.

More than half of all U.S. states have reported cases of the coronavirus, which originated in China last year and causes the sometimes deadly respiratory illness COVID-19. As the outbreak takes root, daily life has become increasingly disrupted, with concerts and conferences canceled and universities telling students to stay home and take classes online.

Organizers of the Conservative Political Action Conference, a high-profile annual gathering that took place in Maryland last month, said on Saturday one of their attendees had tested positive for the virus after exposure prior to the event. The person had no interactions with President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence, who were in attendance, the American Conservative Union said in a statement.

The two latest deaths were in Washington's King County, the hardest hit area in the United States after the virus spread among residents at a nursing facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland. The first deaths on the East Coast were announced late Friday, with two people succumbing in Florida.

Off California, passengers on a cruise ship that was barred from docking in San Francisco after some aboard tested positive for the novel coronavirus did not know on Saturday when they might be able to step ashore.

Mr. Trump said on Friday he would prefer the Grand Princess's 2,400 passengers and 1,100 crew remain out at sea, but that he would let others decide where she should dock.

After 19 crew and two passengers out of 46 tested on the Grand Princess were found to have the virus, Pence said the ocean liner will be taken to an unspecified non-commercial port where everyone on board will be tested again, and that those ”who need to be quarantined will be quarantined” and those who need medical care will receive it.

U.S. officials also began tracking another cruise ship that may have shared crew with the Grand Princess or the Diamond Princess, another ship where the coronavirus spread onboard, Mr. Pence said.

One Grand Princess passenger described a dull and sometimes queasy wait for news of when their limbo would end.

“It bugs me that my relatives in the Bay Area know what's going to happen with us before I do,” Elizabeth Aleteanu of Colorado Springs said in an interview conducted via Facebook.

She turned 35 on Wednesday in a small, windowless cabin shared with her husband and two young children, where the rocking of the vessel sometimes left her nauseated.

“The cruise director and staff called my phone and sang happy birthday,” she wrote. “They delivered a princess notebook, birthday card, set of dominoes and a flower arrangement to my cabin. I'm not sure that we're getting off today. It's a big flower arrangement ... makes me think we'll be on board for a hot minute.”

The ship's captain had addressed passengers earlier to say he did not know when they could dock, and that one guest who was critically ill on Friday was taken off the ship, Ms. Aleteanu said. The ship has increased its offering of television programs to help passengers pass the time, she said.

The predicament of the Grand Princess was reminiscent of the Diamond Princess cruise liner, also owned by Carnival Corp , the world's leading cruise operator. It was quarantined off Japan in February and was for a time the largest concentration of coronavirus cases outside China.

In New York, the number of confirmed cases jumped by 21 overnight to a statewide total of 76 people, 10 of whom have been hospitalized, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday. He issued a declaration of emergency.

“It allows expedited purchasing and expedited hiring, which is what we need right now,” Mr. Cuomo told a news conference.

Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, told a news conference at the White House on Saturday that a total of 2.1. million coronavirus tests will have been shipped to non-public labs by Monday, as the Trump administration aims to counter criticism that its response to the disease has been sluggish.

Mr. Hahn said the focus is on getting tests to the highest risk areas in Washington state and California.

Multiple manufacturers will soon send millions more tests, he said. “What they told us is they believe they could scale up by the end of next week ... for the capacity for 4 million additional tests that could be shipped,” Mr. Hahn said.

The respiratory illness has spread to more than 90 countries, killing more than 3,400 people and infecting more than 100,000 worldwide.

The economic damage has also intensified and stock markets have continued to tumble. To mitigate against the virus, some banks in New York are dividing their teams of traders between central locations and secondary sites in New Jersey and Connecticut, according to sources familiar with the matter.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc had a scare this past week when an employee at its Lower Manhattan offices told the bank he had been at a temple service in a city suburb with a lawyer who later tested positive for the coronavirus. The bank said the employee was sent home and has been under self-quarantine since then “out of an abundance of caution.”

The employee, however, did not have contact with the lawyer at the service and has not shown any signs of illness, the bank said. He is expected to return to work next week when it would have been two weeks since he attended the service.

Goldman also cleaned the floor on which he worked at its headquarters. All floors remained operational, though Goldman let employees who felt uncomfortable work remotely, it said.

“We have no confirmed cases of employees who have contracted COVID-19 and all our buildings are fully operational,” the bank said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/snefeg/article31014271.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKNEWYORK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/two-more-succumb-to-coronavirus-in-us-new-york-declares-state-of-emergency/article31014272.ece

The new measures will apply to about a quarter of the Italian population and will be in force at least until April 3.

In the middle of the night, Mr. Conte signed a decree that imposes new restrictions to the movement of people in the region of Lombardy and in a number of northern provinces.

The entry and exit to and from these areas will be allowed only in exceptional cases.

Italy on Saturday saw its biggest daily increase in COVID-19 cases since the outbreak broke out in the north of the country on Feb. 21.

In its daily update, Italy’s civil protection agency said the number of people with the COVID-19 rose by 1,247 in the last 24 hours, taking the total to 5,883. Another 36 people also died as a result of the virus, taking the total to 233.

Day-to-day life affected around the world

The COVID-19 tightened its grip on day-to-day life around the world on Saturday as ports in several countries turned back ships with infected passengers, Iran declared a “sacred jihad” against the virus and the Vatican announced it would livestream the pope’s weekly blessing.

Around the world, more and more countries were bracing for a big increase in virus cases. Western countries have been increasingly imitating China where the virus first emerged late last year, and which has suffered the vast majority of infections - by imposing travel controls and shutting down public events.

After the city of Venice cancelled its cherished Carnival and governments warned citizens against travel to Italy, the epicentre of Europe’s outbreak, the country is facing a possible recession. Hotel occupancy rates in the lagoon city are down to 1%-2%.

Covid-19: Full coverage

“The surface of the Grand Canal is like glass because the boats that transport merchandise are not there. On the vaporetti (water buses), there are only five or six people,” Stefania Stea, vice president of the Venice hoteliers association, said.

Italy saw its biggest one-day jump in infections, and the Vatican decided to livestream the pope’s Sunday blessing to prevent people gathering at St. Peter’s Square.

Passenger-packed cruise ships confronted their own virus problems.

Officials in California were deciding Saturday where to dock the Grand Princess cruise ship, after 21 tested positive for the virus. There is evidence the ship now idling off San Francisco was the breeding ground for a deadly cluster of almost 20 cases during an earlier voyage.

""Those that will need to be quarantined will be quarantined,” U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said. “Those who will require medical help will receive it.” President Donald Trump said he would have preferred not to let the passengers disembark onto American soil but would defer to medical experts.

In Egypt, a cruise ship on the Nile with more than 150 aboard was under quarantine in the southern city of Luxor after 12 positive tests.

Also Saturday, the port of Penang in Malaysia turned away the cruise ship Costa Fortuna because 64 of the 2,000 aboard are from Italy. The ship had already been rejected by Thailand, and is now heading to Singapore.

And in Malta, which reported its first case of the virus Saturday, the MSC Opera ship agreed not to enter the Mediterranean country’s port amid local worries - even though there are no infections suspected on board. The ship continued to Messina, Sicily, where passengers were allowed to disembark after officials reviewed medical records.

Transmission of the virus is now going in every direction.

While the global death toll has risen past 3,400, more people have now recovered from the virus than are sickened by it. As of Saturday, nearly 90,000 cases have been reported in Asia; more than 8,000 in Europe; 6,000 in the Mideast; about 450 in North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, and fewer than 50 cases reported so far in Africa.

While many scientists say the world is clearly in the grips of a pandemic - a serious global outbreak the World Health Organization isn’t calling it that yet, saying the word might spook the world further.

The virus is still much less widespread than annual flu epidemics, which cause up to 5 million severe cases around the world and up to 650,000 deaths annually, according to the WHO.

In Iran, fears over the virus and the government’s waning credibility has become a major challenge to leaders already reeling from American sanctions. More than 1,000 infections were confirmed overnight, bringing the country’s total to 5,823 cases, including 145 deaths.

The government declared a “sacred jihad” against the virus- Wearing gas masks and waterproof fatigues, members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard sprayed down streets and hospitals with disinfectants.

South Korea, the hardest-hit country outside China, reported 448 new cases on Saturday, taking the total to 7,041, with 48 deaths overall.

Italy has seen its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases since the outbreak broke out in the north of the country on Feb. 21. In its daily update, Italy’s civil protection agency said the number of people with the coronavirus rose by 1,247 in the last 24 hours, taking the total to 5,883. Another 36 people also died as a result of the virus, taking the total to 233.

China on Sunday morning reported 44 new cases over the past 24 hours, the lowest level since it began publishing nationwide figures on Jan 20, and 27 new fatalities. But while infections were increasing more slowly, the country was struck anew by tragedy- A hotel used for medical observation of people who had contact with coronavirus patients collapsed on Saturday, trapping 70 people inside, according to local news reports.

Countries outside Asia stepped up efforts to control the outbreak.

Saudi Arabia banned spectators at any sports competitions starting Saturday. The NBA and British sports teams are considering the same.

""I ain’t playing if I ain’t got the fans in the crowd,” Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James said. “That’s who I play for.”

Spain deployed police to enforce a quarantine. Austria confiscated 21,000 disposable masks that a Turkish company smuggled aboard a tour bus, seeking to profit from soaring demand. Turkish police, meanwhile, threatened legal action against social media accounts accused of spreading false virus information.

The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention is urging older adults and people with severe medical conditions to “stay home as much as possible” and avoid crowds.

Most people who get the virus have mild cases, though the elderly face greater risks. Among the many new cases in Europe on Saturday was a doctor in Slovenia who was in contact with more than 100 people in a nursing home after a ski trip to neighboring Italy.

Global markets were enjoying a weekend respite from market panic, but the world economy faced mounting damage. China, the world’s biggest trader, reported Saturday its exports tumbled 17.2% from a year earlier in January and February.

67,2020/03/08,Coronavirus jump | Italy poised to lock down Lombardy,"The new rules include telling people not to enter or leave Lombardy, which is home to some 10 million people, as well as 11 provinces in four of Italy's 19 other regions, according to a draft decree seen by Reuters.

Italy is set to impose a virtual lockdown on its wealthiest and most populous region, which includes the financial capital Milan, as part of tough new measures to try to contain the coronavirus outbreak.

The new rules include telling people not to enter or leave Lombardy, which is home to some 10 million people, as well as 11 provinces in four of Italy's 19 other regions, according to a draft decree seen by Reuters.

All museums, gyms, cultural centres, ski resorts and swimming pools will be shut in the targeted areas, according to the decree, which was due to come into force from Sunday but was delayed after local politicians asked for more time to review the restrictions.

The head of the civil protection agency said on Saturday the decree would be presented later in the day, after data showed the number of coronavirus infections jumped by more than 1,200 in the past 24 hours.

However, at midnight Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had still not signed off on it, after the leaked draft prompted pushback from the governors of Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna, another region affected.

So far, only a few limited areas of northern Italy, known as ”red zones”, have been quarantined.

If the draft is approved, leave will be cancelled for all healthcare workers, weddings, funerals and sports events suspended, and home working should be adopted as much as possible.

The 11 provinces affected are those around Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia and Rimini in the region of Emilia-Romagna - Venice, Padua and Treviso in the region of Veneto - Asti and Alessandria in Piedmont - and the province of Pesaro and Urbino in the central region of Marche.

All schools and universities will be closed in Lombardy and the listed provinces until at least April 3. This week, the government announced schools all over the country would be closed until March 15.

The epidemic is already weighing hard on Italy's struggling economy and Rome has pledged to spend 7.5 billion euros ($8.5 billion) to tackle the outbreak and its consequences.

'We will win'

The decree instructs citizens to “absolutely avoid” either entering or leaving the areas listed, and even to avoid moving around other than for emergencies or “essential work reasons” within the designated areas.

Cafes and restaurants will be allowed to stay open as long as a distance of one metre between customers can be guaranteed.

The number of coronavirus cases in Italy, Europe's worst-hit country, reached 5883 on Saturday, the civil protection agency said, the biggest daily rise since the epidemic began just over two weeks ago.

Deaths due to the highly infectious virus were up 36 to 233, the head of the agency, Angelo Borrelli, told a news conference.

The disease was first confirmed in Italy 15 days ago and remains mainly centred on northern regions, especially Lombardy, but cases have now been confirmed in each of the country's 20 regions, with deaths recorded in eight of them.

On Friday, the government approved a plan to employ up to 20,000 new doctors and nurses to respond to the emergency.

Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto represent 85% of national cases overall and 92% of recorded deaths.

“We will win this battle if our citizens adopt a responsible attitude and change their way of living,” Borrelli said

In the worst affected areas, Italy's hospitals are under growing strain. The number of patients in intensive care rose to 567, up 23% from the day before.

Of those originally infected, 589 have fully recovered.

National Health Institute chief Silvio Brusaferro said the average age of patients who have died was over 81. They were prevalently male and more than 80% had more than two underlying health conditions.

The outbreak has killed more than 3,400 people worldwide and spread across more than 90 nations outside China.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rha4uy/article31014137.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LOMBARDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-jump-italy-poised-to-lock-down-lombardy/article31014138.ece

A fire engulfed a refugee shelter on the island of Lesbos as Greece announced further restrictions towards asylum seekers in response to a migration surge enabled by Turkey.

The fire on Saturday at One Happy Family, a Swiss-operated family care centre for refugees just outside the island capital, came after violence at the weekend directed at aid groups and journalists on Lesbos.

“The school building has a lot of damage, we can’t say more at the moment,” a source among the operators told AFP.

“The fire brigade is there, our team on the ground as well,” they added.

There were no immediate reports of injuries.

Over 1,700 migrants have landed on Lesbos and four other Aegean islands from Turkey over the past week, adding to the 38,000 already crammed into abysmal and overstretched refugee centres.

The new surge has ramped up already high tensions on Lesbos, an island that has been on the migration frontline for years.

Frustration exploded into violence last weekend with mobs setting up roadblocks, attacking cars carrying NGO workers and beating journalists.

Earlier Saturday, the Greek migration minister announced plans for two new camps to house asylum-seekers who arrived after March 1, when Turkey announced it would no longer prevent people from trying to cross into the European Union.

On the land border with Turkey, tens of thousands of asylum-seekers have been trying to break through for a week.

There have been numerous exchanges of tear gas and stones with Greek riot police.

Turkey has accused Greece of injuring many migrants and killing at least five, a claim Athens denies.

“We want to build two closed centres in (the northern region of) Serres and the greater Athens area with 1,000 places,” migration minister Notis Mitarachi told Skai TV.

“We need the backing of local communities. We cannot leave all (these) people on the islands,” he said.

Mitarachi also said state support for refugees would be drastically reduced, and that they would be asked to leave camps after securing protected status.

“Accommodation and benefits for those granted asylum will be interrupted within a month. From then on, they will have to work for a living. This makes our country a less attractive destination for migration flows,” the minister said.

Far-right militants from other parts of Europe have travelled to Lesbos and the Greek border with Turkey, among them Swedish far-right leader Jimmie Akesson, who reportedly handed out flyers at Edirne with the message “Sweden is full“.

On Friday, two Germans and two Austrians -- identified as hardline nationalists by local media -- told police they had been attacked and beaten on the central Lesbos market.

One of the four, who claimed they were journalists, was identified as Mario Mueller, a German member of the far-right Identitarian Movement.

On Saturday, anti-fascist activists organised a gathering in support of refugees on Lesbos.

73,2020/03/08,Law college admissions hang in balance,"Bar Council of India threatens to stop enrolment if there is no improvement in infrastructure

Admissions to the Ambedkar Government Law College for the next academic year have run into rough weather following the decision of the Bar Council of India to stop enrolment if the college authorities fail to comply with the Rules of Legal Education 2008 of providing adequate faculty and infrastructure.

The Bar Council, in a circular on February 14, had pointed out the absence of a wholetime Principal, shortcomings in core faculty (law and non-law subjects) position, lack of availability of prescribed books and non-compliance of rules on semester exam, teaching hours and moot court exercise.

The college was given 15 days to comply with the circular failing which the institute would not be allowed to admit students for 2020-21 academic year.

A source in the college told The Hindu that the staff holding charge of the institute on February 20 moved a file seeking clarification from the government on proceeding further to implement the circular. The issues related to semester exam and teaching hours could only be addressed at the college level, the source said and added that rest of the subjects were entirely under the domain of the government.

“So far, we have not heard anything on the filling of vacancies, appointment of a regular principal and procuring books for the library, a staff member in the college said. It was not clear whether admissions to degree courses in the coming academic year would happen.

The college offers three-year and five-year degree courses with a total intake of 120 students. “It is sad that issues were allowed to be prolonged for so many years. We are going to celebrate 50th anniversary next year. The institute has been functioning without a whole time principal and adequate staff. A college with such a legacy is now being run by a staff in the lower rank,” said a student. If the college has to comply with the Rules of Legal Education, the government has to appoint four more faculty members in the law stream and has to sanction posts for non-law subjects such as English, Sociology and Economics. Apart from a faculty from the Bharathidasan Government College for handling political science subject, none of the non-law subjects are taught in the institute, a staff pointed out.

“What is the purpose of conducting exams in non-law subjects when there are no teachers?” he asked.

No books

The institute had been functioning without adequate books specified by BCI and a librarian. The circular also pointed out deficiency in not having internal marks in the semester system and necessity to maintain teaching hours.

One of the serious issues, though circular has not mentioned about it, was the absence of security staff on the campus spread over 28 acres.

Anti-social elements have a free run on the campus at night, said a staff.

Three months ago, Drawing and Dispersing Officer S. Srinivasan filed a complaint with Kalapet police marking copies to the Director-General of Police and Director of Higher and Technical Education about loss of property. The institute had lost a substantial number of tables, chairs, electrical equipment and pipes, the staff said.

Due to lack of security, the newly constructed girls hostel remained unoccupied since its inaugural in 2008. “Now, it is overrun with thick vegetation. Anti-social elements have damaged the building,” he added.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/mi4xen/article31011957.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THPONDYHOSTEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/law-college-admissions-hang-in-balance/article31011958.ece
74,2020/03/08,Kepler and his laws of planetary motion,"What is now seen as “Kepler’s third law” was first conceived by Johannes Kepler on March 8, 1618. A.S.Ganesh takes a look at the man and the laws that he formulated over 400 years ago, which forever changed our perception of planets and their motion...

When we are talking about astronomy, it is hard to not mention Johannes Kepler. A German astronomer and mathematician, Kepler was one of the central figures in the scientific revolution of the 17th Century. For the thought that our solar system had planets travelling in circles around the Earth was forever debunked by Kepler and his laws of planetary motion.

Born into an economically weak family in Germany in December 1571, Kepler’s intelligence was apparent from an early age and he won a scholarship to the University of Tubingen. Studying to become a Lutheran minister, it was here that Kepler was introduced to the ideas of heliocentrism by Polish polymath Nicolaus Copernicus.

Backs heliocentrism

Kepler found work teaching mathematics at Graz, Austria and spent his spare time studying astronomy. It was during this time, in 1596, that Kepler wrote his first outspoken defence of the Copernican system with the sun as the centre of the solar system.

This was a dangerous stance at those times when popular belief and religious thoughts placed Earth in the centre of the solar system. The political and the religious difficulties of the era meant that Kepler was banished from Graz.

Brahe's data

Fortunately for Kepler, he found an opportunity to work as the assistant of renowned Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe and so moved with his family to Prague (now in Czech Republic). Having built an observatory and used it to track the motion of planets, Brahe possessed the most accurate astronomical observations of the time.

Even though Brahe was impressed with Kepler’s studies during an earlier meeting and had therefore invited Kepler to work with him, he also mistrusted Kepler, fearing that he might supersede him as the best astronomer of the time.

Mars mystery

This meant that Brahe shared with Kepler only a small part of all the data that he had at his disposal. Brahe tasked Kepler with solving the mystery surrounding Mars, whose movements were among the most puzzling problems in astronomy at the time. Some believe that Brahe did this assuming that the difficulty of the problem would keep Kepler occupied long enough, during which time Brahe was hoping to perfect his own geocentric model with Earth as the centre of the solar system. If this were indeed the case, then Brahe might have unwillingly given the part of his data that led Kepler to his correct model of the solar system.

Kepler is believed to have said that he would solve the Martian problem in eight days, but it took more like eight years. Brahe died in 1601 and Kepler managed to gain possession of Brahe’s vast observations as well.

Kepler published what are now known as the first two laws of planetary motion in 1609 in Astronomia Nova, considered to be among his most important work. It took him almost another decade to conceive what is now known as the third law of planetary motion. For, he first arrived at the idea on March 8, 1618 and discarded it, only to recall it months later when he realised that it was the fruit of his “labor of seventeen years on Brahe’s observations”.

The three laws

In short, the three laws of planetary motion can be given as follows: (1) Planets move in ellipses with the sun at one focus; (2) The radius vector describes equal areas in equal times; and (3) The squares of the periodic times are to each other as the cubes of the mean distances.

Even though Kepler never called these as the first, second and third laws of planetary motion, that is how they are now known. Apart from placing the sun at its rightful place in the solar system and allowing us to better appreciate planetary motion, these laws also led English polymath Isaac Newton to his law of gravitation. Our understanding of the universe was never the same again.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/2z1r4t/article30943038.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08istbJohannesKepler1610jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/kepler-and-his-laws-of-planetary-motion/article30943039.ece
75,2020/03/08,"COVID-19 patient clustering, a first in State","‘First sign of a community spread’

Kerala was the first State in the country to have reported confirmed COVID-19 cases over a month ago. However, these were all imported cases from China, who recovered well and the illness had been contained by the authorities with absolutely no secondary spread of the infection.

This is the first time that patient clustering has happened in the State, signalling a community spread of COVID-19 from an imported case. It also lays bare the fact that airport surveillance is not fool-proof. Unless the State initiates second-line surveillance of hospital-based cases of viral pneumonia from public and private sector hospitals immediately, community-spread of COVID-19 in other parts of the State would not come to light.

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said despite appeals made by the Health Department it was irresponsible behaviour on the part of the family that now exposed the State to a serious threat of a possible spread of COVID-19.

She said when the district medical team visited the family, the family resisted hospitalisation. They had to be forcefully shifted to isolation ward at Pathanamthitta GH. The contact tracing exercise now under way is massive, as the family is believed to have made several social visits after reaching Kerala. It entails preparing a list of primary, secondary and tertiary contacts who will have to be quarantined.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/covid-19-patient-clustering-a-first-in-state/article31017216.ece

Cochin International Airport authorities have decided to implement a slew of measures in the wake of the spread of COVID-19. A massive drive for disinfection will be carried out at the airport following the confirmation that three people who passed through the airport were infected with the virus. This follows a meeting held at the airport to review the latest development, said a press release. The meeting was chaired by District Collector S. Suhas.

The universal screening of passengers started in the airport on March 3 and there were in-flight announcements and intimation at immigration counters for passengers coming from countries like Italy. However, the passengers diagnosed with COVID-19 had failed to report their travel details to the officials. There were 198 passengers in the Doha-Kochi flight.

Dedicated aerobridges

Flights arriving from Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore have been allotted parking bay 19 and 20 and aerobridge 1 and 2. Passengers from these countries are being given dedicated health screen counters, immigration counters, hand baggage screening X-ray, and registered baggage belts. No mixing is permitted between passengers from Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and other passengers.

45-lakh women

The largest congregation of women, with a projected 45-lakh women reaching the capital city to offer pongala, could turn out to be a perfect recipe for disaster in the new situation. Yet the department has confined itself to making a public appeal to all to be extra cautious and to stay at home if at all they have any illness, respiratory or otherwise.

78,2020/03/08,"Coronavirus | Kerala on high alert, home quarantine back to 28 days","Health Minister calls for extra caution during Attukal Pongala that is to be held today

The government has declared a high state of alert across the State, with five new cases of COVID 19 being confirmed in Pathanamthitta district. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in a facebook post here on Sunday, said that people should obey the advisories issued by the Health Department for the safety of general public.

The Health Department h issued revised guidelines in tune with the new situation, while the clinical protocols for treatment would be the same that had been issued earlier by the World Health Organisation.

Diarrhoea

While most patients develop respiratory symptoms such as fever, sore throat and cough, in rare instances, people also develop gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea.

As only supportive care is available for COVID 19, it is important that people seek medical care without delay. Remaining in quarantine and reducing contact with others is the most important step to be adopted in case one contracts the virus.

Airport and sea port surveillance are being strengthened.

Apart from the COVID-affected nations like China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Vietnam, Nepal, Indonesia, Malaysia, people coming in direct flights from Italy, South Korea and Iran will also be screened.

Contact number

The Health Department has appealed to people to self report travel history. People have also been asked to be on the lookout for people who have returned from COVID-affected nations in every neighbourhood and to report to the authorities (Helpline DISHA 1056/0471-2552056).

People who are on home quarantine, who may develop any symptom, should contact the helpline. The Health Department will arrange for their pick-up and transport to designated hospitals.

Surveillance

Kerala has put 732 persons across the State under surveillance following COVID-19 threat. Of these, 648 persons are on home quarantine, while 84 persons with mild symptoms are isolated in hospitals.

The condition of all persons currently in isolation in hospitals, including the five COVID19-positive cases were stable, an official release said.

Non-disclosure

Non-disclosure of travel details by persons who have come into the State from nations where COVID-19 is currently in transmission, would be considered a criminal offence, inviting stringent action, including prosecution, the State police has said.

79,2020/03/08,All set for Attukal Pongala tomorrow,"Organisers allay concerns over COVID-19, say government has adopted precautionary steps

All arrangements are in place for the Attukal Pongala, touted to be the largest congregation of women in the State, on Monday.

Numerous devotees have begun to flock to the State capital from various parts of the State and elsewhere for the festival that marks an offering to the presiding deity of the Attukal Bhagavathy temple.

Attukal Bhagavathy Temple Trust chairman Sasidharan Nair K., president Chandrasekhara Pillai V., and others, who briefed mediapersons here on Saturday, said the ritual would commence by 9.45 a.m. following the completion of the ‘Shuddha Punyaha’ ritual. Chief priest Thekkedathu Kuzhikkattu Parameswaran Vasudevan Bhattathiripad would light the main hearth and hand a lit lamp over to priest P. Easwaran Namboothiri. Subsequently, lakhs of pongala hearths would be lit to prepare the offering. The sanctification ceremony would be conducted at 2.10 p.m.

The kuthiyottam ritual that would be held after the pongala would have 830 boys participating this year, the officials said. Later, the deity would be taken in a ceremonial procession from the temple to the Manacaud Sastha Kovil with the accompaniment of percussion ensembles and decorated floats. The thidambu of the presiding deity would be carried on the elephant Pampady Rajan. After the pooja at the Sastha temple, the procession would return to the Attukal Bhagavathy temple the next day by noon. The 10-day-long festival would come to a close with the Kuruthi Tharpanam at 12.30 a.m. on March 11.

According to the organisers, efforts were being made to enforce green protocol with the support of the city Corporation and various government agencies. Also, portable toilets had been installed at various points. The trust had also adopted steps to insure all devotees for a cover of ₹28 crore throughout the 10-day festival. The organisers also allayed concerns over COVID-19 and said the government had adopted precautionary steps. There was also no proposal to conduct separate health screenings for foreign tourists.

Trust secretary Sisupalan Nair K. also said the organisers had not been issued any advisory by the Health Department regarding the situation.

They were entrusted with the sole responsibility of maintaining sanitation throughout the Pongala ritual.

Security

Around 3,000 police personnel have been designated for the security in the city for the Attukal Pongala.

The force will be boosted by a contingent of the Tamil Nadu police which will be deployed for maintenance of law and order. The premises of the temple and the peripheral areas have been divided into four zones, each led by Assistant Commissioners, for streamlining security arrangements The inner zone that included the temple premises will be monitored by Women’s Battalion commandant Shilpa Dyavaiah. Special Armed Police commandant K.S. Vimal will supervise the security arrangement at the outer zone. Special Cell (Police Headquarters) Superintendent of Police V. Ajith and Deputy Commissioner of Police (Administration) P.A. Muhammed Arif will be in charge of the traffic regulations and fire-related and other exigencies respectively.

81,2020/03/08,"Williams, Krishna put ATK in final","Down by a goal in the first-leg, the side roars past BFC

David Williams starred for ATK, as he found the target twice in the second half, to help the host down defending champion Bengaluru FC 3-1 and book a berth in the Indian Super League (ISL) final for the third time.

The second leg of the semifinal at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday had all the ingredients of a thriller as ATK made a spectacular comeback from a goal down before pulling through 3-2 on aggregate.

With a crowd of more than 50,000 rooting for the home side, its attacking duo of Williams and Roy Krishna, who scored the team's opening goal, delivered for the hosts. Bengaluru’s Ashique Kuruniyan scored the only goal for Bengaluru.

Ashique strikes

Bengaluru produced the early threat with a counterattack in the fifth minute. Ashique, one of the two changes the visitors made in the absence of the suspended Nishu Kumar and injured Albert Serran, scored a goal, latching on to a diagonal pass from Nili Perdomo. The host disputed the goal as Nili, the other replacement in the Bengaluru line-up, seemed to have handled the ball while intercepting a pass from Williams before releasing Ashique.

Stunned by the reverse, ATK took time to regroup and had its first opportunity in the 23rd minute when Williams had a look at goal. Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, however, produced a fantastic save to deny the Australian. However, the India goalkeeper could not protect his clean sheet for long as the host got its act together at the half-hour mark.

ATK’s equaliser was the result of a superb exchange of passes that saw Prabir Das running clear on the right to essay an inch-perfect cross to Krishna, who sent the ball to the roof of the net with a left-footed half-volley.

Given the big task of scoring two more goals to ensure the required margin in the final 45 minutes, ATK kept pressing hard after the break. Suresh Singh Wangjam, the Bengaluru FC right-back, committed the costly error inside his own box by tripping Williams, who made no mistake with the penalty.

Another brilliant assist from Das, who provided a perfect cross to the centre in the 79th minute, had Williams nodding home the third.

ATK will meet former champion Chennaiyin FC in the title clash in Goa on March 14 (Saturday).

83,2020/03/08,ISL | Commitment pays off for Bengaluru FC’s Wangjam,"He is coach Cuadrat’s trusted soldier to nullify potent threats

In football, nothing is quite as liberating as watching a lung-busting run by a young, exciting talent.

Udanta Singh’s irrepressible blend of pace and power is something that routinely draws collective gasps from the Bengaluru FC (BFC) faithful. While the 23-year-old has been off colour this season, it has been the turn of a certain 19-year-old to display a similar youthful energy — Suresh Singh Wangjam.

Be it on the flanks going past defenders or outrunning the opposition to stop a fast break, Suresh has been everywhere. So much so that the teenager from Manipur, who played for India in the landmark FIFA U-17 World Cup at home in 2017, has started five of BFC’s last six ISL matches including the victorious semifinal first leg versus ATK.

However, last June, almost no one, except his father, seemed thrilled by the prospect of Suresh joining the reigning ISL champion from Indian Arrows. “It is easy now to say my father was right, but it was a very difficult decision,” says Suresh. “It was going to be my first professional club and the coaches and senior players I spoke to said BFC was a big club and tough to break into.

Not a bet

“But my father said, ‘why do you want to continue at a place where there is no challenge [Indian Arrows]? At BFC you will learn from Sunil [Chhetri], Gurpreet [Sandhu], [Harmanjot] Khabra and others. Even if you don’t make it in the first year, it’s not like a bet that you have to win’.”

Suresh admitted to feeling out of place initially. “I knew no one. At Indian Arrows we were together for five to six years like brothers. Here, I had no friends. But the hunger was there. I used to see those firecrackers go up [during players’ entry in ISL] and tell myself ‘I should be there’.”

No second thoughts

In search of minutes, he didn’t think twice before turning out for the club’s B side in the local BDFA Super Division. In early January, he was coming on as a substitute against FC Goa one evening and scoring the opener in the Super Division final the next morning.

The commitment has paid off. Of late, he is also coach Carles Cuadrat’s trusted soldier to man-mark the opposition’s most potent threats, a case in point being the way he nullified ATK’s Michael Soosairaj last Sunday.

“The responsibility makes me happy and more confident. Last match I was on the wings, so I prepared by watching videos of how Udanta used to defend.”

This keen interest to learn and adapt has impressed senior midfielder Erik Paartalu. “It’s outstanding that he is showing such versatility at such a young age,” says the Australian.

“The kid has a big future. But what I love about him is he has got a level head.

“He is the only one that has asked the senior boys for advice and guidance and that’s why he will go to the next level.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/n6sv4k/article31010831.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08WANG,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/isl-commitment-pays-off-for-bengaluru-fcs-wangjam/article31010832.ece
84,2020/03/08,Short supply of power hits rice mills in Mannachanallur,"The current problem is said to have started after a transformer burst in the area

The operation of rice mills has been severely hit due to short supply of power in Mannachanallur and adjoining areas.

January to March is the peak season for the rice mills Mannachanallur, which is known for processing single boiled rice in the State. There are 40 rice mills in and around Mannachanallur.

Besides drying the fresh paddy that arrives directly from the paddy fields in Tiruchi and neighbouring districts through driers, the mills work round-the-clock to steam the paddy and remove the husk and the bran layers.

It is the time for the rice mills to run the machineries to their maximum capacity. But, most of the rice mills have downsized their operation because of shortage of power being supplied to them.

The current problem is said to be the fallout of a transformer that burst.

The transformer was primarily meant for transferring electrical energy to Mannachanallur, at Samayapuram in the last week of February.

Since then, the rice mills in Mannachanallur, it is alleged that, have been facing acute shortage of power.

More than two weeks have passed since the failure of the transformer.

But, the problem is yet to be solved.

Though the officials restored the power supply by transmitting power from Omanthur Sub Station, the rice mill owners are of the view that the supply is insufficient to operate machineries. “We require 420 volte of power to run the machinery. But, we get just around 340 volte. If we run the machines with low voltage, fault will occur in the motor. Hence, we have downsized the operation to a great extent,” says M. Sivanandan, president, Mannachanallur Taluk Rice Mill Owners and Paddy Rice Dealers Association.

According to a rough estimate, the mills in Mannachanallur dry about 1,200 tonnes of paddy a day through driers.

The operation is primarily to bring down the moisture content on paddy to 12%.

On an average, the mills produce about 600 tonnes of single boiled rice a day.

But, the production has come down to one fourth due to power supply issue.

Mr. Sivanandan said that it had made a cascading impact right from procurement to supply of rice to traders.

Nearly 50% of rice mill workers had become jobless.

Several rice mill owners could not pay to the farmers as the paddy sent by them was still piled up without being processed. Hence, the Tangedco should expedite the process of replacing the faulty transformer, he added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/3ww8jo/article31016918.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY09PADDYTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/short-supply-of-power-hits-rice-mills-in-mannachanallur/article31016919.ece

87,2020/03/08,Jameela reaches elephant rehabilitation centre,"On the way to the rehabilitation centre abutting the Tiruchi - Chennai National Highway, a brief pooja was performed to the animal at Samayapuram.

Sixty-year-old Jameela is the latest addition at the Elephant Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre at M.R.Palayam near Tiruchi. The female captive elephant was transported from Tirunelveli district on Sunday to the sprawling rehabilitation centre which is already a home to five captive pachyderms.

The elephant was owned by a private person in Tirunelveli district and was sent to the rehabilitation centre on the direction of the forest authorities. The animal is stated to suffer from a chronic wound in both its hind-legs necessitating its shifting to the rehabilitation centre for proper treatment.

On the way to the rehabilitation centre abutting the Tiruchi - Chennai National Highway, a brief pooja was performed to the animal at Samayapuram. The elephant has been accommodated in a separate shelter inside the 20-hectare rehabilitation centre which has nine such sheds, a senior Forest Department official said.

A couple of mahouts from Tirunelveli accompanied the elephant to the centre. The wound on the elephant appears to have been there for several years, an official said adding that the veterinarian in Tirunelveli had taken the swab from the animal’s wound and would dispatch the report.

“The animal is very calm and was taken for a walk inside the rehabilitation centre and also to the water trough inside, the official said adding that the health condition of the animal would be monitored periodically by a veterinary doctor at the centre. The elephant was translocated to the rehabilitation centre on the direction of the Chief Wildlife Warden, Chennai.

The first captive elephant to be accommodated at the rehabilitation was Malachi from Madurai district. Three more elephants – Sandhya, Indhu, and Jayanthi, owned by the Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt and which were in the custody of two private institutions were translocated to the rehabilitation centre on a direction from the Madras High court in September last year.

The fifth captive elephant ‘Gomathi’ was shifted from Tiruvidaimarudhur in Thanjavur district.

88,2020/03/08,Arrival of pacu sends ripples of fear among consumers of fish,"Experts allay apprehension, say this variety is edible though it looks like piranha

Arrival of hitherto unknown pacu variety fish in Puthur Market has caused consternation among a section of customers.

Residents in Thillai Nagar and surrounding areas are uncertain about edibility of the red-bellied fish citing its similarity in appearance to piranha, a carnivorous variety. Experts, on the other hand, said the pacu variety fish has been approved for consumption by the government.

N. Jamaluddin, former member, State Consumer Protection Council was apprehensive that the customers were inclined to purchasing the fish that appeared similar to pomfret and due to cheaper cost. “The buyers are unaware that the fish netted in large quantities in West Bengal is cultured in huge scale in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana”, Mr. Jamalludin said. Senior officials of Fisheries Department have been sounded of the sale of this variety in Tiruchi, he said.

S. Bharathi of Thillai Nagar said that she had come across videos alerting consumers about the harmful nature of the fish. “The videos depicted the similarity of the teeth of the pacu fish with that of piranha, and also warned that consumption of the fish will lead to cancer. I have been concerned about it and have also insisted that my family members do not purchase it,” she said.

Fishermen at the market said that the fish was popular as it tasted similar to pomfret. “Pomfret costs at least ₹ 600-700 per kilogram, which is expensive for a middle-class family. Most people prefer pacu as it is good both for frying and for making curries,” said a vendor at the Puthur market. A load of pacu comes from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana for the weekends, he added.

Allaying the apprehensions, S. Felix, Vice-Chancellor, Tamil Nadu Fisheries University said that the pacu fish was good to consume. “In many parts of the north, and even in Andhra Pradesh, pacu is being reared with carp seeds, popular food for fish. They are not carnivorous fish,” he said.

Dr. Felix said that a research conducted by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-National Bureau of Fish Genetic Resources (ICAR-NBFGR) certified its edibility. “The feasibility for creating special hatcheries for rearing this kind of fish is being explored,” he said.

“For that matter, Tilapia, better known in Tamil Nadu as 'jalebi meen,' is also a foreign species. There are still reared and consumed in large quantities. The fear about pacu fish is only because of similarity in appearance to piranha, which is indeed dangerous,” he explained.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/211phm/article31016347.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY09FISHTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/arrival-of-pacu-sends-ripples-of-fear-among-consumers-of-fish/article31016348.ece

92,2020/03/08,"Corporation’s biogas plant, a hit","Bio-methanation plant at Woraiyur market supplies biogas to community kitchen

The bio-methanation plant at Woraiyur market which supplies biogas to the adjoining community kitchen has many takers, especially from the nearby Karikalan Street. The kitchen, the second one in the city, enables residents to utilise the biogas powered stoves for free.

The Corporation had, on a trial basis, begun using biogas, drawn from food waste at the community kitchen in Viragupettai in Ariyamangalam. Following its success, the model was implemented in Woraiyur, officials of the civic body said. Set up at a cost of ₹25 lakh, the biogas plant and the community kitchen are being maintained by women who live nearby.

R. Saranya, the caretaker of the biogas unit, said that on an average, at least 800 kg of vegetable and fruit waste are discarded each day. “Before the biogas plant was established, most of the waste was dumped in the open, behind the market. The entire area had an unbearable rotting, foul smell. Dogs would feed on the waste and attack residents. Now, after the biogas plant has been set up, the entire location presents a clean look,” she said.

Ms. Saranya meticulously notes down the weight of the waste put into the biogas unit each day. She also notes down the number of people who come to utilise the kitchen every day. A day's waste keeps the stoves lit for over 20 people to cook, she said. “The gas has not run out since we began the unit,” she said.

Residents living nearby also hand over their vegetable waste at the unit, Ms. Saranya said. “When they come to cook here, they also bring kitchen waste from the fruits and vegetables they had cut, and papers from their house,” she said. Food for at least 20 houses from her locality is made at the kitchen, says N. Muthumani, another resident. “The civic body must construct many more such units to help out the public, and the only price we have to pay for it is using our biodegradable, kitchen waste,” she said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/xgv6m6/article31013585.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08TYCITY-BIOGASPLANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/corporations-biogas-plant-a-hit-in-woraiyur/article31013586.ece
93,2020/03/08,Electrification work till Karaikal to be over soon,"Work on laying new line to Peralam to start once funds are allocated

Overhead electrification work up to Karaikal from Tiruvarur is expected to be completed by this month-end, Southern Railway General Manager John Thomas said on Friday.

Mr. Thomas told reporters at Karaikal that electrification works up to Karaikal Port would be completed by April. “Thereafter we plan to operate all trains from Karaikal Port and Karaikal on electric traction,” he said. Central Organisation for Railway Electrification has undertaken this work.

When asked about Karaikal-Peralam new line, Mr. Thomas said the project had been sanctioned. “As of now there is a shortage of funds. As and when funds are released, the work will begin,” he said.

Mr. Thomas said he would inspect the Karaikal Port which gave the Southern Railway maximum revenue and maximum loading of coal for Mettur dam thermal power plant and also for other areas in and around Karaikal. The General Manager said he had come to see the needs of the Karaikal Port to improve the handling of traffic by rail to the maximum.

Later in the day Mr. John Thomas planned a ‘window trailing’ inspection on board a special train from Karaikal to Tiruchi.

Doubling work

Later, speaking to reporters in Thanjavur, Mr.Thomas said doubling work on the Main Line between Villupuram and Thanjavur could be taken up only after obtaining sanction from the Railway Board. However, the ongoing electrification of the Main Line section between Mayiladuthurai and Thanjavur was nearing completion and would be completed by June 2020 .

Stating that the request for Super Fast service and introduction of new trains on the Main Line section have come from the Member of Parliament, Thanjavur, S.S.Palanimanickam and the rail users associations in Thanjavur district, Mr.John Thomas said the process of posting gatekeepers at the level crossings in Tiruvarur-Karaikudi section would get completed by June. Thereafter, the running time of the lone passenger service being operated in the section would get reduced.

Earlier, the Southern Railway General Manager declared open a retiring room complex, constructed at a cost of around ₹2 crore on the Thanjavur Railway Junction premises, for the benefit of the train crew.

He also inspected the Railway Health Unit functioning at an old building on the Junction premises.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/9b1vms/article31013564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07TYDELTA-KARAIKAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/electrification-work-till-karaikal-to-be-over-soon/article31013565.ece

98,2020/03/08,Data | The Yes Bank crisis explained in six charts,"The bank was on a loan spree even amidst mounting bad loans

The government had recently put private sector lender Yes Bank under moratorium till April 3 and capped deposit withdrawal at ₹50,000 after severe deterioration of the bank’s financial position.

However, Yes Bank’s books show that warning bells had been ringing for more than a year. The bank went on a loan spree even as bad loans mounted. Meanwhile, depositers withdrew large amounts, resulting in the bank’s profitability nosediving in the last two fiscals.

Loan spree

In the last five years, Yes Bank went on a loaning spree. Its total advances rose by 334% between FY14 and FY19, the highest rise among comparable banks in the period.

Bad loans multiply

Many borrowers started defaulting. The bank’s Gross NPA% (loans overdue for >90 days) zoomed to 7.39% as of Sept. ‘19, the highest among comparable banks.

Low provisions

While bad loans piled up, Yes Bank did not make enough provisions in its profits. Its Provision Coverage Ratio in FY19 was 43.1%, the lowest among comparable banks. RBI says a PCR of >70% is desirable.

A credit-deposit ratio of 106% means a bank loaned ₹106 for every ₹100 it received.

Poor profitability

The loan spree & high NPA meant poor profitability, gauged by Yes Bank’s sinking Return on Assets (RoA) (RoA = net income/ total assets). Graph shows year-on-year change in RoA.

For instance, Yes Bank's RoA in FY19 was 0.52, in FY18 it was 1.78. Thus the y-o-y change of -1.26 in FY19 is plotted in the graph.

99,2020/03/08,Govt. rolls up sleeves to boost public transport,"Visakhapatnam will need a robust infrastructure to accommodate the spurt in population once it becomes the Executive capital

The State government is now shifting its focus to putting a robust public transport in place for Visakhapatnam, which will see a rapid spurt in population once it becomes the Executive capital of the state.

The Vizag Metro is a project that is on top of the government’s agenda for the port city. The government is also keen on improving the local bus transport within the city. Apart from this, the government plans to boost inter-city connectivity with other districts in the State.

Post bifurcation, a Detailed Project Report (DPR) was prepared for the Vizag Metro project. The TDP government, however, had different priorities and had put the project on the backburner. After coming to power, the YSRCP government issued pre-qualification tenders for the Vizag Metro; the bid was cancelled as only a single tender was received.

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is said to be keen about the Vizag Metro project and is also interested in the possibility of setting up tram corridors in the city. The present proposal for the Metro project envisages increasing the total length of the previously planned Metro corridors, but at the same time going for a ‘Light Metro’ in order to reduce the overall project cost.

Trams are also being planned on the Visakhapatnam–Bheemunipatnam Beach Road stretch to attract tourists, apart from a couple of other routes, where the traffic density is comparatively low. A tram stretch beyond Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, where the proposed Metro rail ends, towards Parawada and Atchutapuram, is also being considered.

The Vizag Metro was proposed in three corridors – Kommadi to Gajuwaka, Gurudwara to Old Head Post Office junction and Thatichetlapalem to China Waltair. The total length of the three corridors put together was only 42.5 km.

The scope of the metro project has changed with the present government deciding to extend the overall length by another 37 km in addition to laying tram corridors along a stretch of 60.22 km in Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (VMRDA) limits in the city. The plan was to extend the original metro corridor from Gajuwaka to Visakhapatnam Steel Plant on one side and from Kommadi to Bhogapuram on the other side of the same stretch.

While the cost of the traditional Vizag Metro was estimated at ₹13,000 crore in 2015-16, it was pegged at ₹9,900 crore for the ‘Light Metro’ in 2016-17.

Now, the State government has authorised the Amaravati Metro Rail Corporation Limited (AMRCL) to invite quotations from DMRC, RITES and UMTC for the revised metro project and wants the revised DPR to be prepared in three months. The ground work for the Vizag Metro project has already been done by the DMRC.

""As the government seems to be serious about the project, the survey for the extended stretch can be done within the stipulated time. The proposal for setting up of a regional office of AMRCL in Vizag has been there for quite some time and now it has been cleared by the government,"" an official said.

City buses

Though the APSRTC is plying around 600 city buses in Visakhapatnam, the number of buses is unable to cater to the demand in the city.

The shortage of city buses is being partially met by over 30,000 auto-rickshaws, most of which operate as a ‘ticket service’. There has been a demand for introduction of local trains as railway lines going towards Parawada, Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, towards Anakapalle, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam, are already in existence and they could be effectively utilised.

Vice-Chairman and MD of APSRTC Madireddy Pratap announced recently that luxury buses christened ‘Dolphin Cruise’ would soon be introduced connecting Visakhapatnam to all other districts in the State.

The existing city buses in Visakhapatnam are being refurbished at an estimated cost of ₹17,000 each.

100,2020/03/08,Which health insurance policy should I take? Answers to your personal finance queries,"Readers can send in queries on personal ﬁnance and investing to moneywise@thehindu.co.in

Q. I am 20-years old and want to take health insurance for myself. How should I choose my insurer?

ANTRYAMI SINGH

A. Consider two aspects before zeroing in on the right policy to buy: the coverage you require and the service and response level of the insurer. You may want a high sum insured (SI), with special coverages like daily cash benefit and other value-added covers. Or you may want a no-frills policy with a sufficient SI. Based on what is on offer by various insurers you can shortlist them and make your final shortlist of policies.

For choosing the insurer, a company with whom you have experienced good service would be a good choice.

Equally important is the intermediary – the agent or broker who gives last mile service. Remember that service can be extraordinarily good when buying a policy. The test will be how they handle a claim.

A company with a high claims settlement ratio is better. You can even see how fast they settle claims through various statistics on the website of Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI, www.irdai.gov.in). Track financial strength of companies which indicates their ability to pay claims. The solvency ratio should be at least 1.5. If not, though the regulations will protect policyholders, you may not want to shortlist them.

Q. I have an insurance policy for ₹2 lakh under the Andhra Pradesh Government’s health policy and a Red Carpet Policy of Star Insurance for ₹2 lakh. If my ₹2 lakh is exhausted in one policy, can I claim the balance from the other policy?

SRIPADA RAMARAO

A. Both policies are indemnity-based, which means that they will reimburse expenses against bills as per the terms of the policy. So, you can claim only to the extent of your expenses under one or the other policy, or proportionately if claiming from both.

Given that you have a built-in redundancy what you can do is as follows.

At renewal time with the insurance company, shift from a basic hospitalisation policy to a top-up or super top-up policy with the same insurer. That will give you an additional coverage and also keep your benefits like coverage of pre-existing conditions intact.

You should discuss with them and ensure your no-claim benefits are carried over into the new policy.

Q. I am working for the Punjab government and covered by the government’s insurance policy which, I think, is not as comprehensive as most of the private players are offering. My question is: If I purchase an insurance policy for me, my wife and my daughter, what effect will that have on my coverage by my employer. Which one will prevail?

ASHISH KATHURIA

A. With an employer policy in place, if you purchase a basic hospitalisation policy from any insurer, one of the two policies will be redundant depending on their SIs. You can instead expand your coverage by purchasing a top-up or super top-up policy from an insurance company that will supplement your coverage with your employer. This policy should have a ‘threshold’ equal to the SI under your employer’s policy for the best efficiency.

If your employer’s policy does not cover your wife and daughter, please buy a basic hospitalisation policy for them with SI equal to the policy that covers you (from your employer) and you have the option still to take a top-up/ super top-up policy for the three of you. Remember the threshold limit of the top-up/ super top-up policy should be equal to the basic cover amount for best efficiency.

101,2020/03/08,Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor arrested by Enforcement Directorate,"Rana Kapoor was questioned by the ED sleuths for over 20 hours after the central agency raided his residence on Friday night.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor under money laundering charges in the wee hours of Sunday, officials said.

The banker was held under the provision of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) around 3 a.m. as he was allegedly not cooperating in the probe, they said.

Mr. Kapoor’s arrest at the ED office in Ballard Estate followed over 20 hours of questioning by the central agency after it raided his residence on Friday night.

The arrest comes after charges of alleged financial irregularities and mismanagement in the operations of the private bank surfaced and the RBI and Union government initiated action to control its affairs.

Officials said Mr. Kapoor, 62, will be produced before a local court during the day to obtain custody.

The investigating officer of the case had recorded Mr. Kapoor’s statement under the PMLA when he was first interrogated on Friday night at his upscale residence in ‘Samudra Mahal’ complex in Worli area here.

He was brought to the ED office on Saturday noon for a fresh round of questioning.

On Saturday, the agency widened its probe in the case as the premises of Mr. Kapoor’s three daughters in Delhi and Mumbai were searched to gather more information and evidence.

Explained: Why did Yes Bank have to be bailed out?

According to officials, Mr. Kapoor’s wife Bindu and daughters — Rakhee Kapoor Tandon, Roshni Kapoor and Radha Kapoor — are allegedly linked to some companies to which the suspected “proceeds of crime” have been traced.

The case against Mr. Kapoor is linked to the scam-hit DHFL as the loans lent by the bank to the company allegedly turned NPAs, they said.

A ₹600-crore worth loan extended by the DHFL to an entity is also at the centre of the ED probe, officials said.

The central agency is also probing Mr. Kapoor’s role in connection with the disbursal of loans to some corporate entities and the subsequent alleged kickbacks reportedly received in his wife’s accounts.

Other alleged irregularities are also under the agency’s scanner including the one related to the alleged PF fraud in the Uttar Pradesh power corporation, they added.

The CBI has recently taken over investigation into the ₹2,267-crore Employees’ Provident Fund fraud in Uttar Pradesh, where hard-earned savings of power sector employees were invested in Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL).

The ED action came after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday imposed a moratorium on the capital-starved Yes Bank, capping withdrawals at ₹50,000 per account, and superseded the board of the private sector lender with immediate effect.

Yes Bank will not be able to grant or renew any loan or advance, make any investment, incur any liability or agree to disburse any payment.

102,2020/03/08,IndusInd defers AT1 bond plan,"RBI scheme for Yes Bank said such bonds will be written down

IndusInd Bank has deferred it’s plan to raise additional tier-1 (AT1) and tier -II bonds in view of the current market conditions.

The bank’s board was scheduled to meet on Monday to approve the fund- raising plan. The board meeting has now been deferred.

“The meeting of the board of directors of the bank was proposed to be held on Monday, March 9, 2020 to consider and approve, inter alia, the borrowing and raising of funds in Indian and/or foreign currency by issuance of debt securities in the nature of Additional Tier I Capilal (AT 1) and/or tier 2 capital (T2 bonds) of the bank.

Market conditions

In view of the current market conditions and since the bank is adequately capitalised at present, it has been decided not to consider raising the Basel III-compliant debt capital instruments for the time being,” the bank said.

The move comes after the Reserve Bank of India’s draft reconstruction scheme for Yes Bank was released on Friday. According to the scheme, instruments qualifying as Additional Tier 1 capital, issued by the Yes Bank Ltd. under Basel III framework, will be written down permanently and in full

“This is in conformity with the extant regulations issued by Reserve Bank of India based on the Basel framework,” the central bank had said.

103,2020/03/08,We welcome private sector competition: NewSpace India CMD G. Narayanan,"Finding PSLV, SSLV makers is a top priority, says CMD of NewSpace India

NewSpace India Ltd., the Department of Space’s second commercial arm, was formed to market products and services of the Indian Space Research Organisation. NSIL’s new Chairman and Managing Director, G. Narayanan, was earlier a Deputy Director at ISRO’s Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre at Thiruvananthapuram. In the interview, Mr. Narayanan speaks about the role of the fledgling company in the Indian scene and in a competitive world space market. Edited excerpts:

NewSpace India Ltd is just about a year old and already it has you as its second chairman and managing director. How was the past year in terms of business goals met and financial performance, etc.? What were the priorities?

I have been in this place for just under a month. I came in after my predecessor here [Ms. D.R. Suma] superannuated in January. So it was a normal transition. For a young company the year has not been bad. I cannot give the financial figures yet.

NSIL’s mandate is to work with Indian industry and create a high technology manufacturing base, especially for space activities. It must realise ISRO’s two satellite launch vehicles, the PSLV and the new SSLV [Small Satellite Launch Vehicle, due for its first launch in a couple of months], through our industry. Some progress has been made in this initiative. Last year, we invited expressions of interest [EoI] for the PSLV. Evaluation of the EoIs is in the final stage and we are preparing to issue an RFP [request for proposal].

NSIL had its customers on two recent PSLV launches. We have some inquiries. You may hear from us shortly about some of the forthcoming contracts. Getting small spacecraft and satellite communication services are other thrust areas. In the area of technology transfer we are identifying potential takers.

What are the plans for the second year?

Basically we should be building on the work done in the first year. Finding an industry partner to produce the PSLV is a major activity we look forward to in the second year. For the SSLV too, we hope to initiate production during the year, but after it makes the first couple of flights.

Starting as a very lean company, we are in the process of fresh recruitments to fill posts across areas. In a couple of months we may double our strength to 15-20 people and may expand further later.

How do you propose to push the commercial production of the PSLV and the SSLV forward?

The technology of making a PSLV is complex. Industry should have wet its hands on it while we do some hand-holding. Industry support is the major thing in this and we currently have about 100 industries supplying for the PSLV programme.

The EoI is only the first step. There were 6-7 interested applicants. After the RFP, a smaller number will be shortlisted. We need just one production player — who could be a consortium of multiple partners.

The SSLV is said to be much simpler to produce than the PSLV. Eventually the SSLV will also follow the same route to production. It could be entrusted to the same or another bidder.

There is a lot of duplication in the business areas of the two commercial arms of the Department of Space — NSIL and its older sibling, Antrix Corporation. How do you both share the same work, are there discussions, where does one company get off and the other one get in? It all looks very puzzling.

I only know about NSIL’s mandate. Coming as I do from a technology background, I do not know much about the working of Antrix. I really cannot say anything about it.

Before NSIL was born, lease of transponders on communication satellites earned the bulk of revenue for the Department of Space through Antrix. How would you rank your different business areas by their revenue potential – lease of satellite capacity, marketing of launch services, etc?

It has not been so in the first year but both the areas that you mention can be our bread and butter! There is demand for launchers from both domestic and foreign operators.

In the case leasing transponders to users, the demand is from the domestic market. Our primary focus is also to meet national requirements through national capacity.

We have the launch vehicle capacity for whatever satellite transponder capacity is required. In addition, we need to have launch vehicles to meet the demands of the international market also.

Getting small spacecraft built is also a thrust area. A few industries are already operating in this area at ISITE [ISRO Satellite Integration and Testing Establishment, Bengaluru] on a turnkey basis.

How many new launch service contracts for the PSLV have been signed or are in the offing?

NSIL had its customers* on two recent PSLV launches. We have some inquiries, and those may be orders in the offing.

You may hear from us shortly about some of the forthcoming contracts.

[* Last year NSIL executed its first batch of launch service contracts. As a result, eight international customers separately hired two PSLV rockets and sent 22 satellites to space – in November and December 2019.]

Will you also market the GSLV rocket?

Marketing of the GSLV is not on our radar right now. As I understand, there are domestic requirements for GSLV and [the more powerful] GSLV-MkIII.

Back in the 1990s, communication satellite INSAT-2E was entirely leased to Intelsat. Can there be such possibilities in these times?

Right now there are no talks on those lines. But we are open and such a prospect cannot be ruled out. It all depends on when such a requirement comes up and also the availability of a satellite.

In recent years, many Indian private sector companies and startups have come up in your business space and they, too, are offering to innovatively make small satellites and launch vehicles, etc at low costs. How does a space PSU hold its own in this global competition and co-exist with the rest?

It would actually be a good development if a private sector player came up and became a competitor to NSIL! I would say that would be NSIL’s biggest achievement. We need not be worried about it.

As I said before, one of the mandates of NSIL is to enable Indian industries to get into high technology manufacturing, and to eventually set up a wide space industry base in the country.

Our primary goal is to facilitate indigenous production whether through a start-up, a private sector company or another PSU. We need not always be competitive but can also play complimentary roles. We will work with industry as a reliable partner.

In that case, would NSIL also push for a quick formulation of a space policy that is long awaited? Many private space players believe that the absence of a clear policy hinders their business plans.

Having a space policy is definitely a positive. But I don't think that not having one has stopped or hindered any activity from happening. ISRO has been very proactive in facilitating industry to the extent possible. Small private-built satellites like Kalamsat have been launched.

If you mean procedures, even NSIL which is a PSU must follow them if it wants to do something.

What is the big picture for NSIL in the coming years?

We are a nascent company and for me to say anything about the long term with my exposure of less than a month will be too much at this stage. Probably in the next 4-5 years, we will be in a position to speak about it.

But yes, we do want to be one of the major space players in the world and an end-to-end service provider in all space activities.

Right now, we market ISRO's spare capacities in rockets, satellites and services. In the mid to long term, we expect to start creating capacity, too, along with the industry.

What is the team needed to pursue these activities? And the rest of the board of directors and NSIL's future premises?

We started as a very lean company. Now we are in the process of fresh recruitments to fill posts across areas. In a couple of months we may double our strength and we may be 15-20 people and could even expand further depending on the needs.

We are not closed to the idea of shifting out [of the ISRO HQ] as we grow.

The interim board [including an executive director and three nominated part-time members] is full. The full-fledged [nine-member] board will take some more time to be completed, and as per PSU guidelines.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sw7gx4/article31017114.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08GNARAYANAN-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/we-welcome-private-sector-competition-newspace-india-cmd-g-narayanan/article31017115.ece
104,2020/03/08,Yes Bank crisis | Rana Kapoor: The rise and quick downfall of a maverick banker,"The journey of an aggressive entrepreneur comes to a stop

Rana Kapoor, a former Bank of America executive, set up Rabo India Finance, a non-banking finance company, with the help of Rabo Bank in 1997-98, along with his partners Harkirat Singh and Ashok Kapur. Rana Kapoor was Ashok Kapur’s brother-in-law.

That marked the start of an aggressive entrepreneur in the financial services space, who would continue his journey in the next two decades until it was cut short by the Reserve Bank of India in 2018.

Watch | Yes Bank crisis explained

After setting up Rabo Finance, the trio decided to open a bank since the government was planning to offer new banking licences. They succeeded, but a year before Yes Bank started operation, Mr. Harkirat Singh fell out with Ashok Kapur and Rana Kapoor and quit the venture. So, Yes Bank started operation in 2004, with Ashok Kapur as chairman and Rana Kapoor as MD & CEO. The bank had an initial public offering in the same year.

Also Read Data | The Yes Bank crisis explained in six charts

During the first phase of growth, the bank, under Mr. Kapoor, focused on the retail liabilities franchise and corporate lending. Just when Yes Bank was preparing for the second phase, Ashok Kapur was killed in the 2008 terror attack in Mumbai.

Yes Bank, however, kept its growth momentum. Around 2012-13, a controversy broke out when Ashok Kapur’s wife alleged they were not given proper representation in the board of the bank.

The Kapurs and Rana Kapoor would reach a truce in 2019.

Meanwhile, Yes Bank was on the path of aggressive growth. Its exponential growth since 2014 did not go unnoticed by the banking regulator. As on March 31, 2014, the bank’s loan book stood at ₹55,633 crore and deposits ₹74,192 crore. The loan book grew to ₹2,24,505 crore at the end of the second quarter (September) of the current financial year, while deposits were at ₹2,09,497 crore. So in the last five years, the loan book grew by over four times, but deposits failed to keep pace. Asset quality worsened during the period, with gross non-performing assets going up from 0.31% as on March 2014 to 7.39%.

Also read: Explained: Why did Yes Bank have to be bailed out?

The RBI was also worried about governance practices. It denied Rana Kapoor three more years after his term ended in August 2018, despite the board’s endorsement. He was finally given extension till January 2019.

After quitting the bank, Rana Kapoor would move quickly to sell his stake and by November 2019, his stake in the bank would come down to 900 shares, held by Yes Capital (India) Private Limited.

Two days after the government put a moratorium on the bank, the Enforcement Directorate arrested him under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) because he was not allegedly cooperating in the probe.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2qpof8/article31017092.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THRANAKAPOOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yes-bank-crisis-rana-kapoor-the-rise-and-quick-downfall-of-a-maverick-banker/article31017093.ece
105,2020/03/08,"Though hunters lose interest in Red Panda, traps still snare endangered mammal","Report on wildlife trade reveals drop in poaching in India and Bhutan; Nepal accounts for 13 seizures between 2016-19

The iconic and endangered Red Panda (ailurus fulgens) has fewer hunters because the younger generations of people across its Himalayan habitat are losing interest in animal products, a new study by wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC has found.

However, the reddish-brown arboreal mammal, not closely related to the iconic black-and-white giant panda, is falling to traps laid for other animals, such as the musk deer and wild pigs, the report said.

“The news is both good and bad for the red panda, whose survival is crucial for the eastern and north-eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests and the eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests,” Saket Badola, the head of TRAFFIC’s India office, told The Hindu on Sunday.

The only living member of the genus Ailurus, the Red Panda is listed as ‘endangered’ on the IUCN Red List of threatened species. The animal has been hunted for meat and fur, besides illegal capture for the pet trade. An estimated 14,500 animals are left in the wild across Nepal, Bhutan, India, China and Myanmar.

10-year period

The report titled “Assessment of illegal trade-related threats to Red Panda in India and selected neighbouring range countries” has looked at a ten-year period from July 2010 to June 2019, and analysed poaching and illegal trade of the species. In addition to looking at seizures, the researchers carried out market surveys, surveys of e-commerce websites and village-level surveys, where they spoke to hundreds of people in the Indian habitat of the Red Panda.

About 5,000-6,000 red pandas are estimated to be present in four Indian states – Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Sikkim and West Bengal. This is the second-largest population after China (6,000-7,000). Nepal accounts for 580 animals, while Bhutan and Mynamar have no estimate of the animal’s population.

Red pandas have been reported from 11 districts of Arunachal Pradesh, which is presumed to hold the largest red panda population in the country.

The researchers found that neither India nor Bhutan had reported any incidences of poaching or illegal trade in Red Pandas in the study period.

“This may indicate that traditional demand for such products has reduced over time and might be indicative of the success of awareness campaigns undertaken in the areas,” the report said, indicating that younger people were not keen on using the pelt or meat of the animal.

The TRAFFIC study surveyed 38 village markets in Arunachal Pradesh, covering six markets in Tawang and a at least one market in each of 19 other districts.

“None of the markets had any parts or products made of parts of the red panda for sale,” the survey said.

“Consultations with experts revealed a similar low-level incidence of Red Panda trade in Bhutan and India with one case of accidental trapping of a Red Panda in a snare in Jigme Dorjee National Park from Bhutan and six incidents of poaching accounting for six individual animals in India, aside from a 1999 case involving more than 20 pelts,” the study said.

In contrast, experts from Nepal reported about 25 incidences of Red Panda poaching, involving approximately 55 animals, and also claimed to have witnessed and/or confirmed reports related to poaching on six occasions involving 15 animals.

Mr Badola emphasised the need for community based conservation and protection for the species as its habitat stretches across remote areas.

The report also recommended trans-boundary law enforcement co-operation through the use of multi-government platforms like SAWEN (South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network).

Dr Badola also added that diminishing habitat is a major threat to the species which is a very selective feeder and survives on selected species of bamboos. “In addition to these threats if there is a threat of poaching that makes things more difficult for the survival of the species,” he added.

107,2020/03/08,CPI(M) decides against fielding Yechury for Rajya Sabha,"Polit Bureau turns down proposal from Bengal unit

The CPI(M) Polit Bureau has shot down its West Bengal unit’s proposal to send party General Secretary Sitaram Yechury to Rajya Sabha.

The decision was taken on March 6 during a Polit Bureau meeting in Delhi, which was attended by only nine of the 17 members.

The West Bengal unit had informally proposed Mr Yechury’s name at the Central Committee meeting in Thiruvananthapuram recently.

Mr Yechury was a Rajya Sabha member from 2005 till 2017. In 2017, the party refused to renominate him from West Bengal, though the Congress had offered the seat to the CPI(M). This is the third instance when the party has stalled his entry to Rajya Sabha.

Also read: Yechury not to seek third Rajya Sabha term

Currently, the Left parties put together have 28 seats in West Bengal Assembly. To send a candidate to Rajya Sabha 46 votes are needed.

If Mr Yechury was to be renominated, then the CPI(M) would have needed Congress support. A majority of Polit Bureau members argued that the party could not lean on the Congress.

With the retirement of T.K. Rangarajan, who was leading the party, in April this year, the party will be down to just four members in the Upper House. It only has one member in Lok Sabha.

We will make it mandatory from January 2021 that all sanitary pad manufacturers will have to compulsorily give degradable bags for disposal of each sanitary napkin,” Mr. Javadekar said at an International Women’s Day event in Pune, where he interacted with waste collectors of SWaCH Pune, a wholly-owned workers’ cooperative.

He said people should address the waste pickers as Swachhta Sevika from this International Women’s Day as they were doing a great service to the nation. “These women have four vital qualities of consistency, compassion, courage and capacity for decision-making. I salute the Swachhta Sevikas gathered here today who are helping in realising the dream of Swachh, Swasth, Hit and Fit India.”

Mr. Javadekar further said cleanliness norms already in force in municipal areas would now be applicable to villages with a population of more than 3,000 across the country. “We must follow the decentralised model wherein the garbage of educational institutes and housing societies are disposed on the premises itself. There is a rule in place for the compulsory picking of garbage and disposal for municipal towns and this rule will be made compulsory for all habitations with more than 3,000 people.”

“I celebrate my Diwali with waste pickers to understand their work and problems… we city dwellers want garbage sheds for us, but not too close from our home. This mindset should change. I have decided to grant funds from the Member of Parliament Local Area Development quota for the construction of 50 big and 50 small garbage sheds, which are designed by SWaCH,” the Union Minister said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/32k6fk/article31016670.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08JAVADEKART,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sanitary-pad-disposal-bags-mandatory-from-january-2021-prakash-javadekar/article31016671.ece
110,2020/03/08,Military Cooperation Group dialogue postponed,"Visit of Defence Secretary Mark Esper is also in question

The India-U.S. Military Cooperation Group (MCG) dialogue, scheduled for later this month, has been cancelled in view of coronavirus outbreak, and the proposed trip of U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper is also in question, defence sources said on Sunday.

India is considering a U.S. request for posting liaison officers at the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) and the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). This was to be discussed at the dialogue.

“The MCG dialogue, to be held in the U.S. this time, has been cancelled due to COVID-19. The formal decision on Mr. Esper’s visit is expected on Monday,” a defence source told The Hindu. Given the current situation, the visit looks doubtful, another official said.

The MCG is a forum to review the progress of defence cooperation between India’s Integrated Defence Staff and the USINDOPACOM at the strategic and operational levels. The Integrated Defence Staff was responsible for coordination among the armed forces before the appointment of the Chief of Defence Staff.

As part of improving defence cooperation and interoperability, India is considering a U.S. request for posting liaison officers at the USINDOPACOM and the USSOCOM.

“We have posted a liaison officer at the U.S. Navy Central Command in Bahrain and a U.S. liaison officer, in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, has joined the Indian Navy’s Information Fusion Centre for Indian Ocean Region at Gurugram,” another defence source said. This is an outcome of the agreement reached at the last 2+2 dialogue in December last, which also “noted their [India and the U.S.] intent to explore further military liaison relationships.”

The liaison officer at the USINDOPACOM is likely to be a Navy officer, while the one at the USSOCOM will probably be an Army officer. “The modalities are still being worked out,” the official said, adding it could fructify by early next year.

The MCG was to have reviewed the decisions taken at the 2+2 dialogue and the recent visit of President Donald Trump to India. Further, it was to follow up on the visit and fast-track the decisions, including that on 24 MH-60R multi-role helicopters, the official said.

The two sides are also moving fast to operationalise the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement. This is one of the four foundational agreements that the U.S. signs with allies and partners to facilitate interoperability between armed forces and sale of high-end technology.

After Sikkim, the Arunachal Pradesh government has decided to ban entry of foreign tourists in order to eliminate any possibility of the COVID-19 outbreak in the State.

The move follows the Bhutan government’s alert about a 76-year-old U.S. citizen who tested positive for COVID-19. The man had spent a week holidaying in Assam before leaving for Bhutan.

Officials in Arunachal Pradesh’s capital Itanagar said the State government has stopped issuing Protected Area Permits (PAPs) to foreigners temporarily.

Arunachal Pradesh is one of the four northeastern States that a foreign tourist can visit only if he or she possesses a PAP. The other three states are Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland. An Indian national is required to have an Inner-Line Permit to visit these States for up to a week.

Nagaland tribe

Meanwhile, the Konyak (Naga tribe) Union in Nagaland has banned the entry of foreign as well as domestic tourists in the State’s Mon district. Nagaland’s Chief Secretary Temjen Toy had last week said that the State would not restrict the inflow of tourists. An official statement by the union said the ban was to prevent people from crowding venues of a Konyak spring festival in the first week of April.

A jawan of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) has composed and sung a Hindi song to mark International Women’s Day on Sunday, officials said.

The 7:24 minute audiovisual song, titled Lado, meri lado, was released by the force on its official social media platforms — Twitter and Facebook.

Head constable Arjun Kheriyal is a singing talent of the force and the song narrates the contribution of women to the family and nation-building, an ITBP spokesperson said.

It has been composed and sung by the 35-year-old jawan, who joined the force in 2002 and is currently posted in Delhi, he said.

The song features the jawan and showcases the commitment of a soldier towards his nation and family and also promotes the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign of the government, the spokesperson said.

The 90,000-strong ITBP, primarily tasked with guarding the Line of Actual Control with China, has produced the song and provided logistical support for it to be shot and edited.

114,2020/03/08,Delhi Police arrests couple linked to ISIS for instigating anti-CAA protests,"‘They were involved in instigating anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests’

The Delhi police on Sunday arrested a couple with alleged links to the Khorasan module of the Islamic State (IS) from Jamia Nagar in southeast Delhi over allegations of inciting anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests.

The police said they were alerted by the officers of the intelligence services to the suspicious activities of the couple from Kashmir planning out terror activity in the national capital.

The couple had been on surveillance for the past several months. The information was shared with the Delhi Police and they were held. The police alleged that the couple were planning to carry out suicide attacks in the country.

“Jahanjeb Sami and his wife Hina Bashir Beg are linked to Khorasan Module of the IS. The couple were apprehended from Jamia Nagar in Ohkla. They were instigating anti-CAA protests in the city,” said Pramod Singh Kushwaha, DCP (Special Cell).

From conserving water to fighting for the rights of the disabled, the seven women who were given access to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s social media accounts have made significant contributions in various fields.

The Prime Minister shared brief videos of the women on his Twitter and Instagram pages and their achievements on his Facebook page. The achievements were shared under #SheInspiresUs.

Sneha Mohandoss

Sneha Mohandoss, inspired by her mother, started an initiative called Foodbank India. She works with volunteers, many of whom are outside India, to eradicate hunger.

“We have over 20 chapters and have impacted several people with our work. We also initiated activities like mass cooking, cooking marathons, breastfeeding awareness drives,” she wrote on Mr. Modi’s Twitter account.

Malvika Iyer

Malvika Iyer survived a gruesome bomb blast at the age of 13 that blew off her hands and severely damaged her legs.

“Giving up is never an option. Forget your limitations and take on the world with confidence and hope,” she wrote on the Prime Minister’s handle.

Ms. Iyer is a motivational speaker, disability activist and a model.

Arifa Jaan

Arifa Jaan from Kashmir had always dreamt of reviving the traditional crafts of Kashmir as, according to her, this was a means to empower local women.

“I saw the condition of women artisans and so I began working to revise “namda” craft ...When tradition meets modernity, wonders can happen. I experienced this in my work. It is designed to suit the modern day market,” she wrote.

Kalavati Devi of Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh collected money to build toilets. She said if you want to achieve something, do not look back and ignore the bitter words of people.

“The place where I used to live, had filth all around. But there was a strong belief that through cleanliness we can change this situation. I decided to convince people. Collected money to build toilets,” she said.

Veena Devi

Veena Devi of Munger in Bihar proved that where there is will, there is a way. She did not allow lack of space to create hurdles in her plan to cultivate mushrooms and grew the crop under her bed.

“Everything can be achieved by will. My real recognition came from cultivating one kilo of mushrooms under the bed.

116,2020/03/08,"Rahul Gandhi most acceptable leader in Congress, should come back as party chief: Ajay Maken","Senior Congress leader Ajay Maken said Mr. Gandhi was “universally acceptable” as he had “good intent at heart” and “no baggage”.

Amid uncertainties over the leadership issue, senior Congress leader and former Union Minister Ajay Maken has said it is high time Rahul Gandhi comes back as party president as he is the most acceptable leader. The former president of the Congress’ Delhi unit, Mr. Maken, in an interview to PTI, also batted for veterans to gradually make way for younger leaders, saying if parties do not change their leadership with time, then people change parties.

Vouching form Mr. Gandhi as Congress chief, he said there is no other face as acceptable as Mr. Gandhi, who also has good intent at heart, zero baggage and consistently takes an aggressive stand in fighting against the might of the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Also read | Rahul Gandhi remains ‘top leader’ in Congress, large section always felt he should return as chief: Khurshid

Mr. Maken also argued for a long-term advisory role for interim President Sonia Gandhi saying her experience and expertise in handling Congress affairs would be much needed by the new president.

The party constitution can be amended to ensure that, he said.

“I think it is high time Rahul Gandhi came back. I am saying this with very strong conviction and strong reasons behind this. Rahul Gandhi is universally acceptable in the Congress party. There is no other face who is as much acceptable as Rahul Gandhi is,” Mr. Maken said.

“So, a person who is universally acceptable, no baggage, good intent at heart and who has been consistent and most aggressive against the BJP and Modi, and has been the voice amplifier of farmers, Dalits and minorities. I think, he single-handedly deserves to be Congress president,” he added.

Asked about what would be the right time for Mr. Gandhi to return, Mr. Maken said, the sooner, the better, because it will end uncertainty.

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also said Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah are deeply wary of the unwavering conviction and fearlessness with which Rahul Gandhi has taken on the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

“Rahul Gandhi has adequately proved his mettle. Time has come to rise above the parochial issues of regional leadership and work towards strengthening and rebuilding the Congress. Needless to add that Rahul Gandhi is the obvious and only choice to lead the Congress,” he said.

Mr. Maken noted that the country needs a person with “good intent at heart, not good content in speech“.

“We have seen the country is paying the price to just follow good content in speech and the present situation where our country is in, the economy is in doldrums, there is a social strife, the riots going on in the national capital and the government not doing anything, is just because the people voted for good content in speech of Narendra Modi. They never saw the intent at heart of the leader,” the Congress leader said.

Old vs young debate

Commenting on the old versus young debate in the Congress, Mr. Maken strongly argued for gradual change of guard in the party and said parties must change their leadership in time.

“I am among the biggest supporters for change, but it has to be gradual. It can’t be in one big sudden change. But it has to be there. That change is required because if the parties don’t change their leadership in time, then the people change the parties,” he said, adding that the electorate wants change.

On whether Congress veterans will be given an advisory role, he said it should be voluntary and not be imposed on them, as has happened in the case of party veterans in the BJP.

On voices backing organisational elections in the Congress, Mr. Maken said elections to the post of party president and working committee members alone would not help, and an overall organisational poll from bottom to up is needed.

Only elections for the president or the working committee will not empower the workers, said Mr. Maken.

He noted that Mr. Gandhi has championed holding elections not only for the working committee, and president, but a series of elections at all levels in a transparent manner.

“That is what Rahul Gandhi has always stood for. He has wanted transparent elections throughout and even ticket distribution should be held through primaries and elections, where workers should decide who should be given the ticket,” Mr. Maken said.

On setbacks

On the Congress suffering two general election setbacks under Mr. Gandhi, he said as far as winning and losing elections is concerned, this is part of the process.

“How many elections under Atal Bihari Vajpayee did the BJP had win. In the 1990s the Vajpayee-Advani duo always used to lose election. The BJP never threw their leaders out of the party, as it was, they who got the BJP into power,” the former Union Minister said.

Mr. Maken also called for spelling out clearly the Congress’ ideology on issues of social, economic and nationalism, to avoid leaders speaking in different voices in public on key issues.

“We should have firmly laid down our ideological stand on key issues, as this would end any kind of confusion and it would also help Congress workers to have their loyalty and allegiance towards a particular philosophy or ideology,” he said.

He said the Congress lost ground in Delhi because it stopped attacking Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal starting January 2019.

BJP’s polarisation agenda also helped the AAP, he said, rejecting the widely held belief that the Congress, under a deliberate electoral strategy, vacated the Delhi turf for the AAP.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/82xnvh/article29815859.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Ajay-Maken,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rahul-gandhi-most-acceptable-leader-in-congress-high-time-he-came-back-as-party-chief-ajay-maken/article31015350.ece
117,2020/03/08,Congress hits out at government over economic policies,"BJP trying to divert attention from bank scam by linking Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rana Kapoor, party says

Hitting back at the BJP for suggesting ‘deep links’ between the Gandhi family and the arrested promoter of Yes Bank, Rana Kapoor, the Congress on Sunday termed the charges an attempt at “diverting attention from the bank scam under the BJP’s watch”.

The BJP’s information and technology wing head, Amit Malviya, tweeted a news clip which claimed that Mr. Kapoor had bought a painting from Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.

“Every financial crime in India has deep link with the Gandhis. Mallya used to send flight upgrade tickets to Sonia Gandhi. Had access to MMS (Manmohan Singh) and PC (P. Chidambaram). Is absconding. Rahul inaugurated Nirav Modi's bridal jewellery collection, he defaulted. Rana bought Priyanka Vadra’s paintings,” Mr. Malviya had tweeted. The Congress termed the charge “fake”, and claimed that Ms. Vadra had sold an M.F. Husain painting, gifted to her father, Rajiv Gandhi, at an auction.

Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said at a press conference that Ms. Vadra received the entire auction amount in a cheque and it had been fully disclosed in her income tax returns for 2010.

Attacking the BJP, Mr. Singhvi noted that the beleguered bank’s loan book rose from ₹55,633 crore in 2014 — the year Mr. Modi took charge as Prime Minister — to ₹2,41,499 crore in March 2019.

Post-demonetisation rise

“Why did the loan book rise by 100% in two years after demonetisation — from ₹98,210 crore in March 2016 to ₹2,03,534 crore in March 2018? Were PM and FM sleeping, ignorant or complicit,” the Congress leader asked.

In a scathing attack, Mr. Singhvi said the recent policies of the government — from rising food inflation to declining EPF rates by the Employee Provident Fund Organisation and a proposed three-fold hike in insurance premiums — had broken the back of the common man.

He said productivity, employment and the rupee had all fallen, while inflation, social division along with the government's arrogance had risen.

The Congress spokesperson also strongly protested against a proposed over 20% hike in third-party insurance premiums for most two-wheelers and three-wheelers besides four-wheelers under the 1500-cc category.

He said a similar hike had also been proposed by regulators for life insurance premiums, and urged the government to stop these decisions that would adversely affect the middle and lower-class the most. “Decisions taken by this government or rather allowed to be taken by this government without interference, restraint and injunction despite having the power to control and stop is directly impacting three Ps of the common man: purchasing power, planning for future and preparation,” Mr. Singhvi said.

BPCL stake sale

In a tweet, Congress communication chief Randeep Surjewala attacked the government over the stake sale of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. “BPCL gave ₹2051.53 crore profit to the government in December. The Modi government has invited bids for sale of its entire 53% stake in BPCL.

118,2020/03/08,"On SC directive, NEERI team collects water samples from Yamuna river in Mathura","After taking the samples, the team left for Agra on Friday to obtain samples from the river there.

Officials of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) collected water samples from Yamuna river here on directions from the Supreme Court regarding overflowing drains in the Taj Trapezium Zone, an activist said.

TTZ is an area of about 10,400 sq km spread over the districts of Agra, Firozabad, Mathura, Hathras and Etah in Uttar Pradesh and Bharatpur district of Rajasthan.

In December last year, an apex court bench had asked noted environmentalist M.C. Mehta and NEERI to inspect the city of Agra and file a report within eight weeks suggesting measures to deal with the problem of overflowing drains.

The NEERI team led by Dr. Praveen Kumar collected the samples from the river on Friday, environmentalist and social worker Gopeshwar Nath Chaturvedi said.

He has been filing petitions in higher courts for cleaning and maintaining ecological flow in Yamuna river for many years.

The samples were taken by NEERI scientists from Bengali Ghat pumping station, Kosi drain, Masani drain, Ambakhar drain and Gokul barrage areas of Yamuna,” Mr. Chaturvedi said while accompanying the team.

After taking the samples, the team left for Agra on Friday to obtain samples from the river there, he added.

Meanwhile, Mr. Mehta said the team had taken water samples based on his plea for protecting the Taj Mahal that also indirectly covers pollution in Yamuna river.

He pointed out that there are two drains passing close to the Mughal-era monument and without making it pollution-free, a “clean Taj” would remain only a dream.

According to Mr. Chaturvedi, the Ganga Action Plan was started in 1985 after Mr. Mehta approached the apex court.

Mr. Mehta’s submission, then, was that without cleaning major tributaries like the Yamuna, Ganga can not be cleaned, Mr. Chaturvedi said.

In 1998, Mr. Chaturvedi had filed a PIL in Allahabad High Court for making Yamuna pollution-free.

On the basis of the HC order, the government had taken steps including keeping a check on the drains, preventing discharge of industrial waste into the Yamuna, etc.

However, owing to indifferent attitude shown by officials, the river became more polluted, Mr. Chaturvedi alleged.

In the last hearing in SC when Mr. Mehta pleaded about rising pollution levels of the river from Delhi to Firozabad in UP, the court ordered for submission of the report by NEERI.

Mr. Chaturvedi also criticised the way the Centre’s flagship Namami Gange Programme was being implemented.

He argued that with unplanned work, the river would not turn pollution-free either in Vrindavan or in Mathura.

The activist said the Kosi drain should be included in the government plan as industrial waste and drain coming from Kosi, Shergarh and Chatta towns discharge in the stretch of the river in Vrindavan.

Without including Kosi drain in the plan, the stretch of the river in Vrindavan can not be cleaned, he said adding that Mathura and Vrindavan have been taken as separate units for implementation of Namami Gange Programme.

Under Namami Gange plan, Mathura was divided into four zones. However, the work is in progress in only two sones, (trans Yamuna and Masani zone), Mr. Chaturvedi claimed.

Even a detailed project report (DPR) for the other two zones – Masoom Nagar zone and Koyala Alipur zone – has not been prepared so far, he said.

In such a situation, I was left with no other option but to request Mehta to do something for cleaning the Yamuna,” Mr. Chaturvedi said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/d5ouhg/article31015279.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/YAMUNARIVERINMATHURA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/on-sc-directive-neeri-team-collects-water-samples-from-yamuna-river-in-mathura/article31015280.ece

She recalled, in June last year, seven MPs of the Rajya Sabha after her protest in front of the Parliament House, moved a Calling Attention Motion on the issue, but the minister of Environment and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar said that India would not bow down to international pressure on climate change.

The Minister’s response was not up to her expectations, she said.

Ms. Kangujam is known as Indian ‘Greta’, after being compared to award-winning Swedish teenage environment activist Greta Thunberg, for her passion towards the fight against climate change.

Ever since her foray into climate activism, Kangujam, who was conferred the Rising Star by the Washington DC-based Earth Day Network last year, made her demands clear -- that the government should enact a climate law to regulate carbon emissions and other greenhouse gases.

Such a law will bring in transparency, she said.

She also demanded that climate change should be made a compulsory subject in schools because she believes that it will help in the fight against climate change from the grassroots level.

“It will also help in educating our leaders as they would learn about the issue from their children and grandchildren,” she said, adding that the leaders just cannot believe that science and climate change is real.

Planting of at least three trees by a student to pass their exam will lead to the plantation of at least 3.5 billion trees a year as “we have 350 million students” asserted Licypriya who believed it will make the country green in five years.

She is certain that the policies would “help fight climate change and also to change the system of the world.”

121,2020/03/08,Coronavirus: 18 Indians among those stranded in cruise ship in Egypt,"The ship is anchored in the Nile, near the city of Luxor, after 33 passengers and 12 crew members on tested positive

Eighteen Indians, all from Tamil Nadu, are stranded in cruise ship ‘A Sara’ that remains anchored in the Nile, near the city of Luxor in Egypt, for the fifth day after 33 passengers and 12 crew members were tested positive for COVID-19.

A passenger from Coimbatore, speaking to The Hindu over phone, said that they, most of them aged above 50, were in a state of panic as they were yet to hear from the Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian Embassy in Egypt about evacuation efforts.

Of the 18 Tamilians, one passenger, an engineer from Chennai, was shifted to a hospital in the port city of Alexandria on Saturday after he developed symptoms of COVID-19.

“The crew told us that we will be quarantined for 14 days more. We were asked to remain in rooms. The crew is also not providing us food on time and not asking about medical requirements of the passengers who are senior citizens. The crew is also not communicating to passengers properly who are all in a state of panic,” said Vanitha Rengaraj, 60, founder of Sharanalayam orphanage in Coimbatore, who along with her husband R. Rengaraj, 62, are among the stranded.

The passengers from India had left the country on February 27 and they were supposed to be back on March 7. Salem-based Grand Royal Tours had taken them to Egypt and the package included a Nile cruise. The ship had 171 passengers on board according to international media reports and a bell boy was first tested positive for COVID-19.

“The crew forcibly took the Chennai native to a hospital leaving his wife in the ship. The crew does not respond to our queries,” she alleged.

When Egypt had a single case of COVID-19, Ms. Rangaraj who had booked the package in advance, asked the tour operator whether it was safe to travel to country. She said that the operator guaranteed a safe tour.

According to her, the U.S. Government evacuated their passengers from the ship a few days ago.

Mr. Rengaraj’s daughter Saranya Rengaraj said that the matter was communicated to the Indian Embassy in Egypt through the tour operator.

“We do not know whether the government knows about the stranded Indians.

The News Broadcasters Association has said it was “shocked” that the decision to ban two Malayalam news channels was taken “without the knowledge” of Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar, and demanded an inquiry into how this happened.

In a statement, NBA President Rajat Sharma said it condemned the decision of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to impose the 48-hour ban on Asianet News and Media One News, two news channels based in Kerala.

Mr. Sharma said the NBA appreciated the concern shown by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this matter and the subsequent withdrawal of the ban imposed on the two news channels.

He stated the NBA was “shocked to learn that a decision like this was taken without the knowledge of the Minister for Information & Broadcasting”.

“NBA demands that the Minister should institute an inquiry as to how the order prohibiting the news channels from broadcasting was issued without his approval,” the statement issued late on Saturday said. “NBA would like the inquiry report to be shared with it.”

The NBA is of the view that all complaints relating to broadcast of news should be referred to the News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA)— the self-regulatory body headed by former Supreme Court Judge (retd) A K Sikri— in order to avoid recurrence of similar incidents in future, it said.

The Centre had on Saturday revoked a 48-hour ban on the two leading Malayalam news channels, hours after imposing the punitive measure on separate charges of “siding with one community” while covering last month’s communal violence in northeast Delhi, and being critical of the police and RSS.

Mr. Javadekar had said on Saturday that Mr. Modi had expressed concern over the entire issue, adding that the government supported press freedom.

Without going into specifics, the minister had said he would look into the matter and take “essential steps” if any wrongdoing is found.

“But let me also tell you that everybody should accept that there has to be responsible freedom,” he had said.

The channels were suspended for 48 hours beginning 7:30 pm on Friday over their coverage of the violence. The official orders said the channels covered events of February 25 in a manner that “highlighted the attack on places of worship and siding towards a particular community”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/wvcty4/article31007269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AsianetNews,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/shocked-that-malayalam-channels-ban-step-taken-without-ib-ministers-knowledge-nba/article31014433.ece

The comments came as Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced to hand over all his social media accounts to women as part of International Women’s Day.

“Women’s Day is not just about one day. Its revolutionary origins for equal wages and rights are a powerful and important reinforcer of those who hold up half the sky,” Mr. Yechury tweeted. “We must struggle every day to make that promise of equality come true.”

“For the past one decade, the women’s reservation bill is sitting in the Lok Sabha speaker’s room. Instead of gimmickry and tokenism, why has Modi not got it tabled and got it passed in the last 6 years?” the CPI(M) leader asked.

Mr. Modi had on Tuesday said he would be handing over his accounts on various social media platforms to women who inspire.

“This Women’s Day (March 8), I will give away my social media accounts to women whose life & work inspire us. This will help them ignite motivation in millions,” he had tweeted.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday marked International Women’s Day by handing over control of his social media accounts to seven women achievers who spoke about the issues and causes close to their heart.

This follows his announcement last week that he was thinking of giving up his social media accounts. That turned out to be a teaser for Sunday’s celebrations.

Since morning, from Sneha Mohandoss, who runs FoodBank India, to Veena Devi, sarpanch of a village in Munger district of Bihar, whose venture of growing mushrooms changed her life, and Arifa from Jammu and Kashmir, who has revived the traditional Namda craft of carpet weaving, seven achievers in turns took over the Prime Minister’s Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram accounts.

Malavika Iyer, who managed to complete her Ph.D. despite losing her hands in a bomb blast, got a much-coveted follow-back from the Prime Minister’s Twitter account at the end of her turn at tweeting.

Massive response

The videos posted by the women achievers were also broadcast through the IGTV vertical screen viewing format of Instagram and had garnered a huge viewership on that platform.

Ms. Iyer’s video, for instance, garnered more than 3.5 lakh views within a couple of hours of posting.

The Prime Minister has a following of 35.5 million on Instagram.

On YouTube, where Mr. Modi has 4.54 million subscribers, these videos gathered traction. Officials told The Hindu that the choice of women achievers was made by the Prime Minister himself from a nomination process invited publicly.

In the morning, just before signing off for the day, Mr. Modi had posted a message for the event. “Greetings on International Women’s Day! We salute the spirit and accomplishments of our Nari Shakti. As I’d said a few days ago, I’m signing off. Throughout the day, seven women achievers will share their life journeys and perhaps interact with you through my social media accounts,” he tweeted.

There were some cheeky responses too, with one social media follower on Twitter, @vikrantbhadaur6, asking Ms. Mohandoss for Mr. Modi’s Twitter password.

125,2020/03/08,"SC, ST student enrolment in Ph.D. programmes remains low in IITs","Only 9.1% SCs and 2.1% STs among those admitted at the doctoral level, data show.

Enrolment of students from marginalised communities, mainly the Scheduled Castes (SC) and the Scheduled Tribes (ST), was abysmally low in Ph.D. programmes in the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) from 2015 to 2019, data presented in the Rajya Sabha on Friday showed.

Also read: Anna University tightens regulations for Ph.D. candidates and guides

Of the 25,007 Ph.D. scholars admitted in the 23 IITs over the five-year period, only 9.1% were from the SC communities and 2.1% from the STs. This is lower than the 15% seats reserved for the former and 7.5% for the latter.

Those from the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) made up 23.2%, which is also lower than the reservation-mandated 27%. Nearly two-thirds of the admissions (65.6%) went to general category students.

Questions from MPs

The data was submitted by the Human Resource Development Ministry in response to a question raised by Elamaram Karim and K. Somaprasad, Communist Party of India (Marxist) MPs from Kerala.

Also read: How far does a PhD go?

Though the total enrolment in Ph.D. programmes went up by 20% during the period, this increase did not result in a corresponding rise in the number of students from the two communities.

image/svg+xml

While the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006 seems to have helped those from the OBCs marginally, the enrolment from the Scheduled communities remained low.

This is shown by the fact that among the 23 IITs, 10 had at least 27% Ph.D. scholars from the OBCs as mandated by the Act. In contrast, only the IIT-Dhanbad ((Indian School of Mines) in Jharkhand had the minimum 15% from SC communities and the IIT-Bhilai in Chhattisgarh met 7.5% reservation for STs.

The IIT-Guwahati came closer with 6.9% of its Ph.D scholars from the STs. These three IITs are located in places with large populations of marginalised communities.

Established IITs worse

Nearly 60% of all Ph.D. admissions happened in the five bigger and older IITs — Madras, Bombay, Delhi, Kanpur and Kharagpur. However, these were also the insitutes with some of the lowest enrolments from the Scheduled communities.

Also read: Mandatory to study publication ethics, misconduct in PhD course work: UGC

For instance, of the 1,653 scholars admitted in IIT-Kanpur, only 11 (0.6 %) were from the ST communities. With the highest of 3,874 admissions, the IIT-Madras contributed to more than one-fourth (26%) of admissions in all IITs. However, it also had the least representation from the SC communities (6.4 %) among the five. The IIT-Madras was the only one among these five IITs to meet the minimum 27% reservation for the OBCs.

Mr. Somaprasad, who is also the vice-president of Dalit Shoshan Mukti Manch, said that institutions such as the IITs and the IIMs hid behind their claim that they did not get enough number of applicants.

“However, it is not true. I have requested for some more data. I will raise it in Parliament appropriately,” he said.

Siddharth Joshi, a Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, who has co-authored a paper on lack of diversity among the faculty in the IIMs, said the claim of a lack of applicants had been proven to be a flimsy excuse. “The onus is on the institutes to ensure at least the reserved number of seats get filled,” he said.

The lack of diversity among the faculty, he said, could not be addressed until the lack of representation in research programmes was addressed.

Stringent process

A top official from one of the bigger IITs, requesting anonymity, said that while the reserved seats in the B.Tech. and M.Tech. programmes got filled, admissions to Ph.D. programmes were dependent on the professors who guided the scholars. “They do not want students to enrol and later drop out. The selection process is stringent, and we often find it difficult to fill even the general category seats in Ph.D. courses,” he said.

However, he said the IITs and the Ministry were keen on addressing this gap and had begun discussions to draw up programmes such as preparatory courses organised for B.Tech. programmes. “We can perhaps take potential candidates as research associates first and later absorb them into Ph.D. programmes,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/article19834385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-IIT%20Kanpur,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-st-student-enrolment-in-phd-programmes-remains-low-in-iits/article31013959.ece
126,2020/03/08,Ban on 2 news channels lifted,"Government supports freedom of the press, says Javadekar

The Information and Broadcasting Ministry on Saturday withdrew the 48-hour ban on two Malayalam news channels hours after it was imposed late on Friday, imposing it reportedly for their coverage of Delhi riots with I&B Minister Prakash Javadekar saying he would look into the matter and take “essential steps” if any wrong doing was found.

The channels, Asianet News and Media One, were accused in the ban orderof “siding with one community”, alleging inaction by the Delhi police and the Union Home Ministry, and being critical of the RSS in their coverage of last month’s riots in Delhi.

“We immediately found out what actually happened and, therefore, we immediately restored the channels. One of the channel owners talked to me. By night only his channel, Asianet, was on and Media One is also on from today morning,” Mr. Javadekar told reporters on the sidelines of an eventin Pune.

For his government, press freedom is absolutely essential in a democracy, Mr. Javadekar said. “We fought the Emergency, we went to jail to remove clamps on press freedom.”

He further said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, had expressed concern about the ban.

However, the Minister while saying, “I will definitely go into the details and take essential steps if there is any wrongdoing,” added, “But let me also tell you that everybody should accept that there has to be responsible freedom.”

The channels were suspended for 48 hours beginning 7:30 p.m. on Fridaytill 7:30 pm on Sunday. In the event, the ban on Asianet News was lifted at 1.30 a.m. while the ban on Media One was lifted at 9.30 a.m. on Saturday.

Asianet News channel denied that they issued any unconditional apology for lifting of the ban. Asianet News Editor M.G. Radhakrishnan said the management of the channel contacted the I&B Ministry on Friday night itself.

“We didn't issue any apology. In fact, the Minister himself has clarified it, that he found it [the ban] out and that it happened without his knowledge. And he has reaffirmed his commitment to freedom of press. So it’s very clear; they have realised their mistake and the withdrew the ban order,” Mr. Radhakrishnan told The Hindu.

Media One Editor-in-chief C.L. Thomas said his channel had not reached out to the government. “We were proceeding for legal action. Today we got the information that the ban has been revoked, so we did not go ahead with the legal proceedings. We did not contact anyone in the Ministry; the government suo motu lifted the ban,” Mr. Thomas said.

According to sources in the Ministry, since the charges against both the channels were identical, once the ban on Asianet was withdrawn, the ban on Media One couldn’t continue. The Ministry's order against Media One also had factual errors. The reporter who has been cited in the ban orders, Hassanul Banna, is actually employed with Madhyamam, a daily which is a sister concern of Media One.

Opposition parties severely criticised the gag order.

“By banning Asianet and Media One, the government is saying that it’s a crime to ask questions and report on the mayhem in Delhi. We are confident that better sense prevailed overnight on account of widespread condemnation of such a intemperate act of the government. Hopefully they will not repeat such obnoxious act,” chief spokesperson of the Congress Randeep Surjewala said. He also slammed Mr. Javadekar, saying the Minister’s statement was shameful since he almost conceded that he did not know what was happening in his own government.

The CPI (M) called the shortlived ban a direct assault on press freedom and an authoritarian effort to suppress news which is not to the liking of the ruling party. CPI General Secretary D. Raja said, “I condemn this action of the government and this reflects fascist attitude of the government that is preventing the truth from being told.”

The National Broadcasting Association (NBA) welcomed the lifting of the ban. In a statement NBA President Rajat Sharma said the Association appreciates the concern shown by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this matter. Mr Sharma also said the Association was shocked to learn that a decision like this was taken without the knowledge of the Minister for Information & Broadcasting. The NBA has demanded that the Minister institute an inquiry on how prohibitory orders were issued without his approval and share details of inquiry report with them.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ban-on-2-news-channels-lifted/article31013934.ece

The CBI has taken over the investigation into the 2018 custodial death case of gangster Munna Bajrangi, officials said on Sunday. The agency had taken over the case following February 25 order of the Allahabad High Court on the petition filed by Bajrangi’s wife Seema Singh.

Alleging that there might be involvement of some mafia in the killing and raising suspicion over the role of jail officials, she had requested that the probe be transferred to the CBI.

The Uttar Pradesh government had opposed the petition on the ground that there was no need of a CBI probe in the case as three inquires were already underway — one under the district judge, another under the district magistrate and the third being conducted by the jail authorities.

A day after 51-year-old Prem Prakash Singh alias Munna Bajrangi was shifted to Baghpat jail in 2018, he was allegedly killed by another gangster Sunil Rathi, the officials said, adding that Rathi was lodged in the jail since 2017.

Bajrangi was brought to Baghpat from Jhansi Jail on July 8, 2018 for a hearing in an extortion case, but was allegedly shot dead by Rathi the next morning, they said.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) is considering new voting methods, capping the campaign expenditure of political parties, online registration of new voters at 17 years and ending social media campaigning 48 hours before polling among the recommendations proposed by working groups it set up in 2019.

The nine working groups, constituted after the Lok Sabha election and comprising ECI officials and State Chief Electoral Officers, had presented their draft recommendations on February 18.

Suggestions by March 31

On Saturday, the ECI published 25 of the main recommendations and invited comments or suggestions from the public till March 31 on the email address: coordination@eci.gov.in

“Working groups collated inputs from the field, analysed these inputs in the context of existing legal and institutional frameworks, and suggested pathways for the future to add value to the electoral process in the country,” the ECI said in the letter inviting suggestions.

Among the recommendations being considered is replacing all the forms for various voter services, including registration of new voter and change of address, with one single form.

Also read | Have electoral bonds made a bad system worse?

“Multiple numbers of forms create confusion and affect the efficiency in the process. It is now proposed to have a unified and simplified form for all services to voters,” the ECI said.

Another recommendation was to start online registration facilities at the school or college-level for all prospective voters at 17 years of age so they can be enrolled in the electoral roll as soon as they become eligible at 18. The ECI also recommended four cut-off dates in a year to enroll as a voter. Currently, January 1 is the qualifying date so those who turn 18 after that date are not eligible to vote the whole year. The ECI has proposed January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 as the qualifying dates, while the Law Ministry has suggested two dates — January 1 and July 1.

Electronic voter cards

The ECI also proposed to give out electronic versions of the voter ID card — EPIC — for convenience of voters.

Though not specifying the method, one of the recommendations was to look at the “possibility and feasibility of different voting methods”. The Hindu had reported on February 16 that the IIT-Madras was working on a prototype for an Aadhaar-linked remote voting system for the ECI.

In its letter inviting suggestions, the ECI said: “The Commission has already implemented one-way online transfer of postal ballots for service and implemented the same for the whole country in 2019. It has been seen that approximately 30% of electors are not able to participate in elections for various reasons... , some of them, as assessed in a report on facilities of domestic migrants may polling to the category of migrants who continue to remain voters at their previous locations. Commission is exploring the possibility and feasibility of different voting methods which remains secure and safe to ease and improve the electoral participation.”

133,2020/03/08,Sadhu parishat sees plan to grab Simhachalam temple lands,"‘Appointment of Sanchaita as trust board chairman a step in that direction’

The A.P. Sadhu Parishat has accused the government of planning to grab the Simhachalam temple lands.

The appointment of Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju, daughter of Pusapati Ananda Gajapathi Raju, as chairperson of the Simhachalam Devasthanam Trust Board was a step in that direction, parishat chairman Sivananda Saraswathi told the media here on Sunday.

“Ms. Sanchaita is being used as a pawn in the political game,” he alleged.

“Where was the need to issue a late-night GO making Ms. Sanchaita chairperson and removing the hereditary trustee, P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju, from the post? There are 105 temples under the purview of the devasthanam and 1,300 acres of land under the MANSAS Trust,” the parishat chairman said.

Stating that there was no such precedence, he said the move was aimed at grabbing lands belonging to the temple.

It was wrong to hand over the reins to a person who had no knowledge of the temple’s traditions and customs, the parishat chairman said. “How can a person who imbibed western culture protect Indian traditions and culture?” he asked.

‘Panchagramalu’ issue

BJP representative Sri Ram said that a ‘Save Simhachalam’ call was given by the party four months ago, and the time was ripe to prevent the government from interfering in the affairs of Hindu temples.

He also alleged that in the name of providing a solution to the ‘panchagramalu’ lands issue, attempts were being made to grab them.

RSS representative Radhakrishna said the developments had created a turmoil in the Pusapati family. He demanded that the G.O. appointing Ms. Sanchaita as chairman of the temple trust board be cancelled.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/601pcl/article31017414.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09VJPG4-SADHU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sadhu-parishat-sees-plan-to-grab-simhachalam-temple-lands/article31017415.ece
134,2020/03/08,DGP declares all policestations women-friendly,"In a first-ever initiative, kin of personnel visit workplace

In a first of its kind initiative by the Police Department to break the mental barrier that prevents women from going to police stations, all personnel in the State celebrated Women’s Day with their kin, including women and children, at their workplace, to start with.

The gathering of family members of personnel, including the station staff, Mahila Mitra members and Mahila Samrakshana secretaries at the 989 police stations in the State, marked the declaration of the police stations as women-friendly ones by Director General of Police D. Gautam Sawang.

Mr. Sawang made the declaration from the police headquarters which was was viewed by the thousands of women and children gathered at different stations via video link.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Sawang urged the personnel to encourage women to feel free to walk into police stations to lodge a complaint or seek help when needed.

“The entry of all these women into the police stations today has shattered the myth that the police stations are a ‘no-go zone’ for women. Seeing their wives, daughters, sisters and mothers in the police stations leads to a change in the mindset of the personnel,” Mr. Sawang said.

Lively interaction

Mr. Sawang also interacted with the women on the occasion. During their interactions, many women said it was their first visit to police stations even though their kin (police officers) have been working there since long.

To make the police stations women-friendly, the State police devised 19 parameters which are divided into institutional, structural, environmental, behavioural and action-based, and all police stations will work towards fulfilling the parameters with special focus on gender-sensitive behaviour of the personnel, police officials say.

Additional DGP (L&O) Ravi Shankar Ayyanar, DIG Technical Services G. Pala Raju, IPS, Disha Special Officer Deepika Patil, IPS and AIG (Administration) Aishwarya Rastogi were among those who took part in the interaction.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/dgp-declares-all-policestations-women-friendly/article31017372.ece
135,2020/03/08,BJP-JSP combine to release manifesto on March 12,"Centre’s help to State and YSRCP govt. ‘failures’ will be campaign highlights in local body polls

The BJP-Jana Sena alliance will release its manifesto for the local bodies’ elections on March 12 and it has resolved to contest in all places. The focus of their campaign will be on the development assistance which the Central government extended to Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) and the “failures” of the YSR Congress Party government.

‘Politics of vengeance’

Addressing media persons after a coordination meeting on the civic polls here on Sunday, BJP leader Daggubati Purandeswari said people were observing the politics of vengeance practised by the ruling party and the government’s ineptitude on various fronts. The attacks on leaders of the BJP and the Jana Sena Party were clearly aimed at infusing a sense of fear in them so that they would concede ground to the YSRCP.

She said the “anti-people policies” of the government would be highlighted and asserted that the State government’s intention behind conducting the elections at such a short notice was to give them little time to face the tussle.

However, the BJP and the Jana Sena had done their homework and were confident of emerging victorious, she said.

Ms. Purandeswari said much of the development taking place in the rural areas was with the funds released by the Central government under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and that a lot of work had been done in towns under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Swachh Bharat and other programmes.

‘Regressive measures’

The Central government’s support to A.P. would be highlighted during the election campaign, she said, exuding confidence that the alliance would emerge stronger in the future.

Jana Sena Party political affairs committee chairman Nadendla Manohar said there was nothing positive about the 10 month-rule of the YSRCP as it wasted time by taking various “regressive measures.”

The JSP and the BJP were committed to cleansing politics and would do their best to save the people from the ‘misrule’ of the YSRCP, he added.

Srinivas Yadav were among those present.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/1zgykc/article31017337.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09VJPAGE4BJP-JANASENA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bjp-jsp-combine-to-release-manifesto-on-march-12/article31017338.ece

138,2020/03/08,Battle Royale: female progeny challenge the ‘Male heir’ rule of Vizianagaram’s royal trust MANSAS,"The A.P. Government’s recent order has stirred up a hornet’s nest, and set to kick off a possibly protracted legal battle among the former royals

The Vizianagaram princely State which has a special place in Indian history has once again come into the limelight with the feud between family members of Pusapati Ananda Gajapathi Raju and Pusapati Ashok Gajapathi Raju for control over the richest prime lands of North Andhra region.

High stakes battle

The legal battle between two the families might continue for many years, according to legal experts. But what’s at stake? Around 14,800 acres of prime lands - spread mostly in Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram districts - technically come under the jurisdiction of Maharaja Alak Narayana Society of Arts and Science (MANSAS), and their worth is said to be more than ₹ 50,000 crore, according to sources. The Trust also controls prime lands of 108 temples including the Simhachalam Devasthanam, the second biggest temple in Andhra Pradesh.

P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju

The latest spark was lit when the Andhra Pradesh Government last week replaced the current male chairman with the grand daughter who has been challenging the male heir rule of the Trust.

Country’s richest Trust

MANSAS, established in 1958, is considered to be the richest Trust in the country with the control of valuable lands and prestigious educational institutions including Maha Raja College, MR Music Music College, M.R.Sanskrit College, among others, established over a century ago. There were no disputes in the last 62 years as P.V.G. Raju, who established the Society was chairperson between 1958 and 1994.

After the death of Mr. P.V.G. Raju, his eldest son Pusapati Ananda Gajapathi Raju, who served as MP during the Congress regime continued in the post till 2016. With his sudden demise, his brother Pusapati Ashok Gajapathi Raju took over and continued until his sudden removal from the post by Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy government. Mr.Ananda Gajapathi Raju's daughter Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju who had been fighting for the legal rights over properties could finally become the chairperson of the Trust.

The government’s move has also provided an opportunity for other family members - including Ashok Gajapathi’s daughter Aditi Vijayalakshmi Gajapathi Raju, Ananda Gajapathi Raju’s second daughter Urmila Gajapathi Raju, P.V.G. Raju’s daughter R.V.Suneetha Prasad - to be in the Trust. The Pusapati family’s younger generation members - Arun Kapur and Vijay K.Sondhi - could also get a place as per the GO MS No.75 which was issued on March 3 by the Endowments Department that also takes care of properties along with MANSAS Trust. Vizianagaram MP Bellana Chandrasekhar and Vizianagaram MLA Kolagatla Veerabhadra Swamy were also made members of the Board.

Royal Court to High Court

However, Mr. Ashok Gajapathi Raju’s family which was unhappy over the appointment of the new body decided to challenge the government’s decision in the A.P. High Court. Meanwhile, Ms.Sanchaita who had already filed cases over personal properties of the Pusapati family decided to continue the legal battle on her own strength. In the normal course, there might not be any controversy over the properties. Mr. Ananda Gajapathi Raju’s wife Uma Gajapathi Raju divorced her husband in 1991. Even after the break up, Ms.Sanchaita used to visit her father’s house and took his guidance for studies. Ms.Sanchaita says she is the legitimate heir as per the existing laws in spite of her mother’s divorce. She also questions the ‘Male heir ‘ rule of the Trust to ensure equal rights for women of the Pusapati family in the Trust affairs.

Speaking to The Hindu, Vizianagaram Bar Association former President Kantubhukta Srinivasa Rao said providing an opportunity for all family members in the Board of MANSAS was a good sign although there was a dispute over the chairperson’s post. He has also added that The Indian Succession Act-1925 can find a solution to the dispute with regard to issues of personal properties.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/e9glta/article31018240.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09VJPAGE4FORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/battle-royale-in-vizianagaram/article31015263.ece

Further, prima facie evidence had been established on his “grave misconduct and irregularities”.

The Home Ministry said the State government had even directed the ACB to conduct a detailed inquiry and submit the report.

Mr. Rao, an IPS officer of the 1989 batch, had handled key portfolios during the TDP term. He was Commissioner of Police, Vijayawada, during 2014-2016 after being promoted as ADGP.

Mr. Rao assumed charge as ADGP of Intelligence after the sudden transfer of A.R. Anuradha in the wake of the cash-for-vote case, in which the Telangana ACB had caught former TDP leader Revanth Reddy on the charge of giving a bribe of ₹50 lakh to an MLC in Hyderabad.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bwlmuf/article31012875.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08VJPG4-RAO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/home-ministry-confirms-ap-ips-officers-suspension/article31012864.ece

151,2020/03/08,Monitoring polls is not the job of government: Naidu,"Opposition being intimidated by YSRCP, he alleges

Stating that there was never so much confusion on the local bodies’ elections, TDP president and former CM N. Chandrababu Naidu questioned how was the State government concerned with the poll monitoring, which was the job of the State Election Commission (SEC).

He objected to the launching of the ‘Nigha’ app after the announcement of the election schedule and alleged that the government was encroaching on certain powers of the SEC.

Addressing media persons on Saturday, Mr. Naidu said the reservations for Backward Classes (BCs) were pruned (the quota for BCs was as low as 10.90% in Nellore district) and the opposition parties were being intimidated by the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) to benefit in the elections.

Control room

False cases were being booked on the leaders of TDP and other parties. He called upon people to vote as per their conscience and not be influenced by money and other illegal offers. On its part, the TDP has set up a control room with phone number 7995014525 to facilitate penal action against those violating the Model Code of Conduct.

Mr. Naidu said the YSRCP should be made to pay a price for its misgovernance which was evident from its rule in the last 10 months. Revenues have plummeted and if people reposed their confidence in the ruling party, the State’s woes would be compounded.

He alleged that the government was interfering in the affairs of the MANSAS Trust to capture its properties. The government’s decisions have put the State on the backtrack and it was high time that it was taught a lesson.

The most conspicuous thing was the crisis which Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy triggered in Amaravati by proposing to shift the Secretariat to Visakhapatnam as part of the ill-advised concept of ‘three capitals,’ Mr. Naidu added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/monitoring-polls-is-not-the-job-of-government-naidu/article31011954.ece

The complaints will be automatically routed to the central control room and the information shared with the officials concerned.

The officials will then be able to take action against those violating the election code of conduct by offering money, liquor and other forms of allurement.

Nigha app is in addition to the measures taken up by the State Election Commission and the Police Department to deal with the election-related offences.

154,2020/03/08,"Will order probe into MANSAS ‘irregularities’, says Sanchaita","‘I have been receiving complaints of shady land deals for last four years’

Chairperson of the Maharaja Alak Narayana Society of Arts and Science (MANSAS) Trust Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju on Saturday said that she would order a probe into the alleged irregularities in the land transactions and other issues of the Trust as well as the Simhachalam Devasthanam.

“I have been receiving many complaints about the irregularities in the last four years,” Ms. Sanchaita told The Hindu on Saturday.

The MANSAS Trust has under its control 14,800 acres of prime land in Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam districts.

Legal battle

“I will wage a legal battle to prove that I am the legitimate heir of my father Pusapati Ananda Gajapathi Raju, who had died in 2016,” Ms. Sanchaita said.

“My uncle (P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju) and his family members have never treated me as a part of the Pusapati family. It was clearly evident during the funeral of my father. They did not allow me to enjoy the property rights. I am fighting over the issue legally. The court made me to implead in the issue,” said Ms. Sanchaita, who is an advocate by profession.

“I was made the Chairperson of the MANSAS Trust after a relentless fight. I had sent many documents to the Endowments Department on my rights after the death of my father. Fortunately, the government responded and made me the Chairperson and others as members without giving a chance for the third persons to intrude into the affairs of the Trust,” she observed.

The TDP government headed by former Chief Minister N.T. Rama Rao had empowered women by taking some historic decisions.

“My uncle and others have repeatedly been stating that only male members of the family should head the Trust. It is an insult to women. I request people to debate on the issue on the the World Women’s Day (March 8), which is aimed at creating awareness on women’s rights and equality,” Ms. Sanchaita said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/will-order-probe-into-mansas-irregularities-says-sanchaita/article31011831.ece

Senior TDP leader P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju on Saturday asked the State government to make public the GO appointing Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju as Chairperson of the MANSAS Trust.

Addressing the media here, Mr. Ashok Gajapathi Raju while expressing concern over political involvement in the affairs of the Trust, hinted at waging a legal battle over the issue.

“Involvement of the government in the affairs of the Trust is not good. There are 230 hereditary Trusts in the State. No one will come forward to serve society in such a scenario,” Mr. Ashok Gajapathi Raju observed.

“Political parties are eyeing the lands of temples and Trusts in the country,” he alleged.

“Ms. Sanchaita had come to Vizianagaram only when my brother and her father Ananda Gajapathi Raju had died in 2016. My father P.V.G. Raju had clearly mentioned in the bylaws that only male members of the family should head the Trust,” Mr. Ashok Gajapathi Raju claimed.

“The government has misused its powers and intruded into the activities of the Trust,” alleged Aditi Gajapathi Raju, daughter of Mr. Ashok Gajapathi Raju.

Meanwhile, Telugu Shakti president B.V. Ram alleged that the YSRCP government, by appointing Ms. Sanchaita as Chairperson of the MANSAS Trust, had caused a sense of fear among similar Trusts in the State.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ashok-decries-political-meddling-in-mansas-activities/article31011807.ece
156,2020/03/08,UoM bracing for NAAC ratings,"The University of Mysore, which was accredited with a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) score of 3.47 out of 4 last time, is bracing for a higher rating in the ensuing rating exercise by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC).

Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar told The Hindu that the process to apply for NAAC rating has commenced and the varsity was compiling data and relevant documents pertaining to the university since February 1.

The process involves uploading data of the last five years. Once the data is submitted, the varsity has time to apply for NAAC rating in the stipulated format for which the last date is the end of March.

‘We have completed generating and uploading the data of the last five years and will complete the application process by the end of this month’’, said Prof. Hemantha Kumar.

The 5 year-data will have a maximum score of 700 marks after which the NAAC committee will visit the varsity for physical verification and assessment. This will carry 300 marks and will be critical in the final ranking.

The grading will be based on various parameters including curriculum enrichment, academic flexibility, student enrolment and profile, teaching and learning process, evaluation, research and innovation, and institutional values.

Prof. Hemantha Kumar said he has accorded lot of importance to research besides ensuring adequate resources for it while publications in journals have also seen an increase. Apart from tapping the UGC for resources, the varsity has mobilised funds from its internal revenue and this will stand in good stead for the ratings.

157,2020/03/08,NGOs seek HC directive to govt. on tribal resettlement,"Final report was submitted in 2014; issue raised before the Karnataka Legal Services Authority in Bengaluru on February 27

Almost 6 years after the submission of final report by a three-man committee on the rehabilitation of Nagarahole tribals, the State government is yet to implement the recommendations of the final report.

Hence the NGOs representing the tribal communities have written to the Chief Justice of High Court of Karnataka, appealing to him to issue a directive to the State government to take up the rehabilitation works. The issue was also raised before the Karnataka Legal Services Authority in Bengaluru on February 27.

The issue is a fall out of a writ petition (WP No. 14379/1999) filed in the High Court of Karnataka by Development through Education (DEED) of Hunsur on behalf of tribals who were displaced or evicted consequent to the notification of the national park in 1992 and as a tiger reserve in 2001. DEED had argued that nearly 18,000 people were affected and left in the lurch but the High Court asked the committee with Muzaffar Assadi as its chairman on October 11, 2004 to ascertain the number of affected people.

The authority’s interim report submitted in 2006 was accepted by the High Court in 2009 with a directive that the final report recommendations be implemented within 2 months. Though the final report was submitted in 2014, the government has not acted on it.

Hence, DEED represented by S. Sreekanth and P. Ramu of Karnataka Vikasa Vahini have drawn the attention of the High Court to the State government’s failure to implement the recommendations.

Mr. Sreekanth said that 3,418 families were affected consequent to the declaration of Nagarahole as a national park and they were to be rehabilitated suitably as per the 3-person committee. But the State government is guilty of contempt of court and the affected families have been left in the lurch, said Mr. Sreekanth.

As per the final report of Musaffar Assadi committee, tribals in H.D. Kote were the worst affected. Out of 3,418 families, 1,801 were from H.D. Kote taluk amounting to 52.69 per cent of the total displaced families. In all, 1,106 families were affected in Hunsur taluk which amounted to 32.38 per cent of the displaced while 511 families were affected in Virajpet taluk of Kodagu district amounting to 14.95 per cent of total displaced tribal population. In all, 11,568 people were displaced

The authority came out with 33 recommendations for the rehabilitation of the tribals that touched upon their socio-economic and cultural aspirations besides according them due political representation. Key recommendations included a conscious effort by the government to ensure that their rehabilitation be participatory in nature and the sites are close to the natural surroundings to which the displaced population is familiar. It also called for relocation of an entire haadi rather than individual families from different hamlets.

The committee recommended the grant of fertile land rather than dry land to the tribals besides training them in farming, dairy, animal husbandry etc. It also called for increasing the financial allocation for Ashrama schools, upgrade them so that they are brought on par with the Navodaya schools, provide land rights to tribals living in the resettlement areas, introduce internal reservation for primitive and forest tribes, and establishment of an Adivasi university.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1bb105/article31017095.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08MYSTRIBAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ngos-seek-hc-directive-to-govt-on-tribal-resettlement/article31017097.ece

It was inaugurated by Mysuru ZP president Parimala Shyam. Vice-president Gowramma Somashekar addressed the gathering and stressed the importance of recognising the contribution of women in various sectors.

She said women should strive to leave a mark in their chosen field and there was no field in which they have not left their impression. Women are present in social, political, industrial, economic and cultural fields and are not destined to remain within the four walls of their homes, she added.

She said it was imperative to encourage women to take up the profession of their choice and enable them to become financially and economically independent and respect their choice. However there are issues related to exploitation, harassment and gender discrimination and efforts should be made to redress them besides creating greater awareness on gender equality.

Mysuru ZP member Mangala Somashekar called upon the women to make use of the facilities introduced by the government exclusively for them and strive to reach greater heights.

161,2020/03/08,‘Congress anti-national in the eyes of Gandhi’,"It is spreading canards in the name of CAA, says Kateel

Stating that it was Mahatma Gandhi who called those spreading canards and destroying public property as anti-nationals, BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel described the Congress as anti-national as it was spreading canards in the name of CAA and destroying public property while staging protests against the law.

Addressing a programme to install S.A. Patil Kochbal as the new district unit president of the party here on Saturday evening, he said that as the Congress is spreading false information about CAA among the people, therefore, it is anti-national in the eyes of Mahatma Gandhi.

Also stating that Mahatma Gandhi, the former Prime Ministers late Indira Gandhi and Manmohan Singh all wanted to give Indian citizenship to religiously persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Mr. Kateel said that it was the Congress leaders of today who are opposing their decision.

He said that, after several decades, it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who had made the dream of those Congress leaders come true by getting the CAA passed in Parliament.

On the issue of Ram Temple, Mr. Kateel said that within two years, the BJP government will get a grand temple built at Ayodhya as the work is already under way now.

The Congress, which did not chant Bharat Mata Ki Jai in its office for decades after Independence, Mr. Kateel said, is today chanting the slogan.

“Today, the same party is openly chanting Bharat Mata Ki Jai in its office. This is the change brought about by Mr. Modi in India after taking charge as Prime Minister for the second time last year,” he said.

Describing B.S. Yediyurappa as a Chief Minister who always believed in wiping the tears off poor people’s eyes, he called the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah as a man who made people cry and another former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy as a man who always cried.

“During the tenure of Mr. Siddaramaiah, 24 Hindu activists were killed. By allowing this to happen, Mr. Siddaramaiah had made people cry. Except giving protection to sand mafia and cow thieves, he did not give protection to Hindu activists. When Mr. Kumaraswamy became Chief Minister, except crying at every function he did nothing. But when Mr. Yediyurappa became Chief Minister, he made sure that flood-affected people got relief and thus, he tried to wipe the tears off poor people’s eyes,” he said.

Calling the BJP as the most democratic party which gives a platform even to a tea seller to become Prime Minister, he said that till today, the Congress has failed to elect a KPCC president after Dinesh Gundu Rao tendered his resignation a few months ago.

He advised the newly appointed district unit president of the party, Mr. Patil Kochbal, to work for the party to ensure that it wins all eight Assembly seats in the next elections.

162,2020/03/08,UAHS develops new paddy variety resistant to blast disease,"‘Sahyadri Megha’ has been approved by the State-level Seed Sub-Committee and will be available for farmers from the coming kharif season

As part of its initiative to prevent decline in the area under paddy cultivation, the University of Agricultural and Horticultural Sciences(UAHS), Shivamogga, has developed ‘Sahyadri Megha’, a new red variety of paddy that is resistant to blast disease and rich in nutrients.

The new variety has been approved by the State-level Seed Sub-Committee and it will be available for farmers from the coming kharif season.

B.M. Dushyantha Kumar, professor of Genetics and Plant Breeding with UAHS, Shivamogga, told The Hindu that the ‘Jyothi’ variety, which was widely cultivated in the command areas of the Bhadra and the Tunga reservoirs and in semi-arid areas in Sorab, Shikaripur, Hanagal and Sirsi taluks, had become vulnerable to blast disease and other infestations. There was a demand for a new paddy variety that is resistant to the infestations.

Another objective of developing the new variety was to cater to the strong demand for red rice, rich in fibre and protein, by health-savvy consumers in urban areas. The research work commenced in 2009, he said.

‘Sahyadri Megha’ is developed under the hybridization breeding method by cross-breeding the best among the ‘Jyothi’ variety with that of ‘Akkalu’, a native disease-resistant and protein-rich paddy variety.

The results of the field trials conducted in Shivamogga, Chikkamagaluru, and Davangere districts have proved that the new variety has a high-level of resistance to blast disease.

Optimistic that the rice from the new variety can be sold for a premium by showcasing it as a protein-rich red rice, he said that the protein content in it is 12.48%, higher than the other red rice varieties grown. The yield per hectare from ‘Sahyadri Megha’ is around 65 quintals, substantially higher than other red paddy varieties.

Also, as the new variety can be harvested after 120 days of sowing, it is a medium-term paddy that can be grown when there is a delay in the onset of monsoon.

The aroma and taste of the rice from the new variety was also praised by farmers. The new variety will be notified under the Indian Seed Act 1966 shortly after which it will become part of the seed chain, he said. It may be mentioned here that the area under paddy that was around 1.5 lakh hectares in Shivamogga district in 1990, has come down to around 1.05 lakh hectares now.

Paddy growers are switching over to commercial crops like arecanut, ginger and rubber for lucrative returns.

The ‘Sahyadri Megha’ variety will fetch a good price if its nutrition values, aroma, and taste is properly showcased. As it is disease-resistant, the cultivation cost will be low, he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/gd8q1b/article31022719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9BGPADDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/uahs-develops-new-paddy-variety-resistant-to-blast-disease/article31015990.ece

165,2020/03/08,Sakleshpur farm land for forests?,"Aim is to mitigate human-elephant conflict: Prajwal

Hassan Lok Sabha member Prajwal Revanna has asked the Hassan district administration to submit a proposal to the State government seeking expansion of forest cover by taking over agriculture land from farmers willing to offer their land, to mitigate human-elephant conflict in Sakleshpur taluk.

He gave this instruction in a meeting with officers and elected representatives at the Deputy Commissioner’s office here on Saturday. As many as 416 farmers have given consent to part with their total land of 3,355 acres spread over eight villages of Hettur hobli to expand the forest cover. They have been demanding government takeover of the land for a suitable compensation, suggesting that such a move would help address the elephant menace.

Mr. Prajwal Revanna said many farmers had suffered a lot because of elephant menace. Their estates had been damaged repeatedly. A delegation would be taken to Delhi to meet Ministers concerned so that the problem could be resolved.

The proposal would be limited to eight villages – Mankanahalli, Arani, Yedakumari, Bajimane Estate, Balehalla, Bettakumari, Boranamane and Yettanahalla. “The governments at the Centre and State should appreciate the gesture shown by the farmers and provide them relief”, he said.

Sakleshpur MLA H.K. Kumaraswamy said the farmers in the elephant-affected areas had been suffering loss over the years. The government should provide them proper relief.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sugppr/article31014106.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07HASSANFOREST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sakleshpur-farm-land-for-forests/article31014107.ece

167,2020/03/08,Mahadayi water project: Fund and approvals a matter of concern despite Budget bonanza,"The ₹500 crore allocation in the State Budget for the Kalasa–Banduri Nala under the Mahadayi project, on the heels of the Supreme Court verdict allowing the State to go ahead with the works in the basin after getting necessary approvals, has brought cheer to farmers. However, officials say the road ahead is not very clear.

Officers say that they are seeking clarification from the legal team over many matters, including the issue of clearances. “First of all, the term ‘necessary clearances’ is loaded. We are not sure whether we need to seek all three types of clearances afresh from the start,” a senior officer of the Irrigation Department said. The March 2 judgment has terms like “approval from the Union Environment Forest and Climate Change Ministry”. Whether this mean approach afresh the Environment Ministry that had exempted the drinking water project in 2005-2006 is unclear, the official said.

Issues of ecology

Secondly, every project in a forest area that affects trees, wild animals and the ecology has to obtain three clearances. “We have obtained exemption from the Environment Ministry for the Kalasa-Banduri project as drinking water projects do not need it. But it still needs forest clearance and wildlife clearance. Goa has strongly objected to these two procedures as it suspects that the project will involve diversion of large-scale forest land and have negative impact on wildlife. That will take some time,” the officer said.

He also pointed out that the exemption was for using around 3.9 tmcft of water for the project of the total allocation of 13.4 tmcft. “For the remaining nine tmcft, we will have to get all three clearances,” the officer said.

Last month, Major and Medium Irrigation Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi announced the State government’s plans to build a hydro electric project in the Mahadayi basin, saying the 8.02 tmcft of water that will be used to generate power will be released back into the river. “But even this is not easy as it needs all the three clearances,” another officer said.

Officials point out the fund issue is also crucial. The ₹500 crore set aside is quite inadequate, they believe. “The first detailed project report prepared in 2014 involved expenses of ₹1,600 crore. The SC has now asked us to submit fresh detailed project reports. A fresh DPR will see escalation of costs. Also, we are not sure if we have to prepare three separate DPRs for the Kalasa nala, Banduri Nala, and the MHEP hydro electric project. If the cost escalates by 20% to 30%, then the time taken for completing the project will stretch to more than the planned period of six years,” an officer said.

Another contentious issue is of the continued objection to the project by Goa, which has filed an original petition against the project saying it would have devastating effects on the environment. It also tried to stop Karnataka from going ahead with the project after the notification in the union gazette. But this suit was dismissed by the SC that asked Karnataka to go ahead after necessary clearances. On Friday, Goa CM Pramod Sawant met Union Jal Shakti Minister G.S. Shekhawat to urge him not to entertain any proposal from Karnataka without keeping Goa informed.

The politics behind

Ashok Chandaragi, convenor of the action committee for Kannada organisations, suggests the three riparian States should settle the dispute out of court, considering the political nature of the dispute. “The Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti is against the project because they want Khanapur taluk, where the projects will be taken up, to be merged with Maharashtra,” he argued.

Sidagouda Modagi, Krishik Samaj leader feels the only hindrance is release of funds for the project. ``The path for all projects in the Mahadayi basin have been cleared by the Supreme Court. The state government should arrange the money for the project and go ahead,’’ he said. Vijay Kulkarni, president of the Mahadayi Horata Samiti claimed in Belagavi on Wednesday that there was no need for any clearance for the drinking water project. Officers say these are not informed opinions.

Farmers also feel that the tribunal’s allocation of 13. 4 tmcft is less compared to Karnataka’s demand of 36.71 tmcft. Officers say that would require seeking a review of the Tribunal order that could jeopardise the projects that have been cleared till now.

Background

In August 2018, the Mahadayi river water disputes resolution tribunal allocated Karnataka 13.4 tmcft of water against its demand for 36.71 tmcft. This was contested by all the parties who sought clarifications. In February 2020, the Centre notified the award following directions from SC. On a petition by Goa against Karnataka starting work on the projects, the SC, on March 2, allowed Karnataka to go ahead after obtaining approvals.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/gigiuj/article31013948.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGMAHADAYI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mahadayi-water-project-fund-and-approvals-a-matter-of-concern-despite-budget-bonanza/article31013949.ece

Deve Gowda on Saturday lambasted the Centre for its economic policies and alleged that during the BJP’s tenure the Reserve Bank of India had been destabilised instead of being given freedom.

Speaking to presspersons in Hubballi, Mr. Deve Gowda said that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s regime, the Centre interfered too much with the functioning of RBI.

Mr. Deve Gowda said that former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan had not allowed the Centre to interfere. But subsequently, the Centre had continued its policy of interfering in the functioning of RBI, resulting in a spate of resignations of financial experts.

He alleged that too much interference had resulted in extending financial assistance to ineligible borrowers.

169,2020/03/08,Watermelon cultivation on the upswing in Udupi district,"About a decade ago, produce used to come in from outside

The cultivation of watermelon has been on an upswing in Udupi district in the last 10 years.

About a decade ago, watermelons from other districts used to be sold here. According to the Department of Horticulture, the area under watermelon cultivation in the district in 2010-11 was 13 hectares with the production being 520 tonnes and productivity per hectare being 40 tonnes, while the total value of watermelon production was ₹23 lakh.

However, by 2018-19, the area under watermelon cultivation increased to 55 hectares with the production being 2,200 tonnes, while the total value of the production being ₹2.2 crore.

Farmers find cultivation of watermelon profitable. Suresh Nayak, a farmer who cultivates on 13 acres of his field at Munduje village near Hiriyadka, told The Hindu that he spends about ₹70,000 per acre.

“If the rate of watermelon per kg is ₹10 to ₹14 per kg, a grower makes a profit from ₹1 lakh to ₹2 lakh per acre. But if the market rate dips below ₹10/kg or the crop suffers from disease, then the grower is in trouble,” he said.

“Usually I cultivate two crops of watermelon — December-February and March-May. This year, I have cultivated a single crop because of heavy monsoon rains,” Mr. Nayak said.

Another farmer, Sudhir Balegar, who cultivates watermelon on his 2.5 acre field at Kambadakone village near Byndoor, said he had been cultivating two crops of watermelon for the last six years.

“I have only made profits through watermelon cultivation in six years. I follow mulching and drip irrigation. The watermelon cultivated has been sent to other districts through a broker,” he added.

Meanwhile, H.S. Chaitanya, senior scientist and head in-charge, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Brahmavar, said there was silt deposition on soil during floods (during monsoon). Hence, when watermelon was cultivated in such soil, its quality would be good. “A farmer can produce about 20 tonnes of watermelon per acre. The produce grown here is supplied to Kerala, Mumbai and other places. Compared to other crops, watermelon has good potential in the district,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mi0s6d/article31013941.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8BGWATER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/watermelon-cultivation-on-the-upswing-in-udupi-district/article31013942.ece
170,2020/03/08,Nikhil’s grand wedding plan: Kumaraswamy rebuffs criticism,"Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Saturday rebuffed criticism levelled against him over the grand marriage ceremony he is planning for his son Nikhil.

Reacting to former Minister A.H. Vishwanath’s remarks questioning the need for extravagant weddings in light of the country’s poor economic condition, he referred to the expenditure the Bharatiya Janata Party had incurred in the recent byelections.

Claiming that the saffron party spent ₹60 crore to ₹100 crore in each Assembly constituency, Mr. Kumaraswamy asked Mr. Vishwanath whether such spending could be justified in times of economic slowdown. “Didn’t they understand the condition of the poor when they spent such huge sums in the bypolls?” he asked.

Saying that he did not need to learn lessons from anyone, Mr. Kumaraswamy defended his decision to invite to the wedding the people who had blessed him and stood by him and his family in politics.

The April 17 wedding in Ramanagaram will also be an occasion to organise and strengthen the Janata Dal (S). The party workers will join hands with the family to organise it, he said.

On GTD’s future

Mr. Kumaraswamy also said he was not in a hurry to take action against former Minister G.T. Deve Gowda, who has been repeatedly criticising the JD(S) leadership.

He said that in any case, he could not take a decision on Mr. Gowda on his own and would have to consult the other leaders in the party. Mr. Gowda has incurred the ire of the JD(S) leadership by not only hobnobbing with BJP leaders, but also lashing out at JD(S) leaders.

“Tomorrow, the BJP government may fall and our government may form. Anything is possible in politics,” Mr. Kumaraswamy said.

Reacting to the resignation of former MLC Ramesh Babu from the JD(S), he said his criticism of the party leadership was hardly surprising. “It is natural for people to criticise the leadership when they are not given power and position,” the former Chief Minister said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/nikhils-grand-wedding-plan-kumaraswamy-rebuffs-criticism/article31011983.ece

172,2020/03/08,"For women to be safe, society needs to change its mindset about them: Olga","Telugu writer and women’s rights activist Popuri Lalitha Kumari, popularly known as Olga, on Saturday said that society needed to change its mindset about women in general to prevent atrocities against them.

Speaking after inaugurating a two-day International Women’s Day seminar at Dr. Ambedkar Bhavan here, she said only a change of mindset would lead to the protection to women and children, besides empowering women.

“Society has always believed that women should be confined within the four walls [of the house] because of incidents such as rape and sexual assault. But atrocities against women are not new. Society should not curtail the strength and power of women. Instead, it should create an atmosphere of women to walk fearlessly and with dignity,” she said.

According to her, women are asked to return home by 6 p.m. now. Even governments want women to reach home early. “It is not women, it is those who harass and exploit women who should go home early,” he said.

‘Take to the streets’

The writer also urged women to hit the streets for their empowerment, to know the world, and to protest atrocities against them. “Instead of stepping out from home alone, women should leave in groups. Unity will enhance their confidence, make them realise the power of liberty, allow them to learn about the difference of day and night, and make them strong to face the challenges in their routines,” she said.

Ms. Olga also said that politicians were making women’s self-help groups their vote banks while also dividing the unity among women.

She underlined the need of universities across the country to start women’s studies courses to provide a better perspective on the woman’s strengths and importance to society.

He was speaking after laying the foundation stone for a barrage across the Krishna between Jalalpur and Ingali villages. “We are committed to providing irrigation to every corner of the State.

177,2020/03/08,"KIIFB functioning is transparent, says Pinarayi Vijayan","‘State has undertaken ₹54,000-crore projects in four years’

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday rubbished allegations against the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB).

Inaugurating Kerala Nirmithi, an infrastructure expo showcasing projects being implemented under the aegis of the KIIFB at EMS Stadium here on Sunday, Mr. Vijayan said it was not right to destroy KIIFB by levelling baseless allegations.

Flawless system

“The State is witnessing a flurry of developmental activities. The KIIFB has a flawless inspection system. There is complete transparency in mobilising and distributing funds. The listing of masala bonds in the London Stock Exchange shows that even foreign agencies are showing an interest in the KIIFB,” Mr. Vijayan said.

On the YES Bank crisis, the Chief Minister said that KIIFB had withdrawn its deposit in the bank.

“This shows the alertness and correctness of the KIIFB. The public is showing hardly any interest in allegations levelled against the KIIFB. Our aim is to complete the projects in a time-bound manner,” he said. The State government had undertaken development projects to the tune of ₹54,000 crore in the past four years, the Chief Minister said. “The government has promised to undertake development projects worth ₹50,000 crore in five years. However, we have already taken up projects worth ₹54,000 crore in less than four years,” Mr. Vijayan said. The Chief Minister said 250 projects funded by KIIFB were nearing completion in the State. In Alappuzha, 86 projects worth ₹3,187 crore had been given nod, he said.

Pravasi Chitty

Regarding the Pravasi Chitty and Pravasi Dividend scheme, the Chief Minister said that ₹150 crore had been mobilised through the Chitty and ₹50 crore was received through the dividend scheme in two months.

Mr. Vijayan said that the government’s development policy was based on social justice.

“All sections of society should be able to taste development. The government has developed educational institutions, health centres and other hospitals utilising KIIFB funds. In the industrial sector, the government is providing all help including to industrial parks,” he said.

After an interval of 11 months, a death due to Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) or monkey fever death was reported in the district on Sunday.

Meenakshi, 48, of Naranga Kunnu tribal hamlet at Kattikulam under the Appappara Primary Health Centre died of KFD at the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Kozhikode.

Meenakshi was admitted to the District Hospital at Mananthavady on March 5 with symptoms of monkey fever. She was referred to the MCH on March 6.

13 cases this year

“As many as 13 KFD cases were reported in the district this year, of which nine patients have recovered. Two patients were admitted to the MCH and one to the District hospital a few days ago,” R. Renuka, District Medical Officer, told The Hindu. However, the condition of the patients was stable, Dr. Renuka said.

Dr. Renuka has issued an advisory to the public, especially villagers on the fringes of forests and tourists, against the outbreak of the KFD.

All the cases had been reported from the Begur area in Thirunelly grama panchayat in the district, she said.

Surveillance

Fever surveillance cell has been set up in Thirunelly grama panchayat for the early detention of the disease.

Vaccination drive was also intensified in the region, but the unwillingness of people to take vaccination owing to the severe pain after vaccination was a major hurdle, Dr. Renuka said.

Directions had been given to the front line forest staff and high risk population on the forest fringes to use personal protection measures, including gloves and gumboots as well as repellent lotions, before they entered forest, she said.

Tourists who visited the forest and resorts on the fringes of forest in Thirunelly grama panchayat should contact the health authorities in their area if they had symptoms of fever soon after the visit, she said.

Since 2013

The first case of the disease was reported in the district in 2013 and another confirmed case reported in 2014.

The virus wreaked havoc in the district in 2015 when 102 cases were reported and 11 persons died. Nine cases were reported in 2016. Though two suspected cases were reported in 2017, not a single case was reported in 2018.

The State is inching closer to realising housing for all, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

He was laying the foundation stone for an apartment complex as part of the third phase of the Livelihood Inclusion and Financial Empowerment (LIFE) Mission at Paravoor here on Sunday.

Mr. Vijayan said that the State government would create one more beneficiary list to include deserving people who had been left out of the initial phases of the LIFE Mission. “There are people yet to find a place in the beneficiary list. We are planning to prepare another beneficiary list after finding deserving families across the State,” he said.

The Chief Minister said that the LIFE Mission had created a positive impact on the people. “For several families owning a house was a mere dream. The government has fulfilled their dream by building two lakh houses through LIFE Mission. Their happiness is the government's happiness too,” Mr. Vijayan said.

He said that apart from Paravoor, housing complexes will be constructed at Thazhakara, Pallipad and Mannancherry in the district. The housing complex at Paravoor will be constructed on 2.15 acres of land for 156 families. The land has been provided by the Alappuzha municipality. The complex with two seven-storey blocks will be constructed at a cost of around ₹35 crore. The 500-sq.ft. units will have two bedrooms, a kitchen, hall, among other facilities. Besides, a hi-tech anganwadi, drinking water facility, waste treatment system and park will be set up.

183,2020/03/08,Coronavirus | Five new COVID-19 cases in Kerala; total in India now 39,"Family did not report travel to Italy, evaded airport scanners

Five persons, including two women from Pathanamthitta in Kerala, tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, taking the total number of confirmed cases across the country to 39.

Covid-19: full coverage

Kerala Health Minister K.K. Shailaja said the State had been put on high alert in the wake of the new cases. The Minister added that all the passengers who travelled with the infected family on the Venice-Doha Qatar airlines QR 126 flight on February 29 and the Qatar Airlines flight QR514 from Doha to Kochi on March 1 should get in touch with health authorities.

Official sources said three of the infected persons — a couple in their 50s and their 22-year old son — had reached the Kochi international airport from Venice via Doha.

All three, who were reportedly having mild fever, failed to inform the airport authorities or the Health Department officials that they were coming from COVID-affected Italy.

They were received at the airport by a few relatives from Kottayam, and reached their village of Aythala in Ranni the same day.

Relatives infected

A brother and sister-in-law of the man who had visited Italy were the first to seek treatment for fever at a private hospital in Ranni on Friday. The doctors found symptoms of COVID-19 and learnt that three of their relatives had recently returned from Italy. The matter was immediately referred to the District Collector and the district Health authorities.

The two patients and their three relatives were shifted to the isolation ward at the Pathanamthitta General Hospital. Laboratory reports released early on Sunday confirmed that all five had COVID-19 infection.

The Collector convened an emergency meeting of health officials at 2.30 a.m.

An action plan was prepared to identify all those who had come in contact with the infected persons.

The 86-year-old mother and 90-year-old father of the infected brothers were shifted to the isolation ward with fever on Sunday.

According to District Medical Officer A.L. Sheeja and General Hospital Medical Superintendent Ashish Manohar, the condition of all the five infected persons is stable.

A senior health official in Delhi said around 4,000 samples from across the country had been tested in the past month.

In the Capital, the government has ordered that Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses, metro trains and hospitals will be disinfected regularly as a precautionary measure.

More isolation facilities

Isolation facilities are being augmented in several hospitals across the country.

The Health Ministry has asked the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi to designate a part of the new emergency wing for setting up isolation beds for suspected COVID-19 patients.

N. Vijayan Pillai, CPI(M) MLA representing Chavara constituency, passed away early on Sunday at a private hospital in Kochi. He was 65 and undergoing treatment for the last two months. His body will be brought to Kollam and his last rites will be conducted at Chavara.

Mr. Pillai started his political career in 1979, representing the local body for over 20 years as a leader of the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP). He left the RSP and joined the Congress in 2000 and was a member of Kollam District Panchayat from 2000 to 2005.

But he later quit the Congress following political differences and moved to the CPI(M).

In the 2016 Assembly election, he defeated sitting MLA Shibhu Baby John in Chavara, a stronghold of the RSP, by 6,189 votes.

185,2020/03/08,"Fighting till the last, to save a life","The life was lost, but a nurse’s quick response drew all-round praise

It was an extraordinary end to what had started as just another day. A nurse’s valiant efforts to revive a passenger who had collapsed at the East Fort bus station here when employees of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation went on a flash strike drew in much praise. She only wishes that the effort had borne fruit, and Surendran, 60, survived.

Renju, senior staff nurse at PRS Hospital, was optimistic that Surendran would recover since she had wasted no time in administering cardio pulmonary cerebral resuscitation (CPCR) to him. However, it was not to be. Now, Renju plans to visit Surendran’s home to meet his family.

How it unfolded

On Wednesday, the day of the strike, Renju was heading home after her shift at the hospital. Her husband Binu too had come to the hospital for physiotherapy and they were taking the bus back. However, the strike saw their direct bus getting cancelled and they reached the East Fort station around 2.30 p.m. Just as they arrived, they saw Surendran trying to get up from the floor onto a seat. As he was showing signs of uneasiness, people around thought his sugar level had dipped and tried to get him to drink juice. Even while drinking it, he collapsed.

Surendran had no pulse and immediately, Renju’s training in providing life support kicked in though she did not know his medical condition. She laid him on the floor and started administering CPCR. She administered CPCR for around 15 minutes, when an ambulance took Surendran away.

Only after Renju and her husband reached home did they get to know that Surendran did not make it. Renju says her training in basic and advanced cardiac life support as part of her work helped her in the situation.

Earlier experience

She has had a similar experience in the past. Not long after completing her nursing course from PRS, she was at the Attukal temple when she came across a crowd surrounding a man who had collapsed. Then too, she had administered CPR.

Since Wednesday, Renju has been flooded with calls from a lot of people, including the PRS Hospital management.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ppnbdn/article31014127.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvnurse,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fighting-till-the-last-to-save-a-life/article31012114.ece
186,2020/03/08,Spreading WINGS on the volleyball court,"The group’s objective is to promote fitness of elder women

They neither had even a passing interest in sports nor had they entered any playground when they were in school or college. But a volleyball team of homemakers, all aged above 40, won the masters national meet in Gujarat in February 2020.

The masters national volleyball meet title was one of the many feathers on the hat of WINGS, (Women’s Integration and Growth Through Sports), a group of homemakers, based in Thrissur.

Initiated by N.A. Vinaya, Sub-inspector at Kerala Police Academy, Thrissur, WINGS objective is to promote fitness of elder women.

“For us the masters title was nothing less than an Olympics medal,” said Sheela Menon, the team captain. “We never thought even in our wildest dreams to take part in a national event. Nine women from Thrissur were part of the women’s volleyball team of Kerala that won the title.”

Beginning in 2014

It was in 2014, Vinaya thought of physical fitness for women. “Our first attempt was to give football training for girls. Soon, we realised that without inculcating the habit of fitness in mothers, it is not easy to get permission for the girls to practise such sports events,” Vinaya recalled.

“I introduced the idea at a State meet of the Kudumbashree Mission in Thrissur,” says Vinaya.

“Thus we stated the first team in 2014 at Puthurkkara. Overcoming many hurdles, women came for practice every day. It was not a cakewalk for us. We faced hurdles at each step. The physical fitness of many, who are stepping onto a playground for the first time, was poor. They faced resistance from family and society. Onlookers found their practice sessions funny. They did not like women of their age wearing jerseys and screaming while playing. But they were not ready to give up. The spirit was unmistakable as they were determined to fight all odds.”

Organises tournament

“We made history when WINGS organised a State women’s volleyball tournament with participation of 14 teams in 2015 in Thrissur. Regular practice made a huge change in their health, attitude, and self-esteem.” Redefining all traditional concepts of women’s freedom, WINGS spread across the State, forming teams in almost all districts.

In 2016, the women of WINGS crossed another milestone. Breaking the more than 200 years of male dominance, they took part in Pulikkali, considered a men’s event.

“But still things are not easy for us,” says Sheela. “Even at this point, when we had won a national title, we are struggling to get a playground for practice,” she said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/s9wqoy/article31012095.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvtrvolley,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/spreading-wings-on-the-volleyball-court/article31012074.ece

188,2020/03/08,Lawyer killed in tiff over waste dumping,"Accused snatched helmet from lawyer and hit him on the head with it

A 65-year-old lawyer was murdered following a dispute over dumping of waste in Chengannur on Friday. The deceased was identified as Abraham Varghese from Angadikkalmuri, Chengannur. The police have arrested A. Arvind, 33.

The police said Abraham had gone on a motorcycle to dump kitchen waste at a nearby place. “Arvind saw him dumping the waste and informed two of his friends. They chased Abraham on motorcycles and blocked him near his house. An argument ensued and they took the helmet from the Abraham’s head and hit him on the head with it. He fell unconscious,” said an officer.

The police said the accused and his friends first tried to escape but then they took Abraham to a nearby hospital on a motorcycle.

As he was in a critical condition, the medical staff referred him to the taluk hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. His toes got almost detached from a foot after they rubbed against the road while he was being taken to the hospital.

Arvind later came to the police station and said that a person had been admitted to the hospital after being met with a road accident.

189,2020/03/08,Leading the show at Cochin airport,"Recarpeting of the runway being done by a 27-member women team

It is another feather in the cap for the Cochin international airport. In its silver jubilee year, the recarpeting of the 3,400-metre long runway of the airport at Nedumbassery is nearing completion under a 27-member women team.

A seven-women team led by assistant general managers, civil, Ushadevi T.P. and Mini Jacob, supported by over 20 women apprentice engineers, has shown that women are not behind in taking up the challenge, demonstrating expertise for the upgrade of infrastructure to enhance the travel experience of flyers.

Six-to-seven-hour work

Since November 20, they are involved in relaying works lasting six to seven hours when the runway is closed for flight operations from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.

Braving the scorching sun, heat and dust, these women work amidst humongous trucks, pavers, millers, rollers, broomers, excavators, and compressors .

The relaying of the runway and the taxiway pavement of equal length happens in different layers. On the runway, a layer of dense bituminous macadam and dense asphaltic concrete with polymer modified bitumen is given.

Daily paving area for runway pavement varies from 6,750 sq m to 8,550 sq m and the gross bitumen mix used is 1,200-1,600 tonnes.

Planning helps

“This was a challenge for us and we executed it through planning and execution. Perhaps, this may be the first time women are involved to such an extent in the re-carpeting of the runway in an airport. Women have shown that they can handle tough civil engineering assignments,” says Ushadevi.

“In the silver jubilee of the airport it is a matter of pride that the key project of re-carpeting involving adherence to time schedule, stringent quality control, and the highest technical specifications is being implemented by a team of women. More than 3,000 of the 12,000 people working within the airport premises are women,” says CIAL managing director, V.J. Kurian. About 90% of recarpeting of the runway, which commenced on November 20, was over and the work may be completed by March 28 ahead of the summer schedule.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/s9byhq/article31012008.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvCIALRUNWAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/leading-the-show-at-cochin-airport/article31012005.ece
190,2020/03/08,"A few lessons out of syllabus, on personal hygiene","Shanthi Ganga holds menstrual awareness and sex education classes

Shanthi Ganga had the shock of her lifetime when she asked girls in one of her menstrual awareness classes about how they disposed of their sanitary napkins.

“I wash it, remove the cotton and flush it, and then burn the rest,” was the reply from many. The reason cited was Sarpadosham (serpent curse), which is instigated by burning of blood and could allegedly lead to infertility. Apparently, even non-Hindus believed in it.

“I do not want to touch the aspect of belief. But this method of disposal of sanitary napkins is unscientific. What appears like cotton inside them is actually super-absorbent polymer that bloats when put in water and eventually leads to clogging of toilet pipes,” says Dr. Shanthi, an Ayurveda physician in Kozhikode, who provides menstrual awareness/ hygiene and sex education classes to teenagers in government schools.

Ironically, the girls, even while accepting her advice to burn the napkins completely, are in no position to challenge their mothers. A majority believe menstrual blood is impure blood being discarded by the body.

Dr. Shanthi, in her classes, has been trying to promote eco-friendly menstrual hygiene methods such as cloth pads and menstrual cups instead of plastic sanitary napkins. Most teenage girls had heard about menstrual cups but had never seen one until Dr. Shanthi introduced it to them. But none of them wanted to use it for fear of losing their ‘virginity’ (hymen). She holds separate menstrual awareness classes for boys so that they understand that it is not something to be stigmatised and treat the women in their life properly. The sex education classes are also held separately for boys and girls. “These kids are advanced in their knowledge of sex as compared to the generation before them. But they are thoroughly misinformed too,” Dr. Shanthi says, adding she does not want to talk morality to the children.

“I just talk about safety and the right procedures. This is important as most of them are exposed to pornography and are guided by those videos,” she adds.

It was a discussion on how biology teachers in schools skipped the lesson on the reproductive system that led Dr. Shanthi to work on the idea of sex and menstrual education classes. It is four years since she began these classes.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wwei2m/article31012024.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvshanthi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-few-lessons-out-of-syllabus-on-personal-hygiene/article31011970.ece

192,2020/03/08,Kochi’s 64-year-old trekking guide,"Life’s setbacks have failed to deter trekking guide Sudha Chandran

Sudha Chandran (Sudhamma) looks diminutive but few people can match the 64-year-old’s passion when it comes to nature and wildlife.

Not many know that she began her tryst with nature in 1989, when her husband Chandran died. Defying her age and a bout with cancer, she continues to take nature enthusiasts on treks along forests, especially the Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary at Thattekad. She is on the move from 6.30 a.m. up to 10.30 p.m. every day with rare zeal and enthusiasm.

Guests, especially foreigners, seek her service since she made it to the Lonely Planet travel guide.

“Moreover, guests have given high ratings for Jungle Bird - my homestay in platforms like TripAdvisor. Almost every day, I accompany ornithologists, scientists, nature lovers etc., on treks and bird watching sojourns,” she said.

Thorough with habitat

In the past three decades, she has come to know of at least 170 of the 325 types of birds in the sanctuary , their habitat, and breeding season.

“After my husband’s death, I was confused and worried and remained at home for a week. Then the mother in me gained strength, for I had to take care of my two school-going children.”

She joined her mother and a neighbour at a tea shop at Thattekad. She attended classes and nature trails led by ornithologist Sugathan, who was a student of ornithologist Salim Ali.

Soon after, Sudhamma was able to send her children to Mysuru for higher studies. Her son Girish Chandran is a lawyer and often accompanies nature lovers on night treks.

“Being a good cook, my daughter-in-law Sandhya leads in preparing food for guests at our homestay. Nature and wildlife are a blessing to human kind. Sans them, our existence will be under challenge,” she says.

Sudhamma also finds time to help widows, the elderly, and cancer patients. “I underwent 25 radiations for cervical cancer in 2019. Now I am back on track and do not even have time to think of cancer. This could also be because I have a bold and positive outlook towards life. I seldom get tired and ensure that I retain a smile on my face.”",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/l1av68/article31011825.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvsudha,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kochis-64-year-old-trekking-guide/article31011826.ece
193,2020/03/08,Cracked hands do not puncture her tireless spirit,"Ayesha, widely known as Puncture Thatha, has been repairing tyres for 22 years

When the world celebrates International Women’s Day on Sunday, a woman at Manjeri salutes her gender by proudly reasserting that work is worship, no matter how hard or soft.

Illikkal Ayesha, 45, who has dedicated herself to repairing of flat tyres over the last two decades, has become a synonym for automobile puncture work. She is widely known as Puncture Thatha (meaning a woman who dabbles in puncture work). Her shop at Kozhikkottuparamba, near Vellila, is also named Puncture Thatha.

Ayesha is the lone woman who has taken up tyre repairs as a profession in this part of the land. And she takes pride in being called Puncture Thatha. “I took up this job 22 years ago because I had no other means to support my family, particularly my father. Now I continue in this field because this is the only job I know,” she said.

Her hands looked withered with uncountable cracks developed out of long years of hard labour. Ayesha began her job by repairing the flat tyres of bikes and scooters. Now, she handles the tyres of not only cars and jeeps, but also buses, trucks and earth movers.

“The biggest tyres I repaired are those of a JCB,” she said. While she is adept at removing the flat wheels of bikes, cars and jeeps, she needs the support of men for removing the wheels of buses and lorries. “Handling the tyres of vehicles is no issue. But survival really matters now with the economic slump having badly hit all areas, including tyre repairing,” said Ms. Ayesha.

Husband’s shop

Over five years ago, Ayesha got married to Kunhahamed Pallipparamban, who now suffers from renal failure. The couple have no children. When she manages her husband’s tyre shop at Manjeri, her own Puncture Thatha shop at Kozhikkottuparamba remains closed. But her friends and neighbours keep calling her, asking her to reopen the tyre shop.

“The concern and care of people is the biggest asset I have. My shop was named by my artist friend Upasana Narayanankutty, who wrote my number and name as Puncture Thatha on the shop's shutter. So it became a hit, and people began calling me so,” she said.

She lives in a rented house with her ailing husband. “I have no house to call mine. I want to share my plight with our Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, whom I am sure can help me. I am looking for an opportunity to meet Pinarayi Sir,” she said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/qdol12/article31011728.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvmp,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cracked-hands-do-not-puncture-her-tireless-spirit/article31011729.ece
194,2020/03/08,"COVID-19: Railways asked to sterilise all coaches, says Health Secretary Beela Rajesh","Of the two persons quarantined in a hospital, one had tested positive and the other was under observation, she says

The Railways had been given instructions to thoroughly sterilise all its coaches to prevent the spread of SRS-CoV-2 infection, said Health Secretary Beela Rajesh.

At a press conference here on Sunday, she said instructions had been issued to the transport departments and the Railway authorities to sterilise all buses and railway stations and trains besides public places to prevent the spread of the infection.

As of Sunday, of the two persons quarantined in a hospital one had tested positive and the other was under observation.

Since the infection was limited to persons who had been travelling, she said the focus was on advising against unnecessary travel. “We are also releasing IEC material to educate the population,” she added.

According to her, of the 60 samples lifted for testing only one had tested positive. The condition of the patient who had tested positive was stable, she added.

‘State well-equipped’

The State was well-equipped with medicines, doctors and could deal with the infection, so far. She urged people to avoid travelling unnecessarily. “The disease is spreading due to travel history to affected countries, and contact with those with travel history.

Baseless rumours were being spread in Tamil Nadu linking broiler chicken and COVID-19, Minister for Animal Husbandry Udumalai K. Radhakrishnan said here on Sunday.

The Minister participated in a programme (‘kaalkol vizha’) ahead of foundation stone laying for the Tiruppur Medical College Hospital to be held soon.

196,2020/03/08,"On Women’s Day, women power to the fore at Railways’ Salem Division","All-woman crew operates the Coimbatore-Bengaluru UDAY Express on International Women’s Day

It was a day of women power for Salem division of the Southern Railway as an all-woman crew operated the Coimbatore-Bengaluru UDAY Express on International Women’s Day.

The double-decker train was operated by H. Nimmy, Locopilot, and B.J. Sindhu, Assistant Locopilot. S. Mareena was the guard and a five-member ticket checking team led by Chief Travelling Ticket Inspector P.R. Savithri conducted the core duties of the train.

A senior woman passenger congratulated the team when the train was flagged off from Coimbatore.

At Salem, A. Annadurai, Additional Divisional Railway Manager, Salem, E. Harikrishnan Senior Divisional Commercial Manager, Salem, and Uma Maheswari, Senior Divisional Finance Manager, congratulated the team and felicitated them.

Sapna Soni, Station Manager of Magnasite Junction railway station flagged off the train from here. Ms. Soni said that it was a moment of pride for them. “It is a great day for women in the Division and we feel for more enthusiastic,” she said.

For Ms. Nimmy, the only woman Locopilot in the Division, it was a day of achievement since she was operating an Express train for the first time in her career. “I have been working in the Railways for seven years and I have been working as a Locopilot for 10 months. I usually operate goods trains and this is the first time I operated an Express train. We clocked a speed of 105 km/hr,” said Ms. Nimmy.

She said that from childhood trains enthused her and was always curious about the locomotive. Ms. Nimmy said the job was adventurous and more women should come forward to take up the job. “Operating an Express train is an entirely different experience,” she said.

B.J. Sindhu, who has been with Railways for four years, said that with support from family, women could achieve great heights.

Ms. Uma Maheswari said that it was the first time an all-woman crew operated a train under the Division and it was an honour for entire women staff.

P.R. Savithri, Chief Travelling Checking Inspector, said that she had been working in the train ever since the service was launched and said that the passengers had been very encouraging. “We felt that when passengers see women faces in crew, they are more assured and there is a smile on their face. Ever since the train started its service, we have ensured that there are no complaints regarding service,” she said.

Mr. Annadurai said that the Railways had been taking various initiatives for safety of women and he added that the Division recently distributed pepper spray to women staff as a self-defence measure.

According to Railway officials, the Division had been organising various events from March 1 on the themes ‘#EachforEqual and SheInspiresUs’ to emphasise on gender equality and to celebrate women achievers here.

According to officials, there are 1,131 women staff across departments under the Salem Division.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/fqbw90/article31014425.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Womenpower1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/on-womens-day-women-power-to-the-fore-at-railways-salem-division/article31014427.ece
197,2020/03/08,Safety in the dream factory: ‘Indian 2’ shoot tragedy gives a wake-up call to Tamil film industry,"The recent deaths of three persons during a shoot may have come as a wake-up call to the Tamil film industry, bringing to the fore the need to put in place a real safety net for professionals working to create magic on screen

The accident that left three dead and several injured on the sets of Indian 2, starring actor Kamal Haasan and directed by Shankar, at EVP Film City just outside Chennai, has forced the film industry into taking a fresh look at the adherence to safety norms on sets — an introspection that should’ve been done a long time ago, according to industry experts.

While accidents during shoots – at least two on the sets of actor Vijay’s 2019 release Bigil and actor Rajinikanth’s Kaala, which released in 2017 – are not uncommon, many in the industry hope that the deaths on the sets of Indian 2 result in concrete changes, not merely cosmetic ones.

Also Read In Kollywood, insurance is not top priority

Mr. Haasan and Lyca Productions appeared to criticise each other after the mishap: the former demanded that the production house adhere to safety norms, ensure compensation and medical help for the injured, the latter said that they had given importance to safety norms and reiterated that the filming happened under the supervision of Mr. Shankar and Mr. Haasan.

Beyond the verbal volleys, there could, however, be a silver lining. There are two types of risks – to the film itself and those working in it.

While safeguarding of the investment by insuring the film, evolving best practices to protect the hard disks and expensive equipment have improved matters, the safety of those working on the film set – light men, stunt men, the cinematographer’s team, heavy equipment operators and others – is still a cause for concern.

Companies such as Qube Cinema Technologies have evolved protocols to ensure that the producer’s property does not get misused whilst still in post-production. The same cannot be said for safety on the set.

Film Employees Federation of South India or FEFSI, an influential umbrella union of workers of all 24 film crafts (stuns, lightmen, assistant directors, etc.) is working on bringing out a ‘safety protocol’, which will soon be released. R.K. Selvamani, president, FEFSI, said he is currently involved in several internal discussions with other unions to come up with a safety protocol — a manual that would lay down rules for everyone to follow.

“We have not had a manual so far and we are working on one. We are also working with the State government to make it into a law by getting it passed in the Assembly. We are consulting all the 24 film crafts and are also in discussion with actors such as Kamal Haasan. It will soon be released and we are also talking with Kadambur Raju, Minister for Information and Publicity, to make that into a law,” said Mr. Selvamani.

Industry insiders say that there are potential risks to those working in the art department, camera department, light men or those who operate big industrial cranes and heavy equipment. A production executive recalled how a cinematographer fell down from a crane while filming and injured his spinal cord. “He was on rest for 6 months. The Art Department folks also work in a high-risk environment, especially when they build heavy structures,” said the production executive.

Need for audit

Who could do the audit? As happens usually in India, it takes a major accident and fatalities to push the industry into thinking seriously about safety. But, does the industry have competent personnel to do this safety audit on film sets?

Yes, says ‘Supreme’ Sundar, president of the South Indian Cine Stunt Directors and Stunt Artistes Union. He said that the stunt union has evolved reasonably better standards of safety on sets mostly due to the nature of the work involved. “When I had initially started working in the Tamil film industry nearly 15 years ago, there were hardly any safety norms or regulations in place for filming stunt sequences. We used vaikkol (grass) for protection and then nets and now we are using ropes and harnesses,” he said, adding that since the stunt directors and stunt department were already experienced in running a safety audit, they could help the industry come up with a robust ‘to-do’ list.

“There should be an ambulance, doctors and fire safety on standby. Right now there are norms but since some companies might not have funds for this, they might avoid following them,” he said. Mr. Sundar agrees that there should be a robust safety audit since workers who belong to other crafts often don’t take safety precautions. “Light men, for instance, just use a rope to climb up, when they need to be wearing a safety harness. If we were to ensure sets are safe, there should be a separate department to do so. Why should we think of all this after someone dies,” he asks.

“As the stunt union, we are ready to do these checks since we have experience. We want to suggest this,” he adds. Mr. Sundar underlined that the lack of insurance for stunt men was continuing to be an issue for which there seemed to be no real solution in sight. “Actors Suriya and Vijay Sethupathi have been extremely helpful in providing us with funds to ensure all our union members are covered under insurance. However, we need a permanent solution,” he said. While at present, they take about 5% from the wages of their members as union funds, they have appealed to the government to help them as well.

Recently, before the commencement of the shoot of actor Silmbarasan’s Maanadu, an announcement was made about how producer Suresh Kamatchi had insured the entire film’s team, including all actors and technicians. With more Tamil films recruiting foreign professionals, especially stunt directors, the stunt department is also best placed to learn best practices from around the world.

Penny pinching

A first-time film-maker, whose low-budget film has stunts involving an animal, said, on condition of anonymity, that his stunt director chose to not to make use of equipment to be in the producer’s good books. “In my film, I had given a list of things to my producer – industrial cranes, ropes, bed etc. – to film a stunt sequence, but my stunt director refused to take the bed. He wanted to get into the good books of the producer and as a result, there was an instance where a stunt man could have suffered serious head injury. Thankfully, he was okay and it was not serious,” he narrated.

Mr. Sundar underlined that the lack of insurance for stunt men continued to be an issue for which there seemed to be no solution in sight. The situation is dire for production assistants, who are the backbone of any film set. For Manohar*, a production assistant who has been working in the Tamil film industry, a safety audit for production assistants has not been a topic of discussion for long. Production assistants are among several people who work round-the-clock to ensure that the shooting goes off smoothly.

While smaller films can have up to eight assistants like him, larger films can have up to 25 assistants. ""The topic of our safety or security is something that hasn't been discussed with us before,"" he admits. While Mr. Haasan had called for a safety audit to be conducted on the sets of Indian 2 following the accident, Mr. Manohar says this isn't a norm on most of the film sets he's worked in. ""At least in the case of a big film made on a large scale, we might be given compensation if we get injured on sets. The same doesn't happen in the case of small budget films,"" he adds.

A creative producer of a small budget film said that his producer once asked the cinematographer of the film to set up lights on top of an artiste’s caravan instead of properly setting it up. “There are potential risks to those working in the art department, cinematographer’s team – when they operate cameras sitting on top of big cranes and those who operate heavy equipments. Art department workers are at risk when they build big structures. I remember my producer wanted to save Rs.5,000 and asked me to set up lights on a caravan instead of on top of a proper structure. In small-budget films, there are always cases like these,” he said.

Producer G. Dhananjayan said that the big budget movies that build big sets and use expensive equipment should be more careful. “Smaller films don’t build such big sets. They go to a real location and shoot without big equipment. Nevertheless, nobody should go to shoot without production insurance. Almost 80% of the films are insured these days against various kinds of accidents,” he said.

What is ultimately needed is a means to set in place and enforce safety as a discipline on the sets of any film being shot in the State, irrespective of the budget. The life of every worker on the sets of a film is valuable, and utmost care must be taken to protect them from harm.

Hundreds of people and leaders from various political parties bid a tearful farewell to former Minister and DMK general secretary K. Anbazhagan on Saturday.

From early in the morning, party cadre were seen queuing up to get a glimpse of the departed leader at his residence in Aspiran Garden, Kilpauk.

Leaders of various political parties dropped in to pay floral tributes to him.

In the afternoon, veteran actor and Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan, actor-turned-politician Kushbhu Sundar, Congress MLA Vijayadharani, PMK leader G.K. Mani and leaders of educational institutions paid tributes to the leader. As the crowd swelled, the police had to regulate the queue, restricting entry for many visitors.

In a handwritten message, he said that when his father M. Karunanidhi died, he took solace in the fact that Periyappa (Anbazhagan) was alive.

‘Heart aches’

“Whom will I look up to for advice now? How will I find solace?” Mr. Stalin wondered.

Mr. Stalin said that though it was difficult to draw appreciation from Anbazhagan, the late leader had praised him profusely and had even declared that “Stalin will be the leader of the party after Kalaignar (Karunanidhi)”.

“My heart aches as the man who conferred the greatest honour [on me] is no more,” he said.

200,2020/03/08,A day when condolences poured in from across the political divide,"Anbazhagan left an imprint on Tamil Nadu politics, says Chief Minister

Governor Banwarilal Purohit, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and leaders of various political parties condoled the death of DMK general secretary K. Anbazhagan on Saturday.

Mr. Purohit said the DMK stalwart’s contributions to the development of Tamil Nadu, over 70 years, would always remain in the minds of the people.

Mr. Palaniswami said that Anbazhagan remained a loyal friend of former Chief Minister and DMK leader M. Karunanidhi throughout his political journey and never deviated from the ideology of the Dravidian Movement. “He was a politician, a teacher, an orator, a writer, a trade unionist and a social reformer. He left an imprint on Tamil Nadu politics as the general secretary of the DMK for 43 years,” Mr. Palaniswami said.

TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said Karunanidhi and Anbazhagan personified friendship, and no other political movement had seen such personalities with a close bond. “They had a perfect understanding and ran the party efficiently during testing times,” he said.

MDMK general secretary Vaiko said that Anbazhagan stood by Karunanidhi and protected the DMK when M.G. Ramachandran quit the party to launch his own outfit; when V.R. Nedunchezhian left the party; and when he himself was expelled from the DMK.

“Few could match his oratory skills, and he even surpassed party founder C.N. Annadurai when he was given a reception on the Marina,” he added.

PMK founder S. Ramadoss said Anbazhagan was very close to DMK founder Annadurai and never compromised on his principles. “He was also close to Kalaignar (Karunanidhi) and accepted his leadership though the latter was younger than him,” Dr. Ramadoss said and recalled Anbazhagan’s appreciation of Tamil Osai, a newspaper launched by the PMK.

CPI(M) State secretary K. Balakrishnan said Anbazhagan was a multi-faceted personality and maintained his equanimity in tough situations. “At a time when the country is in the grip of communal forces, and secularism and State rights are under attack, the death of Anbazhagan is an irreparable loss,” he added.

Senior CPI(M) leader N. Sankaraiah recalled the role played by Anbazhagan in the seat-sharing agreements with his party since 1967. “He would always express his views after considering the issue from all angles and in a polite manner,” he said.

DMDK leader Vijayakant, VCK chief Thol. Thirumavalavan and leaders of other political parties also condoled the DMK general secretary’s death.

Polls postponed

In the wake of Anbazhagan’s demise, the DMK has postponed intra-party polls in all districts for seven days.

202,2020/03/08,Transgender couple ventures into business,"Premkumaran and L. Preethisha have set up a tea-cum-snacks shop in Chennai

G. Premkumaran and L. Preethisha, who are among India’s first transgender couples, have ventured into business by setting up a tea-cum-snacks shop on Kaliamman Koil Street in Virugambakkam, Chennai.

Prem is a transman, and Preethisha, a transwoman, who got married in 2018. After trying their hands at selling organic oil, they decided that a tea and snacks centre in Virugambakkam would do well.

In both the cases, Rotary Club of Madras Chenna Patna lent them a helping hand by giving a micro loan of ₹ 50,000 each.

While Preethisha is from Kalyanipuram in Tirunelveli, Premkumaran is from Erode. Earlier, she did small roles in films and worked as a delivery person for Uber Eats. Premkumaran drove for Uber to meet their financial commitments.

“Having worked for others, we wanted to live on our own. That’s when the organic oil business was booming. While people are ready to buy shampoo for ₹ 800, they are hesitant to buy ₹120 worth organic products from us, saying it is costly. That’s why we decided to go slow on it and think of a different venue,” said Premkumaran.

On Friday, the transgender couple started their new venture. The tea stall-cum-snacks centre will sell tea, juice, soup and bread in the morning. It will offer different types of organic food items in the evening.

As Premkumaran was manning the shop, Pereethisha had gone to the market to buy vegetables. “Summer is approaching, we will add ice creams, tender coconut and many other items,” he said.

“We have been prompt in repaying our loan. I don’t want to have any debt. We will clear the first loan very soon. That’s why Rotary Club of Madras Chenna Patna offered us the second loan of ₹ 50,000,” said Premkumaran, readying his new shop in Virugambakkam.

Rotary Club of Madras Chenna Patna has been providing a soft loan of ₹ 25,000 to street cart vendors, tailors, hair stylistsand foodmakers among others. It recently enhanced the amount to ₹ 50,000. Preethisha and Premkumaran are the first beneficiaries to get up to Rs.1 lakh.

204,2020/03/08,Rain to continue in parts of State,"Westerly winds blowing from Kerala cause of showers, says Met department

Rain is likely to continue in a few places in Tamil Nadu, especially along Western Ghats, on Sunday, according to the Meteorological Department.

During the past 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Saturday, a few places across the State received moderate showers. Manjalar in Theni district received 4 cm, the maximum rainfall for the day in the State. Periyakulam and Sothuparai in Theni district; Pulivalam in Tiruchi district received 2 cm.

One or two areas in Coimbatore, Karur, Ramanathapuram and Tiruppur districts also recorded light rain. Dry weather may, however, return on Monday.

N. Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, Chennai said westerly winds blowing from the Kerala region and moisture incursion influenced light rain over the Western Ghats region. In places like Chennai and interior parts of the State, strong south and southeasterly winds are blowing instead of the usual easterly winds. This helped in keeping the maximum temperature under control.

On Saturday, weather stations in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam recorded a day temperature of 32.3 degree Celsius and 32.2 degree Celsius, which is normal for the month.

Last year, the day temperature climbed to a maximum of 35.7 degree Celsius on March 29. The same wind pattern is set to prevail for a couple of days and it would keep day temperature under control.

206,2020/03/08,"In Kollywood, insurance is not top priority","Experts in the film insurance industry point out that when it comes to insurance, the Tamil film industry is still at a nascent stage

The Tamil film industry, which spends several crores on actors’ remuneration, has a tendency to tighten its purse strings when it comes to buying insurance cover for its projects. Only 30-40% of the 200-plus films that get released every year have a complete insurance package. The rest only get their equipment and key cast members insured.

Nascent stage

Experts in the film insurance industry point out that when it comes to insurance, the Tamil film industry is still at a nascent stage. “Only a few big production houses in the Tamil industry are functioning like Bollywood when it comes to insurance but the point is that the ratio of insuring films versus the number of productions going on the floors is not very encouraging,” says Sumant Salian, Business Head, Alliance Insurance Brokers Private Limited. He added, “We have also seen heavy price negotiation without giving importance to the compromise in coverage. The insurer who does not have a large book size will definitely not be comfortable giving wide coverage.”

According to Shreeraj Deshpande, Chief Operating Officer, Future Generali India Insurance, says, compared to the Mumbai film industry, which buys insurance that covers all aspects (package policy), the Tamil film industry is still catching up. “Initially, insurance was considered as one more burden on the film budget and the producers were very hesitant to take insurance policies. Now, with massive-budget Tamil movies coming up, they are open to opt for film insurance and even pay high premiums,” Mr. Deshpande points out.

The popular policy amongst film-makers in Tamil Nadu is one that covers the cancellation of shoots and injuries of the cast, which includes the main actors and directors and the crew members, and includes covers like damage to sets, public liability etc. Today, major Tamil movies feature a range of risky elements like motorcycle/ car stunts, fights and filming in foreign locations, hence insuring a film — especially a big-budget film — has become crucial.

Crew left out

“But the Tamil film industry very rarely gives importance to insurance for people, including stuntmen, cameramen, hospitality team, location managers, etc. There are policies which look into distributors’ loss of revenue, but this is not a hit among people in Kollywood,” said the managing director and CEO of another insurance firm who requested anonymity as he has signed a contract with producers.

Mr. Sumant explained that generally the film package insurance taken by the production house covers the entire crew, including light man and camera man, on an unnamed basis for accidental insurance. “The insurance rule book says if you are insuring your crew on an unnamed basis, the insured should declare the total number of crew members in attendance at any point of a given day so that there is no under-insurance or a no-insurance situation,” he said. “We have seen insurance policies where the number of people insured on an unnamed basis looks inadequate and also the value of insurance per person is low,” added Mr. Sumant.

Producers who spoke to The Hindu said that their biggest concern while making a film is the lead actor and his salary. Then comes the payment of the director. Unless it is a big budget film, producers said that they would not bet much on insurance.

“Making a film is not easy – from pre-production to post-production, it involves so many stakeholders. And, apart from the producers like me, there are other people who also invest their monies. So, taking insurance needs the nod of all these people,” said a producer, who has been in the industry for over two decades.

“Even today, 20-30% of dealings in this industry are in black,” he added.

A few years ago, a few production houses tried to streamline film insurance and film budgeting by roping in financial experts and even chartered accountants.

“It did not work out. Producers here have a different mindset and would not like it when an outsider talks about finances,” this producer added.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/mhdud8/article31012546.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Shooting,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/in-kollywood-insurance-is-not-top-priority/article31012543.ece
207,2020/03/08,"No new taxes proposed in Telangana budget, says Harish Rao","State on growth path with six% hike in State’s Own Revenue, says Finance Minister

Finance Minister T. Harish Rao has said that about 5.85 lakh farmers with loans outstanding up to ₹ 25,000 will be cleared of their burden this month itself as part of the loan waiver promise of the government.

The MLAs in respective constituencies will distribute the cheques for the loan amounts in villages across the State, Mr. Rao told a post-budget press conference.

Stating that no decision was taken on imposition of new taxes, he said the State was already on growth path this year (2019-20) with six % hike in State’s Own Revenue and 10.5 to 11 % in overall rate. The growth rate was better than some other States.

Mr. Rao was, however, critical of the double-edged weapon used by the Centre to cut into the revenues of the State government. It promptly slashed the release where the recommendations of the Finance Commission went against the State but did not consider where the State was favoured.

First, the State will get ₹ 2,384 crore less in 2020-21 going by the interim report of the 15th Finance Commission to cut down the tax devolution to States from 42 to 41 %. Pro-rata, the percentage for Telangana will go down from 2.437 to 2.133 which translated into ₹ 2,384 crore lesser devolution. In 2019-20 also at the old rate of 42 %, the devolution to the State dropped from ₹ 20,583 crore in the vote-on-account budget presented by Modi government before Parliament elections to ₹ 19,719 crore in the regular budget post-elections. In the revised estimates towards the end of the year, the devolution was brought down to ₹ 15,988 crore which was ₹ 4,595 crore lower than original estimates.

Secondly, the Finance Commission had recommended a grant of ₹ 730 crore but this was not conceded by the Centre.

Referring to Goods and Services Tax claims, Mr. Rao said the State government did not get any compensation for implementing the regime in the first two years — 2017-18 and 2018-19 — but was entitled to ₹ 3,196 crore in 2019-20 as its growth rate was less than the threshold level of 14 %. The Centre had so far released ₹ 2,263 crore out of ₹ 3,196 crore but its claim of ₹ 2,300 crore for implementation of Integrated GST was still pending.

Mr. Rao announced a fund of ₹ 10,000 crore for Hyderabad Urban Agglomeration scheme. Completion of intra-town pipeline network under Mission Bhagiratha in 38 towns would cost the government ₹800 crore as the contractor quit without completing the project. A start up grant of ₹ 300 crore for Godavari Riverfront Tourism project, market intervention fund of ₹ 1,000 crore and sanction of ₹ 300 crore to Forest Department for green cover improvement were among flagship programmes of the government this year.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/55igk7/article31016360.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY09HARISHCM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/no-new-taxes-proposed-in-state-budget-says-harish-rao/article31016361.ece
208,2020/03/08,Ryots debt up to ₹25K to be cleared soon under loan waiver scheme,"Cheques for debt amount to be given directly to farmers by MLAs

In a good beginning for the farming community in Telangana in the next financial year, those who have borrowed crop loans from commercial and cooperative banks and have outstanding debt up to ₹25,000 would soon be given cheques to clear the debt as part of the farm loan waiver scheme.

The major announcement from the point of view of the farming community formed part of the budget speech of Minister of Finance T. Harish Rao in the Legislative Assembly on Sunday. The dole was promised by the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) before the December 2018 Assembly elections.

According to the Minister, there are 5,83,916 farmers in the State who have outstanding loans up to ₹25,000. As the State government has decided to waive their loans completely in one go, an amount of ₹1,198 crore would be released during the current (March) month itself for the purpose. In a move to strike a sync with the farming community directly, the cheques of the loan waiver would be directly given to the farmers, instead of the regular practice of releasing the amount to the banks, and they would distributed by legislators.

Further, the farmers who have taken institutional credit and have debt over ₹25,000 and up to ₹1 lakh would, however, be given the benefit in four instalments spread across the next four years as it requires a huge amount of ₹24,738 crore. Cheques pertaining to the loan waiver scheme beyond ₹25,000 would also be given directly to the farmers by the legislators concerned.

The Minister for Finance told the Assembly in his budget speech that an allocation of ₹6,225 crore has been made for the loan waiver scheme during 2020-21.

In its continuing bid to ensure support price to farmers raising major crops such as paddy, maize, redgram and others, the State government has allocated ₹1,000 crore towards market intervention fund for the next fiscal. Similarly, continuing its thrust on micro irrigation to make optimum use of the available water, the government has provided another ₹600 crore for implementing the scheme with subsidy of 100%, 90% and 80% to different categories of farmers.

In the socio-economic outlook for the next fiscal, the government has estimated that crop is estimated to grow at 23.7% with the help of improved irrigation facilities and other support such as investment support (Rythu Bandhu) and subsidised seed supply. Similarly, the allied livestock and fishing sectors are estimated to grow at 17.3% and 8.1%, respectively with development of water bodies, free fish seed supply, sheep distribution and others.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ryots-debt-up-to-25k-to-be-cleared-soon-under-loan-waiver-scheme/article31016123.ece
209,2020/03/08,"Budget misleading, unrealistic: Bhatti","How can revenues increase by 29% from -19%, CLP leader asks

Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader, Bhatti Vikramarka has termed this year’s budget as jugglery of figures to mislead people, and asked the government as to how it can project 29% growth over last year financial year when it had scaled down the same by 24% this year citing economic crisis.

“How can minus 24% budget of 2019-20 financial year over the previous year can suddenly see 29% growth in 2020-21 year,” he asked at a press conference. Mr. Bhatti who spoke along with MLAs — D. Sreedhar Babu, T. Jaiprakash Reddy, Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy — and MLC T. Jeevan Reddy said the government was just showing unrealistic figures.

When the state was formed in 2014 with a surplus budget the government showed 15% growth in 2015-16 year, 13% in 2016-17 year; 15% in 2017-18 year and 17% in 2018-19 year, he said adding that citing economic slowdown the government presented a budget with minus 19% rate of growth in 2019-20.

When the country is still facing economic crisis, how was it possible to expect 29% growth over last year, he wondered and asked the Chief Minister to stop misleading the people. In fact, the Chief Minister has been blaming the BJP government at the Centre for the economic crisis, he reminded and said this budget is not only unrealistic and fictitious but also absolutely misleading.

Mr. Bhatti alleged that even in the previous budgets the government projected huge allocations but did not release the money. There is no allocation for unemployment dole that CM promised and also the three-acres land for Scheduled Castes, he said.

The Congress MLAs reminded that last year ₹ 6,000 crore was allocated for farm loan waiver but the amount remained unspent and this year too ₹ 6,225 crore has been allocated for the same purpose. In the last budget ₹ 500 crore were earmarked for unemployment dole but not a single penny was released and this year not a single rupee has been allocated for it.

At a separate press conference, former Minister Shabbir Ali said budget for 2019-20 was presented with ₹ 1,42,152 crore but the overall revenues till the end of January 2020, as per CAG, were ₹ 1,05,992 crore, including loans of ₹ 26,383 crore. This may not even reach the set target in the next two months and may stay around ₹ 1.10 lakh crore.

How can the government present a budget of ₹ 1.82 lakh crore for 2020-21, when state revenues are just about ₹ 1.10 lakh crore this year, he asked. “Where will the government get the additional revenues of Rs. 70,000 crore in the next one year,” he questioned.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/4bkxxf/article31016029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY09BHATTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/budget-misleading-unrealistic-bhatti/article31016030.ece
210,2020/03/08,Outstanding public debt close to 2.3 lakh crore,"Telangana far ahead of national average in per capita income

The outstanding public debt at the end of the financial year 2020-21 has been pegged at ₹ 2.29 lakh crore.

This is ₹ 30,100 crore higher than the previous year’s public debt of ₹ 1.99 lakh crore and constitutes 20.74 % of the State GSDP. The public debt outstanding was 20.55 % of the GSDP according to the revised estimates of the financial year 2019-20.

Given the population figure of around 3.7 crore, the per capita debt would amount to little over ₹ 61,000 crore by the end of the next financial year.

According to the budget estimates, the State kept the option of raising ₹ 35,500 crore as public debt and this component was included in the capital receipts. Of this, ₹ 34,000 crore was planned through open market loans, ₹ 1,000 crore as other loans, ₹ 400 crore as loans from the Central government and another ₹ 100 crore as floating debt.

In addition, the total tentative risk weighted outstanding guarantees stood at ₹ 40,241.32 crore with guarantees to the irrigation sector constituting ₹ 22,380 crore and Mission Bhagiratha accounting to ₹ 12,010 crore while guarantees to others were pegged at ₹ 5,849.98 crore. The public debt repayment during the next fiscal is projected to be ₹ 6,521 crore.

The State, however, performed well in terms of per capita income. The State’s per capita income during the current fiscal was pegged at ₹ 2.28 lakh as against the national average of ₹ 1.35 lakh. Telangana was far ahead of the national average with the difference between the two exceeding ₹ 90,000.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hakvvj/article31017534.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy09Budgetcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/outstanding-public-debt-close-to-23-lakh-crore/article31015731.ece
211,2020/03/08,An out and out farmers budget with upped allocation for Rythu Bandhu and irrigation,"The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has termed Budget 2020-21 introduced in the Assembly by Minister for Finance T. Harish Rao on Sunday as the best possible effort in the wake of severe economic slowdown being faced by the country.

Reacting to the budget, Government Whip Balka Suman said it would help all sections of Telangana live with self esteem, and would come in hand as the backbone of the State’s progress. He thanked Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, and Finance Minister T. Harish Rao for presenting a practical budget taking care of all needy sections, including the farming community for whom the Rythu Bandhu allocation has been increased by another ₹ 2,000 crore, taking it to ₹ 14,000 crore.

Palamuru-Rangareddy LI Project gets a push

Another Government Whip Guvvala Balarjau termed the budget as progressive which would help speed up the ongoing Palamuru-Rangareddy Lift Irrigation Project. He also complimented the government and welcomed the decision of handing over farm loan waiver cheques directly to the farmers through the hands of legislators concerned.

Further, Mr. Balaraju said the budget was a slap on the face of the opposition parties which have been spreading misinformation that economic slowdown would force the government to prune welfare schemes. He also welcomed the decision to give financial assistance (grant) to those poor who want to build houses on their own provided they have house sites.

Keeping pre-poll promises

Terming the budget as farmer and irrigation-oriented, legislators Sunke Ravi Shanker and Nomula Narasimhaiah said: “The healthy increase in the per capita income in Telangana was a reflection of the State’s economic progress even in the adverse conditions of economic slowdown.” Another legislator A. Jeevan Reddy said the budget was in the direction of fulfilling the pre-poll promises, including giving Aasara old-aged pensions by reducing the eligibility age to 57 years.

Government Whip in the Legislative Council Karne Prabhakar said making ample allocations to rural development, housing, irrigation, farming and other core sectors was an indication of the State leadership’s commitment to keep it on the track of growth without getting any help and cooperation from the Centre.

A delight for farmers

Meanwhile, Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy said the budget was a reflection of the Chief Minister’s commitment to continue with the welfare and development of the farming community with an additional allocation ₹ 2,000 crore to Rythu Bandhu to cover farmers who were added to the beneficiaries list after getting record of rights afresh.

Further, the allocation of ₹ 1,141 crore for Rythu Bima, ₹ 6,225 crore for farm loan waiver during 2020-21, ₹ 350 crore for development of farmers’ platforms (Rythu Vedika), ₹ 142 crore for seed subsidy, ₹ 100 crore for dairy development, ₹ 600 crore for micro irrigation,₹ 5,000 crore for free power supply to agriculture, and ₹ 11,054 crore for irrigation were aimed at making agriculture and allied sectors profitable.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/x53ng3/article31017585.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY09SNIRANJANREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/telangana-budget-2020-21-a-farmers-budget/article31015201.ece
212,2020/03/08,Telangana’s Budget 2020-21 pegged at ₹ 1.82 lakh crore,"Finance Minister T. Harish Rao presents a tax-free, progressive, and poll promise keeping budget; more people to be included into the State’s welfare net

Telangana Finance Minister T. Harish Rao has presented a huge, ₹ 1.82-lakh crore tax-free, budget for the financial year 2020-21, with a people-centric approach in the Legislative Assembly here on Sunday.

Coming in the backdrop of the economic challenges faced by the country and the State, the budget has projected revenue expenditure at ₹ 1.38 lakh crore, and a capital expenditure of ₹ 22,061 crore. The annual financial statement estimated a revenue surplus of ₹4,482.12 crore, while the fiscal deficit is pegged at ₹ 33,191.25 crore. Mr. Harish Rao asserted that there was no reduction in the funds pertaining to welfare schemes. In fact, the government took a decision to increase the beneficiaries under different welfare schemes.

Agri and welfare sectors get big bucks

According to the projections made for different departments, the budget apparently weighed heavily towards agriculture and welfare sectors with ₹ 14,000 crore allocated for Rythu Bandhu, the farmers’ investment support scheme, and another ₹ 6,225 crore towards implementing the TRS’ election promise of a loan waiver. The Panchayat Raj Department, which saw a new legislation enacted for its effective functioning at the grass roots, was given lion’s share of ₹ 23,005 crore while the Municipal Administration Department too got in excess of ₹ 14,800 crore, while the Home Department was allocated ₹ 5,852 crore.

The government’s intent on enhancing the coverage of financial assistance to different vulnerable groups through social welfare pensions was evident from the ₹ 11,758 crore allotted for Aasara pensions which would soon see a reduction of age limit from the present 63 years to 57 to become eligible as beneficiaries. The heavy accent on welfare could also be seen from the ₹ 16,534 crore allocated to Scheduled Castes Special Development Fund and ₹ 9,771.27 crore for Scheduled Tribes Special Development Fund.

₹ 10k crore for Musi projects

The twin cities got a major boost with the announcement of ₹ 10,000 crore for Musi Purification and Musi River Front projects. “The allocation was made as the government estimated that ₹ 50,000 crore would be required in the next five years for transforming the city into international levels,” Mr. Harish Rao said.

In the over one-hour presentation, Mr. Harish Rao said the State was better placed than others in the backdrop of the economic recession. The State’s own revenue average growth rate was 21.5 per cent for the past five years, and this had come down to 6.3 per cent this fiscal upto February, a 15.2 per cent decline. Keeping track of changed economic conditions, the government was preparing suitable strategic economic plans to address contingencies arising from time to time.

On sale: Housing Board and Rajiv Swagruha assets

Given the development of real estate as a major industry, the government had decided to sell non-performing assets held by institutions like the Housing Board and Rajiv Swagruha in a transparent manner to raise resources. “The budget was prepared in the backdrop of an economic slowdown gripping the country since the past one-and-a-half years resulting in reduction in tax devolution, and other transfers from the Centre as well as decline in the growth of State revenues,” the Finance Minister said.

Tax devolution from the Centre was expected to be lower by ₹3,731 crore during 2019-20 and there were also shortfalls in the release of the State’s share in the IGST and GST compensation. In the light of the economic slowdown, the growth of State’s own revenues in 2019-20 was estimated to be 6.3 per cent till February, much below the 16.1 per cent achieved in 2018-19. On top of this was reduction of the State’s share in Central tax devolution from 2.437 per cent to 2.133 per cent following the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/telangana-state-budget-2020-21/article31015074.ece

Further, the CM has expressed satisfaction over adequate allocations in the budget for plans made for the welfare of all sections, and for all sectors. He said despite the fact that the country is going through an economic slow-down, decrease in the State’s revenues, reduction in the funds from the Centre, the budget was made not to hamper any development activity in the State, which is a congratulatory effort.

Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao added the budget was made in accordance with the promises made during the elections, measures taken by the government for village and urban progress and development, and the objective of including more poor in the welfare schemes.

The Sunday newspapers and regional TV news channels featured many women achievers honouring them for their outstanding contributions in respective fields, in connection with the International Women’s Day celebrations all over the State. None of them, however, remembered the braveheart forester Chole Anitha, who had braved a brutal physical attack in line of duty in June last year in Kagaznagar of Kumram Bheem Asifabad district.

“More than the media, it is the Forest Department and the women’s organisations which ought to be blamed for the perceived ‘miss’,” opined a forester. “Notwithstanding the K.V.S. Babu IFS Memorial Gold Medal that she was awarded on Independence Day last year, the department should have remembered her as a woman officer for her outstanding contribution in protection of forest land,” he added.

It may be recalled that on June 30, 2019, Ms. Anitha, then Kagaznagar Forest Range Officer, and her team were attacked by villagers of Kotha Sarasala where she had been to take up plantation in a 20 hectare piece of forest land. The attack was allegedly led by Koneru Krishna, a local ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi party leader and brother of Sirpur MLA Koneru Konappa. Ironically Mr. Krishna was made vice chairman of Asifabad Zilla Parishad.

Rewards

Also ironical, according to conservationists, was the appointment of the MLA as a member of the Telangana State Board for Wildlife which was reconstituted in December.

In contrast, the government transferred out Ms. Anitha and then Kagaznagar Forest Divisional Officer M. Raja Ramana Reddy.

219,2020/03/08,‘5 cases of medical negligence in Gurugram’,"Incidents took place in 2017-18, hospitals including Fortis and Medanta: panel

A report by a Haryana Assembly committee has revealed that in 2017 and 2018, five cases of medical negligence were reported from Gurugram-based private super speciality hospitals, including Fortis, Medanta and Artemis.

Apart from this, one case of medical negligence each from Panchkula and Hisar districts and two cases from Jhajjar district were also reported during the same period.

Report tabled

The report by ‘Haryana Vidhan Sabha Subject Committee on Education, Technical Education, Vocational Education, Medical Education and Health Services – 2019-20’, which was presented in the State Assembly earlier this week, pointed out that two complaints of medical negligence were found to be correct against Fortis hospital, Gurugram, by the Medical Negligence Board in 2017, besides in 2018, two such complaints against Medanta hospital and one against Artemis hospital in Gurugram were found to be correct.

‘Judgemental error’

According to the report in the case of death of sixty-one-year-old Savitri Devi in 2018, where the complaint was made against Artemis hospital, the medical board found a “partial negligence” as it observed “...during treatment, all possible measures were taken to combat the complication, however, there was a judgmental error on the part of the operating team (orthopaedician) to undertake an aggressive surgical approach for an old patient with multiple co-morbid conditions. All possible measures to combat complication were taken..hence, no evidence of medical negligence has been found in the case by the board of doctors.”

In the complaint, filed by Haryana Medical Council pertaining to Gopendra Singh, whose child was admitted at Medanta hospital, the Board held that while there was no negligence in treatment, but hospital was found overcharging for blood products.

“There was no negligence done in the treatment and care by the doctors at the hospital, however, it was found the hospital has charged ₹1,950 per unit against supply of RDPs (random donor platelets) to the patient instead of ₹400 per unit fixed for dengue patients as per government guidelines,” the Board said.

No cardiologists’

In another case at Medanta hospital, where Hawa Singh (72) had died, the medical board observed: “Considering the very critical condition of the patient with acute coronary syndrome and cardiogenic shock, the patient should have been physically examined by Dr Praveen Chandra (consultant) on urgent basis, which was not done in this case. And also in his absence, there are no records of any cardiologists examining the patient from 4 p.m. to 6.50 p.m. It is presumed that the patient was not under direct care of any cardiologist for which the hospital is responsible.”

In the case of death of fifty-one-year-old Seema in 2017, the medical board probing the complaint against Fortis hospital, concluded that the patient, who was rushed to such a big hospital at night with chest pain and as the doctor stated, had a possibility of heart attack – not giving emergency medicines to her is “negligence”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/5-cases-of-medical-negligence-in-gurugram/article31017266.ece

221,2020/03/08,"More street lights, cameras for safety of women: Haryana CM","‘Numerous steps taken to provide more secure atmosphere’

Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal on Sunday said that 3.90 lakh street lights would be erected and one lakh closed-circuit television cameras installed across the State to ensure safety and security of women.

He was speaking at a State-level programmne at Government College Sector-14 here to mark International Women’s Day.

Speaking about the steps taken by the State government towards women empowerment, Mr. Lal said 3.90 lakh street lights would be erected as lighting provided a secure atmosphere to women folk during night hours. Two lakh CCTV cameras had already been installed and one lakh more would be fitted in the next two years to keep vigil on the law and order situation.

“Special vehicles were being provided to girl students to ensure that they reached their educational institutions safe. Not only this, 31 new girls colleges have been opened and nine more would be set up so that girl students do not have to travel more than 20 km from their homes,” said Mr. Lal.

He said Haryana was the first State in the country to announce capital punishment to rapists of girls below 12 years of age and numerous such steps were taken to provide more secure atmosphere to girls and women in the State.

Mr. Lal said women and girls played a significant role in taking the culture forward. He said today special gram sabhas were also being organised in all village panchayats to discuss the issues of women, their empowerment, health, hygiene, how to improve the sex ratio and bring equality and other related issues.

Booklet released

Before his address, the Chief Minister released a booklet on ‘Poshan Pakhwara’ (Nutrition Fortnight), the State-wide campaign launched on Sunday. Under it, the health of adolescent girls, pregnant women and children would be examined.

222,2020/03/08,Hooda hits out at BJP-JJP government in Haryana,"‘It is pushing the State back instead of taking it forward’

Former Haryana Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday hit out at the ruling BJP-JJP government in the State, describing it as a disaster which has failed to satisfy any section of society with the quality of governance.

“This government is pushing the State back instead of taking it forward,” said Mr. Hooda, who was addressing a rally at Karoda village in Kaithal.

‘No help for farmers’

“The State government had failed to protect the interests of farmers. Farmers are on the verge of bankruptcy, but the government has not yet come forward to help. Combination of natural disasters and government apathy have pushed the farmers into debt. The government should not only give full compensation to the farmers for the crop loss, but their debt should also be waived,” he said.

Mr. Hooda alleged that the government’s apathy was responsible for the poor condition of roads in the State. “All major roads now have tolls and people of the State have to pay for commuting to their own village and city. Haryana is caught between tolls and potholes,” he said.

“It has been more than four months since they formed the government, but the ruling coalition has not even released its Common Minimum Programme even though a new budget has been presented. There is no mention of any plan for bringing the CMP in the budget. In such a situation, even if the programme comes, it has no justification as no provision have been made in the budget,” Mr. Hooda said.

“During the Congress regime, Haryana was a leading State in per capita income, per capita investment, rewarding sports persons and providing employment to the youth. But under the BJP rule, the State is now leading in crime, drugs, unemployment and pollution,” alleged Mr. Hooda.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/krucu6/article31017233.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE08-HOODA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hooda-hits-out-at-bjp-jjp-government-in-haryana/article31017234.ece
223,2020/03/08,"84,000 vacant posts in Kashmir, but no recruitment yet","Replying to a parliamentary panel, the Home Ministry cited ‘scrutiny of details’ as reason for putting off the process

Almost seven months after Article 370 was revoked in Jammu and Kashmir, the Union Home Ministry has informed a parliamentary standing committee that the J&K administration has identified nearly 84,000 vacant government posts in the newly created Union Territory but the recruitment is yet to begin as the details are still being “scrutinised”.

Home Minister Amit Shah moved two Bills in the Rajya Sabha on August 5 that read down Article 370 that had granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir and downgraded and bifurcated the State into two Union Territories — J&K and Ladakh. In his speech, Mr. Shah linked Article 370 to poor economic development in the region.

According to the Ministry’s reply to the parliamentary panel on February 18, as many as 76,453 vacancies are of non-gazetted and Class IV level posts. Merely, 7,552 vacancies are gazetted posts. On August 28, the then Governor Satyapal Malik said at a press conference in Srinagar that the government had identified 50,000 government jobs and the vacancies would be filled soon.

In December, the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI) pegged the losses post August 5 security measures that included a continued communication lockdown in the Kashmir Valley at ₹17,878 crore.

A report of the panel headed by senior Congress leader Anand Sharma that was tabled in Parliament last week asked the government “to expedite the recruitment process and fill the vacancies in a time-bound manner”.

“The committee further recommends to reserve seats for the local youth so that they can get due share in the government jobs of the UT,” the report said.

When the committee sought to know about the initiatives proposed to employ people, the Ministry submitted, “The available data indicate vacancies of 22,078, 54,375 and 7,552 at Class IV, non-gazetted and gazetted level, respectively. The details are further being scrutinised and after finalisation of the exact vacancies available for direct recruitment, the Class IV and non-gazetted vacancies shall be referred to the Service Selection Board and gazetted vacancies to the Public Service Commission for selection,” the report said.

The Ministry said that to bring transparency, selection committees for Class IV posts had been abolished and the task assigned to the Service Selection Board.

Written tests

“The selection shall now be conducted solely based on written tests to be conducted by the Service Selection Board. Similarly, in respect of gazetted and non-gazetted posts, the relevant rules have also been modified providing therein that the selection shall be made based on written tests to be conducted by the recruiting agency and oral test,” the report said.

In the Union Budget, ₹30,757 crore was allotted to the Union Territory for the financial year 2020-21. When the committee sought to know the Union Territory administration’s plans to utilise the funds, the Administrator replied that the amount is in addition to the resources raised by the UT and ₹26,800 crore will be spent on salaries as per the 7th Central Pay Commission recommendations.

Pending projects

Of the 54 projects sanctioned under the ₹80,000-crore Prime Minister’s Development Package (PMDP) announced in 2015 for J&K, only seven have been completed so far.

When asked about the completion status of the PMPD, the Jammu and Kashmir Chief Secretary informed the committee that as on December 2019, 46% amount of the package had been spent and “seven projects have already been completed.”

“By the end of the financial year 2020-21, 75% of the expenditure will be incurred and by the end of 2021, 90% will be spent. Further, the PMDP, which is ₹80,000 crore, is a separate allocation and is reflected in the individual department’s budget,” the Chief Secretary said.

Industrial estates

The committee was also informed that more than 6,000 acres of government land in J&K has been found feasible for establishing and extending new industrial estates besides creation of infrastructural facilities.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pz7c6j/article31016972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THJampKCIVILSECRETARIAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/84000-vacant-posts-in-kashmir-but-no-recruitment-yet/article31016973.ece
224,2020/03/08,Sher-e-Kashmir International Convention Centre to be renamed,"The title, Sher-e-Kashmir, will be removed from nomenclature

The Jammu and Kashmir government is likely to change the name of the Sher-e-Kashmir International Convention Centre (SKICC) by dropping the title, referring to National Conference founder Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah.

An official of the SKICC told The Hindu, “The proposal has been moved and a formal order is likely on Monday.”

The convention centre, built in 1977, will be called Kashmir International Convention Centre.

Earlier, the administration dropped Muhammad Abdullah’s birth anniversary from the list of holidays and removed the title from the police medal.

Iltija Mufti, People’s Democratic Party PDP president Mehbooba Mufti’s daughter, wrote on Twitter, “Sheikh sahab was a political giant and played an instrumental role in J&K’s accession to India. His pro-poor land reforms transformed millions of lives. The Government of India can’t obliterate his contributions by such petty decisions. It’s etched in the hearts of Kashmiris.”

The decision comes at a time when the The Jammu Municipal Corporation (JMC) has had previously proposed to rename the Jammu Airport and the Jammu University after Dogra monarchs Maharaja Hari Singh and Maharaja Gulab Singh., who ruled Jammu and Kashmir from 1846 to 1947.

The JMC has already renamed the historic City Chowk in Jammu as Bharat Mata Chowk and Kachi Chawni Chowk as Atal Bihari Vajpayee Chowk.

225,2020/03/08,‘Missing’ M.P. MLA returns to Bhopal from Bengaluru,"Bisahulal Singh is among 4 lawmakers said allegedly ‘lured’ by BJP

The Madhya Pradesh Congress on Sunday claimed to have “freed” its MLA Bisahulal Singh who has been missing for five days, from the “clutches” of the BJP in Bengaluru. Mr Singh is among four legislators who went incommunicado recently.

The return of the Anuppur MLA, whose son had filed a ‘missing person’ complaint in Bhopal on Wednesday, comes a day after the return of Surendra Singh Shera, independent from MLA Burhanpur, who had also gone missing. Mr Shera however, denied that he was abducted and restated his support for the government.

Stating Minister Surendra Singh Baghel had escorted Mr. Singh back from Bengaluru, State Congress media coordinator Narendra Saluja claimed, “For the past three days, Mr. Singh was in the clutches of the BJP in Bengaluru.”

Mr. Saluja quoted the besieged leader, four-time MLA and former Minister, as saying that he had been with the Congress and will remain with it, and his “full support” remained with Mr. Nath.

On Wednesday morning, the Congress claimed it “rescued” six MLAs held hostage at a hotel in Haryana by the BJP, which was conspiring to poach them in a bid to destabilise the Congress-led government. The State government is supported by four independents, two BSP and one SP MLA. Legislators Hardeep Singh Dang, whose alleged resignation letter surfaced recently, and Raghuraj Singh Kansana are still believed to be in Bengaluru.

Refuting the charge that the BJP had held Mr. Singh hostage, State BJP president V.D. Sharma told The Hindu, “It’s clear from statements of other MLAs who returned they were not kidnapped or lured by anyone to cross over. They’ve even made it clear they departed and returned of their own accord.”

As reported earlier, four of the six MLAs who were “rescued”, including two BSP, one SP and a Congress lawmaker, rubbished claims of Congress Ministers of being offered bribes to cross over or having been held hostage.

Mr. Sharma distanced the BJP from the developments and pointed out it was a result of infighting within the Congress instead. “They are fighting among themselves. We have nothing to do with this,” he said.

Meanwhile, speaking to reporters here on Sunday, Bhopal MP Pragya Thakur said “ache din” (good days) were afar from Madhya Pradesh, and would find their way there soon. “The foundation of the Congress is weak. If the foundation of a building is weak, it will fall on its own. Wherever dharma has been attacked, ache din have come there.”

Earlier, Congress MP and former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh, first to flag the purported poaching bid, while maintaining the government was stable, had said Bisahulal Singh had informed him he was being taken by the BJP against his will. “Still, he told me he was with us.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/f1ud6g/article31016479.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WhatsApp-Image-2020-03-08-at-72227-PM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/missing-mp-mla-returns-to-bhopal-from-bengaluru/article31016480.ece
226,2020/03/08,Ex-J&K Minister and PDP leader Altaf Bukhari floats new political outfit,"J&K Apni Party not to seek special status for Union Territory

Businessman-turned-politician and former Minister Altaf Bukhari, 60, on Sunday floated the J&K Apni Party (JKAP) as an alternative to the regional parties such as the National Conference (NC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), of which he was once a member.

Also read | Analysis: Several obstacles on the political front in Jammu and Kashmir

The JKAP becomes the first Valley-based regional party since 1947 that stands for integration of Jammu and Kashmir into the Union of India and that is against any special status or autonomy for the Union Territory, in contrast to the NC’s pre-1953 position, the PDP’s ‘self-rule’ and Jammu and Kashmir People’s Conference’s ‘Achievable Nationhood’.

“We’re not here to sell dreams and fantasies but will always be pragmatic, honest and fair in our approach,” Mr. Bukhari said.

“We have resolved to create a platform where people are the real stakeholders of the political process,” said Mr. Bukhari, who hit the political scene in 2014 by joining the PDP and was the richest candidate with assets worth ₹84 crore in the Assembly election.

On Article 370, Mr. Bukhari said, “It is now in the domain of the judiciary. We will wait for the verdict of the Supreme Court.” However, his party’s main plank would be restoration of statehood and domicile rights to land and employment.

The party has decided not to seek reunification of the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh into one State. It has taken no members from Ladakh and confined itself to Jammu and Kashmir. “The party will seek to preserve the identity and dignity of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, the dignified return of the Kashmiri Pandits, empowerment of youth and women,” he said.

Except for PDP patron Muzaffar Hussian Baig, Mr. Bukhari has roped in most of former PDP legislators and Ministers.

Sources said Mr. Bukhari and Mr. Baig were in touch, but failed to reach an agreement on who would head the new party. However, Mr. Baig’s brother Javid Baig did join Mr. Bukhari's party. Five former legislators of the Congress and one from the NC from Jammu are among the 40 leaders who joined the party.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/3oa4sd/article31015125.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BUKHARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ex-jk-minister-altaf-bukhari-floats-new-political-outfit/article31015056.ece

Two of the four nominees are women, which is a matter of pride on International Women’s Day, noted party’s chairperson and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.

Mamata Banerjee announced the names on Twitter. “I am glad to announce that @AITCofficial will be nominating Arpita Ghosh, Mausam Noor, Dinesh Trivedi and Subrata Bakshi to the Rajya Sabha.”

Two of the nominated MPs are former Lok Sabha members of the party Dinesh Trivedi from Barrackpore and Arpita Ghosh from Balurghat constituency.

Mr. Trivedi was elected from Barrackpore twice in 2009 and 2014, while Ms. Ghosh, a theatre activist, was elected from Balurghat in 2014.

Another TMC nominee, Mausam Benazir Noor, was a Congress MP from Malda in 2014 but joined the TMC before the 2019 Lok Sabha poll. She was defeated by BJP’s candidate Khagen Murmu, formerly with the CPI (M) in 2019.

228,2020/03/08,Allahabad High Court pulls up Uttar Pradesh govt. on controversial hoardings,"The court took suo motu notice of the Lucknow administration’s controversial decision to ‘name and shame’ persons accused in the violence during the protests against the CAA by putting up their photos in hoardings all over the city

In a rare Sunday sitting, the Allahabad High Court pulled up the Uttar Pradesh government for the controversial hoardings put up by the Lucknow administration in the city of persons accused and out on bail, but not convicted, in the violence during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Ramesh Sinha took up the matter suo motu and sought answers from the Advocate-General (A-G) of Uttar Pradesh.

After the hour-long hearing, the court reserved the order for Monday. The court moved the hearing, scheduled for 10 a.m., to 3 p.m. on the request of the government that the A-G required more time to fly down to Prayagraj.

While accepting the State’s request, the court orally observed that the hoardings were an encroachment on personal liberty and asked if the government would take corrective measures before the hearing, said lawyers present in court. A senior lawyer said the court asked the State under which authority did it put up the hoardings.

Advocate K.K. Roy, who was present in the court, said: “The court’s observation was very important, that by putting up banners with photographs in this manner, you [the State] are encroaching upon the privacy, dignity and freedom of a person, and this appears to be an illegal act.”

Additional Advocate-General Niraj Tripathi said the court reserved the order after hearing the government’s side through the A-G.

“The court didn’t make any observations. Proper reply was given to all queries made by the court,” Mr. Tripathi said, when asked by journalists about the court’s oral observations.

Triggers fears

In a controversial move, the police and the administration put up several hoardings in Lucknow identifying those accused of violence during the protests against the CAA in December last, triggering fears among those named.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused are listed in the hoardings.

They have been asked to pay for the damage to public and private property within a stipulated time or have their properties seized by the district administration. The total damage listed in the hoardings amounts to ₹1.55 crore.

As many as 57 persons have been identified in separate hoardings that have come up pertaining to the jurisdiction of the Hazratganj, Thakurganj, Hasanganj and Qaiserbagh police station areas.

One of them, with 28 names, put up at the prominent Hazratganj intersection, next to the statue of B.R. Ambedkar, asks them to pay up over ₹64 lakh.

Those served notices in this hoarding include retired IPS officer S.R Darapuri, lawyer and activist Mohammad Shoaib, Congress member Sadaf Jafar, teacher Robin Verma, cultural activist Deepak Kabir and Dalit activist Pawan Rao Ambedkar. They had secured bail in the charges against them and also received notices for damage charges personally.

Exposed to public

Many of those featuring on the hoardings expressed anxiety over their safety as their personal information was now exposed to public and possibly to unruly elements. They termed it illegal and unethical.

While the Lucknow administration’s decision was widely debated on social media, and the Samajwadi Party condemning it, the Adityanath government has defended it.

231,2020/03/08,Fall in prices of vegetables worries farmers in Talavadi hills,"Say they are unable to recover production cost

Fall in price of vegetables, particularly tomato, cabbage and beetroot that are widely cultivated in Talavadi Hills, are worrying the farmers as they were unable to recover even the production cost for cultivating vegetables.

Agriculture is the major activity that provides livelihood for the people in the hilly area that is located 120 km from Erode and borders Karnataka. Tomato, onion, chilly, potato, turnip, ginger, cauliflower, cabbage, beans, brinjal, beetroot, carrot, radish, garlic and banana are widely cultivated by farmers in their small holdings in over 35 villages at Talavadi. Vegetables are taken to the seven mandi’s where price is arrived by auctioning and the successful bidder transports the produce to markets in Erode, Coimbatore and Kerala.

But many farmers say that they are not getting right price for their produce ending up in loss. “Production cost for a kg of tomato, cabbage and beetroot comes to ₹ 5. But traders purchase it for ₹ 3 to ₹ 5”, says Kanagaraj of Soosaipuram. “Since there is no cold storage facility here, we are forced to sell our produce at a price fixed by traders, he says and added that tomato is even procured for ₹ 1 from them at times.”

Also, vegetables arrive in large quantities from Chamrajanagar, Chikola and Bandalli, all in Karnataka where adequate water is available. Price for our produce is fixed by traders and not us, says another farmer Balan. “We cannot transport our produce to markets in plains and hence we sell beetroot for ₹ 2 a kg”, he added. Absence of cold storage facility, lack of provision for converting vegetables into value added products, arrivals from Karnataka and poor pricing are affecting the farmers.

Another farmer S. Manickam wanted the district administration to establish a regulated market at Talavadi so that vegetables are procured at a reasonable price every day. He sys that many farmers without harvesting tomato and beetroot are ploughing their land to avoid further loss. “A tomato sapling cost sixty paise, while production cost including fertilizer, labour cost and maintenance for 60-days cost over ₹ 5. But one kg tomato is procured for ₹ 1”, he said and wanted a permanent solution for the perennial problem.

Farmers say that price of vegetables will shoot up only after two months when the production drops. “Even when tomato and cabbage is sold at ₹ 50 and ₹ 30 a kg respectively in retail market in May, it is procured at less than ₹ 20 and ₹ 10 a kg”, Mr. Manickam added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/fvh0iy/article31017451.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB09CABBAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/fall-in-prices-of-vegetables-worries-farmers-in-talavadi-hills/article31017452.ece

234,2020/03/08,People want government-run swimming pool renovated,"People using the swimming pool maintained by the Tamil Nadu Sports Development Authority near the Mahatma Gandhi Stadium here have demanded necessary steps to renovate the facility at the earliest.

Flooring damaged

The swimming pool was constructed in 2008 and according to officials, minor repair works were taken up in 2013. However, the tile flooring of the pool is damaged at many places, exposing the concrete beneath.

“The exposed concrete has caused bleeding injuries to many swimmers. Though the damaged spots were covered with marble slabs to protect users for the time being, authorities must find a permanent solution. The dressing rooms also need repair,” a user said.

Currently, close to 30 persons use the pool on a regular basis and pay ₹750 a month as user charge.

Special camps are also conducted during vacations at the pool.

235,2020/03/08,Hasthampatti flyover out of bounds for motorcyclists without helmets,"Move aimed at encouraging two-wheeler riders wear helmets regularly: police

The Salem City police have introduced helmet zone on a flyover that helps motorists escape city traffic.

From Saturday, only those wearing helmets will be allowed on AVR roundabout -Hasthampatti flyover, which was brought to use recently. Police said that the move would encourage motorists to comply with road traffic regulations and wear helmets regularly.

City police has demarcated the over two-km flyover stretch as helmet zone and motorcyclists not wearing helmets will not be allowed to use the flyover. They will have to take the service road to reach Hasthampatti via Sharadha College Road, which would take over 15 minutes to reach Hasthampatti during peak hours. While the flyover route would take only five minutes or less.

Police officials are hopeful that this would encourage more motorcyclists to use helmets.

City police had earlier introduced helmet zones at Mulluvadi gate area and from Sankari Main Road to Periyar Arch.

Most two-wheeler riders travelling towards Hasthampatti and onwards to Yercaud and Kanankurichi prefer the flyover from AVR roundabout, since it helps them escape the slow moving traffic on Sharadha College Road that is dotted with schools, colleges and other commercial establishments.

“In spite of various awareness programmes, public are not realising the importance of wearing helmets. We hope that the move would make them wear helmets regularly,” Deputy Police Commissioner (Crime and Traffic) S. Senthil.

Cases registered

“Until March 8, 6,799 traffic violation cases were registered in the city, while only close to 1,900 cases were registered during the corresponding period last year”, Mr. Senthil said.

He added that while 45,000 cases have been registered for not wearing helmets and seat belts till March 8, only 26,000 cases were registered during the corresponding period last year.

Mr. Senthil said that they have also recommended for suspension of 1,500 driving licences this year.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/sdyaex/article31017378.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA09HELMET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/hasthampatti-flyover-out-of-bounds-for-motorcyclists-without-helmets/article31017379.ece
236,2020/03/08,A push for change,"Women share their stories of success at the 2020 Women’s Power Summit

The 2020 Women’s Power Summit, organised by FICCI FLO Coimbatore, had invited women who used their voices, positions, privilege and commitment to push for change. They included social entrepreneur Meenakshi Ramesh, Angel Investor Shanti Mohan, environmentalist Mridula Ramesh, film producer Archana Kalpathi, actor Lakshmi Manchu and fashion designer Jayanti Reddy. Journalist Mitali Mukherjee moderated the sessions.

The conversations centred around creating spaces in male-dominated work areas, being heard, and most significantly leaning in to improve the lives of others. Practical initiatives such as providing day care facilities, assuring them a job after they returned from childbirth and making them financially literate are as important as creating a safe and supportive home environment for them and bringing up sons to be feminists, they said.

Giving the example of #MeToo movement, Lakshmi Manchu pointed out how a collective uprising had wrought such powerful change. It was imperative that women be actively involved in financial decision making, said Shanti Mohan while Archana Kalpathi advocated employing more of them in the film industry. Meenakshi Ramesh struck a positive note when she said that women enrolment into education had improved and there were a sizeable number of them who were driving the change. She said it was also the task of the privileged women to share their wealth, work and wisdom.

Mridula had a less positive take as she described the devastating impact of climate change on women. From droughts and floods to diseases and unemployment, they suffered the most, she said. In a telling presentation she linked climate change to dowry deaths, amongst other revealing and shocking statistics.

Swathy Rohit, the Event Chair for the summit concluded, “This year’s International Women’s Day theme is #eachforequal. And I truly believe it is not empowerment we need.

238,2020/03/08,Encroachments by tea estate removed,"Revenue officials in Coonoor took action against the owners of a private tea estate, who allegedly encroached on a wetland in Bearhatty near Coonoor, and also illegally diverted water for use in their estate.

According to officials from the Revenue Department, the owners of the estate had apparently denied access to officials to the area for many years. They had purchased small plots of land surrounding the wetland over the course of many years, and had fenced off the entire area, before encroaching on the wetland by planting tea plants there.

An inspection by the Coonoor Sub-Collector, Ranjith Singh, a few months ago, had unearthed the illegal encroachment. He then gave the owners time to remove the tea plants on their own. However, as they had failed to remove the plants within the specified time, revenue officials entered the area and removed the tea plants from the wetland. Officials said that the area encroached upon by the tea estate measured approximately around 80 cents, and was an important water source, which helped replenish groundwater levels.

When contacted, Mr. Singh told The Hindu that the cost of removing the plants and returning the wetland to its original state will be charged from the estate, while the estate will also have to pay a fine to the department for illegally diverting water from a stream in the area at three separate locations.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/encroachments-by-tea-estate-removed/article31011952.ece

242,2020/03/08,COVID-19 scare affects broiler sales,"Social media posts on COVID-19 and fear among the public have hit broiler consumption.

According to the traders, the producers and traders have suffered nearly ₹500 crore loss in the last few days.

M. Kandasamy, president of Coimbatore Broiler Trading Association, told presspersons here on Saturday that in regular seasons, monthly broiler consumption in the district would be 40 lakh to 45 lakh kg. It was down nearly 50 % now. The average retail rate would be ₹200 to ₹250 a kg and it was just about ₹120 now.

Broiler was a product that could not be stored and the producers were already suffering losses. It was mainly because of fear about COVID-19, based on social media posts, that had led to drop in broiler sales for the last two weeks, he said. The fall in consumption was steep for the last few days and it was spread across the district.

Broiler sales would be high during April-May as it was summer vacation. This year, the traders feared that the sales could drop.

The drop in consumption was mainly seen in retail sales. Institutional sales continued to be as usual. Some hotels had reduced purchase by 10 % to 20 %. “We have spoken to the Chief Minister regarding this,” he said.

The Association planned to distribute pamphlets and create awareness among the public that broiler consumption would not increase the risk of COVID-19 spread, he added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/covid-19-scare-affects-broiler-sales/article31011894.ece
243,2020/03/08,E-bicycling tours launched in the Nilgiris,"Tourists hoping to experience a guided electric-bicycling tour will be taken on routes that showcase the colonial architecture of the district.

Electric bicycling trips were launched for the first time in the Nilgiris on Saturday. Backed by the tourism department, ‘BLive’, India’s first electric bike tourism venture, which has already made its presence felt in six other States across the country, launched their guided electric bicycling tours at the Taj Savoy here.

Speaking to reporters at the launch of the event, Samarth Kholkar, CEO and co-founder of ‘BLive’, said that the tours will operate from the Taj Savoy Hotel and the Club Mahindra, Derby Green. “Our aim with the tours is to ensure that tourists visiting the Nilgiris get an immersive experience of the district, its flora and fauna, its scenic beauty, culture and history, while also doing so in a manner that does not negatively impact the environment,” said Mr. Kholkar.

Tourists hoping to experience a guided electric-bicycling tour will be taken on routes that showcase the colonial architecture of the district. Those taking the tour will also be taken to a eucalyptus distillery, while the tour will also take visitors through tea plantations and forests and to also an indigenous Toda village, where they will be educated on the local culture of the tribe.

“The tours are open to everyone, regardless of whether they stay at the two hotels where the bike hubs have been installed,” said Mr. Kholkar, who added that people of any age, be they just children or people as old as 75, can use the electric bicycles.

Geetha Srinivasan, Convenor of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) in the Nilgiris, who was a special guest at the launch event, reminisced about the lost charm of the Nilgiris, with booming construction and increasing tourist numbers, leading to more traffic and pollution having an impact on the air quality of the district.

“It is not enough to have quantitative tourism, but what’s more important is to have quality tourism,” said Ms. Srinivasan, who added that the district’s residents must band together to insist on the district administration to ban diesel and petrol engine vehicles from the town’s roads once a month, so that walkers, cyclists and electric vehicle users can enjoy the roads.

Shobana Chandrasekar, one of the founding members of the “Make Ooty Beautiful Project,” which is partnering with BLive, said that it was apparent that “Ooty was serving a far larger population than it can handle… Choosing electric bikes instead of cars and two-wheelers that use fossil fuels can significantly reduce air pollution while encouraging more tourists to stop using road-hogging vehicles and to using bicycles to see the Nilgiris differently,” she said.

Also present at the event was Assistant Tourism Officer, Nilgiris district, Durga Devi, who said that the department welcomed such initiatives which encourage more sustainable tourism in the district. “We will also actively encourage visiting tourists who come to us for information to take these tours,” she said.

Anita Nanjappa, another founder of the Make Ooty Beautiful Project as well as M.R.

244,2020/03/08,Candidates in South Zone preferred over others in conservancy workers’ appointment,"Of the 321, more than 200 are from South Zone, according to civic body sources

Two out of every three persons the Coimbatore Corporation appointed conservancy workers is from the South Zone, which falls under Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani’s Thondamuthur constituency.

On Friday, the Corporation issued appointment orders to 321 persons as conservancy workers.

Of the 321, more than 200 are from South Zone, said Corporation sources, adding that the vacancy in the Zone was 93, though. And, from the remaining four zones – North East, Central and West, the Corporation had filled the rest 120-odd posts.

The Corporation, following the State Government's approval, had sometime ago called for applications to fill up 543 vacant conservancy worker posts. More than 7,300 candidates had applied and of those 4,700 turned up for the preliminary certificate verification process in December 2019.

Though the Corporation had fixed the ability to read and write Tamil as the basic qualification, candidates with engineer, arts and science degrees had turned up with their certificates.

After sitting over the list of selected candidates for nearly three months, the Corporation suddenly said it was issuing appointment orders to the short-listed candidates.

The Friday's announcement that Mr. Velumani would issue appointment orders was a surprise even for us, said a few Corporation officials. They admitted on condition of anonymity, that the selection for appointment of over 200 candidates from the South Zone clearly had the stamp of political interference.

They would not be surprised if people close to the powers that be or employees of contract companies that were close to the powers that be were preferred to others, the officers said.

A sanitary officer said the Corporation overlooking the candidature of contract workers with over 10 years of experience had already led to people posing difficult questions.

N. Karthik,MLA, said he had started receiving complaints since Friday evening. The Corporation had preferred not only candidates from the South Zone but also those who were close to the ruling party, the AIADMK.

The skewed appointment was only an extension of the Corporation spending money on projects mostly in South Zone that fell under Mr. Velumani's constituency.

After the week-long mourning due to the death of party’s general secretary K. Anbazhagan, Mr. Karthik said the DMK would oppose the Corporation’s skewed appointment.

Commissioner Sravan Kumar Jatavath said while he was not aware of how many candidates were selected from each of the zones, the Corporation had selected candidates from all zones.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/fbirer/article31013971.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB08CANDIDATES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/candidates-in-south-zone-preferred-over-others-in-conservancy-workers-appointment/article31011885.ece

246,2020/03/08,Civic body to establish dry waste incineration plant at ₹ 1.60 crore,"Tender has been floated, says Corporation Commissioner

As part of its plan to create ‘zero per cent garbage city’ by the year end, the Corporation has proposed to establish dry waste incineration plant at a cost of ₹ 1.60 crore at Vairapalayam to convert it into fly ash.

About 250 tonnes of municipal solid waste is generated in the city that was earlier dumped at compost yards at Vendipalayam and Vairapalayam.

After the city was selected under the Smart City Mission, the civic body planned to make it free of garbage and started removing dustbins in public places and improved door-to-door garbage collection. Also, it had established 19 micro compost centres at ₹ 13.58 crore while the legacy waste at the two yards were bio-mined at ₹ 37.25 crore.

Under Phase II, the civic body proposed more micro compost centres at ₹ 5.56 crore so that the municipal waste generated in each area was processed at the centres and the fertilizers distributed to the people free of cost.

As part of effective solid waste management, the civic body has proposed to establish the plant with 25 tonne capacity a day where dry waste will be burnt at 1,000 degrees Celsius. The process produces pure carbon ash, which is not harmful to environment, and the end product can be used in manufacturing bricks and making construction materials.

Corporation Commissioner M. Elangovan told The Hindu about 40% of the total garbage generated in the city every day was dry waste and the process of converting the waste into carbon was also environment friendly.

He said that tender had been floated and the successful bidder should design, build and operate the plant for three years and transfer the plant to the Corporation.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/33rmkb/article31011796.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA08GARBAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/civic-body-to-establish-dry-waste-incineration-plant-at-160-crore/article31011797.ece

251,2020/03/08,Reardon’s knock in vain,"Nathan Reardon’s bold batting took him within four short of a century before Sri Lanka captain Tillakaratne Dilshan snared him as the islanders registered a thrilling seven-run win over Australia at the Unacademy Road Safety World Series at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday.

Tillakaratne had removed Mark Rosgrove and Travis Birt in one over, finishing with three wickets, after Chaminda Vaas struck off the third ball, forcing opener Michael Klinger to edge to slip.

Australia bounced back from 30 for five in the seventh over to come within sight of an unlikely victory, thanks to No. 6 Reardon (96 off 53 balls, 9x4, 5x6).

Earlier, Xavier Doherty had struck early for the Aussies, sending back Dilshan and Marvan Atapattu in the PowerPlay overs. Veteran Romesh Kaluwitharana, however, kept the scoreboard ticking with big shots. Monday is a rest day.

The scores: Sri Lanka 161/8 in 20 overs (Romesh Kaluwitharana 30, Chaamara Kapugedera 28, Xavier Doherty 2-28, Jason Krejza 2-37, Brad Hodge 2-18) bt Australia 154 in 19.5 overs (Nathan Reardon 96, Tillakaratne Dilshan 3-35, Rangana Herath 2-5, Farveez Maharoof 2-28).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/reardons-knock-in-vain/article31017108.ece
252,2020/03/08,"No mean achievement, says Shantha","Team needs to be applauded despite loss, says ex-skipper

Despite Sunday’s crushing loss, India’s run to the T20 World Cup final was “no mean achievement,” believes Shantha Rangaswamy, former India skipper and current member of the BCCI Apex Council.

“We have to give the team credit,” Shantha said. “To focus just on the defeat and not on the earlier wins is not fair. We should congratulate Harmanpreet Kaur and team.”

The failure of India’s premier batters Harmanpreet, Smriti Mandhana, Jemimah Rodrigues and Veda Krishnamurthy in the competition had made the team over-reliant on the teenaged Shafali Verma.

“The final was the first match Shafali didn’t click and you saw the collapse. Harman's form is causing concern. Jemimah is perhaps one of the best we have; an excellent fielder, great bat and a future captain. But it's time they justify the ‘senior’ tag.”

Shantha felt there was immense scope for Shafali to improve. “She is an exciting talent and we want her to play long-term. For that she needs to get fitter. She has brilliant hand-eye coordination like [Virender] Sehwag and [Kris] Srikkanth, but her fielding and running between the wickets are below par.”

However, despite the bitter after taste of defeat, Shantha was certain the tournament would have a positive effect.

“After the 2017 World Cup final (that India lost), the number of women taking up cricket tripled, even quadrupled. Broadening the base is our dire need, and, in that context, Harman and team have done well.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bt1zz0/article31016791.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09SHAF,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/no-mean-achievement-says-shantha/article31016792.ece
253,2020/03/08,Have full faith in my team: Harmapreet,"Rues dropped chances, says have to work on fielding

India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur said on Sunday she had full faith in her team to do well in future after Australia outclassed her side by 85 runs in the summit clash of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup here.

Unbeaten throughout the tournament, India was outplayed in all departments of the game. “The way we played in the league games was outstanding. I still have a lot of faith in my team,” Harmanpreet said after the match.

“It’s part of the game, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. You have to keep learning. But I trust this team,” she said.

Harmanpreet, however, rued the dropped chances of Beth Mooney and Alyssa Healy, who set up their team’s victory. She said the team needs to work on its fielding and learn from the mistakes.

“Today, it was unfortunate that we dropped those catches. The upcoming one-and-a-half years is very important. We need to focus, especially in fielding,” she said.

The skipper reckoned her side needed to learn how to win high-stakes clashes. “If we talk about the last T20 World Cup, we got to the semis, and this time to the final. I think we’re on the right path. Every year we are improving. We just need to think of how we play with focus in the main games. Sometimes we don’t manage that,” she said.

She spoke highly of the domestic IPL style Women’s Challenger tournament, saying the event had helped spot talented players for the national team.

“This year we are hoping for some more games in the Women’s Challenger. That tournament is very important for us because it is high quality. From there we already got two good players, and hopefully we can get more.”

Wonderful group

Australia captain Meg Lanning was delighted by her team’s performance throughout the tournament.

“I’m just really proud of this group of players and staff. We’ve had everything thrown at us — ups and downs. It was tough, definitely, especially after we lost that first game. There was a lot of expectation on us, inside and out. Definitely some tough times in there but we stuck with each other, had each other’s backs,” she said.

Australia was dealt major blows when star all-rounder Ellyse Perry and pacer Tayla Vlaeminck were ruled out and Lanning said the duo’s absence affected team plans.

“Coming in they (the injured players) were a big part of our plans, we had to go to Plan B and C.”

Talking about the record turnout at the MCG, the most in a women’s cricket match, she said, “It has been massive, 86,000 people at the MCG, I’ve never seen it before and didn’t think I’d be part of it in the middle.”

Player-of-the-Tournament Beth Mooney said her team was aware of the shortcomings from the group stage loss against India and worked on executing plans properly.

Lost for words

“I’m a bit lost for words. It has been an unbelievable tournament. The crowds have been great throughout the tournament,” Mooney said.

“Didn’t really do anything differently. We had some plans we didn’t execute in that first game. I think we stuck to our processes. We sort of knew what went wrong against India in the first game and we worked on our plans accordingly,” she added.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/eora6n/article31016780.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09INDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/have-full-faith-in-my-team-harmapreet/article31016781.ece
254,2020/03/08,Kumble factor swayed Rhodes,"Former South African great opens up on new job with Kings XI

The next couple of months are going to be exciting for Jonty Rhodes. After a long hiatus, the former South Africa cricketer will be returning to the IPL as Kings XI Punjab’s fielding coach and he is looking forward to working with head coach Anil Kumble.

Having played in the same era, Rhodes admires Kumble’s coaching style. “I did not approach Kings XI Punjab, I got a call from them. But I took up the offer because of Kumble,” Rhodes told Sportstar. In the city for the UnAcademy Road Safety World Series — where he is leading South Africa Legends — Rhodes admitted that Kumble’s idea about the game is incredible.

Thinking man’s cricketer

“I really like the way Kumble works. He is a thinking man’s cricketer.

“He is someone who has played top-level cricket, but has a real brain around, away from cricket too. And I think you need that. If you’re going to be head coach or mentoring a team, you got to be more than just a cricketer,” Rhodes said.

This season, Kings XI will be led by India international K.L. Rahul and Rhodes rates him quite highly.

“I love watching Rahul. He has been playing some superb limited overs cricket. His stats in white ball cricket have been really good because he plays good cricket shots. He maximises the PowerPlay,” the 50-year-old Rhodes said.

Rhodes wants to groom young talent from Punjab.

“All this while, I’ve been really focusing on grassroots and development cricket. So I am hoping that by the time my time is up with Kings XI, I can be adding more than just to the IPL franchise. I want to make sure that we’re growing the game in the area too, so that you get young local players, and future stars for Kings XI,” Rhodes said.

“So when I leave after two-three years, I want to make sure that I’ve left the game in a better position than I found it.

“ I’m sure winning trophies is important, but growing the game in that area is something I’ve been excited about.”

Last year, Rhodes had applied for the position of India’s fielding coach. But R. Sridhar was retained in his position for another term.

Asked whether he would want to coach any international team, Rhodes said that there are no such plans.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/34x69a/article31016542.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09JONTY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kumble-factor-swayed-rhodes/article31016543.ece
255,2020/03/08,"Despite the final stumble, a campaign to be proud of","Teenaged talent came to the fore even as senior batters disappointed

The G was abuzz with a record turnout. While the Australian women saved their best for the last, their Indian counterparts wilted under big match pressure at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday.

Despite the disappointing loss, captain Harmanpreet Kaur, head coach W.V. Raman and the touring entourage have every reason to hold their heads high after a highly successful campaign. No doubt the final was lopsided, the loss should not take away anything from the Indian girls who exceeded expectations.

For starters, India was clubbed in the ‘group of death’, with Australia and New Zealand fancied to progress to the semifinals from its pool. To add to its woes, two of its seniormost batters — Harmanpreet and the stylish Smriti Mandhana — never got going. Still, to maintain a clean slate and top the group was creditable.

With the two seniors struggling for big runs, three teenaged prodigies — Shafali Verma, Jemimah Rodrigues and Richa Ghosh — came to the fore consistently, with allrounder Deepti Sharma and finisher Veda Krishnamurthy making vital contributions in the latter half.

Shikha and Poonam shine

While Deepti was consistent with her off-breaks as well, the bowling burden was shouldered by the experienced duo of Shikha Pandey and Poonam Yadav. While Poonam bamboozled opposition batters with her combination of leg-breaks and googlies, pacer Shikha was at her best with the new ball and also in the death overs and played the silent contributor’s role to perfection.

They may have to failed to cross the hurdle again in a World Cup summit clash, after the 2017 50-over event in England, but the Indian women have proven in the last three weeks that Indian cricket has a bright future beyond the Men in Blue.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/yxba89/article31016396.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09DEEPTI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/despite-the-final-stumble-a-campaign-to-be-proud-of/article31016397.ece
256,2020/03/08,Everyone has the X-factor: Saha,"The wicketkeeper finds a rare spark in the Bengal team

Wriddhiman Saha, whose first Ranji Trophy match of the season will be the title clash, is impressed with Bengal’s team work.

Saha, who was part of the Indian side for the two-match Test series in New Zealand, joined the Bengal side early on Sunday after welcoming his second child in Kolkata. Ahead of the final against Saurashtra here, he found a rare spark in his state team.

“Earlier, Bengal reached the knockouts on the basis of performance of a few players. For example, Ashoke Dinda used to take wickets without much support from the other end.

“Now, everyone is contributing. The bowlers are also contributing with the bat. Match-winning performances have come in batting too. There is good camaraderie,” said Saha.

Asked who had the X-factor in the present Bengal side, which reached the summit clash after 13 years, Saha said, “Everyone has the X-factor.”

Saha, who played his last competitive match, a three-day warm-up game in Hamilton in mid-February, looked forward to the final.

“First time I am getting to play the final and it doesn’t happen regularly. In our team only Manoj (Tiwary) has played it. Really excited and team is doing well in all departments. Shami and I were tracking the team’s performance from New Zealand.”

On switching between international and domestic matches, the wicketkeeper-batsman — who has played 116 First Class matches — said: “Ultimately, you need to follow the ball. I have been playing for a while, so I have gotten used to it. Whether it is keeping or batting, I just follow the ball.

“Every match is important, not only the Ranji Trophy or an international. Even in club matches, my intensity is the same. It is a special occasion as it is the final, but we will approach it like we approach any other match.”

On tackling his India teammate Cheteshwar Pujara, who will sport Saurashtra colours in the final, Saha said, “Whoever fights till the end, will win. They (Bengal teammates) watch international matches. They know how to get Pujara out.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/everyone-has-the-x-factor-saha/article31016124.ece
257,2020/03/08,"Women’s T20 World Cup final | We can’t blame Shafali for defeat, says India captain Harmanpreet Kaur","Australia captain Meg Lanning was delighted by her team’s performance throughout the tournament.

India captain Harmanpreet Kaur on Sunday backed beleaguered 16-year-old Shafali Verma after her dropped catch of Alyssa Healy cost India dear in the Women’s T20 World Cup final against Australia here on Sunday.

Shafali dropped Healy in the first over when the Australian opener was on nine. Healy went on to smash a 39-ball 75 and, along with Beth Mooney (78 not out off 54), added 115 runs for the opening wicket to power Australia to 184 for 4.

In reply, India were bowled out for 99 to hand the hosts a 85-run win and an unprecedented fifth world title in the shortest format.

“She (Verma) is only 16, she’s playing her first World Cup. She did really, really well and performed for us. For a 16-year-old kid, it’s difficult to keep thinking positively and stay in the game,” said Kaur.

“It’s a learning lesson for her but it could happen to anyone. We can’t blame her because there were others also in her position.”

Left-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad also wasted a caught and bowled chance of Mooney early in the Australian innings, and Kaur rued the two dropped catches.

“We gave chances to batters in great form and it’s difficult for bowlers to come back when that happens,” she said.

Not overwhelmed by occasion

Kaur denied that her side were overwhelmed by the occasion as they were playing in their maiden final in front of a record 86,174 spectators at the iconic MCG, the most in a women’s cricket match.

“We weren’t feeling under pressure but unfortunately we were unable to create those chances. It’s a lesson for all of us, we have to be at 100% when we’re fielding because that’s the most important part of cricket.”

India came into the tournament with one of its youngest squads, and became the first team to field more than one teenager in the tournament’s final. There were plenty of new faces since their 2017 World Cup defeat to England.

On that occasion, just nine runs separated India from the title. The lack of clinical cricket this time around has made defeat slightly easier to swallow for the skipper.

“I guess 2017 was more disappointing, because that was so close,” Kaur said.

“We didn’t play the cricket we expected of ourselves this time. As our team is quite young, we did really well in the league games. We reached the final this year. If we keep working and improving, maybe in the future we can win.”

The setback will serve as a learning experience, according to the India captain.

“We didn’t field well, we need to learn from today’s performance. When you are playing a great level of cricket, you cannot drop the chances and we were not up to the mark.

“We will take this seriously and when we come to play next time, we will be one of the best fielding sides.”

She spoke highly of the domestic IPL style Women’s Challenger tournament, saying that the event has helped spot talented players for the national team.

“This year we are hoping for some more games in the Women’s Challenger, that tournament is very important for us because it is of high quality. From there we already got two good players, and hopefully in the upcoming tournaments we can get more.”

258,2020/03/08,Title clash promises some exciting action,"Pujara and Saha’s availability gives strength to Saurashtra and Bengal, which have thrived on different brands of team work

Will Bengal lift the Ranji Trophy after 30 years or will Saurashtra be fourth-time lucky?

Irrespective of the outcome, the title clash of the 94th edition of the country’s premier tournament, beginning at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium here on Monday, between two exceptional sides — which have thrived on different brands of team work — promises some exciting action during the festival of colours.

The availability of Wriddhiman Saha and Cheteshwar Pujara gives strength to Bengal and Saurashtra respectively.

Wicketkeeper Saha, who will replace Shreevats Goswami to play his first match of the season, will aid Bengal in batting too.

Gharami for Raman?

Bengal, which has experienced several top-order collapses, may take a calculated risk by fielding uncapped left-handed opener Sudip Gharami in place of a shaky Abhishek Raman.

Interestingly, Bengal had witnessed the debut of Sourav Ganguly in its last title win in 1989-90.

The experienced Sudip Chatterjee and Manoj Tiwary (playing his 100th Ranji match) and the dependable duo of Anustup Majumdar and Shahbaz Ahmed will look forward to shoulder the responsibility in batting.

Captain Abhimanyu Easwaran, going through a lean patch, will hope to get back his touch.

Superb pace trio

Bengal has a superb pace trio — Ishan Porel, Mukesh Kumar and Akash Deep. Its spin all-rounders — Shahbaz and Arnab Nandi — give the side balance and variety.

Coach Arun Lal sounded philosophical ahead of the final.

“It’s more enjoyable to win it as a coach. It’s like guiding your son to achieve something. It has been a fabulous journey, we need to do what we have been doing,” said Arun Lal.

Home conditions

Saurashtra, boosted by Pujara, will savour the home conditions in its second consecutive summit clash. Experienced campaigners such as Pujara, Arpit Vasavada, Sheldon Jackson and Chirag Jani will hold the key in batting.

The pitch, topped with a thin layer of grass, may favour the batsmen in hot and dry weather. Time will tell how it helps the bowlers.

Captain and bowling trump-card Jaydev Unadkat, who has won several matches, wants to make his personal achievement of being the highest wicket-taker — 65 this season — more memorable. However, the next successful Saurashtra bowler, Dharmendrasinh Jadeja, has aggregated 29 wickets.

“If we play to our strength, we can beat any team,” said Unadkat.

Saurashtra has reached four finals in seven years. It will try to bring the Ranji Trophy, named in the honour of Ranjitsinhji of Jamnagar, to its spiritual home.

The teams (from):

Saurashtra: Jaydev Unadkat (Capt.), Cheteshwar Pujara, Sheldon Jackson, Kamlesh Makwana, Arpit Vasavada, Chirag Jani, Dharmendrasinh Jadeja, Harvik Desai, Snell Patel (wk), Kishan Parmar, Avi Barot (wk), Prerak Mankad, Samarth Vyas, Vishwaraj Jadeja, Kushang Patel, Chetan Sakariya and Parth Bhut.

259,2020/03/08,Hardik Pandya makes an expected return to ODI squad,"So do Dhawan and Bhuvneshwar; Gill in for Jadhav

India’s captain and head coach may have tried to downplay the whitewash in New Zealand by stating ODIs aren’t a priority in a T20 World Cup year but Sunil Joshi — in his ﬁrst meeting as selection committee chief — hinted at the selectors building a team for the 2023 World Cup.

Hardik Pandya, Shikhar Dhawan and Bhuvneshwar Kumar — who have regained ﬁtness after being out due to injuries — expectedly returned to the fold for the three ODIs against South Africa. The trio, which excelled for Reliance 1 during the recently-concluded DY Patil T20 tournament in Navi Mumbai, replaced Shivam Dube, Shardul Thakur and Mayank Agarwal from the squad that went to New Zealand.

Also read: Hardik, Bhuvi and Dhawan set for comeback

Hardik has been in swashbuckling form with the willow — he scored two hundreds, including a 158-run blitzkrieg that included 20 sixes and also picked a ﬁvewicket haul — while Dhawan and Bhuvneshwar were put through their paces to prove match-ﬁtness.

But the ﬁrst meeting of the re-jigged selection panel, held in Ahmedabad on Sunday before the selectors headed to Rajkot to watch the Ranji Trophy ﬁnal, preferred to include promising

youngster Shubman Gill in place of middle-order batsman Kedar Jadhav, thus indicating the planning for the future has begun. While Jadhav — who will turn 35 later this month — had been persisted with after the last World Cup, Joshi and Co. opted for Gill. It would be interesting to see if Gill, who featured in a couple of ODIs early last year in New Zealand, gets some gametime against South Africa. Despite the BCCI not elaborating on the changes in the squad, it is understood that pacer Mohammed Shami has been rested as part of the workload management regime.

260,2020/03/08,ICC launches campaign to promote women’s cricket,"“It will challenge perceptions, build heroes and create excitement as we head into the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2021 in New Zealand,” an ICC media release said

The International Cricket Council on Sunday launched a 12-month campaign dedicated to the promotion of women’s cricket to build on the momentum of the ongoing T20 World Cup here.

The campaign titled “100% Cricket” will showcase the skill, athletic brilliance, passion and intensity of the players and bring everything fans love about the sport to life.

“It will challenge perceptions, build heroes and create excitement as we head into the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2021 in New Zealand,” an ICC media release said.

The campaign, launched on the occasion of the International Women’s Day ahead of the T20 World Cup final at the MCG, demonstrates the ambition of the entire sport to accelerate the growth of the women’s game and capitalise on the record-breaking momentum that has been created over the last two weeks.

“I believe that we are at an inflection point for the women’s game. In the last three years we have made significant strides in our efforts to grow and develop the game and have publicly stated our long-term commitment to reach parity across cricket,” ICC Chief Executive, Manu Sawhney said.

“We want to build a long-term sustainable foundation for women’s cricket and build a product that fans want to watch, that kids want to take up, that sponsors and broadcasters want to be part of,” he added.

Mr. Sawhney said that the campaign will drive the conversation around women’s cricket between the ongoing T20 World Cup and the ODI World Cup in New Zealand next year.

“We are also challenging everyone to get involved and make their own pledge to support 100% Cricket and #IDeclare the action they will take to drive the growth of the women’s game,” he said.

“As part of this, on behalf of the ICC #IDeclare that we will work with Members with the ambition of bringing 1million new women and girls to the game in next 12 months.”

The ICC’s pledge to bring one million new women and girls to the game as part of ‘100% Cricket’ will be delivered through a range of initiatives including, a new school and community group participation program, an accelerated growth programme delivered to targeted members, support to member programmes focused on growing the game and development programmes targeting women and girls.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/18kvgj/article31014520.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WOMENSCRICKET,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/icc-launches-campaign-to-promote-womens-cricket/article31014486.ece
261,2020/03/08,ICC Women’s T20 World Cup | Australia outclass India by 85 runs in final,"In front of a massive turnout at MCG on Women's Day, Australia put up a total of 184; India crumbled to 99 all out

India saved their worst for the last as a brutal Australian side outclassed them by 85 runs for an unprecedented fifth T20 World Cup triumph in a final that promised much but delivered very little here Sunday.

Batting first after the coin landed in Meg Lanning’s favour, Australia came out in scintillating fashion with their openers Alyssa Healy (75 off 39 balls) and Beth Mooney (78 off 54 balls) laying the foundation with a 115-run partnership in double quick time.

Stirred up by the grand occasion, their onslaught fired Australia to a formidable 184 for four in the stipulated 20 overs.

Overwhelmed by the occasion, India crumbled to 99 all out in front of a big crowd at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground.

What worked in the home team’s favour was that their openers easily neutralised the threat posed by the in-form spinner Poonam Yadav (1/30 in 4 overs) with percentage game while taking the likes of medium-pacer Shikha Pandey and Deepti Sharma to the cleaners.

On the day, Pandey was smashed for 52 runs in her four overs.

Half the battle was won there for the formidable Australians, who, in stark contrast to the India, saved their best for the last.

The manner and magnitude of the defeat, including a few sub plots, were reminiscent of the 2003 men’s World Cup final when Ricky Ponting’s Australia thrashed Sourav Ganguly’s India in an anti-climactic title clash.

Like Zaheer Khan in his opening over at the Wanderers against Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden, Deepti Sharma was all nerves when up against Mooney and Healy, who blasted massive sixes as the beaming husband Mitchell Starc watched from the stands.

The match was as good as over when India were 18/3 in the fourth over, which became four for 4/30 when skipper Harmanpreet Kaur departed and 58/5 when Veda Krishnamurthy was taking the long walk back.

Earlier, Mooney and Healy rode on dropped chances to smash blistering fifties and power Australia to a challenging 184 for four.

Mooney top-scored for Australia but it was Healy, who took to the attack after being dropped in the fifth ball of the innings by Shafali Verma off Deepti Sharma.

Healy’s 39-balls innings was laced with seven fours and five hits over the fence.

Healy and Mooney shared 115 runs in 11.5 overs for the opening wicket to give Australia a flying start after opting to bat first.

Just like Healy, Mooney too cashed in on a dropped chance -- caught and bowled opportunity by Rajeshwari Gayakwad in the fourth over -- to punish India by reaching her fifty in 41 balls.

Mooney struck 10 boundaries in her 54-ball unconquered knock.

Despite losing to India in the tournament opener, defending champions and four-time winners, Australia entered the final as favourites because of their big match temperament and experience.

And the Meg Lanning-led side proved their billing as Healy tore apart the hapless Indian attack with her power-hitting from ball one.

Healy’s entertaining knock finally came to an end in 12th over when she was holed out at the long-on boundary by Veda Krishnamurthy off left-arm spinner Radha Yadav.

After Healy’s dismissal, Mooney took charge and added 39 runs with skipper Lanning before Deepti’s double strike in the 17th over pulled things back for India to some extent.

While Lanning (6) was caught by Shikha Pandey in the second ball, Ashleigh Gardner was stumped by Taniya Bhatia three balls later.

Rachael Haynes (4) too failed to deliver as she played on a Poonam Yadav delivery in the 19th over.

But Mooney took up the responsibility and remained unbeaten in the company of Nicola Carey (5 not out) to take Australia close to the 190-run mark.

The Indian slow bowlers -- Deepti (2/38), Radha Yadav (1/34) and Poonam Yadav (1/30) did well to restrict Australia under 200, which looked easily achievable when Mooney and Healy were going great guns

Brief Scores:

Australia: 184 for 4 in 20 overs (Beth Mooney 78 not out, Alyssa Healy 75; Deepti Sharma 2/38)

India: 99 all out in 19.1 overs (Deepti Sharma 33, Veda Krishnamurthy 19; Megan Schutt 3/18.)

262,2020/03/08,Ranji Trophy final | Saurashtra poised for Ranji glory at home,"While Bengal bulldozed over the mighty Karnataka in the semifinals, Saurashtra edged out Gujarat in a see-saw contest.

Saurashtra, led by inspirational Jaydev Unadkat, will back themselves to win an elusive Ranji Trophy title at home but a buoyant Bengal will be no pushovers in what promises to be an absorbing final beginning in Rajkot on Monday.

Both the teams are desperate to go all the way with Saurashtra reaching their fourth final in eight seasons while Bengal has not tasted success in the premier domestic event since the 1989-90 triumph.

While Bengal bulldozed over the mighty Karnataka in the semifinals, Saurashtra edged out Gujarat in a see-saw contest at the SCA Stadium, which is also the venue for the final.

There will also be star power on display with Test regulars Cheteshwar Pujara and Wriddhiman Saha joining the Saurashtra and Bengal squads respectively, having returned from New Zealand.

In fact, Pujara was very much Saurasthra’s 12th man with Unadkat being in constant touch with his senior teammate during the hard-fought semifinal. Now his physical presence in the all-important game will be a big boost to the side.

Saurashtra would not have ended up on the right side of the result against Gujarat if it wasn’t for Unadkat, who has had a sensational run this season with 65 wickets at an average of 12.17 and is three shy of the all-time record of 68 scalps, set by Bihar spinner Ashutosh Aman last season.

Also read: Ranji Trophy semifinal | From being a non-entity, Mukesh Kumar rises as hero of Bengal

The left-arm pacer single-handedly led his team on day five earlier this week with a seven-wicket haul on a flat surface, including the scalps of a set Parthiv Patel and Chiragh Gandhi, who had brought Gujarat back in the game from a hopeless 63 for five while chasing 327.

Unadkat’s stellar performances over the course of the season has put him back in national reckoning but in his own words, they would count for little if the team doesn’t go all the way.

Not just with the ball, he also inspired with his captaincy and one example of that was when he promoted number 11 Chetan Sakariya, who shared a crucial 90-run stand with Arpit Vasavada (139) after the hosts collapsed to 15 for five.

The skipper is leading from the front but will expect more from his fellow pacers who have not done much to write about this season.

Besides Pujara, the team’s leading run-getter Sheldon Jackson will be expected to shoulder the batting responsibilities.

Saurashtra will be wary of Bengal’s potent pace attack which fashioned their comprehensive win over eight-time champions Karnataka.

Also read: Arun Lal — the man behind Bengal’s march

The pace trio of Ishan Porel, Mukesh Kumar and Akash Deep were on fire in the semifinal and has contributed significantly to the team’s overall success.

Left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed has come of age this season and is the team’s joint highest wicket-taker with 30 scalps alongside Kumar and Akash Deep.

The onus in the batting department lies on veteran Manoj Tiwary, who has been the team’s leading run-getter with 672 runs from 10 games but has not fired after his couple of match-winning half-centuries on a challenging track in Patiala.

The role of head coach Arun Lal also cannot be overlooked in Bengal’s first final appearance after 13 years.

263,2020/03/08,"Australia has the edge, India the momentum","It will be the defending champion’s sixth successive final while the Women in Blue haven’t lost a game in this edition

India Women will have to overcome big-match pressure as it aims to exorcise the ghosts of the past in the T20 World Cup final against Australia in front of a record crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground here on Sunday.

Group topper

India goes into the final unbeaten after topping the group stage where it beat four-time champion Australia in the tournament-opener. After the semifinal against England was washed out, the Harmanpreet Kaur-led squad advanced to its maiden summit clash, having finished first in Group A.The refreshing firepower of 16-year-old Shafali Verma at the top and consistency of India’s spin-heavy bowling attack has contributed massively to the team’s success so far.

Also read: Eight-day break playing on Harmanpreet’s mind ahead of final

However, much more is needed from star batters Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet if India is to win its maiden ICC trophy. The brittle middle-order too needs to deliver. And besides doing the right things on the field, India will also have to win the battle of nerves.

Australia, having beaten India in the preceding tri-series final, finds itself in familiar territory having made its sixth successive final in seven editions.

Also read : ICC Women’s T20 World Cup final | Don’t want to bowl to Verma, Mandhana during powerplay, says Schutt

The Australians know how to win the big moments in high-pressure games, while the Indians have been found wanting on that front. India capitulated to England in the 2017 ODI World Cup final and 2018 World T20 semifinal.

India will expect Shafali to provide another flying start and hope this time the experienced Smriti also fires. There can’t be a bigger stage for Harmanpreet to be back amongst the runs and lead the team from the front.

If it was not for Shafali, India would have struggled to post competitive totals with the middle and lower-order doing precious little. The team did not cross the 150-run mark in the group stage but still managed to get over the line, thanks to a disciplined bowling effort.

Leggie Poonam Yadav has made a sensational comeback from a finger injury and is the tournament’s leading wicket-taker with nine alongside Australia pacer Megan Schutt.

Pacer Shikha Pandey, too, has been impressive, while the left-arm spin duo of Radha Yadav and Rajeshwari Gayakwad has kept things tight. It will be interesting to see how the Australians play Poonam on Sunday as the leggie was all over them in the opener.

Massive crowd

More than 75,000 tickets have already been sold for the final and the figure could go as high as 90,000 — unprecedented in women’s cricket.

Australia, led by Meg Lanning, will be backing itself to win in front of the home fans, though a sizeable number of Indian fans too is expected at the MCG.

Lead men’s team pacer Mitchell Starc will also be in attendance, rooting for the home team and his wife Alyssa Healy after getting clearance to leave in the middle of the South Africa tour.

Australia’s campaign has been hit by injuries to pacer Tayla Vlaeminck at the start and star all-rounder Elysse Perry was ruled out of the remainder of the tournament before the semifinal against South Africa.

Despite the twin setbacks, Australia has stormed to yet another title clash.

Attitude

“We’re not coming just to put on a good show. We’re coming here to win and that’s the attitude we’re going in with. It’s been a long time coming and the build-up to the game is something I’ve not experienced before. It will be the biggest moment of my career,” said Lanning.

The teams (from): Australia: Rachael Haynes, Megan Schutt, Alyssa Healy, Meg Lanning (Capt.), Ellyse Perry, Jess Jonassen, Delissa Kimmince, Beth Mooney, Nicola Carey, Ashleigh Gardner, Sophie Molineux, Georgia Wareham, Erin Burns, Molly Strano and Annabel Sutherland.

India: Harmanpreet Kaur (Capt.), Smriti Mandhana, Shikha Pandey, Poonam Yadav, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Veda Krishnamurthy, Deepti Sharma, Jemimah Rodrigues, Pooja Vastrakar, Taniya Bhatia, Radha Yadav, Harleen Deol, Arundhati Reddy, Shafali Verma and Richa Ghosh.

264,2020/03/08,"COVID-19: healthy people need not wear masks, says Delhi CM Kejriwal","Masks and hand sanitisers only give a false sense of security. There is no substitute for frequent handwashing, he says

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that healthy people in the Capital need not wear a mask to protect themselves from COVID-19.

People tended to constantly adjust their masks and touch their face, thereby increasing the risk of infection in case they had already touched contaminated things.

Frequent washing of hands with soap and water was the best preventive measure against COVID-19. “Masks and hand sanitisers only give a false sense of security. There is no substitute for frequent handwashing,” he said.

Those showing symptoms, however, should wear masks so that they did not cough and pass on the infection. The Chief Minister was addressing a press conference after a meeting of a State Task Force headed by him on COVID-19. The task force also said that there was a craze to buy N95 masks but it was not required. “There is an unnecessary rush to buy masks and hand sanitisers in the city. People need to report cases of people who have returned from abroad and are showing any symptoms and work together to fight COVID-19,” he said.

265,2020/03/08,Court extends Shahrukh Pathan’s police custody by 3 days,"He had pointed a gun at a policeman

A court here on Saturday allowed the police three more days’ custodial interrogation of Shahrukh Pathan, who allegedly pointed a gun at a head constable during the recent communal violence in north-east Delhi.

Duty Magistrate Vijay Shri Rathore extended Pathan’s police custody after he was produced before the judge at the end of his four-day remand period amidst high security late in the evening, a lawyer associated with the case said.

Pathan, 23, whose picture showing him pointing a gun at unarmed Delhi Police head constable Deepak Dahia during the riots went viral on social media, was arrested on Tuesday from Uttar Pradesh’s Shamli district.

The police have registered a case against him under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Arms Act. His four-day police custody ended on Saturday, officials said.

On Friday, the pistol was recovered from his house.

266,2020/03/08,‘Constitutional values are tested in the courts’: Excerpts from Justice S. Muralidhar’s farewell speech,"In front of a huge gathering, including judges and lawyers, Justice S. Muralidhar recounted the pivotal moments in his 14-year stint on the Delhi High Court Bench

Justice S. Muralidhar was transferred from the Delhi High Court to the Punjab and Haryana High Court in a midnight order following two crucial orders related to the Delhi riots.

Excerpts from his farewell speech delivered in the Delhi High Court building on March 5:

The Chief Justice, my colleagues, and all present here. I had first written out a speech thanking those who made it possible for me to be where I am. That ran into six typed pages. Some of them are here, some elsewhere. They include Amma, my sister and my niece, sisters-in-law, brothers-in-law, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, cousins and numerous other relatives and friends and above all, Usha, all of whom have been incredibly close and supportive.

To each of them I wish to say I am deeply grateful for the various ways they have enriched my life and helped me navigate it. Among those who are not with us and whose lasting influence in my life I gratefully acknowledge are my father Srinivasan, my uncle Viswanaathan, my mother-in-law Indira Ramanathan. In May 1987, Mr. G. Ramaswamy (GR), who was then the ASG of India in the Supreme Court took me on as his junior and I moved from Chennai to Delhi. The two-year stint with him was an incredible period of learning. His razor-sharp mind, ready wit and humour, remarkable advocacy skills and solid grounding in the basics of all branches of law helped me learn about the law and the Court.

I am eternally grateful for that and, not a day passes without recalling him.

Professor Lotika Sarkar, whom we all called Ma'am. Usha and I were fortunate that Ma'am spent the last four years of her life with us. She was the epitome of an ethical life and continues to be a huge inspiration.

Shortly before the lunch recess on February 17, 2020, the Chief Justice of India's letter dated February 14, 2020, communicating the transfer proposal was delivered to me in my chamber.

In the early hours of that day, our pet Labrador Sakhi, literally a companion to the entire family who gave unconditional warmth and joy for over 11 years, breathed her last.

The reason Sakhi came into our lives was Ma'am. Sakhi remained till the last a strong sagely and pure presence. I can confidently claim to be very close to many of the judges here on the dais. There are judges in the audience and elsewhere in Delhi and India who have helped me in various ways in traversing the difficult path of judgeship. It is only paucity of time that prevents me from naming them. I am grateful to each of them.

Every Judge of this Court has a mini establishment of over a dozen persons without whom no work can get done. The back up support is by over 1,200 employees of this Court. If I have been able to function effectively as a Judge of this Court, it is because of these people.

Over the years, I have realised that it is not enough for lawyers and judges to speak about constitutional values. It is essential to imbibe them. The constitutional values of equality, non-discrimination, dignity, prohibition of untouchability, inclusivity, and plurality have to be practiced continuously at both a personal and professional level.

Some random thoughts: The act of judging takes place in a space that is both mediative and meditative. The former is in acknowledgement of the primary function of judging: dispute resolution. The latter, i.e., the meditative space in constitutional court adjudication has, at least for me, two guiding principles. The Gandhian talisman of the weakest person and Ambedkar's adoption of Grote's constitutional morality. If in this meditative judicial space, I allow my judicial instinct to be so guided, the result, I believe, would answer the constitutional vision of justice. In this vision, Courts are not merely places where law is practised and produced. They are also spaces where the constitutional values are tested.

I don't subscribe to the view that Judges perform a divine function. To me, jettisoning the prefix Lordship and even 'Hon'ble' is not a fetish. It is an acknowledgment of how mortal, temporal, and, if I may venture to add, fallible we are.

There is a distinction between neutrality and impartiality. They are not antithetical. Impartiality is non-compromisable for a judge. It is an essential attribute. On neutrality, the Constitution, in my view, requires the judge at all levels to be able to discern the weak from the strong litigant in terms of their capacities to access justice and lean on the side of the vulnerable in order to attempt to achieve equality of arms.

Not an easy task

Judging is, without question, not an easy task. It involves a daily onslaught of negative emotions brought to the court by anxious, and often frustrated, litigants seeking justice.

It is possible that many of the physical ailments of judges are on account of having to withstand the negative energies. Maintaining equanimity and calm through the day, case after case, is indeed a big challenge.

Judging can be enlightening. It demands that you delve deep into the minds and lives of people across a wide cross-section of society, sometimes very different from your own. It can also be deeply humbling. Someone asked me not long ago, after nearly 14 years on the Bench, ""things must be much clearer, in black and white?"" I found I could not agree. The colour that the judge of many years best identifies with is Grey. I am often asked, ""are judges under pressure?"" My answer to that is: Not unless they acknowledge it.

How different is the Court since I joined the Bench 14 years ago? The Bench strength has not particularly increased. It crossed 40 briefly on one or two occasions. We'll be down to 33 in a few days. Pendency has inevitably increased. The buildings have expanded. Paperless Courts are an integral feature. No paper causelists. A state-of-the-art Block C where with the curtains lifted justice can be 'seen' to be done. A younger, vibrant and more diverse Bar. And an exciting variety of work which makes demands on the judges' mental agility. Work-wise, more attention is needed on scientific management of caseloads, of space, of litigant friendly procedures, and creative approaches to court architecture. There is much scope for enhancing transparency, accountability and access to justice. So too in the area of legal education and training.

What keeps me going as a judge? Those moments when I can bring to an end a two or three-decade old case, get an 80-year-old pensioner relief, long overdue retiral benefits to the legal representatives of a deceased bus conductor or wrongly dismissed CRPF jawan, reverse a wrong conviction or a wrong acquittal. The cry for justice is loud in every roster and in every court. What I felt every day as a Judge, and still feel, is that it never seems enough.

The most moving moment as a Judge was in this very Court sitting where I am today when on July 2 , 2009, Chief Justice A. P. Shah and I delivered our judgment in Naz Foundation.

Even as we held that consensual same sex between adults in private was not a crime, the relief that swept through the courtroom amongst those waiting to hear the verdict was palpable. Many broke down right here in front of us. At that moment, we knew that something irreversible had happened.

Now about my transfer and what exactly happened on February 26, 2020. There has been some confusion about what transpired, and I thought it should be cleared. What the five-member collegium sends to the Central Government is a recommendation that a Judge of a High Court should be transferred to another High Court. The Judge concerned is not at this stage under orders of transfer. That happens only when the recommendation of the collegium fructifies into a notification.

In my case, the collegium's decision was communicated to me by the CJI on February 17 by a letter which sought my response. I acknowledged receipt of the letter. I was then asked to clarify what I meant. As I saw it, if I was going to be transferred from the Delhi High Court any way, I was fine with moving to the Punjab and Haryana High Court. I therefore clarified to the CJI that I did not object to the proposal. An explanation for my transfer reached the press via Maneesh Chhibber's article in The Print on February 20 quoting ""sources in the Supreme Court collegium"", confirming what had been indicated to me a couple of days earlier.

February, 26, 2020, was perhaps the longest working day of my life as a Judge of this Court. It began at 12.30 a.m. with a sitting at my residence with Justice Bhambani, under the orders of Justice Sistani, to deal with a PIL filed by Rahul Roy seeking safe passage for ambulances carrying the injured riot victims.

When I received a call at my residence from the lawyer for the petitioner, I first called Justice Sistani to ask what should be done, knowing that the Chief Justice was on leave.

Justice Sistani explained that he too was officially on leave the whole of February 26 and that I should take up the matter. This fact is stated in the order passed by the Bench after the hearing. Later that day, upon urgent mentioning, as the de facto CJ's Bench, Justice Talwant Singh and I took up another fresh PIL on the CJ's Board seeking registration of FIRs for hate speeches. After the orders passed on that day, the above two PILs remained on the CJ's Board.

The notification issued close to midnight of February 26 did two things. First, it transferred me to the Punjab and Haryana High Court. Second, it appointed me to a position from where I can never be transferred, or removed and in which I shall always be proud to remain. A former Judge of arguably the best High Court in the country.

On Saturday afternoon, inside the Idgah in Mustafabad, which has doubled up as the largest relief camp for families in riot-hit north-east Delhi, Haji Naim Malik, 47, made an announcement through a hand-held loudspeaker: “Those who have to go to Shiv Vihar for verification should assemble here. There is no need to worry. There is a vehicle and also police protection.”

Vikas Anand, a senior IAS officer, was heard telling a group of women to wait for the vehicle that had been arranged to take the displaced people to Shiv Vihar. Mr. Anand is one of the six IAS officers who have been leading the verification drive since Saturday morning in different areas of north-east Delhi.

The Delhi government has announced multiple compensations for people whose houses and shops were burnt, ransacked and looted in the communal violence in north-east Delhi. It has already distributed compensation of ₹2.96 crore, according to official figures till Saturday. But with hundreds of people still living in relief camps, the government is finding it difficult to check their locked houses, which is delaying the distribution of compensation.

Two-day drive

To speed up the process, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia announced on Friday a two-day verification drive, headed by six senior IAS officers. From Saturday morning, vehicles with a police constable have been taking people from various camps, including the one at Idgah, to their houses for the verification.

Once the vehicle carrying the survivors reaches the area, a Sub-Divisional Magistrate goes with the family to the property for verification. “Many were going back to the locality for the first time [after the riots]. This also helped us to show them that shops have reopened, people have started coming back. Now, they have more courage and confidence to return,” said SDM Pradeep Tayal, who was carrying out the verification drive in Shiv Vihar, one of the most affected areas.

The riot-hit families have to first fill up a form to claim compensation, which is followed by the verification.

“Many shops and houses are locked and hence not verified. We are bringing many people from the Idgah camp to their houses in the area. Today we opened and saw many buildings and did the assessment [of the damage]. This will speed up the process of giving compensation,” the SDM said.

“The forms were filled by officials at people’s houses, and also at help desks, relief camps and by NGOs and this led to duplication [of requests]. Now we are creating an authoritative database,” the official said.

Many requests pending

As Mohammad Ahsan, 40, joined a group at the Idgah to go to his ransacked rented house in Shiv Vihar, an official told him, “We are taking the owners of houses and shops today. We will take people who are living on rent tomorrow.”

Mr. Ahsan, a differently abled man, said he fled his house in gali no. 6 of phase 5 in Shiv Vihar where rioters were burning houses and he was scared to go back alone.

Officials said since morning more than 100 people from the camp were taken to the riot-affected areas for verification. But many requests are still pending.

At gali no. 14 in Shiv Vihar, Mumtaz Begum said the SDM was yet to come and verify her house. “The rioters have looted everything. They took out the TV and clothes and burned them outside the house. We need help.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/l60i2d/article30935728.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Delhi-riotsjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-govt-officials-accompany-riot-hit-people-to-their-houses-for-verification-of-losses/article31013457.ece
268,2020/03/08,"In Delhi, floating graveyards chart course of violence","The four major drains in north-east Delhi flow past areas that saw some of the most horrific violence during the recent riots

The four major drains that run through north-east Delhi flow past areas that were the worst hit by the riots that broke out in the last week of February.

The drains have turned into floating graveyards with nine bodies recovered so far.

Three of the drains meet at Gokulpuri, where earth-moving machines and cranes have been removing black muck from the drain.

They have mostly dredged up remains of gutted vehicles. The area saw heavy stone pelting, and several shops were burned during the violence that killed over 50 people.

Afrooz Malik and his brother — whose house was burned down during the riots — were at the site examining the burned vehicles in an attempt to spot the remains of their motorbike. “The insurance company will not reimburse us unless we find the chassis number,” said Afrooz as his brother sifted through the mangled remains of a bike that was recently removed from the drain.

Scores of such vehicles lie along the drain. Many of them are surrounded by ragpickers trying to find reusable material.

While these drains are typically cleaned prior to monsoon, an official of the Flood and Irrigation Department said that efforts had been intensified to dredge the drains to recover any more bodies.

On March 1, at least two bodies were recovered from the drain flowing from Khajoori Khas to this area, where garbage is removed from the water at a filtration facility and then sent through pipelines to a sewage treatment plant. “It was the day after the rains [February 29],” said Alok*, a shop owner in the area.

“When it rains, parts of the drain that are clogged become free and start moving,” he explained.

A total of five bodies were recovered from the drains after rain lashed the city — about a week after the riots began. The bodies were decomposed and were in an unrecognisable state, said employees of RML Hospital mortuary.

One of the bodies was identified as that of 20-year-old Aftab. “His body was burned. He had no hair on his head and his fingers were hanging by shreds of skin... his stomach was also bloated,” said his brother Mohammad Qadir.

The two bodies found in Gokulpuri were reportedly spotted stuck near the bund created right before the filtration plant. “The whole area was blocked off by the police, everyone was asked to remain indoors... the police were standing on the banks of the drain to block off the view,” said Alok.

“There is no way to tell where the bodies came from, whether it was Mustafabad, Khajoori Khas or Brijpuri,” said Ajau Kumar, a mechanic.

The drain flows from Khajoori Khas to Gokulpuri, and parts of Chand Bagh, where the body of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma was found. It also flows past Arun Modern School, which was burned down by a mob.

Hafiz* [who is he?] said that it was unlikely that any bodies had been dumped in the network of smaller drains inside the colonies. “There is too much garbage. The water barely moves. The bodies that have been found would have been dumped in the big drain directly,” he added.

Also Read The Delhi police were missing, Hindus and Muslims agree

Apart from the drain that flows from Karawal Nagar to Shiv Vihar (the worst-hit area during the riots), a third drain flows from Shiv Vihar towards Gokulpuri. “There is a kachha road that goes past this drain. That is where most of the bodies were dumped,” said Nadeem*, a resident of Mustafabad.

“In the middle of the night, when no one was seeing, the bodies were cut up and dumped,” he said, adding: “They [rioters] must have thrown them in because if they were left lying around on the streets it would have led to more riots.”

The fourth drain travels from the Uttar Pradesh to Gokulpuri where the three drains meet, and flows beside the metro line towards Seelampur and beyond. Along its course lie Kardam Puri, Maujpur, Babarpur and Jaffrabad, where violence had initially erupted.

Mohammed Shahnawaz, who has been arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder of Dilbar Singh Negi, an employee of a sweet shop in Shiv Vihar, has been running a cigarette and paan stall close to the sweet shop for the past few years.

“Bad elements of the area gather here and while away their time. Sometimes, they created nuisance which no one liked,” said a shopkeeper who did not wish to be identified. Many others The Hindu spoke to also shared the same sentiment.

Talking about the day violence broke out, a member of the family who owns the sweet shop — Anil Sweet Corner — on condition of anonymity, said that he himself shot videos when rioters were throwing stones.

Though he claimed he saw Shahnawaz also hurling stones, he said was not able to capture it on video.

‘Trapped for 45 minutes’

“Around 3 p.m., Muslims started throwing stones and eventually Hindus retaliated. My other family members and I who were at the shop managed to go to one of our shops on the street and went to the terrace. We were trapped there for about 45 minutes. I took multiple videos and photographs,” he said while showing them. In the videos, rioters wearing masks and holding sticks were seen throwing stones.

“When I started taking videos, Shahnawaz hid himself,” alleged the 25-year-old.

The police also said that during investigation, eyewitnesses had found him as the ‘main aggressor’. There was no mention of video evidence in the police statement. When asked about his previous criminal involvements, a senior police officer said that they were yet to ascertain the details.

Initially, the sweet shop owner’s family member said that they had helped Shahnawaz take refuge.

“When stone throwing had just begun and Hindus were targeting the Muslims, our men saved him and took him to a safe place opposite our shop. An hour later, he came and joined his side on the terrace,” he said.

The men said that they started looking and asking for Negi late evening on February 24 but did not think he could have been killed.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/videos-dont-show-it-but-we-saw-him-hurling-stones/article31012364.ece

A novel pilot project named ‘No bag day’ was introduced for the first time in Odisha on Saturday by Ganjam district administration to make studies for primary school students more fun.

Primary school students of around 452 schools of Ganjam district did not carry heavy bags or study materials to school on Saturday and they will repeat the same on every Saturday from now. ‘No bag day’ project has been introduced in selected primary and upper primary schools. It is an effort to reduce children’s stress as well as to encourage them to perform co-curricular activities in a creative and comfort zone.

In the first phase, the project was started in 20 primary and upper primary schools of each of 22 blocks of the district as well as a dozen schools in Berhampur. It will later be extended to other primary and upper primary schools. Ganjam District Collector Vijay Amruta Kulange formally inaugurated this project at a Putigopalpur school in Chhatrapur block.

Mr. Kulange said that the aim was to take school education beyond “chalk and talk”.

Under this project, the school timing has not been altered.

The first period on Saturdays for these students was physical education in the form of yoga and mass drill. Second period has been earmarked for health and sanitation awareness through competitions, general knowledge sessions, plantations, toilet training etc. In the third period, children learnt moral and value education through story-telling, book-reading, creative writing and debate sessions. Effort to eradicate superstitions and myths by interactive sessions was the motto of fourth period.

The basics of women’s empowerment was the theme of the fifth period to promote education of girls, stop child marriages and create awareness about women-friendly projects of the government and administration. The last period has been named the ‘zero period’ during which the students performed art and craft, rangoli, model construction, logical thinking etc.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/4ho1h8/article31012357.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE08BAG1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/students-in-primary-upper-primary-schools-in-odisha-observe-no-bag-day/article31012358.ece
271,2020/03/08,Delhi violence: Man arrested for murder of sweet shop staff,"Charred body of Dilbar Singh Negi was found in godown of shop on February 26

A 27-year-old man was arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder of a sweet shop worker during communal riots on February 24, the police said on Saturday.

The police said that the accused, identified as Mohammed Shahnawaz, a resident of Shiv Vihar, has been arrested for the murder of Dilbar Singh Negi whose charred, mutilated body was found in the shop’s godown two days later on February 26.

The arrest was made by the team of Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch) Rajesh Deo on Friday.

The police claimed that on February 24, a riot had taken place near Shiv Vihar three-way junction in which “accused Shahnawaz and several other persons threw stones and torched several shops”. Further, the police claimed that the accused entered a bookstore and a sweet shop godown in Chaman Park and “torched both the places along with other rioters”.

A case under Section 147, 148, 149, 302, 201, 436, and 427 of the Indian Penal Code was registered at Gokul Puri police station and investigation was started.

During the probe, the police said, “Eyewitnesses had identified accused Shahnawaz as the main aggressor who was leading the mob on February 24”.

Accused Shahnawaz used to run a cigarette and paan shop right opposite the sweet shop’s godown for the last few years. Negi, from Uttarakhand’s Pauri, used to work as a waiter in the sweet shop.

Negi’s fellow mates said that around 2 p.m. on February 24, the victim had gone for lunch and the violence began around 3 p.m. after which Negi and two of his colleagues got stuck on the second floor of the godown. Right above the second floor was the terrace where scores of rioters had gathered and were throwing stones.

272,2020/03/08,"Any little help means a lot to us, say Delhi riot victims at relief camp","Displaced persons provided folding beds a day after heavy rain floods camp

Following heavy rain, which lashed the city for two days, folding beds have been provided to the victims of the Delhi riots who have sought refuge at the Idgah relief camp in Mustafabad.

Not having to spend another night on drenched mattresses is a welcome change, said many of the people who were displaced by violence in north-east Delhi in the last week of Febraury.

“The first night was really bad. All the blankets and mattresses got wet due to heavy rain. It felt like our shelter was snatched for the second time in a week. However, now we have been provided with the folding beds,” said 35-year-old Aleena, a resident of Shiv Vihar.

After the camp was flooded, the Delhi government sent the folding beds on Friday night.

Stating that “any little help” at this point is beneficial to them, Aleena added: “We have been completely stripped off all our belongings. Staying in camps is definitely not the most convenient thing. The beds are also literally attached to each other and there is not much space for movement. But at least we have food and a cover over our heads. We are not really in a state to complain right now. Any little help means a lot to us.”

The Delhi government, in a statement released on Saturda, said: “The sudden rain in Delhi over the last two days caused some flooding at Mustafabad relief camp, but the government ensured speedy removal of water from the camp and also provided 800 beds. All the basic facilities have been arranged in the camp and people are satisfied.”

‘Spent night outside’

While scores of volunteers, senior government officials and legal aid services swarmed the camp on Saturday, 28-year-old Fatima, sat with her two kids — aged six-month-old and five-year-old — at a distance from the main tents and claimed that she had not been given an accommodation.

“I have spent two nights out in the rain with my two kids and my mother-in-law. Our blankets got completely drenched and it was only later that one of the volunteers came and gave us a new one. Somehow, I wrapped my two kids in it. When I went inside, the other ladies said the tents were already occupied and we could not stay there,” she said, while vowing to never return to her house in Shiv Vihar.

“My husband was brutally beaten by a mob and we were locked in the house for two days. I am only thankful that my kids were saved. I do not want to go back to that place,” she added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/yt22v5/article31012349.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8DECAMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/any-little-help-means-a-lot-to-us-say-riot-victims-at-relief-camp/article31012350.ece
273,2020/03/08,‘Tahir paying the price for being Muslim’,"It is possible that he will be held responsible for Delhi riots, says Amanatullah

Suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, who has been arrested for his alleged role in the recent riots in north-east Delhi, is “being punished for being a Muslim”, AAP Okhla legislator Amanatullah Khan alleged here on Saturday.

The Nehru Vihar councillor, who was suspended from AAP after allegations of his involvement in the violence which ripped across the Chand Bagh area, where he stays, in addition to the alleged murder of Intelligence Bureau IB staffer Ankit Sharma, could also be accused of instigating the whole episode, Mr. Khan alleged further.

“Today Tahir Hussain is paying the price only for being a Muslim. Perhaps the biggest crime in Hindustan today is being a Muslim. It is possible that it is proved in the immediate future that Tahir Hussain is behind the violence in Delhi [sic.],” Mr. Khan tweeted on Saturday evening triggering a backlash from the BJP.

East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir took the opportunity to question AAP “intensions”.

“You has set out to conduct Sundar Kand recitals...but delivered a deliberate plot...@arvindkejriwal Tahir is accused of being behind the 400 wounds inflicted on Ankit Sharma who was a defender of the nation! And your legislators are using religion to divide the country...the real question is about AAP’s intensions [sic.],” Mr. Gambhir alleged in a tweet.

Former Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly and Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta accused the AAP of practising appeasement politics.

“Kudos to AAP’s politics of appeasement. My question to @arvindkejriwal is whether he is in agreement with his legislator...will you tell him [Mr. Khan] what Tahir is actually paying for?

274,2020/03/08,W.B. teachers oppose new law on recruits’ antecedents and reproductive health,"‘We suspect it to be a roundabout way of implementing CAA’

Teachers in West Bengal are questioning the new law that will subject fresh recruits in all State government-aided colleges to police verification and also a medical examination assessing, among other things, the reproductive health of female candidates.

There are nearly 600 State government-aided universities and colleges in W.B. Critics say that the new law — which requires applicants to specify whether they were originally a resident of Pakistan, Bangladesh or Nepal — was totally unnecessary at a time when the country was witnessing anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests.

“We suspect this to be a roundabout way of implementing the CAA, even though on the face of it Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is opposed to it. Or else, why do they want to know whether a candidate originally hailed from Pakistan or Bangladesh? As for police verification, it only makes candidates vulnerable to political victimisation. And what is the point of an elaborate medical check-up? Are the candidates applying for the Army? We strongly oppose this law,” Kesab Bhattacharya, general secretary of West Bengal College and University Teachers’ Association, told The Hindu.

The notification, issued on February 24, says: “Every [State government-aided] university or college shall take immediate steps to have done all procedural formalities regarding police verification and medical examination of the incumbent so appointed. However, confirmation of service shall be withheld till receipt of report of police verification and medical examination even after completion of usual period of probation.” For male candidates, the medical test will determine, among other things, the girth of the chest, and for females, it will evaluate the functioning of ovaries and uterus.

“This is unprecedented and deplorable. It violates one’s right to privacy and the right over one’s own body. It will discriminate against pregnant women and the transgender community. The whole thing is shocking, to say the least, and seems to have sinister motives,” said Ishita Mukherjee, a professor of economics at the University of Calcutta and also the president of the teachers’ association there.

A section of teachers that supports Mamata Banerjee says such regulations were already in place in government colleges and the only thing new is that they have been extended to government-aided colleges. “The number of government colleges is very less, that is why [such regulations] escaped attention and no one talked about them, but now that government-aided institutions have also been brought under the law, people are making noise,” said Sujoy Ghosh, spokesman of West Bengal College and University Professors’ Association.

“State Education Minister [Partha Chatterjee] has already said that he was open to discussion with any group that had problems with certain clauses of the law. We fully support his statement,” said Mr. Ghosh.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/wb-teachers-oppose-new-law-on-recruits-antecedents-and-reproductive-health/article31012320.ece
275,2020/03/08,Naveen announces names of party candidates for RS election,"Speculation was rife that BJD may not field candidate for the fourth seat

Putting all speculations to rest, Odisha Chief Minister and Biju Janata Dal (BJD) president Naveen Patnaik on Saturday announced the names of his party’s candidates for elections to four Rajya Sabha seats in the State.

Mr. Patnaik announced that Subhas Singh, Munna Khan, Sujeet Kumar and Mamata Mahanta will be the BJD’s candidates for the four seats for which elections are scheduled to be held on March 26.

While Mr. Singh was the Chairman of the Odisha Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board, Mr. Khan is the Adviser to the Minority Affairs Department and Mr. Kumar was the Adviser to the Special Development Council. Ms. Mahanta is a prominent leader of the BJD’s women’s wing in Mayurbhanj district. They belong to the coastal, southern, western and northern regions of the State respectively.

Earlier, there was a speculation that the BJD might not field a candidate for the fourth seat if it entered into any kind of understanding with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The party had supported BJP nominee Ashwini Vaishnaw in the Rajya Sabha polls last year following requests made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

Of the four seats, which are now going to the polls, one was vacated by BJD’s Anubhav Mohanty following his election to Lok Sabha last year and the terms of Narendra Kumar Swain, Sarojini Hembram of the BJD and Ranjib Biswal of the Congress were due to end early next month.

While the BJD has 113 members in the 147-member House, the BJP has 23, Congress nine, CPI(M) one and one is an independent legislator. Going by the membership strength of different parties in the State Assembly, the BJD is placed in a comfortable position to win three seats. There may be a contest for the fourth seat if the BJP fields a candidate.

The BJD may succeed in winning all four seats as the BJP does not have the number of members required to win a seat on its own. The Congress is unlikely to contest, and there is little chance of it supporting a BJP nominee.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/naveen-announces-names-of-party-candidates-for-rs-election/article31012313.ece
276,2020/03/08,Sadar Bazar shop owners left high and dry this Holi,"The market sees low footfall due to COVID-19 scare

With Holi celebrations set to begin in the Capital, the shopkeepers in Sadar Bazar have taken a double hit because of derailed shipments from China and declining customer footfall due to the COVID-19 scare.

The local vendors as well as traders at this hub where pichkaris and water balloons are sold are in a fix after supply from Chinese factories has been stopped in mid-January.

Samjuddin, a shopkeeper, said that the last packet of balloons he could procure was in January. He said, “I have got these pichkaris from a factory in Gurugram at a very high rate and the customers are refusing to buy these at such prices.”

“We got the last stock two months ago and now we have no goods left. It will be worse if the situation does not improve in near future,” said Amrit Pal Singh, a toy store owner.

Drawing a comparison, he said that plastic toys made in China are popular among customers owing to their finishing which toys made in our country lack.

The shopkeepers also said that after the outbreak of COVID-19, people were refraining from visiting crowded areas as a preventive measure. “The shops used to attract a lot of customers in this season, but the fear of the disease among people has changed the situation this time,” said Devesh Khurana of Shan Tradings.

Inflated wholesale prices of goods in India and stuck payments of shipments have posed a threat to several shopkeepers. Mr. Singh said people will be forced to switch businesses which are not dependent on imports from China, if there the situation does not improve.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ma3gt2/article31012293.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05DELPRIYAHOLI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sadar-bazar-shop-owners-left-high-and-dry-this-holi/article31012294.ece
277,2020/03/08,"₹10,000 crore for power subsidy a big relief to discoms","The budgetary support for power subsidy component for 2019-20 was about ₹8,000 crore

In a big relief to the ailing power utilities of Telangana, the State government has increased the budgetary support to power sector by over ₹2,150 crore for 2020-21, compared to last year, taking it to ₹10,406 crore, including enhanced subsidy of nearly ₹10,100 crore.

With this, in addition to the government’s go-ahead given for increase in the power tariff, the power utilities, particularly the two distribution companies (discoms), are expected to tide over the huge revenue gap to a large extent.

Significantly, the budgetary support for power subsidy component for 2019-20 was about ₹8,000 crore.

In addition, the government has already issued instructions to various departments to clear energy consumption dues to the discoms, already standing at a staggering ₹10,000 crore, at least in instalments.

Supplier credit

With the help of increased subsidy component and increase in tariff, the discoms are expected to manage the niggling issue of letter of credit to be issued to the power suppliers every month.

Although the budgetary support to the irrigation sector is pegged at ₹11,053 crore, the outlay for capital expenditure is only ₹3,606 crore.

The outlay for establishment expenditure of ₹7,447 crore, however, includes the costs of maintenance of major lift irrigation projects in operation, including its power bills.

A lion’s share of capital expenditure for major projects such as Kaleshwaram, Palamuru-Rangareddy, Sitarama, Kanthanapally and others is expected to be met from institutional borrowings.

Heavy pumping

According to the statistics released by the government as part of the socio-economic outlook, about 51.77 tmcft water has been lifted from Godavari river (Medigadda barrage) through Kannepally pump house followed by 46.53 tmcft at Gunjepadugu pump house (Annaram), 44.06 tmcft at Goliwada pump house (Sundilla), 59.94 tmcft at Nandi Medaram pump house and 57.64 tmcft at Laxmipur pump house till March 4 starting from June 21, when they became operational.

On Mission Kakatiya, the government stated that restoration of 21,601 minor irrigation tanks was completed out of works taken up on 27,584 tanks in four phases with an expenditure of ₹4,353 crore.

Allocation to the education sector has increased this year compared to previous years with the government assuring ₹ 12,127.55 crore, which is ₹2,238.43 crore higher over the last year. Last year, ₹9,899.12 crore was allocated.

In tune with Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao’s announcement on ‘Each One Teach One’ concept in the last sessions, the Finance Minister allocated ₹100 crore to it. However, it is to be seen how it would be utilised.

Out of the total outlay, School Education has been allocated ₹ 10,405.29 crore while higher education was given ₹ 1452.03 crore and Technical Education ₹270.23 crore. The additional allocations over last year have been shown in the School Education department. Though estimates for School Eduction sent to the government were about ₹14,000 crore, only ₹10,405.29 crore has been allocated. However, majority of the allocation would be utilised for salaries and maintenance only.

The Higher Education sector has seen allocated ₹1,452.03 crore while Technical Education has been given ₹ 270.23 crore. Universities have got enhanced allocations in this budget. Last year, conventional universities were given ₹582.88 crore and this year they were allocated ₹606.73 crore. But the additional money would be enough to pay the salaries as enhanced by the University Grants Commission.

Osmania University was allocated ₹309.53 crore last year and now it got ₹343.58 crore. Similarly, Kakatiya University (79.53 to 88.28 crore), Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Open University (10.44 to 11.59 crore), Telugu University (22.41 to 24.88 crores), Telangana University (23.76 to 26.38 crore), RGUKT (20.12 to 22.33 crore) JNAFAU (16.23 to 18.02 crore). From ₹320.29 crore last year, alloction for Technical Education has been reduced to ₹ 265.08 crore. This had an effect on the allocations to colleges under JNTU Hyderabad.

279,2020/03/08,Symbol of national pride to stand tall at Khammam railway station,"Tricolour to flutter at a height of 100 feet on a giant pole at the place

The national tricolour will flutter at a height of 100 feet at the railway station here soon, providing a visual delight to travellers and instilling a sense of national pride among them.

A giant flag pole weighing about 1.5 tonnes has been erected at a vantage point beside the vehicle parking area right in front of the railway station for this purpose.

The South Central Railway (SCR) had embarked on a plan to install the tall flag pole with lighting facility exactly opposite the railway station to hoist the national flag atop it as a symbol of national pride and unity in diversity, sources said.

Around 30 trains pass through the Khammam railway station, one of the major railway stations on the busy Secunderabad-Vijayawada section of the SCR, daily. It handles nearly 13,000 passengers per day.

It has earned a special place in the annals of history as Mahatma Gandhi visited the railway station during the historical Indian independence movement and addressed a meeting here on February 5, 1946.

This fort town already has a 100-foot-tall flag pole with the national tricolour flying high atop it at the Lakaram tank bund. The giant flag pole was installed at the picturesque spot to spread the spirit of patriotism following the initiative of Collector R V Karnan. It was inaugurated on August 15 last year.

When contacted, SCR Engineer Avinash Reddy told The Hindu that plans were afoot to finalise the design for erecting railing and raising a garden around the 100 feet flag pole already installed on a trial basis adjacent to the parking area opposite the main entrance of the railway station.

A concrete pedestal would be constructed to provide a solid foundation for the giant flag pole and a dedicated power supply would be arranged to ensure proper lighting for the tall pole, he said, adding that the whole project was expected to be completed in a few months.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/lh7io9/article31016405.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09HYKHM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/symbol-of-national-pride-to-stand-tall-at-khammam-railway-station/article31016406.ece
280,2020/03/08,"Maruthi Rao, prime accused in Dalit youth’s murder, found dead","Police suspect he ended his life by consuming some poisonous substance

Tirunagaru Maruthi Rao (52), the prime accused in the ‘honour killing’ of a Dalit youth, P. Pranay Kumar, in Miryalaguda, was found dead in a room at Arya Vysya Bhavan in Khairatabad here on Sunday morning.

Police suspect that Rao committed suicide by consuming an unidentified poisonous substance.

In a note purportedly left by him, Rao apologised to his wife forgive him and asked their daughter to live with his wife. It read: “Girija, nannu kshaminchu. Amrutha, maa daggariki ra’ (Girija, forgive me. Amrutha, live with your mother.)

“We suspect he resorted to the extreme step by consuming a poisonous substance. We did not find any bottle in the room. However, the exact reason will be known only after the autopsy report is out,” Saifabad inspector Ch. Saidi Reddy said.

In January 2018, his only daughter Amruthavarshini had got married to 24-year-old Pranay against his wishes.

He opposed the inter-caste marriage and allegedly hired assassins to kill his son-in-law. The killers hacked Pranay to death in broad daylight when he came out of a hospital with his pregnant wife after a routine medical check-up in Miryalaguda in September that year.

Rao, an influential businessman in Miryalaguda, who had been out on bail for the past few months, came to Hyderabad on Saturday evening to meet his advocate and checked into Room No. 306 of Arya Vysya Bhavan.

However, on Sunday his driver Bellamkonda Rajesh, along with the help of Bhavan’s staff, broke open the door when the victim did not respond even after repeated knocking on the door.

The victim’s wife Girija called and asked the driver to check on him as he was not responding to her repeated calls.

“When I entered the room after breaking the door, I found him lying in a prone position and tried to wake him up. But, he was motionless.

Soon, the staff alerted police, who rushed to the spot and shifted the body to Osmania General Hospital,” Mr. Rajesh said.

He said that they came to the Bhavan around 6.40 p.m. and after an hour he brought him some snacks. “Around 8.30 p.m. we had Pani Puri at a nearby stall and he went inside the room. Half an hour later, I gave him the documents, and he instructed me to sleep in the vehicle,” the driver said.

281,2020/03/08,"Coronavirus | As mask hysteria spreads, doctors bust myths","Awareness session on COVID-19 held to check panic-buying of masks, sanitisers

In what seems a case of panic-buying, sales of masks and sanitisers have shot up in the city after a techie with travel history to Dubai tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) five days ago.

However, Superintendent of Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Tropical and Communicable Diseases (Fever Hospital) K. Shankar has said that not everyone needs to use a mask.

Speaking at an awareness session on coronavirus organised at Telangana State Human Rights Commission, Nampally, on Saturday, Dr Shankar said N95 masks have to be used only by people detected with the virus or those suspected to have been infected.

“Attendants, doctors, nurses and ward boys who attend the suspects have to use maks,” Dr Shankar said, adding that the two-layer masks are not really useful. “Instead, one can use three or four-layer masks while visiting hospitals. A scarf, too, is effective,” he explained.

Health officials have stressed that COVID-19 is not an airborne disease. The virus spreads when an infected patient coughs or sneezes, causing the droplets to fall into the eyes, nose or mouth of others.

Treatment type

A statement by Health officials about there being no treatment for COVID-19 and treatment being provided to positive patients has left many confused. In attempt to clear the uncertainty, Director of Medical Education K. Ramesh Reddy said that they do not treat the virus, but provide treatment to contain other symptoms. Medicines to cure fever and sneezing are administered to patients, who are also kept under observation. If their condition deteriorates, such as multi-organ failure, specialists attend them.

Dr Shankar said that there are three forms of treatment — symptomatic treatment; supportive treatment and specific treatment. “There is no specific treatment for coronavirus. But there is symptomatic and supportive treatment available,” he said.

SHRC chairman Justice G. Chandraiah, judicial member Ananda Rao Nadipally, former district and sessions judge and non-judicial member Mohammed Irfan Moinuddin were present at the session.

285,2020/03/08,GHMC’s affidavits vague: HC,"Observing that two consecutive affidavits filed by GHMC Commissioner Lokesh Kumar were vague, Telangana High Court directed him to a file another with complete details, giving a time-bound plan to deal with waste disposal at Jawaharnagar dumping yard.

A division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy, hearing a PIL plea on capping garbage at Jawaharnagar dumping yard, passed the direction. Picking holes in the two affidavits, the bench said the Commissioner had stated that GHMC established resource centres for collection of dry waste but failed to explain if they were existing. Efficiency of these centres too was not mentioned.

Barring simply stating that an awareness campaign on waste generation was launched, frequency of the programme and how people were being educated and its impact was not elaborated, the bench said. Under Swach Bharat Mission, litter bins were put up at commercial establishments and fines were being imposed on violators, the affidavit said.

Location of these bins and the fine imposed were not mentioned. How the fine amounts were used was also not explained, the bench said in its order. The Commissioner stated that waster pickers in GHMC jurisdiction were identified. They were given identity cards. However, points like how many waste pickers were there, what was their functional quality and how efficient their services were not stated, the bench noted. These waste pickers were provided with 2,500 vehicles for garbage collection but what area under GHMC these vehicles cover was not stated.

Except saying that GHMC prepared a solid waste management plan, there was no clarity in the affidavit as to how and where it was being implemented. The manner of implementation and its success rate was also not expressed, the bench remarked.

The State Level Advisory board constituted on July 7, 2017 had met only twice. In the past two years, it had not convened a meeting even once. “This is, indeed, a sorry state of affairs,” the bench observed. The State Level Committee to monitor implementation of Solid Waste Management Rules had not met once in past eight months.

Pyaranagar, Khanapur and Lakdaram were identified as alternative locations for Jawaharnagar dumping yard. But they were not in the possession of GHMC. These locations do not seem to be practically feasible. Hence, mere identification of alternative locations was meaningless, the bench said.

286,2020/03/08,Meet on epilepsy in neonates concludes,"A three-day International Conference on Epilepsy in Neonates and Infants concluded on Sunday with a special workshop on Electro-Encephalogram (EEG) in infants for accurate detection and analysis of seizure and epilepsy.

The workshop titled ‘EEG in the first year of Life – from newborn to toddler’ was led by International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE).

A seizure is like a power surge, abnormal electrical discharges from neurons disrupting brain function. This causes varying symptoms in older children and adults like shake, twitching, fall, staring spells, unconsciousness, confusion, etc. However, seizures in newborns are quite different and even experts have difficulty recognising them.

Addressing the meet, Dr. Vinayan K.P., Head of Paediatric Neurology and Epilepsy, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, said babies born prematurely or with low birth weight need special attention because febrile seizures are more common among them.

“The issue is complex. Continued febrile seizures can injure the brain. Conversely, brain abnormalities in the child can trigger febrile seizure. Either way, recurring seizures can lead to epilepsy,” he said.

“In babies EEG recording is done continuously for hours to record awake and all sleep stages. The test is not uncomfortable for the child,” said Dr. Vinayan.

290,2020/03/08,A mission to foster stronger family bonds,"DCPU identifying potential beneficiaries for vacation foster care programme

Manitha C. Nair, an assistant professor at Amrita Centre for Nano Sciences, is in a dilemma.

Having brought in 12-year-old Rema (name changed) to her family for two successive years under the Vacation Foster Care programme, she simply could not decide whether to bring her back again this year, thus further fostering the already strong bond with her foster daughter or give that chance to another equally unfortunate girl who has no memories of being part of a loving family.

“We were discussing the pros and cons of bringing her back till the previous evening. Our family, including my two young children, are very attached to her. Yet, we were discussing whether to bring another girl this time.

“Besides, we are not sure whether we will get her again since there seems to be a move to send back inmates of child care institutes from other States to their parent States,” said Ms. Manitha.

She bared the pangs of separation on both occasions when her foster daughter, originally from north India and who got separated from her mentally disturbed mother at the age of around five, was sent back to the institute after the vacation.

Incidentally, Ms. Nair’s family is the only one to apply for the third successive year under the vacation foster care programme since the District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) rolled it out in 2018.

Since then, as many as 39 children, lodged at various child care institutes across the district, got to spend their vacations with 30 foster families.

Significantly, girls outnumbered boys by 28 to 11, indicating the strong preference of families for girls. There were also instances of families taking in siblings from child care institutes.

“Inquiries are pouring in, and on a single day we received around 160 calls. Unlike in the previous two years when we called for a list of children available for the vacation foster care programme from the 95 child care institutes registered in the district, this time the DCPU is directly identifying potential beneficiaries,” said M.K.P. Hafzeena, protection officer, non-institutional care, DCPU.

Home study

The last date for submission of applications under the programme is March 10 after which social workers assigned by the DCPU will undertake a home study, followed by counselling to ascertain whether the families are capable of taking care of children in a safe, secure and peaceful atmosphere.

Children who are not able to return to their families even during vacations are mainly considered for the programme.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/a-mission-to-foster-stronger-family-bonds/article31012531.ece

Major traffic violations along the 20-km stretch from Okkal to Manoor along MC Road will come under the purview of the Eyes on the Road initiative to be launched by the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) at Perumbavoor.

The innovative project involves the participation of Kudumbashree workers and MVD and police personnel. Eyes on the Road was conceived in the wake of the rise in road accidents on MC Road.

“As many as 10 accident black spots have been identified on the 20-km stretch. Kudumbashree workers in civilian dress will spot traffic violations along with other surveillance teams and report them to the enforcement units of the MVD and the police at once,” said B. Shefiq, Joint Regional Transport Officer, Perumbavoor.

The project is being rolled out with the support of Eldhose Kunnappilly, MLA. A report was submitted to the district administration, seeking financial aid for the project, which will be monitored by a high-level committee comprising a judicial officer and senior officials of the MVD and the police.

Mr. Shefiq added that only major violations would be brought under the scanner. “They include helmetless driving, driving without wearing seat belt, use of mobile phone while driving, reckless driving, underage driving, and allowing people to travel on top of vehicles carrying loads,” he said.

Sign boards

The MVD will set up sign boards at 10 points on the Okkal-Manoor stretch. Incidentally, the route is under the surveillance of the department, and offenders will be booked in accordance with the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act.

The objective of the project is to have a sustained drive involving personnel of the MVD and the police. Kudumbashree workers have been roped in with the aim of involving the public and self-help groups in detecting traffic violations.

293,2020/03/08,Coronavirus | How is India containing COVID-19?,"Are there enough testing facilities in the country? What happens when a person tests positive?

The story so far: On March 8, India’s Health Ministry said the total number of the highly contagious coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in the country had risen to 34. In December 2019, the World Health Organisation (WHO) had declared an outbreak of the febrile respiratory illness of unknown etiology from Wuhan, Hubei Province of China. The outbreak was epidemiologically linked to the Wuhan Seafood Wholesale Market involving the sale of seafood and live animals. Later named COVID-19, it has now spread to more than 90 countries apart from China, — there are 101,923 confirmed cases and 3,486 deaths from 94 countries, areas and territories (as on March 7, 10:00 CET). WHO has declared the outbreak as a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern.”

What do we know about the virus?

Little is known about the novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2), which currently has no vaccine and has the potential to cause severe illnesses and pneumonia, according to senior health officials in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). It primarily spreads through the respiratory droplets of infected people. If a person touches a surface or object that has been infected by the virus and then touches his own mouth, nose, or eyes, he may get infected. Symptoms of COVID-19 appear within two to 14 days after exposure and include fever, cough, a runny nose and difficulty in breathing.

Where is screening being done?

As preventive measures, the Health Ministry has recommended universal screening of all international flights, cancellation of biometric attendance for all ministries till March 31, advised against mass gatherings. The Indian Army is now establishing additional quarantine facilities for 1,500 personnel (total) which will be activated at locations as part of the overall effort. The tentative locations identified are at Jaisalmer (Rajasthan), Suratgarh (Rajasthan), Secunderabad (Telangana), Chennai (Tamil Nadu) and Kolkata (West Bengal).

The Ministry has also suggested augmenting isolation facilities in hospitals across India besides ensuring adequate supply of protective gear, medicines and other essential services.

What is the process?

Universal screening for coronavirus is being done at 30 airports having international operations. A total of 7,26,122 passengers have been screened so far from 7,108 flights (as on March 7).

Airlines have been instructed to make in-flight announcements about COVID-19 and all international passengers are being asked to fill the ‘Self Reporting Form’ in duplicate. Those picked out through thermal screening are sent for further tests and isolation and treatment if necessary to designated hospitals including Ram Manohar Lohia and Safdarjung Hospital (both in Delhi). The government has adopted these measures such as universal screening of passengers, filling up self-declaration forms, surveillance of those who have come in contact with infected persons to contain the spread.

What happens if a person tested has fever?

Points of entry such as airports, sea ports, borders have set up a protocol of thermal screening, which means anyone with fever will be picked out. All passengers coming into India are being screened. In case a passenger has a temperature, he is referred for further tests at designated hospitals where COVID-19 symptoms are matched, the country he comes from is looked into, exposure is checked and samples are collected for testing.

Watch | COVID-19: Dos and don'ts from the Health Ministry

Isolation (home/hospital) is advised for a period of 14 to 21 days when the case samples of the suspected person are sent for testing. If he tests positive, he is sent for treatment and all his contacts are then traced. The test results for COVID-19 are obtained in four to five hours. The virus has an incubation period of about 14 days. According to health officials, India is following WHO-prescribed guidelines to detect, treat and contain the virus.

How is the infection being treated?

A WHO release says: “We are dealing with a new virus and WHO is working closely with clinicians caring for patients with COVID-19, across the globe and international experts on infectious disease to better understand, in real time, the clinical presentation, natural history and treatment interventions for COVID-19.” It adds that a majority of patients with COVID-19 are adults and most patients (80%) experienced mild illness. Approximately 14% experienced severe disease and 5% were critically ill worldwide.

In India, a senior health official said WHO-prescribed patient management guidance was being followed, which included interim clinical care guidance for hospitalised patients and home care guidance for those with a milder infection which may be treated at home in isolation when the health system is strained.

What are the challenges?

Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said, “India’s additional challenge is to contain clusters due to local transmission. We have provided the Containment Action Plan to all the States. A national level training workshop has been conducted for all the States and hospitals on COVID-19 management which will then be taken up at the district level. Senior officers of the Ministry have been deputed to States and UTs [Union Territories] to review their preparedness and provide required guidance in the containment efforts.”

COVID-19 | Virus response a test of integrated governance, says Jaishankar

He added that the Ministry has designated the District Collector as the nodal officer for containment operations. States have been guided in terms of identifying the containment zone, buffer zone and preparation of a micro plan to ensure effective active and passive surveillance and contact tracing through inter-disciplinary teams in the areas where cases are located. A 24-hour seven day control room is operational with call centre number 011-23978046. So far, more than 9,200 calls have been attended to including 667 international calls, as per information released by the Health Ministry (March 5).

Are testing labs being strengthened?

“Early diagnosis helps in early identification and containment of the disease,” notes a senior ICMR official. As many as 52 laboratories are now operational across the country to test for COVID-19. An additional 57 laboratories have been provided with viral transport media and swabs for sample collection.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan said, “We have tried to limit COVID-19 exposure to India by suspending regular visas/e-visa granted to nationals of Italy, Iran, South Korea, Japan issued on or before March 3, 2020. Also Indian citizens are advised to refrain from travel to China, Iran, South Korea, Italy and Japan. But that isn’t enough. We are now strengthening our testing labs too.”.

As on March 6, 2020, a total of 4,058 samples from 3,404 individuals have been tested by the labs. The Minister said, “This includes testing of 1,308 samples from 654 individuals evacuated from Wuhan, China and quarantined at the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and Manesar Camps and tested twice on days 0 and 14. Subsequently, another 236 individuals evacuated from Wuhan and Diamond Princess Ship, Japan on February 27, 2020 was tested on day 0. Repeat testing will be done on day 14.”

When should a person get tested?

Giving details of who should be considered for COVID-19 testing, the Minister said this would include people who are symptomatic (that is if they have fever, sore throat, running nose, dyspnea, etc), especially individuals who have returned from affected countries (China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Iran, Italy etc.), or have had close contact with confirmed positive cases of COVID-19. The types of samples being taken include throat and nasal swabs.

Is India ready with lab requirements, medicines?

An ICMR release said testing laboratories have been supplied with the primers, probes, PCR reagents, positive and negative controls, and standard operating procedure (SOP) by the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. Further, NIV is also undertaking quality control activities. It maintains an inventory of reagents for itself and testing labs. Currently, NIV has sufficient reagents for facilitating testing in the entire network, the release pointed out.

Chemicals and Fertilizers Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda said India has sufficient stocks of active pharmaceutical ingredients — the raw materials needed to make medicines — to last the next three months. The statement comes amid reports of disrupted supply chains for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from China due to the outbreak. He said, “The export ban on 26 APIs for common medicines was imposed to ensure that there is no domestic shortage due to the coronavirus outbreak.”

Uttar Pradesh Agriculture Minister Surya Pratap Shahi on Saturday directed officials to undertake a survey to ascertain the extent of losses in crops due to the recent hailstorm in the State.

In a statement issued here by the State government, Mr. Shahi said, “The department officials must ensure that a survey is conducted to ascertain the extent of loss in terms of crops by the farmers in the State caused by hailstorm and rain. The State government is committed to compensate the losses caused to the farmers.”

Instructions have also been given to insurance companies to ascertain the extent of loss, and pay for the damages caused to farmers.

Toll-free number

Mr. Shahi also said that farmers can register their losses with a toll-free number 1800120909090.

Rashtriya Kisan Manch president Shekhar Dixit said, “Hailstorm and rain has damaged 70% of the crops. We have already written a letter to the Chief Minister drawing his attention towards the problems faced by the farmers. In 2015, during the SP regime, hailstorm had taken place in some parts of the State. The money, which was meant for the farmers, never reached them. The State government should act in time, else it would be too late for the farmers.”

‘Farmers frustrated’

State Congress convenor (media department) Lalan Kumar said, “The farmers are feeling frustrated with the BJP regime, as their problems are yet to be redressed. The BJP government has done nothing concrete for the farmers, and seems to be only interested in branding itself. The farmers are feeling devastated.”

Mr. Lalan added, “U.P. Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu visited villages to get a first hand idea of the damage caused to the crops.

After the delimitation of panchayat bodies, elections to the 57 newly formed village panchayats and panchayat samitis in Rajasthan will be held next month. Elections to over 4,300 panchayats in the State were held in three phases in January this year.

Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, who holds the Rural Development and Panchayati Raj portfolio, said in the State Assembly recently that the election would strengthen democratic traditions at the grassroots, while the new model of rural development would bring prosperity to villages.

Replying to the debate on budgetary demands for his department, Mr. Pilot said each revenue village would get the allocation for four works for development of pasture land, water harvesting structure, crematorium or graveyard, and playground.

Grants of ₹759.28 cr.

This approach would ensure all-round development of rural areas, he said.

The House passed the demand for grants of ₹759.28 crore to the department by voice vote.

Mr. Pilot said Rajasthan had occupied first position in the execution of works under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, providing daily wages as a right to the people in villages.

At least 12 people died and three were critically injured in a head-on collision between an SUV and a tractor in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur district early on Saturday, an official said.

The accident occurred on National Highway-28 in Kanti area, 80 km north of Patna, when the speeding vehicle carrying 14 people rammed the brick-laden tractor, being driven on the wrong side, District Magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh said.

The car’s occupants, who hailed from a village in Hathauri area, were returning to their homes for Holi from Buxar where they had been working as daily wage earners, Mr. Singh said.

The impact of the collision left the car mangled, killing seven of its occupants on the spot and four others succumbed to injuries while they were being rushed to a hospital. A person seated on the tractor was also killed, while three occupants of the SUV are undergoing treatment at a hospital and their condition is stated to be critical, he said.

The national highway was blocked for a few hours as large crowd had gathered at the spot. Movement of vehicles was restored after police arrived with quick response team personnel and got the road cleared, the District Magistrate said.

300,2020/03/08,Allahabad HC stays recovery order against CAA protesters,"‘Rules under which notice issued challenged before SC’

The Allahabad High Court has stayed a Bijnor ADM order directing the administration to recover ₹2.22 lakh from four persons accused of damaging public property in clashes during anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests on December 20, 2019.

“We are of the view that the rules under which the impugned notice has been issued is under challenge before the apex court,” a Division Bench of Justices Manoj Mishra and Deepak Verma said on Friday.

“Therefore, the ends of justice demand that the effect and operation of the impugned notice is put in abeyance till the issue is determined by the apex court,” the order said.

The Bench was referring to the writ petition filed by advocate Parvaiz Arif Titu, which is being heard by the Supreme Court. Mr. Titu’s petition described such notices as “arbitrary” and asked for an independent judicial inquiry into the incidents.

The order has come after Javed Aftab, former municipal corporation chairman, Bijnor, moved the High Court along with Parvez Aftab, Shahadat Ali and Zeeshan Baig against the recovery orders issued by ADM Avadesh Mishra.

Issuing a notice to the State government, the Bench listed the case for April 20.

‘No power’

Senior advocate V.M. Zaidi, who is representing the four accused, said he argued that the ADM (Finance) had no power to issue such recovery notices.

“The Supreme Court guidelines [in Destruction of Public and Private Properties versus State of A.P. (2009) and Kodangallur Film Society versus Union of India (2018)] say that in such cases a serving or retired High Court or district judge is to be appointed as Claims Commissioner by the High Court,” Mr. Zaidi told The Hindu.

“It seems like a case of State terror to name and shame people without proper evidence. It has come after a stay order was passed by the honourable High Court when Mohammed Faizan of Kanpur approached against a similar recovery notice issued by ADM, Kanpur. I hope all such orders would be eventually set aside,” added Mr. Zaidi.

61 protesters identified

Official sources said 61 protesters were identified through CCTV footage and slapped with recovery notices.

The stay order came on the same day when the Lucknow administration pasted photos and recovery notices of those who allegedly vandalised public property during the anti-CAA protests in public places in the city on December 19.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/allahabad-hc-stays-recovery-order-against-caa-protesters/article31012454.ece

302,2020/03/08,Motor racing | Bahrain F1 race to be held without fans due to coronavirus,"Bahrain is the second F1 race casualty of the virus

The Bahrain Formula One Grand Prix will go ahead on March 22 without fans due to the coronavirus crisis, a blow to the Gulf Arab state's important tourism sector.

Bahrain, which is hosting the second round of the Formula One season at the Sakhir circuit outside Manama, has reported 83 cases of the virus, mostly linked to people who had travelled to Iran.

“Bahrain has made the decision to hold this year's (race) as a participants-only event,” organisers said on Sunday.

“Convening a major sporting event, which is open to the public and allows thousands of international travellers and local fans to interact in close proximity would not be the right thing to do at the present time,” they added.

“To ensure that neither the sport, nor its global supporter base, is unduly impacted, the race weekend itself will still go ahead as a televised event.”

Bahrain is the second F1 race casualty of the virus. The Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai scheduled for April 19 has already been postponed.

Racing without fans will be a first for the sport, although former commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone once mooted the idea of a 'VIP grand prix' at France's Le Castellet circuit with only invited guests.

A Bahrain International Circuit spokesman said accredited media would attend as usual.

Concerts featuring DJ's Afrojack and Don Diablo over the race weekend have been cancelled.

“We know how disappointed many will be by this news...but safety has to remain our utmost priority,” the circuit said.

Bahrain has suspended flights to some destinations over concerns of the rapidly spreading virus.

It has also asked people entering the country who have recently visited Italy, South Korea, Egypt and Lebanon to isolate themselves for two weeks.

Italy has ordered a virtual lockdown across a swathe of its wealthy north, including financial capital Milan, in a drastic attempt to try to contain a rapidly growing outbreak of coronavirus.

The Maranello base of Formula One's oldest and most successful team Ferrari is within the affected area.

Ferrari and Red Bull-owned AlphaTauri, who are based in Faenza, will still race in Bahrain because they will be coming from Australia which hosts the opening race in Melbourne next weekend.

“Depending on where they flew through on the way from Melbourne, there is a process that you go through,” the circuit spokesman said of the Italian teams.

Formula One has discussed arranging a special charter for Italians working in Formula One to avoid transit through airports in countries affected by the virus.

Organisers will refund fans who had bought tickets, whose sales were suspended last week.

Bahrain's biggest global sporting event reported a three-day crowd of 97,000 in 2019, a record for the event, with 34,000 on the Sunday.

That attendance is small compared to other races, with 202,146 the average Formula One three-day crowd in 2019.

Tourism is an important contributor to Bahrain's economy, which in recent years has been in deficit and sought bailouts from its wealthier Gulf Arab neighbours, and the race brings global exposure with millions of viewers.

Concerns over rapid spread of the coronavirus, which has killed 145 people and infected 5,823 others in Iran, has led to a raft of major events including concerts being cancelled in the Gulf region.

Formula One has two races in the Middle East, with Abu Dhabi hosting the closing race in November.

Besides, women officers were deployed for GD charge and surveillance duties in all police stations in the city. The city police control room was also under the control of women officers on the day.

The 30 differently abled students from ‘We Smile Vocational Training Centre for Differently Abled’, who presented a social awareness programme titled ‘We too have something to say’ were the chief attraction at ‘Blossom 2020’, the women’s day event organised by the Indian Medical Association Kozhikode branch. Wayanad District Collector Adeela Abdulla and former judge P.N. Shanthakumari Amma were the guests of honour at the event.

305,2020/03/08,Premalatha asks women to shun TikTok,"‘Teach a fitting lesson to self-centred parties’

Desiya Murpokku Dravida leader Premalatha Vijayakant on Sunday appealed to the women of the State to shun mobile video application TikTok.

Addressing a party meeting on Women’s Day here in the presence of party founder Vijayakant, she said that several innocent women were falling trap to the app and their family life was getting ruined.

Stating that women were a treasure of rich culture, she said that they did not need TikTok. “Do not upload any acts like singing or dancing. Your family, your children and your future are more important,” she said. TikTok uploads were creating rift among couples. “Instead, concentrate on good things in life,” she added.

Ms. Premalatha said that some political parties were trying to divide people on the basis of caste, religion and language. “You should identify such self-centred parties and teach them a fitting lesson,” she said.

Referring to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, she said that no Muslim in the country would be affected by the CAA and National Citizenship Register. Only those who came from other countries and tried to harm India would face action under the CAA.

“If there is any problem for the Muslims of our country, the DMDK will be the first to raise its voice,” she said.

Stating that the Aam Admi Party had come to power within one year after its launch, Ms. Premalatha said that the DMDK too deserved to get such a distinction. “But, it was only the people who lost a good opportunity to put in place a good party to rule the State. The DMDK has not lost anything,” she said.

People had fallen prey to the political parties that split votes for money, freebies, caste, religion and language, she said.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Sunday laid the foundation — through video conferencing from Chennai — for construction of a new building for the government law college and hostel in Theni.

A release said the Chief Minister had announced under Rule 110 in July 2019 in the Legislative Assembly the establishment of new government law colleges in Salem, Namakkal and Theni districts.

The colleges would facilitate students to pursue law course with ease and without migration. The government proposed to have three and five-year law degree programmes.

308,2020/03/08,Salary of teaching assistants yet to be hiked,"It was fixed at a Syndicate meeting held in September last

MADURAI

Despite orders from Madurai Kamaraj University Syndicate and Finance Committee to fix the salary for teaching assistants with over 10 years of service at ₹25,000 per month, the decision is yet to be implemented.

In a statement, secretary of Madurai Kamaraj, Manonmaniam Sundaranar, Mother Teresa and Alagappa University Teachers’ Association (MUTA) S. Ramasundaram said that according to the Sixth Pay Commission of the University Grants Commission, ₹25,000 was prescribed as salary for teaching assistants, guest lecturers and resource persons.

In a Syndicate meeting held at the university in September 2019, MKU Vice-Chancellor M. Krishnan said that the salary for teaching assistants with over 10 years of experience at MKU’s constituent colleges, university departments and the MKU College would be enhanced to ₹25,000. Currently, in most colleges the teachers are getting ₹15,000 per month.

The Syndicate had created a salary slab system which stated that freshers would get ₹15,000 per month, those with two years of experience would get ₹18,000, five years ₹20,000 and 10 years ₹25,000.

Mr. Ramasundaram said that the Association office-bearers had met officials of the university administration several times in this regard, but to no avail.

MUTA treasurer A.T. Senthamaraikannan said that despite teachers having UGC-mandated qualifications – Ph.D degrees, or National Eligibility Test or State Eligibility Test clearance – the pay hike had not yet been implemented as colleges were still screening candidates based on their experience and service.

Mr. Krishnan said that the screening process was nearly complete.

Principal of Tirumangalam Constituent College M. Bhuvaneswaran said that the revised salary with arrears would be disbursed to the teachers of the four constituent colleges starting from April.

“However, there was no response to my complaint to rescue the animal,” Mr. Ramesh said.

Recently he saw the photographs of the elephant uploaded in social media. “I found that the animal continued to suffer with the wound and again sought the intervention of officials from the Department of Forests,” he said.

Since, the private owner was taking the captive animal to different places for various functions, the animal suffered more, he complained.

“Jamela had the wound for nearly 15 years and was under treatment. However, with the limited facility with the owner, the wound was not healing fast,” the District Forest Officer N. Senthil Kumar said. After receiving the complaint, veterinary doctors from the Forest Department attended to the wound.

“But, we thought that taking the jumbo to the rehabilitation centre could give the aged animal some quick relief,” he added.

The DFO got a nod from the district-level Captive Elephant Welfare Committee to take Jamela to the rehabilitation centre. Following an order from the Chief Wildlife Warden, Chennai, Yuvaraj, the elephant was transported on Saturday.

“Jamela has reached the centre and would get better medical treatment,” he said. Besides, the rest would ensure that the wound gets healed sooner,” the DFO added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/t1lbyo/article31016709.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY09ELEPHANTTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ailing-elephant-sent-to-rehabilitation-centre/article31016025.ece

312,2020/03/08,Roundabout caves in; AIADMK cadre slip into pit,"Residents blame poor quality of structure for the incident

Four AIADMK cadre, who accompanied Cooperation Minister Sellur K. Raju, slipped into the pit that developed as a portion of the granite floor of the roundabout on Palam Station Road at the landing of Thathaneri bridge here caved in on Sunday.

The Minister, along with a group of cadre, inspected the roundabout which is under renovation as part of Swachh Iconic Places Initiative of Madurai Corporation. Beautification works in three roundabouts are over and the works are in progress at the roundabouts in Tirupparankundram and Sellur.

The civic body is giving a facelift to the Sellur roundabout at an estimated cost of ₹42 lakh and has planned to install a statue of a kabaddi player in the centre. According to a Corporation official, the granite floor was laid a month back.

But, residents of Sellur, who were present when the incident occurred, said that a group of AIADMK cadre were standing on the floor of the roundabout when it caved in suddenly, allegedly due to the poor quality of the structure. “They fell inside the pit filled with sewage and were lifted by other party men,” said a resident.

City Engineer S. Arasu said that an underground drainage pipeline burst had loosened the soil beneath the granite floor and led to the collapse of a portion. “We will attend to the pipeline burst immediately. Since, it is an ongoing project, we will strengthen the safety measures,” he added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/gks3ja/article31020507.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA09MDUROUNDABOUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/roundabout-caves-in-aiadmk-cadre-slip-into-pit-madurai/article31015806.ece
313,2020/03/08,HC nod for Christian convention,"Court imposes set of conditions for organisers to follow

MADURAI

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed Kanniyakumari police to consider the representation made to conduct a Christian convention in the district in mid-March. Disposing of the petition, the court imposed a set of conditions for the organisers to follow.

The court was hearing the petition filed by Rev. C. Ragavan of Kanniyakumari district, founder of Bethel Revival Ministries Trust. He had sought permission to conduct the convention on the trust premises. With the police denying permission, he moved the High Court for relief.

Justice A.D. Jagadish Chandira permitted the convention to be held on the trust premises, and said that the volume of speakers to be used at the event should be kept at a minimum level and the organisers should ensure that there was no disturbance to the public.

There should not be any speech that would affect the sentiments of any other religion, caste or race, the sovereignty of India, peace and harmony. The organisers should not erect any digital banners/placards on roads, platforms or walkways, the court said.

Further, the court said that the organisers should ensure that the conditions imposed were followed and no law and order problem was created. If any stage was to be erected for the event, a structural stability certificate should be obtained from Public Works Department.

If the meeting was stopped by the police on any valid ground on account of any emergency, the organisers should cooperate with them, the court said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-nod-for-christian-convention-madurai-kanniyakumari/article31015621.ece
314,2020/03/08,It’s watermelons everywhere in Dindigul,"People get ready to beat the rising heat

With rise in temperature, residents here are preparing to face the challenges of the season.

Thanks to the south-west and north-east monsoons last year, reservoirs received copious water and agriculture activities looked bright for many farmers across the State. Many dams, which were bone-dry, received surplus water.

Under such circumstances, the summer, which usually begins from April, appears to have arrived a month in advance. Any wonder then that on four-way lanes in and around the town and enroute to Palani and other places, roadside shacks selling watermelons have sprung up. Merchants say the fruit is flooding the market in the city too.

Watermelon is the most popular summer fruit followed by tender coconut and lemon juice, according to sellers near bus stand. This year, water melons have arrived from Tindivanam, Udumalpet, Easanatham, Theni and surrounding areas.

According to officials in the Horticulture Department, watermelon is harvested during the season and the arrivals will continue for the next 90 days. This year, some of the varieties in the market are Maharaja, Narmada 295, Apoorva and Kaveri. Some of them weigh anywhere between 3 to 10 kg each.

Some of the enterprising vendors sell a glass of watermelon juice at ₹10. Many purchase watermelon in large quantities as it has a reasonable shelf life, officials point out.

Avoid travel

Doctors at the government hospital say motorists should avoid riding their two-wheelers between noon and 3 p.m. In the event of any emergencies, people should travel by four-wheelers or buses.

In order to beat the heat, police have also started giving lemon juice to traffic police personnel manning signals across the State.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/h2q8na/article31015472.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA07WATERMELONDGL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/its-watermelons-everywhere-in-dindigul/article31015458.ece

317,2020/03/08,Rail fans mull contempt plea against Railways over cancellation of Karwar train,"Rail users in coastal Karnataka who are upset with the Railway Board’s decision to cancel the existing Bengaluru-Karwar overnight express to introduce the Yeshwantpur-Karwar express are mulling filing a contempt plea in the High Court of Karnataka against the Railways.

The board, on March 6, ordered cancellation of Train Nos. 16513-14/ 16523-24 Bengaluru-Karwar Express via Kunigal and via Mysuru, respectively, that were operated as combined services with the Bengaluru-Kannur overnight express upon insistence from Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. (KRCL). This was done while announcing a dedicated train between Bengaluru and Karwar bypassing Mangaluru region via the Padil bypass.

Vivek Nayak from Kundapura Railu Prayanikara Hitarakshana Vedike pointed out that the Bengaluru-Mangaluru-Kannur overnight express was ordered to be extended to Karwar by the High Court in 2012.

Advocate Shankar Bhat and others filed a PIL petition before the High Court after the Railway Board decided to extend the Bengaluru-Mangaluru overnight express to Kannur, ignoring the Inter-Railway Timetable Committee’s recommendation in 2009 to extend it to Karwar. South Western Railway (SWR) then decided to bifurcate the train at Mangaluru Central and run one portion each to Kannur and Karwar from November 1, 2012.

When SWR did not introduce a direct train to Karwar after the Bengaluru-Hassan new line was opened in 2017, again people had to approach the High Court. On the PIL petition of Sanjay Revankar from Kadwad near Karwar, SWR decided to run the existing Bengaluru-Kannur/Karwar overnight express on four days via Kunigal and three days via the old route of Mysuru.

‘Policy violated’

Rail fan Kundapura Gautam Shetty of Bengaluru said the Railway Board had violated its own policy of consulting users before cancelling any existing train. The board or KRCL cannot assume that the existing train would lose patronage with the introduction of the new train, as both cater to different sets of passengers, he argued.

S. Yogendra Swamy from Mysuru Grahaka Parishat said the cancellation had snatched coastal connectivity from travellers in Ramanagaram, Mandya and Mysuru, thereby violating the Railways policy of not cancelling services without any alternative.

MP for Udupi-Chikkamagaluru Shobha Karandlaje too had expressed displeasure with the cancellation during the flagging off ceremony at Yeshwantpur on Saturday morning.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/j9k804/article31011988.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGMANGTRAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/rail-fans-mull-contempt-plea-against-railways-over-cancellation-of-karwar-train/article31011989.ece

320,2020/03/08,Judge says India is taking steps towards gender equality,"‘It is necessary to have women in all sectors of life’

C.M. Joshi, Principal District and Sessions Judge, said on Saturday that the country was giving importance to gender equality and had been taking steps to achieve it.

He was speaking at a seminar on ‘Women Empowerment: Challenges and prospects,’ on the occasion of the International Women’s Day, organised by the Bar Association and the District Legal Services Authority, here.

Mr. Joshi said that the Constitution and the laws were all for gender equality. Important steps had been taken for its implementation.

“But its implementation has to be done by us and we have to ask ourselves have we implemented the mandate of the Constitution,” he said.

Mr. Joshi said that women were making their mark in all fields in the country now. They had even adorned the top posts in the country including that of the President and Prime Minister.

“Though women are been able to work in some important sectors, they had still not been able to work in all sectors. There are certain areas where we need to create an enabled world. It is necessary to have women in all sectors,” he said.

“The number of women in judiciary had been increasing slowly but steadily. More than 50% staff at the District Court Complex here were women. Once upon a time, there were lesser women advocates, but now their number had increased,” Mr. Joshi said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/judge-says-india-is-taking-steps-towards-gender-equality/article31011855.ece
321,2020/03/08,Some ideas to make your mutual fund investments tax-efficient,"By following a few simple steps to reduce the tax impact, investors can gain more out of mutual fund investments

In our article dated February 10, 2020 (Budget aftermath: reap the dividends, don’t fret) we discussed that the growth option of mutual fund (MF) schemes is more tax efficient than the dividend option, more so after the Union Budget presented on February 1. Let’s discuss this in detail.

There are two types of funds from the tax perspective — equity and debt. Hybrid funds are classified either as equity or debt in this respect. If a fund has more than 65% in equities, it is classified as an equity fund and more than 65% in debt makes it a debt fund for tax purposes.

Let’s start with equity funds. In equity funds, growth option becomes long term from the tax perspective after a holding period of one year. The taxation rule says, on your gains from the growth option, you pay tax at 10% plus surcharge and cess as applicable on gains of more than ₹1 lakh per financial year. In other words, up to ₹1 lakh of long-term capital gains per year is free from tax; beyond that you pay 10% plus surcharge and cess on your gains.

Tax efficiency

There is a method of generating further tax efficiency within this rule. Even if you do not want to move out from an equity stock/equity MF, and if the price/NAV has moved up since your purchase, you can sell (i.e. book the gains) and repurchase the same share/MF Scheme.

How does it help? It helps by creating a higher acquisition cost for tax purposes when you finally exit the stock/scheme. For taxation of equity, January 31, 2018 is known as the ‘grandfathering date’ i.e. prices /NAVs prior to this date is to be ignored and this becomes the cost of acquisition for all future dates. Let’s say the price/NAV as on January 31, 2018 was ₹100 and you would eventually sell it after seven years when the price would be say ₹170. At that point of time, you would pay tax on ₹170 minus ₹100 = ₹70, provided the gain is more than ₹1 lakh in that financial year and tax laws remain same as on today. Currently, two years have passed from January 31, 2018 and price/NAV has moved up to say ₹120 as on February 2020.

Today, if you sell the share / MF scheme at ₹120 and purchase it again, as long as the gains e.g. ₹120 minus ₹100 = ₹20 is within ₹1 lakh, it is tax free for you. How it helps you is, through this transaction, your cost of acquisition moves from ₹100 to ₹120, which will be relevant when you eventually sell it after another five years at ₹170. At that point of time, your gains will be ₹170 minus ₹120 = ₹50 instead of ₹170 minus ₹100 = ₹70.

To give another perspective to the same idea, let’s say you invested ₹10 lakh in equity MFs at an earlier date (more than one year ago) and the portfolio value as of today is say ₹10,99,000. You can redeem the entire portfolio as the gains are within ₹1 lakh in the financial year.

Higher acquisition cost

Since equity investments are long term, you invest again in the same funds and create a higher acquisition cost. If the market value of the portfolio today is say ₹11,50,000, then for executing this strategy, you have to sell as much as your gains are within ₹1 lakh in the financial year, to avoid paying tax. In the dividend option of MF Schemes, as and when the Union Budget proposals are passed and becomes applicable from April 1, 2020, you have to pay tax on dividends at your marginal slab rate, which for most investors is 30% plus surcharge and cess. In the growth option, as long as you hold it for one year and it becomes long term for tax purposes, you either pay tax at 10% or if the gains are less than ₹1 lakh, it becomes free of tax.

Now, let’s discuss the final piece on taxation of your equity MF investments. The illustrations above assume that you invested in the fund lump sum i.e. on a particular date and exited lump sum on a particular date. In reality, you may invest in a fund over multiple dates e.g. through a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) and may withdraw over multiple dates e.g. through a Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP). In such a scenario, to match against the exit, the NAV of your earliest investment in the fund will be taken.

The jargon for this is First- In-First-Out (FIFO). As an example, if you did a SIP in a fund from January 1, 2018 to January 1, 2019 and exit today, the acquisition NAV as on January 1, 2018 will be relevant for tax purposes i.e. today’s NAV minus that on January 1, 2018 is your gain. If you do an SWP from January 1, 2020 onwards, the first i.e. earliest investment will be considered for taxation, for every exit.

322,2020/03/08,Three essential ingredients to a child’s education plan,"With galloping inflation and high cost education, parents must go for a melange of investments to realise the dreams for their children

Building up a tidy sum towards children’s education is the top financial aspiration for most Indian parents and often takes precedence over every other goal.

Aware that an early start makes all the difference, many parents today are prepared to invest towards this right from the toddler stage.

But an early start will be of little use if you end up investing in the wrong class of products, based on emotional sales pitches that help line the pockets of product sellers more than investors. Here are some of the essential ingredients to building a healthy corpus for your child’s education.

Budget for high inflation

In India, the demand for quality education far outpaces the supply of seats offered by top-tier institutions. This mismatch, and the government’s efforts to make public education institutions more self-sustaining, has resulted in the cost of higher education galloping at a higher pace than the general inflation rate. Official data tells us that the CPI index for education increased at about 6% annually in the last eight years, but fees at the sought-after colleges have risen much faster.

In the IITs, for example, the total cost of a four-year B-Tech course adds up to ₹8-10 lakh today, a fourfold increase from about ₹2 lakh in 2012. The course fee at the top three IIMs is about ₹21-22 lakh against ₹13-15 lakh in 2012.

The cost of putting your child through private colleges is significantly higher. BITS Pilani levies ₹20-24 lakh for a four-year B Tech degree. The cost of a BA (Hons), BSc (Hons) at the Ashoka University is close to ₹28 lakh.

So, while the current cost of a graduate plus post-graduate degree at premier institutions is about ₹30-40 lakh, you need to budget for inflation in these costs over the next 10-20 years to decide on your target corpus.

Many online calculators help you figure out this target corpus. While using them, be sure to use inflation assumptions of 8-10%, rather than the default numbers of 5-6% to get to a realistic figure. For instance, at 8% inflation, ₹30 lakh in today’s prices will be about ₹95 lakh in 15 years’ time.

Don’t shun equities

Many folks investing for their child’s education like to stick with safe debt options such as traditional insurance plans or post office schemes for this goal because they offer capital safety. But safety is usually accompanied by modest returns, so doing this can result in your child’s education corpus falling well short of target with inflation over time. Traditional ‘child’ insurance plans offer just 5-6% annual returns. Returns from post office schemes such as the NSC/PPF and Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana are healthier at 7.9% and 8.4% respectively. But even these may barely match inflation in education costs. This makes a sizeable equity component essential to get to your child’s education goal.

The higher return potential of equities also reduce the amount of savings you will need to set aside towards your child’s education. At an 8% return, to get to ₹95 lakh in 15 years’ time in the above example, you will need to invest roughly ₹27,500 a month. But at a 11% return, the monthly investment reduces to about ₹21,000.

But equities need a long runway to deliver decent returns and can wreak havoc with your capital for horizons less than 5-7 years. So, to ensure that equity bets pay off, you need to make an early start on your child’s education investments, ideally starting when he/she is 3-5 years old.

Have a dollar component

If you have your heart set on a foreign college degree for your child in the western world, you can budget for lower inflation in college fees, at 3-4% a year. But one factor that can throw your plans off kilter is the rupee depreciating against foreign currencies. The rupee has typically depreciated by 3-4% annually against the dollar in the last decade. Investing a portion of your child’s education portfolio (say 10-15%) in mutual funds that invest in U.S.-listed stocks can help you gain from the rupee depreciation and hedge this risk.

Look beyond ‘child’ plans

Financial product sellers in India are well aware that children’s education is an emotional issue for parents. They promote a wide range of ‘special child plans’ that are long on slick packaging and short on benefits. So, before investing in a ‘child plan,’ the first question to ask is if a plain-vanilla product will not do better for your child’s education.

Here are some specific red flags to avoid. Child endowment and money-back plans from insurers with a return guarantee usually offer very low returns to make up for the safety. They are avoidable as they may fail to keep up with inflation. Many of these plans, strangely enough, bundle in a life cover for your child. What you need, instead, is an adequate term insurance cover for yourself and other breadwinners in your family, so that your child’s education needs are met even if you aren’t around.

Mutual funds schemes that are specially designated as ‘child plans’ often carry five-year lock-ins and exit loads which prevent you from switching out in the event of the fund lagging its peers. Plain, aggressive hybrid funds or multi-cap equity funds make for a far better choice, offering the same return potential with greater flexibility. Overall, a combination of post office schemes such as NSC/PPF and SIPs in two to three multi-cap equity funds and a generous term insurance cover for the breadwinners , are the essential ingredients to make the dreams for your child come true.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ibffz8/article31011097.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th07BUMW,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/three-essential-ingredients-to-a-childs-education-plan/article31011098.ece
323,2020/03/08,What does the Supreme Court order reinstating virtual currency activities mean?,"Why does the RBI find virtual currencies problematic?

The story so far: On Wednesday, March 4, a three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court of India struck down a 2018 circular of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which sought to prevent banks and institutions from dealing in “virtual currencies” — also referred to as cryptocurrencies, an example being Bitcoin — and providing services to those engaged in trading in such currencies. The Court order comes seven months after an inter-ministerial committee recommended that cryptocurrencies be banned, proposing instead that an official digital currency be launched in the country.

Why did the case land in court?

It has its origins in the writ petitions filed by the industry body, the Internet and Mobile Association of India, and several crypto exchanges, their shareholders, and traders. They challenged the RBI circular on many counts. Through that circular, the RBI had forbidden banks from extending a range of services to facilitate individuals and entities in dealing with cryptocurrencies. The list of such services included “maintaining accounts, registering, trading, settling, clearing, giving loans against virtual tokens, accepting them as collateral, opening accounts of exchanges dealing with them and transfer/receipt of money in accounts relating to purchase/sale of VCs [or virtual currencies].”

The petitioners gave instances of virtual currency exchanges shutting down as a result of this circular. There was also a mention of how money lying in the account of one of the exchanges got frozen. The petitioners questioned the RBI’s power in prohibiting trading in virtual currencies; they wondered how the RBI could propose an outright ban when all other stakeholders such as the Department of Economic Affairs, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Central Board of Direct Taxes, among others, had batted for a regulatory regime; they also challenged the circular on the grounds of lack of proportionality (the idea that regulatory action shouldn’t be disproportionate to the goals such action seeks to achieve).

This can be understood by how the RBI defined virtual currencies in 2013, which the Court said was perhaps the first time it took note of “technology risks in changing business environment”. The RBI defined such currency, the Court order notes, “as a type of unregulated digital money, issued and controlled by its developers and used and accepted by the members of a specific virtual community”. The absence of a centralised authority running it, seen as a plus by those who back cryptocurrencies, is viewed as a drawback by official monetary systems. There are other factors too. The value of such currencies has been driven purely by speculative impulses, and they have had a volatile journey all along. The anonymity that the system ensures has also been misused in the past, with cryptocurrencies said to enable funding of terrorist operations. There is also fear that it could undermine the monetary system and render policies ineffective. And all these fears are shared by the global financial system.

Why did the Court rule in favour of the petitioners?

Justices Rohinton Nariman, Aniruddha Bose and V. Ramasubramanian set aside the RBI circular of 2018, saying, “It is not possible for us to hold that the impugned measure is proportionate.” Their reasoning was based on the fact that the RBI had not found that the activities of virtual currency exchanges had adversely affected the entities it regulated. This, even as virtual currencies have not been banned in the country. “But the trading in VCs and the functioning of VC exchanges are sent to comatose by the impugned circular by disconnecting their lifeline namely, the interface with the regular banking sector,” the order said.

But while doing so, they have indicated quite strongly that the central bank has the requisite power to regulate or prohibit virtual currencies. They have noted that: “Anything that may pose a threat to or have an impact on the financial system of the country, can be regulated or prohibited by RBI, despite the said activity not forming part of the credit system or payment system.”

Will relief for the cryptocurrency ecosystem be shortlived?

Quite likely. The inter-Ministerial committee had recommended an outright ban on crypto currencies. A draft law was also put in place. This verdict may not have changed the direction in which our policymakers want to go with respect to cryptocurrencies. The Economic Times has reported that the RBI is planning to file a review petition in the Supreme Court.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/jmjrs3/article31010928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THiStock-914035064,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/what-does-the-supreme-court-order-reinstating-virtual-currency-activities-mean/article31010937.ece
324,2020/03/08,Lettuce grown in space as nutritious as ones on Earth: NASA,"Apart from a welcome diet change, the fresh produce may provide astronauts with additional potassium as well as vitamins.

Researchers have found that the salad crop, red romaine lettuce, grown on board the International Space Station (ISS), is as nutritious as counterparts grown on the Earth, an advance that may help astronauts grow safe, fresh food during space missions.

According to the study, published in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science, the space-grown lettuce is free of disease-causing microbes and safe to eat, and is at least as nutritious as the Earth-grown plants.

The researchers, including Christina Khodadad from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in the U.S., said that the lettuce is nutritious despite being grown under lower gravity and more intense radiation than on the Earth.

Traditionally, astronauts in space live on processed, pre-packaged space rations such as fruits, nuts, chocolate, shrimp cocktails, peanut butter, chicken, and beef to name a few, they said.

Apart from a welcome diet change, the researchers said, the fresh produce may provide astronauts with additional potassium as well as vitamins K, B1, and C – nutrients that are less abundant in pre-packaged rations, and degrade during long-term storage.

Ms. Khodadad and her team believe that growing crops on board may be especially useful on long-distance space missions such as the upcoming Artemis-III missions, scheduled to land humans on the lunar South pole by 2024, and NASA’s first crewed mission to Mars, planned for the late 2020s.

“The ability to grow food in a sustainable system that is safe for crew consumption will become critical as NASA moves toward longer missions. Salad-type, leafy greens can be grown and consumed fresh with few resources,” Ms. Khodadad said.

The study noted that between 2014 and 2016, lettuce was grown on board the ISS from surface-sterilised seeds within Vegetable Production Systems, nicknamed “Veggie” – growth chambers equipped with LED lighting and a watering system, specifically designed to grow crops in space.

It said the crops grew undisturbed inside the Veggie units for 33 to 56 days, until crew members ate part of the mature leaves without any negative health effects.

The scientists said the remainder of the crops was deep-frozen until transport back to the Earth for chemical and biological analysis.

As a control, the researchers also grew plants on the Earth under the same conditions – possible because temperature, carbon dioxide, and humidity data were logged on board the ISS, and replicated in labs with a 24 to 48 hour delay.

They said the space-grown lettuce was similar in composition to the Earth-based controls.

The study noted that in some trials, the space-grown plants tended to be richer in elements like potassium, sodium, phosphorus, sulphur, and zinc, as well as in some molecules with proven antiviral, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activity.

It said both varieties of lettuce also had similar levels of anthocyanin, and other antioxidants – molecules in food which can protect cells from damage by highly reactive natural chemicals present in the body.

When the scientists assessed the microbes growing on the lettuce varieties, they found that the typical Earth-grown plants harboured a diverse set of microbes with specialised, beneficial bacteria, and those that neither harm nor benefit their host.

They said these microbes can affect the health of plants and their suitability as food.

Using DNA sequencing technology, the researchers then characterised the communities of fungi and bacteria growing on the lettuce, and identified the 15 most abundant microbial genera on the leaves and 20 in the roots.

The findings revealed that the diversity and identity of these microbes were similar for space- and Earth-grown lettuce.

None of the detected bacteria genera are known to cause disease in humans, the scientists said.

They said the leaves never carried any dangerous bacteria known to occasionally contaminate crops, such as E. coli, Salmonella, and S. aureus, adding that the fungal and mould spores on them were also in the range fit for human consumption.

According to the study, the lettuce grown in the Veggie units is safe to eat, opening the door for experiments with other nutritious and tasty crops onboard the space station that may help astronauts journey further into space.

“The International Space Station is serving as a test bed for future long-duration missions, and these types of crop growth tests are helping to expand the suite of candidates that can be effectively grown in microgravity,” said study co-author Gioia Massa, a project scientist at the Kennedy Space Center.

“Future tests will study other types of leafy crops as well as small fruits like pepper and tomatoes, to help provide supplemental fresh produce for the astronaut diet,” Ms. Massa added.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/o146n7/article31014393.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LETTUCE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/lettuce-grown-in-space-as-nutritious-as-ones-on-earth-nasa/article31014394.ece

After being grilled for more than 15 hours, Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor was placed under arrest by the Enforcement Directorate early on Sunday.

The Central agency had first questioned Mr. Kapoor at his Worli residence on Friday and later brought him to its office on Saturday morning, where he was questioned throughout the day.

“Despite prolonged questioning, Mr. Kapoor was found to be uncooperative and hence, the need for custodial interrogation was deemed necessary. He was arrested in the early hours of the morning and charged under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA),” an ED officer said.

Later in the day, ED officials stopped his daughter, Roshni, from taking a flight to London as she is required to join the probe in the PMLA case, officials said. They said Ms. Kapoor was disallowed to board the flight from Mumbai on the basis of a Look Out Circular (LoC) issued against her by the Central agency. The LoC requires immigration authorities to intimate the issuing agency before they allow the passenger to travel to any international or domestic location.

Told to join probe

Ms. Roshni Kapoor was asked to join the investigation after she was intercepted by immigration authorities, officials said.

The Central Bureau of Investigation has registered a separate offence against Mr. Kapoor. “We have booked him for cheating under the IPC, along with accepting illegal gratification and misconduct under the Prevention of Corruption Act,” a CBI officer said.

Mr. Kapoor is under the scanner for granting large loans to the crisis-hit Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL), allegedly in exchange for kickbacks to the tune of ₹600 crore that were paid into accounts of his family members. The ED on Saturday also conducted searches at the office of DOIT Urban Ventures, a firm owned by Mr. Kapoor’s daughters Radha and Roshni. The ED also questioned Mr Kapoor’s wife in connection with the case on Sunday.

“We have found prima facie evidence that establishes transactions between DOIT and DHFL. We have seized electronic storage devices and balance sheets pertaining to the same,” the officer said.

Mr Kapoor was produced in a holiday court on Sunday afternoon, where the ED sought his custody for five days. The ED argued that sub-standard properties were mortgaged by DHFL for the loans that it took, and that the money trail had to be examined, for which custody was necessary. The defence, on the other hand, argued that Mr. Kapoor was being targetted and that he was ready to provide any evidence necessary.

Mr Kapoor, meanwhile, claimed that he had taken “loans” from DHFL for his daughters’ business venture and that the entire amount, with interest has been paid. The court, after hearing all arguments, remanded Mr. Kapoor in the ED's custody till March 11.

326,2020/03/08,"Yes Bank crisis | Indian banks well capitalised, no reason to worry: Chief Economic Adviser","Krishnamurthy Subramanian further said that it is a wrong method to assess a lender’s health based on the ratio of deposit to market capitalisation

In the wake of the moratorium on private sector lender Yes Bank, the RBI clarified on Sunday that deposits of customers were safe.

“Concern has been raised in certain sections of media about safety of deposits of certain banks. This concern is based on analysis which is flawed. Solvency of banks is internationally based on Capital to Risk Weighted Assets (CRAR) and not on market cap,” the RBI said in a social media post.

“The RBI closely monitors all the banks and hereby assures all depositors that there is no such concern of safety of their deposits in any bank,” it said.

Allaying concerns over the banking sector health, Chief Economic Adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian on Sunday said Indian banks were well capitalised and there was no reason to worry. He said it was a wrong method to assess a lender’s health based on the ratio of deposit to m-cap

(market capitalisation).







“What I want to emphatically state that the m-cap ratio is a totally incorrect metric for assessing the safety of the banks. No banking sector expert or banking regulator uses this measure,” Mr. Subramanian said while addressing a select mediapersons at his office here.

After what unfolded about the crisis-hit Yes Bank recently, top government functionaries including Finance Minister Sitharaman, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das and the chief economic advisor have been trying to assuage panicked investors.

The CEA said that no banking sector experts or regulators use deposit/m-cap ratio as a measure to gauge resilience of banks rather it is the capital to risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and other such metrics that can rightly gauge the health of banks.

Also read: Explained: Why did Yes Bank have to be bailed out?

“What banking sector experts and regulators use is what is called the CRAR. It is important to keep this in mind that the international norms for CRAR is 8% and Indian banks on an average have a CRAR of 14.3%.

“So, 8% is the mandated minimum norm and our banks on the average have 14.3% (CRAR). Now 14.3% versus 8% almost translates into 80% greater capital than the international norms,” he said.

He further said that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mandates the Indian banks to keep CRAR at 9%.

“Even compared to that our banks have 60% more capital. So this is something that is very important.”

Giving reasons as to why the deposit/m-cap ratio is an incorrect measure to assess the health of the banks, he said the m-cap ratio is essentially the ratio of the deposits that a bank has to its market capitalisation.

“Now if you compare for instance any bank, let’s say a private sector bank with the State Bank of India, State Bank of India would have an order of magnitude of higher m-cap ratio.

“But the State Bank of India is as safe as the any other bank in the world. In fact it is the only Indian bank to be the part of the top 100 banks internationally.”

So this ratio does not really capture the safety of a bank because it is actually affected by the market capitalisation. “As you all know the stock price of a bank can change minute to minute, as a result the m-cap ratio will also change minute to minute but the solvency cannot change minute to minute,” Mr. Subramanian said.

He also emphasised that the Indian banks on an average have a CRAR of 14.3%, which is way more higher -- about 80 per cent greater than the global measures.

“So our banks on an average are very-very well capitalised, so there is absolutely no reason to worry. Also, the government has increased the limit for deposits that are insured to up to Rs 5 lakh, which covers a large majority of the deposits.

“Together with the fact that our banks are well capitalised and the fact that the deposits are well taken care of, there is absolutely no reason for anyone to worry,” he said.

A day after imposing a 30-day moratorium on Yes Bank and capping withdrawal limit at ₹50,000, the RBI on Friday evening had issued a draft reconstruction scheme for the private sector lender.

As per the RBI’s draft reconstruction scheme, State Bank of India will pick up 49% stake in the crisis-ridden Yes Bank under a government-approved bailout plan.

327,2020/03/08,"Exempt telcos with under 15% market share from floor price norms: BSNL, MTNL to TRAI","Reliance Jio leads the India mobile subscriber market.

State-owned BSNL and MTNL have told the sector regulator TRAI that tariff fixation should be applicable only on telcos with more than 15% subscriber base in a service area, while those with lower or negligible user base should be exempt from the purview of minimum floor price.

It is pertinent to mention here that Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) – which operates telecom services across India except Delhi and Mumbai circles – has about 10.3% market share in all India mobile subscriber base. Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL), present in Delhi and Mumbai, has 0.29% mobile market share, as per the latest TRAI data.

Reliance Jio leads the India mobile subscriber market with a share of 32.1%, while Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have 28.43% share and 28.89% share on an all India basis, respectively.

In their suggestions to TRAI, the two public sector operators have acknowledged that the telecom industry is facing heat due to sudden and unexpected entry of “capital rich telecom service providers” offering free and ultra low tariffs, leading to closure of many players and that the situation has got compounded by companies required to make huge Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) payouts after the Supreme Court order.

“...the telecom industry needs a helping hand – at least in the immediate short term – from the authority to survive ,” the two companies have told TRAI in nearly identical submissions.

The two have batted for fixing of floor prices by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) but with a rider.

“...the fixing of floor price should be limited and applicable to Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) having a minimum subscriber base of 15% in that LSA (Licensed Service Area) otherwise floor price may wipe out the prospective new TSP/TSP having small customer base from the telecom business altogether,” BSNL and MTNL have said.

They added that to mitigate the present stress and to ensure adoption of future technologies, BSNL and MTNL both support the regulatory intervention for tariff fixation of the TRAI with condition that operator with 15% or less market share in that LSA be exempt.

The operators require a minimum customer base to remain viable and survive, BSNL and MTNL have reasoned in their comments submitted on TRAI consultation paper on “tariff issues of telecom services”.

“Considering the financial health of the telecom industry and demands of major telecom service providers, BSNL feels that there is a need for a change in TRAI policy of forebearence in tariffs as a short term major,” BSNL said.

The state owned telecom companies have also said that although the operators have hiked their tariff recently, they remain susceptible from each other to maintain their customer base.

Even with the increase in tariffs the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) levels are below the levels needed for long term survival, they felt.

The two have favoured fixation of floor price based on average industry costs, and added that a markup of minimum 25% or as approved by TRAI above the current industry cost.

BSNL and MTNL in their separate submissions have said irrespective of the parameters used to fix the floor prices, TRAI should ensure that the exercise does not result in windfall profits for a few operators.

They have said that floor prices should be fixed for mobile data services – applied uniformly to different category of subscribers.

The public sector operators have also said that floor price should also be put for voice calls and SMS – a position different from private telecom operators.

“In the present competitive situation, the tariff for voice calls have been worst causality and therefore it cannot be left without the intervention of the authority. In fact, the need to fix floor price for voice calls is as strong as for mobile data,” BSNL and MTNL have said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aifn5o/article29777423.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02bsnlvg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/exempt-telcos-with-under-15-market-share-from-floor-price-norms-bsnl-mtnl-to-trai/article31015344.ece
328,2020/03/08,Explained: Why did Yes Bank have to be bailed out?,"How will the Reserve Bank of India plan impact depositors? What are the implications for the banking sector?

The story so far: On the advice of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the government imposed a moratorium on Yes Bank with effect from 6 p.m. on March 5 up to April 3. Subsequently, the RBI superseded the private sector lender’s board and appointed as an administrator, Prashant Kumar, who was serving as chief financial officer and deputy managing director at State Bank of India (SBI). Mr. Kumar resigned from the SBI to assume charge as the administrator of Yes Bank. Under the moratorium, deposit withdrawals have been capped at ₹50,000. Within 24 hours, the RBI proposed a reconstruction scheme under which SBI could take a maximum 49% stake in the restructured capital of the bank.





Why was the moratorium imposed?

The banking regulator, while recommending the moratorium, cited a steady decline in Yes Bank’s financial position mainly due to the lender’s inability to raise adequate capital to make provisions for potential non-performing assets. This failing resulted in downgrades by credit rating agencies, which in turn made capital raising even more difficult — a vicious cycle that further worsened its financials.

This apart there were serious lapses in corporate governance.

The RBI said, “The bank has also experienced serious governance issues and practices in the recent years which have led to steady decline of the bank,” adding that it had been in constant engagement with the bank’s management to find ways to strengthen its balance sheet and liquidity.

“Since a bank and market led revival is a preferred option over a regulatory restructuring, the Reserve Bank made all efforts to facilitate such a process and gave adequate opportunity to the bank’s management to draw up a credible revival plan, which did not materialise. In the meantime, the bank was facing regular outflow of liquidity,” the RBI explained on March 5, laying out the rationale for the moratorium.

When did it all start?

As on March 31, 2014, the bank’s loan book was ₹55,633 crore and deposits were ₹74,192 crore. Since then, over the next five-and-a-half years, the loan book expanded fourfold to ₹2,24,505 crore as on September 30, 2019, at the end of the second quarter of the current financial year, while deposit growth failed to keep pace and increased less than three times to ₹2,09,497 crore. The bank is yet to announce results for the third quarter.

Asset quality also worsened during the period with gross non-performing assets sharply rising from 0.31% as on March 31, 2014, to 7.39% at the end of September 2019.

The exponential growth at Yes Bank during that period also came under the regulator’s scanner. The lender has substantial exposure to several troubled borrowers including the Anil Ambani-led Reliance group, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) and IL&FS. This resulted in the RBI refusing to grant its then Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Rana Kapoor — also the bank’s co-founder — another three-year term after his tenure ended in August 2018. The RBI did not make public the reason for its decision to not extend Mr. Kapoor’s term. Finally he was given an extension till end-January 2019.

The tipping point probably came earlier this year when one of the bank’s independent directors and chairman of the board’s audit committee, Uttam Prakash Agarwal, resigned from the board in January citing governance issues. The RBI, meanwhile, had been taking stock of the developments at the bank on a regular basis for the last few months.

What will be the likely impact on depositors?

While deposit withdrawals have been capped at ₹50,000, there are exceptions under which a higher amount can be withdrawn, with the permission of the RBI.

The RBI can allow a customer to withdraw more than ₹50,000 under the following conditions: (i) in connection with the medical treatment of the depositor or any person actually dependent on the depositor; (ii) towards the cost of higher education of the depositor or any person actually dependent on him for education in India or outside India; (iii) to pay obligatory expenses in connection with marriage or other ceremonies of the depositor or his/her children or of any other person actually dependent upon depositor; (iv) or any other unavoidable emergency.

The total withdrawal should, however, not exceed ₹5 lakh or the actual balance in the account, whichever is lower.

What about deposit insurance?

In case Yes Bank goes belly up for any reason, depositors will not lose all their money since deposits up to ₹5 lakh are covered under deposit insurance.

While the deposit insurance cover was ₹1 lakh till recently, this was increased to ₹5 lakh in the aftermath of the crisis at the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank Limited where caps too were set on deposit withdrawals. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the increase in deposit insurance in the Budget.

Will the developments at Yes Bank pose a systemic risk?

While the government and the regulator have asserted that the problem is solely related to this particular bank, ratings agency Fitch Ratings said the latest developments spotlight the governance risks in India’s banking sector.

It said, “There is a risk that the already poor operating environment for the banking sector could suffer further impairment if the government’s efforts to tackle problems in the bank fail to provide reassurance to depositors and investors,” while also assigning a negative outlook to India’s banking sector.

What is the way forward?

The RBI has come up with a draft reconstruction plan for Yes Bank which proposes that depositors’ funds would be protected. The employees would also have the same service conditions, including remuneration, at least for one year. However, in the case of key managerial personnel, the new board would be empowered to take a call.

The SBI, which has received board approval to invest in Yes Bank, will have to pick up to 49% stake, according to the scheme, at a price that is not less than ₹10 for each share having a face value of ₹2.

The investor bank (SBI) also cannot reduce its holding below 26% before the completion of three years from the date of infusion of the capital.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/6gw2ga/article31010979.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THINDIAECONOMY,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/why-did-yes-bank-have-to-be-bailed-out/article31010980.ece
