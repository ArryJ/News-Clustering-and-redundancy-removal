0,2020/03/20,Weightlifting | Mirabai Chanu sure-shot for her second Olympics,"Jeremy Lalrinnunga also set to make the cut for the quadrennial event

Weightlifting’s Olympic qualifying schedule has gone haywire due to the Covid-19 pandemic but India’s Mirabai Chanu is a sure-shot for the Tokyo Games, if they are held, while young Jeremy Lalrinnunga is also set to make the cut for the mega sporting spectacle.

Former World champion Mirabai currently occupies third place in the women’s 49kg world rankings following the cancellation of the Asian Championships, the last Olympics qualifying event of the continent due to the coronavirus outbreak.

She has taken part in five events out of the six mandated in the new qualification rules.

In a meeting of the Executive Board of the International Weightlifting Federation held on March 17-18 via video conference, the world body has made some recommendations to the International Olympic Association (IOC) regarding the Olympic qualifying events.

One of the key recommendations, sources said, may close the qualification process as all the five continental championships were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Final call

This would mean the Olympics qualification slots will be decided based on the current world rankings. The IOC will, however, take a final call on the recommendations of the International Weightlifting Federation.

“Mirabai is certain to the qualify for the Olympics, she is currently at third spot in the world rankings. The top eight from the world rankings after the end of the qualification period automatically qualifies for Tokyo Olympics,” Indian Weightlifting Federation secretary-general Sahdev Yadav said.

No more events likely

“She has competed in five qualifying events but the sixth one, the Asian Championships in Tashkent was cancelled. I think there will be no more qualifying events and the world rankings is set to be based on what it currently is.”

Under the new rules, to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics, a weightlifter must compete in at least one event in each of the three periods of six months (spread over November 2018 to April 2020), at least six events overall and in at least one gold and silver-level event.

The 25-year-old Mirabai has now collected 3869 Robi points — the IWF’s official calculation method — to be placed third behind Hou Zhihui (4703) of China and Ri Song Gum (4209) of North Korea.

Regarding the 17-year-old Jeremy (men’s 67kg), who won a gold in 62kg in the 2018 Youth Olympic Games, Sahdev said, “In the Olympics, there will be 14 competitors in each weight category, men and women. Besides the top eight from the world rankings, the top ranker from each of the five continents will also qualify. Jeremy is at the top of Asian rankings and if the international federation’s recommendations are accepted by the IOC, he will also qualify.”

Jeremy is at the top of Asian rankings with 3119 Robi points, far ahead of second-placed Mohammed Almazyadi Nawaf (2672) from Saudi Arabia. He is set for his maiden Olympics.

The last slot will be from the host country, if that country (Japan) has not qualified from this method. But if a weightlifter from the host country has qualified, the last slot will be given through the tripartite commission process.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/n5jept/article31122475.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21CHANU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/mirabai-chanu-sure-shot-for-her-second-olympics/article31122476.ece
1,2020/03/20,"NRAI postpones Olympic selection panel meeting, coaching camps","NRAI requests marksmen and coaches to train from their home base

The National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) has postponed the Olympic selection committee meeting which was scheduled for Friday.

With the growing uncertainty triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, the NRAI also decided to postpone all the coaching camps scheduled for April.

“We urge all Olympics-bound shooters and national coaches to refrain from coming to the range till further notice, and request that they continue with their respective training schedules from their home base, as best as they can,” said the president of the NRAI, Raninder Singh, in a statement.

Requesting the senior coaches to refrain from travel, the NRAI president urged the shooting fraternity to not lose focus on the main goal of best performance in the Olympics in Tokyo, as and when it was held.

With 15 shooters having qualified for the Olympics, the original plan was to announce the Olympic team after the World Cup in Delhi, which has subsequently been postponed to May.

In an attempt to compensate for the requisite scores, the NRAI went ahead and conducted the selection trials for all the Olympic qualified shooters.

Some suspense

Even though most of the shooters would comfortably be holding on to their Olympic quota that they had won in the World Championship, World Cups and the Asian Championship, there could be some suspense in a couple of events, as to who would be chosen by the national federation to represent the country in the Olympics.

With the situation fluid, the NRAI realised that there was no urgency to finalise the Olympic team, as the world of sports had been compelled to face weeks of inaction, owing to the global concern for everyone’s health.

Meanwhile, the public dealings at the NRAI House in Tughlakabad have also been stopped till the end of the month.

It has been stated that no visitors would be allowed at the shooting headquarters, and senior NRAI officials would work from home.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/nrai-postpones-olympic-selection-panel-meeting-coaching-camps/article31122422.ece
2,2020/03/20,Ding Liren gets off the mark in Candidates Chess Tournament,"Top seed Fabiano Caruana’s ambitious plan backfires

Top seed Fabiano Caruana’s ambitious plan to surprise Ding Liren backfired in the third round of the Candidates Chess Tournament. The American lost, as his second-seeded Chinese rival finally was able to post a point.

Ding had lost both his previous games and looked worried when Caruana, playing the black side of a Slav Defence, sacrificed two pawns. The top seed succeeded in sowing doubts in his opponent's mind with his novelty on the ninth move. Ding had fallen behind the clock by about an hour after 20 moves.

But, soon he found that Caruana had little compensation for the two pawns. Black then gave up a knight for two pawns, on the 35th move, but he was clearly losing. He resigned seven moves later.

The results (third round): Ding Liren (Chn) 1 bt Fabiano Caruana (US) 1.5; Kirill Alekseenko (Rus) 1 drew with Ian Nepomniachtchi (Rus) 2; Alexander Grischuk (Rus) 1.5 drew with Wang Hao (Chn) 2; Anish Giri (Ned) 1 drew with Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (Fra) 2.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ding-liren-gets-off-the-mark-in-candidates-chess-tournament/article31122350.ece

7,2020/03/20,"Spain toll crosses 1,000","The COVID-19 death toll rose to 1,002 in Spain on Friday after 235 people died in 24 hours, and the number of cases approached 20,000, the Health Ministry said. The spiralling number of infections has propelled Spain into the top four worst-hit countries in the world — with the figures growing as the country steps up its capacity for testing. Over the past seven days, the number of deaths has risen 10-fold, the figures show.

Since the last update around mid-day on Thursday, another 2,833 infections have been confirmed, taking the overall number of cases to 19,980, the ministry's emergencies coordinator Fernando Simon said.

But he said it was “very likely that the figures underestimated the overall number” of people with the virus, saying the testing laboratories were “overwhelmed” which could skew the numbers.

Of those diagnosed, 52 % were in hospital and around 6% were being treated in intensive care.

The State Department had already said it was suspending visa issuance at most posts overseas. But Friday’s order was global and, while temporary, there was no date set for services to resume.

The suspension will not in itself affect travellers, largely from Western and wealthy Asian nations, who can come to the United States without visas.

However, the United States has temporarily halted arrivals of most Europeans in a move to halt the spread of the pandemic.

Mr. Trump charged on Thursday that the world is “paying a big price” for China’s lack of transparency on the outbreak when it emerged in the central city of Wuhan late last year.

China has been criticised for suppressing information and punishing whistleblowers during the early stages of the contagion, which has killed more than 10,000 people. “Some people on the U.S. side are trying to stigmatise China’s fight against the epidemic, and shift the blame onto China,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.

Great sacrifice

“This approach ignores the great sacrifice made by the Chinese people to safeguard the health and safety of humankind, and slanders China’s major contribution to global public health.”

Mr. Geng said China has shared data with the U.S. throughout the health crisis.

The exchange marked an escalation in the bitter war of words between China and the U.S. over the past week.

China’s announcement this week of mass expulsions of American journalists sparked a media freedom row that coincided with Trump's ramped-up usage of the term “Chinese Virus”, which he claimed was in response to Chinese misinformation suggesting that the virus originated in the U.S.

In recent days, Chinese state media has been heavily critical of Mr. Trump.

They come to bless those suffering the most from the virus. And then, more and more often, Italy’s priests die themselves. The diocese of Bergamo northeast of Milan appears to have been ravaged the most by the stealth killer. At least 10 of its priests have died of coronavirus (COVID-19), the Catholic daily Avvenire reported Thursday.

The deaths, whether of priests or members of their communities, are “so numerous that it is difficult to count”, the paper wrote.

Five more fatalities were registered in the city of Parma. Still more virus-related deaths emerged among priests in Brescia, Cremona and the northern industrial hub of Milan itself.

14,2020/03/20,24 killed in Afghan insider attack,"Pre-dawn raid targets joint police and army headquarters.

At least two dozen Afghan security forces were killed on Friday in an insider attack on their base in southern Afghanistan, officials said, as fighting raged in the war-weary country while efforts to start talks with the Taliban stalled.

The pre-dawn attack in Zabul province comes as Afghanistan is grappling with several crises including an increase in Taliban violence that has thrown a supposed peace process into turmoil, mounting coronavirus (COVID-19)cases, and a political feud that has seen two men claim the presidency.

Also Read Coronavirus | Janata curfew on March 22 between 7 am and 9 pm, says Modi

The attack in Zabul saw several “infiltrators” open fire on their comrades as they slept, according to provincial Governor Rahmatullah Yarmal, in one of the deadliest attacks since the U.S. signed a withdrawal deal with the Taliban last month.

The pre-dawn raid targeted a joint police and army headquarters near Qalat, the provincial capital. “In the attack, 14 Afghan Army forces and 10 policemen were killed,” Zabul provincial council chief Ata Jan Haq Bayan said.

Connection with Taliban

He added that four other Afghan service members were missing. “The attackers had connections with the Taliban insurgents,” Mr. Bayan said. They fled in two military Humvee vehicles, along with a pickup truck, weapons and ammunition. Mr. Yarmal confirmed the toll.

Hours after the incident the Defence Ministry vowed to retaliate, while also giving a lower death toll for the attack, saying just 17 were killed. The Afghan security forces “will not leave this attack unanswered and will avenge the blood of the martyrs” the Ministry added in a statement. The U.S. embassy later condemned the attack on Twitter, saying “the time for peace is now”.

Zabul province, bordering Pakistan, has long been an insurgent stronghold and was the holdout for former Taliban supreme leader Mullah Omar, who died in 2013.

The Zabul attack comes just a day after Afghan Defence Minister Asadullah Khalid called on the Taliban to commit to a ceasefire as a way of tackling COVID-19, which observers fear is spreading unchecked through the impoverished country.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/24-killed-in-afghan-insider-attack/article31121759.ece

More than 10,000 people have now died in the COVID-19 pandemic that has swept throughout the world, forcing the confinement of tens of millions in their homes.

As the virus has marched westwards, the severity of the outbreaks and the focus of concern has shifted from Asia to Europe, with increasingly tough restrictions being imposed by national governments.

Globally, at least 251,347 have been infected of which 89,945 people recovered.

The U.S. State of California, among the worst hit in the country, has told its 40 million residents to stay at home, the most drastic move yet in the United States to combat the pandemic.

France announced more than 4,000 people were fined on the first day of its confinement. France and Italy have both said they will most likely extend the confinement beyond the initial periods, while British schools will close indefinitely on Friday.

Germany’s biggest state Bavaria on Friday became the first region in the country to order a lockdown for two weeks, imposing “fundamental restrictions” on going out.

The strict measures follow the template set by China, where a lockdown imposed in Hubei province where the COVID-19 first emerged, appears to have paid off.

Europe now accounts for half of the 10,000 fatalities linked to the COVID-19 disease around the world.

However, accurate figures are difficult to come by as many of those who die are suffering from other illnesses and infection rates are uncertain because of a lack of testing in many countries.

Relief package

The United States is showing signs that it is ramping up its efforts on all fronts, fast-tracking antimalarial drugs for use as a treatment against the virus and promising a $1 trillion emergency relief package to combat the economic turmoil.

The package — coupled with a European Central Bank plan to buy 750 billion euros in bonds — saw stock markets rebound on Friday with exchanges up throughout Asia and Europe.

16,2020/03/20,India an important asset for global community to fight against coronavirus: Saudi envoy,"Saud bin Mohammed Al Sati’s remarks come days after PM Modi held a telephonic conversation with Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and emphasised the need for coordinated efforts to address the challenge arising out of coronavirus outbreak.

India is an important asset for the international and regional fight against coronavirus (COVID-19) and in minimising its impact on the health of global community, Saudi Arabia, the chair of the G20 grouping, said on Friday.

In an interview to the PTI, Saudi Arabia’s envoy to India Saud bin Mohammed Al Sati also assured that the Gulf nation is taking care of the safety of expatriates in the Kingdom on priority.

His remarks come days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a telephonic conversation with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, and emphasised the need for coordinated efforts to address the global challenge arising out of the coronavirus outbreak.

“Saudi Arabia views India as an important strategic partner. India is an important asset to international and regional integrated efforts to deal with the current situation and minimise its impact on the health of global community. We are working closely with the Indian government in this regard,” the envoy said.

Mr. Al Sati said that during the call, Crown Prince Salman affirmed that the Kingdom is working to coordinate international cooperation in combating this pandemic and adopting appropriate policies to reduce its economic burdens within the framework of the G-20.

Saudi Arabia, that now has G20 presidency, is communicating with member countries to convene an extraordinary virtual G20 Leaders’ Summit next week, he said.

The summit will be aimed at advancing a coordinated response to the COVID-19 pandemic, its human and economic implications and will build on the ongoing efforts of the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors, senior health-, trade-, and foreign affairs officials, he said.

Mr. Al Sati said that Saudi Arabia and India, as members of the G20 and long-standing strategic partners, will work closely to gather global cooperation in dealing with the coronavirus situation. Officials on both sides will work closely towards this cause, he added.

“The current situation with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates an international and coordinated response. The Kingdom is committed to working with international organisations and members of G20 to control and reduce the spread of the virus, protect people, mitigate its effects on the economy, and take the necessary measures to maintain the stability of the world economy,” he said.

G20 countries are working closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) to monitor the outbreak, share relevant information, encourage preventive measures, early case detection, and clinical care, he said.

The health officials of G20 members met earlier this month to discuss the health and social impact of coronavirus and other infectious diseases, he pointed out.

Moreover, G20 finance ministers and central bank governors have agreed to use all available policy tools, including fiscal and monetary measures as appropriate to deal with the global pandemic, the envoy said.

“We extend our support to the IMF and World Bank commitments to extend financing to developing countries that need it and invite countries to strengthen funding facilities,” Mr. Al Sati said.

“As an effort in this direction, Saudi Arabia has provided USD 10,000,000 to the World Health Organization for the implementation of urgent measures to minimise the spread of the disease and to support countries with vulnerable health infrastructures, an effort that has been commended by WHO and the global community,” he said.

Asked about the situation faced by a large number of Indians living in Saudi Arabia in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, he said that his country, after closely following the developments related to the spread of coronavirus, has adopted several temporary, precautionary measures affecting travel to and from the Kingdom.

He said the measures have been put in place to ensure the safety of Saudi citizens as well as that of the expatriates living in the Kingdom.

The measures taken by the Saudi government for the safety of its citizens and expatriate, include a temporary suspension on entry into the Kingdom for the purpose of Umrah or visiting the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina, he said.

Saudi Arabia has also decided to suspend attendance at work headquarters in all entities in the private sector, which employs a considerable number of expatriates, for a period of 15 days, the envoy said.

The Saudi Education Ministry has also ordered all schools to remain closed until further notice and an intensive health awareness campaign has also been launched in the Kingdom, Mr. Al Sati said.

The Saudi Ministry of Health has issued an awareness guide in several languages, including Arabic, Filipino, Urdu, English, French, Russian, and Portuguese, targeting citizens and expatriates to raise awareness about the spread of COVID-19, he said.

Saudi Arabia’s General Authority of Civil Aviation has intensified its efforts of sterilising and disinfecting terminals and all of the general facilities around the Kingdom’s airports to ensure public safety, he said, adding that these operations are carried out on a daily 24 hours basis.

“The Saudi authorities are doing their best to deal with the pandemic and let me reassure you that the safety of expatriates in the Kingdom is a priority for us. In fact, many notable expatriates in Saudi Arabia including health experts have praised the efforts being made in this regard,” the envoy said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/g6c7ci/article29548017.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SAUDIAMBASSADOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/india-an-important-asset-for-global-community-to-fight-against-coronavirus-saudi-envoy/article31120014.ece
17,2020/03/20,"Iran announces 149 more coronavirus deaths, toll rises to 1,433","More than 240,000 people have been infected worldwide.

Iran has announced 149 more fatalities from the new coronavirus, bringing its death toll to 1,433 amid nearly 20,000 confirmed cases.

Iran is battling the worst outbreak in the Middle East, and has been widely criticised for its slow response.

The country’s leaders struck an upbeat tone earlier Friday, issuing messages in honor of the Persian new year in which they vowed to overcome the pandemic.

Iran’s leaders had marked the Persian new year on Friday by vowing to overcome the coronavirus and build up the economy, striking an upbeat tone after authorities’ delayed response to the pandemic contributed to the worst outbreak in the Middle East.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, called the new year “the year of leaps in production” in Iran’s economy, which has been under heavy U.S. sanctions since President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear accord.

President Hassan Rouhani marked the new year, known as Nowruz, by promising a better economy. “We will put the Coronavirus behind us soon with unity, with hard work and with cooperation,” he said.

Their optimistic tone stood in stark contrast to the devastation caused by the outbreak. Iran has reported 1,284 fatalities out of 18,407 confirmed cases of the new virus.

Most people who come down with the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus experience only minor symptoms and recover within weeks. But the virus is highly contagious and can be spread by people showing no symptoms. It can cause severe illness, including pneumonia, particularly in sick or elderly patients.

More than 240,000 people have been infected worldwide. More than 10,000 have died, while more than 85,000 have recovered.

Mr. Rouhani has defended his government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak in the face of widespread criticism that officials acted too slowly and may have even covered up initial cases before infections rapidly spread across the country.

Mr. Rouhani assured Iranians that his administration will prioritize health in the coming year and said it had stockpiled basic supplies.

Mr. Khamenei issued a religious edict this week prohibiting all unnecessary travel and authorities have restricted travel between cities. After weeks of heavy criticism, authorities finally closed two major religious shrines in recent days.

Other countries in the region have imposed far stricter measures to contain the virus, including cancelling flights, sealing borders and forcing all non-essential businesses to close.

Saudi Arabia announced early Friday it would shut down domestic air travel, buses, taxis and trains for the next two weeks, beginning on Saturday morning. The monarchy has reported 274 confirmed cases, eight of whom recovered.

In a televised address late Thursday, King Salman said “we are living through a difficult phase of the world’s history.”

“However, we are completely certain that this phase will end and pass, despite its harshness and bitterness and its difficulties,” he said.

King Salman assured Saudis that the country had sufficient medical care and supplies to get through the crisis.

Pakistan meanwhile reported its third death from the coronavirus, a 77-year-old cancer patient, in its southern Sindh province. Pakistan has reported 452 confirmed cases, most linked to travel to neighboring Iran.

Pakistan closed its borders with Iran and Afghanistan weeks ago, but Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday asked authorities to allow trucks carrying food and other essential items to cross into landlocked Afghanistan, where infections are also on the rise.

18,2020/03/20,Coronavirus | Indian mission offers help in arranging accommodation for stranded Indians in U.K.,"The Indian High Commission in London has set up an email system for Indian passport holders to get in touch with details of their situation

The Indian High Commission in London is offering assistance with organising accommodation for Indian nationals stranded in the U.K. in light of India’s ban on travellers from the U.K. and Europe over coronavirus pandemic.

The mission had already set up an email system for Indian passport holders to get in touch with details of their situation and continued to field hundreds of calls and social media messages from Indian professionals and students desperate to return home.

All about COVID-19

“High Commission can help you with accommodation. You may let us have your location by email at info.london@mea.gov.in. We will give you further advise by email,” the mission said, in response to pleas for help.

The High Commission continues to engage with the U.K. authorities on guidance for Indians in the U.K. whose visas are due to expire but are currently unable to leave, notes its latest advisory.

Among those seeking help is an animator and graphic designer who is among a group of four Indian professionals, who say their confirmed tickets to return to India were automatically cancelled as the ban came into effect from Wednesday.

Now without jobs and savings how are we going to survive in here, he says.

“I know this is a dynamic situation, however it is pretty disappointing to see that we still do not have a decision from U.K. authorities for people stranded in the U.K.. Chinese nationals have received an automatic extension of visas, why are we not following the same model,” asks a senior business analyst from Leeds.

There are others keen to know if they would be able to travel back to India after March 31, the current deadline for India’s travel ban. However, there is an increasing fear that the travel ban would be further extended given the rapid spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has claimed 144 lives in the U.K.

Meanwhile, student groups have continued to rally around to help Indian nationals through the crisis and called on the U.K. Home Office to help those stranded with the additional worry of an expiring student visa.

“We have set up a team to specifically provide guidance and support to all students in the U.K. in these unprecedented times. We are getting queries linked to health, travel and accommodation and even loneliness,” said a spokesperson for the Indian National Students Association (INSA).

We request both the Home Office in the U.K. and the High Commission of India to work together, especially for students whose U.K. visa is set to run out by the end of March, the spokesperson said.

Universities across the U.K. have said they are mindful of the plight of international students, many of whom have nowhere to go as campuses go into shutdown.

Universities are particularly mindful of international students who are separated from friends and family and may be unable to travel because of the pandemic. Universities will continue to do all they can to support those remaining on campuses and keep them safe, and are regularly communicating with students and staff to provide them with timely and accurate information, said Alistair Jarvis, Chief Executive of Universities U.K., the representative body for U.K. universities.

Meanwhile, the U.K. remains under strict social distancing conditions, with the government imposing curbs on all non-essential social contact and travel as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country hit 3,269.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/428z7r/article31117481.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LONDONQUEUE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-indian-mission-offers-help-in-arranging-accommodation-for-stranded-indians-in-uk/article31117483.ece
19,2020/03/20,COVID-19 | 40 million Californians ordered to stay home,"There are at least 1,030 confirmed cases in California and 18 people have died.

California’s 40 million residents should stay home indefinitely and venture outside only for essential jobs, errands and some exercise, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday, warning that the coronavirus threatens to overwhelm the state’s medical system.

The move, the most sweeping by any state so far, was an exclamation point at the end of a week of increasingly aggressive moves meant to keep the virus in check by forcing people to stay away from each other as often as possible.

“I can assure you home isolation is not my preferred choice, I know it’s not yours, but it’s a necessary one,” Mr. Newsom said at an evening news conference streamed on social media.

The announcement came after the release of a letter to President Donald Trump where Mr. Newsom warned the virus was spreading quickly and eventually could infect more than half the state’s population. A spokesman later clarified that the figure did not take into account the aggressive mitigation efforts that have been made.

The governor said he doesn’t expect police will be needed to enforce his stay-at-home order, saying “social pressure” already has led to social distancing throughout the state.

“I don’t believe the people of California need to be told through law enforcement that it’s appropriate just to home isolate,” he said.

The Democrat who is barely a year into his first term also called up 500 National Guard troops to help distribute food. The move comes after panic buying led to massive lines at some grocery stores.

Mr. Newsom also outlined a series of steps aimed at providing more space for hospital patients.

The coronavirus is spread through sneezes and coughs. There are at least 1,030 confirmed cases in California and 18 people have died, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

Newsom’s statewide order came after counties and communities covering about half the state’s population already had issued similar edicts. He said the restriction is “open-ended” because it could raise false hopes if he included an end date.

“Safer at Home” in Los Angeles

Just before Newsom’s statewide declaration, Los Angeles announced what officials there called a “Safer at Home” order that carried the same restrictions.

“We’re about to enter into a new way of living here in Los Angeles,” Mayor Eric Garcetti said. “What we do and how we do it and if we get this right will determine how long this crisis lasts.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4xoytw/article31117429.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN20VIRUSOUTBREAKCALIFORNIACAPITOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-40-million-californians-ordered-to-stay-home/article31117430.ece

The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have committed to providing $588 million to Pakistan for its emergency response to fight the coronavirus and to address the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic, a media report said on Friday.

According to an official statement, the World Bank would provide $238 million and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) $350 million to Pakistan in support for the COVID-19 emergency response and to tackle the socio-economic disruption associated with it.

The announcement was made by the Planning Commission after a meeting with representatives of the two lending agencies on Pakistan’s preparedness and response to fight COVID-19, the Dawn newspaper reported.

The meeting, presided over by Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission Mohammad Jehanzeb Khan, was attended by World Bank Country Director Illango Patchamuthu, ADB Country Director Xiaohong Yang, besides other officials and representatives of the ministries of economic affairs, finance and national health services.

The meeting also approved in principle a project concept “Pakistan National Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19”.

The participants of the meeting agreed that not only they needed to enhance cooperation to jointly fight challenges but also work to demonstrate firm commitment for a multi-faceted cooperation in different fields, the report said.

21,2020/03/20,Sri Lanka imposes nationwide curfew to combat coronavirus pandemic,"Sri Lanka has 66 confirmed cases of coronavirus

Sri Lankan has imposed a nationwide curfew from Friday until Monday to combat the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic that has claimed over 9,000 lives globally, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s office has announced.

The curfew announcement comes a day after the country’s Election Commission announced the postponement of the parliamentary election which was scheduled for April 25. The Commission said a decision on the new date would be taken after March 25.

The country is to be placed under a curfew with effect from 6 p.m. (local time) on Friday until 6 a.m. (local time) on Monday, President Rajapaksa’s office said.

Although there were no reasons given for the announcement, it is believed that the government is keen to see restricted movement of the people in order to promote social distancing in the face of a looming threat posed by the COVID-19 outbreak.

The national centre tasked to prevent COVID-19 infections said out of the 66 confirmed cases so far, 25 were overseas returnees.

It said 22 of them were from Italy while two were from the U.K. and one from India.

Over 2,400 people are under quarantine which includes 27 foreign nationals, it added.

President Rajapaksa has refused to lockdown the entire country, citing economic hardships for the poor.

Sri Lankan police had previously restricted the curfew to night time in the western coastal areas, a move aimed at tracking down Italy returnees who were avoiding compulsory quarantine process.

The police said despite the curfew people were engaging in social activities, defying the need to maintain social distancing.

Countries around the world are sealing their borders and banning travel to stop the fast-spreading COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed 9,800 lives and infected more than 232,650 people in 158 countries and territories.

In view of the rising number of the novel coronavirus cases globally, Sri Lanka on Tuesday suspended all international flights arriving in the country.

China with 80,967 infected cases and 3,248 deaths tops the list followed by Italy (41,035 cases and 3,405 deaths), Iran (18,304 infected cases and 1,284 deaths), Spain (19,077 infected cases and 831 deaths), Germany (15,320 infected cases and 44 deaths) and France (10,995 infected cases and 372 deaths).",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ibrt30/article31116502.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SRILANKAVIRUSOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-imposes-nationwide-curfew-to-combat-coronavirus-pandemic/article31116503.ece

Russian scientists have begun testing prototypes of potential vaccines against the new coronavirus on animals in a laboratory in Siberia, Russia's consumer health regulator said on Friday.

Russia has reported 199 coronavirus cases so far, less than in many other European countries, but the figure has risen sharply in recent days. One person diagnosed with the virus has died.

Scientists in the Vektor State Virology and Biotechnology Centre in the city of Novosibirsk have developed vaccine prototypes based on six different technological platforms and began tests on Monday to try to work out how effective they are and in what doses they could be administered, the regulator said.

Scientists around the world have warned that the development of a vaccine is a lengthy and complex process that might only yield something for broader use in the next 12-18 months.

“Most often, laboratory mice and rats are used for such studies, ferrets, lower primates and other special lines of laboratory animals are also used,” the Russian regulator, Rospotrebnadzor, said in a statement.

The United States and Mexico are working on plans to halt much of cross-border travel without disrupting trade during the coronavirus outbreak, officials said Thursday.

Mexican Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said he proposed steps to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that “won’t paralyze economic activity and keep the border open to commerce and work.” He promised details on Friday.

Mr. Pompeo said on Twitter that he was working closely with his Mexican counterpart “on travel restrictions that balance protecting our citizens from further transmission of “COVID19. Together, we can reduce public health risks and prioritize essential cross-border commerce and trade.”

U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials briefed business leaders Thursday on plans to prohibit non-essential travel, similar to a measure announced earlier this week on the Canadian border, said Paola Avila, chair of the Border Trade Alliance, an business group.

The measure would effectively close the U.S. to all tourist and recreational visits along the Mexican border, said Ms. Avila, who participated in a conference call with CBP officials. Administration officials said the U.S. would announce it as early as Friday, though details were still being worked out and subject to change, she said.

U.S. officials provided a long list of “essential” workers that would be unaffected going to and from their jobs, including farmworkers, restaurant and grocery store employees and bus drivers, said Avila. Mexico was preparing similar restrictions on visitors from the United States.

U.S. Homeland Security Department officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment late Thursday.

Keeping trade flowing, as the U.S. and Canada agreed to do, contains the economic damage. Mexico is the U.S.’s largest trading partner, just ahead of Canada. The U.S. accounts for about 75% of Mexican exports, including autos, computers and medical devices.

While halting travel for students, shoppers, families and many workers would be a major blow to border economies, the impact has already been felt.

The State Department on Thursday issued a new travel alert urging Americans not to go abroad under any circumstances and to return home if they are already abroad unless they plan to remain overseas. California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the state’s 40 million residents to stay at home, restricting non-essential movements.

""It’s really not huge,” said Avila, who is also the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce vice president for international business affairs. “People are not crossing anyway. This is the right thing to do. If you don’t have to cross, don’t.”

The U.S. has also been considering whether to immediately turn back to Mexico anyone who crosses the border illegally, including asylum-seekers. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he planned to announce such a measure “very soon,” relying on a law that says he can deny entry to people or reject cargo if the U.S. surgeon general determines there is a “serious danger” of bringing a communicable disease to the United States.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ineuy9/article31115766.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-IMMIGRATIONMEXICO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-mexico-discuss-halting-much-of-cross-border-travel/article31115686.ece

President Donald Trump has scrapped this year’s in-person G7 summit set to be held in the US in June due to the coronavirus crisis and will instead hold the high-profile event through video-conference, the White House has said.

The decision comes as countries around the world seal their borders and ban travel to stop the fast-spreading COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed over 9,000 lives so far.

The G7 summit is the latest high-profile event to be cancelled as anxiety over coronavirus puts an end to political gatherings, sports events and musical festivals around the world.

In view of the ongoing coronavirus crisis that has gripped the entire world in an unprecedented way, the G7 summit scheduled to be held at Camp David from June 10-12 has been cancelled so that leaders of these countries can devote their time and energy in addressing the public health challenge, the White House said on Thursday.

“In order for each country to focus all of its resources on responding to the health and economic challenges of COVID-19 and at President Trump’s direction, National Economic Council Director and US Sherpa for the 2020 G7 Larry Kudlow has informed his Sherpa colleagues that the G7 Leaders’ Summit the US was set to host in June at Camp David will now be done by video-teleconference,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere said in a statement.

“The White House also informed the other G7 members that in order to continue close coordination, the President will convene the leaders’ via video teleconference in April and May just as he did this week,” Deere said.

Early this week, Mr. Trump had a video-conference call with G7 leaders, whose members are the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom.

In a joint statement, after the video-conference, leaders of G7 acknowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic was a human tragedy and a global health crisis, which also posed major risks for the world economy.

“We are committed to doing whatever is necessary to ensure a strong global response through closer cooperation and enhanced coordination of our efforts. While current challenges may require national emergency measures, we remain committed to the stability of the global economy,” they said.

The leaders expressed their conviction that the current challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic needed a strongly coordinated international approach based on science and evidence, consistent with democratic values, and utilising the strengths of private enterprise.

The G7 leaders said they were committed to marshalling the full power of their governments to coordinate on necessary public health measures to protect people at risk of COVID-19; restore confidence, growth, protect jobs, support global trade and investment and encourage science, research and technology cooperation.

In another statement, Deere said Mr. Trump spoke with President Emmanuel Macron of France and discussed the latest developments and efforts to combat coronavirus.

“The two leaders agreed to continue close cooperation on resolving the pandemic and minimising its economic impact, in coordination with the G7 and other international partners. The two leaders also discussed telecommunications security and European migration issues,” he said.

A total of 218 people have died in the US due to the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic, while there are 14,299 confirmed infected cases in the country. Coronavirus cases have been reported in all the 50 States in the US and District of Columbia as well as Puerto Rico.

A 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck China’s remote Himalayan region of Tibet close to Nepal on Friday, authorities said.

The epicentre of the quake was located 28.63 degrees north latitude and 87.42 degrees east longitude, with a depth of 10 km, according to the China Earthquake Networks Centre.

Tremors were felt in Tingri county of Xigaze city in Tibet near Mount Everest at 9:33 AM, the local government said, adding that no house collapse or disruption of traffic and communications were reported.

The county government has sent officials to villages and towns to collect more information, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Tingri borders Nepal to the south. Most areas of the county belong to the Mount Everest National Nature Reserve, it said.

In the meantime, nine firefighters and three fire tenders were dispatched to the epicentre. More than 100 firefighters and dozens of vehicles are on standby.

29,2020/03/20,Coronavirus | China exonerates doctor reprimanded for warning of virus,"The official China News Service late Tuesday said police in the epicenter city of Wuhan had revoked its admonishment of Dr. Li Wenliang that had included a threat of arrest and issued a “solemn apology” to his family.

China has taken the highly unusual move of exonerating a doctor who was reprimanded for warning about the coronavirus outbreak and later died of the disease.

The official China News Service late Tuesday said police in the epicenter city of Wuhan had revoked its admonishment of Dr. Li Wenliang that had included a threat of arrest and issued a “solemn apology” to his family.

It said two police officers had been issued “disciplinary punishments” for the original handling of the matter, without giving further details.

In death, Li became the face of simmering anger at the ruling Communist Party’s controls over information and complaints that officials lie about or hide disease outbreaks, industrial accidents, natural disasters and financial frauds, while punishing whistleblowers and independent journalists.

The 33-year-old ophthalmologist died in early February at Wuhan Central Hospital, where he worked and likely contracted the virus while treating patients in the early days of the outbreak.

After seeing thousands of new cases daily at the peak of the city’s outbreak a month ago, Wuhan on Friday had its second consecutive day with no new confirmed or suspected cases.

The health ministry said all of the 39 new cases recorded nationwide Friday were brought from overseas, showing that rigid travel restrictions and social distancing requirements appear to have had their desired effect.

China has loosened some travel restrictions in Hubei, the province surrounding Wuhan, although its provincial border remains closed and Wuhan itself remains under lockdown. Officials say they will only lift the quarantine after Wuhan goes 14 consecutive days with no new cases.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hfglok/article30759809.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINAOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-exonerates-doctor-reprimanded-for-warning-of-virus/article31115021.ece
30,2020/03/20,Olympic flame lands in Japan as doubts grow over Tokyo Games,"The flame reached Japan aboard a white aircraft painted with the inscription “Tokyo 2020 Olympic Torch Relay” along its side. It was greeted on the tarmac by a small contingent of organizing committee officials.

The Olympic flame arrived in Japan on Friday from Greece in a scaled-down ceremony at an air base in northern Japan.

The flame, carried in a burning canister, touched down amid growing doubts if the Tokyo Games can open as scheduled on July 24 because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Organizers and the International Olympic Committee say it will, but postponement or cancellation is viewed increasingly as a possible option.

The flame reached Japan aboard a white aircraft painted with the inscription “Tokyo 2020 Olympic Torch Relay” along its side. It was greeted on the tarmac by a small contingent of organizing committee officials.

Two of Japan’s most famous Olympians - three-time wresting gold medalist Saori Yoshida and three-time judo gold medalist Tadahiro Nomura - received the flame for the lighting ceremony.

The flame will stay in northern Japan for almost a week until the torch relay begins officially on March 26 from Fukushima prefecture.

This is the northeastern part of Japan, located about 250 kilometers (150 miles) from Tokyo, that was devastated by the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and meltdown of three nuclear reactors that has left many still living in temporary quarters.

Getting the flame to Japan represents a small victory for the IOC and local organizers, who maintain the Olympics will open on schedule followed by the Paralympics on Aug. 25.

Even if they don’t, the burning flame could be used as a symbol - particularly if the games are eventually delayed - and a rallying point for the Japanese public.

In a conference call on Wednesday, IOC president Thomas Bach got support for holding course, but is also getting push back from athletes who can’t train, are confused about the qualification process, and worry about their health. Critics are also complaining about the unfairness of qualifying, which might give some athletes advantages over others.

The four-month torch relay could be fraught with problems, particularly for sponsors which have invested millions for the publicity.

The torch relay in Greece, following the symbolic lighting on March 12, was stopped during the second day and did not resume because of large crowds. Japanese organizers have asked crowds to be “restrained” and could stop or delay the relay if they are not..",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/g1aied/article31114979.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/APTOPIXOLYMPICSTOKYO2020TORCHARRIVAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/olympic-flame-lands-in-japan-as-doubts-grow-over-tokyo-games/article31114980.ece
31,2020/03/20,Coronavirus | Italian death toll overtakes China’s as virus spreads,"In the U.S., the Army prepared mobile military hospitals for deployment in major cities. In Madrid, a four-star hotel was turned into a hospital. Medical centers around the United States set up drive-thru testing sites that drew long lines of motorists waiting for nurses to swab their nostrils.

Italy’s death toll from the coronavirus outbreak eclipsed China’s on Thursday as the scourge extended its march across the West, where the United States and other countries increasingly enlisted the military and improvised at every turn to get ready for an onslaught of patients.

In the U.S., the Army prepared mobile military hospitals for deployment in major cities. In Madrid, a four-star hotel was turned into a hospital. Medical centers around the United States set up drive-thru testing sites that drew long lines of motorists waiting for nurses to swab their nostrils.

As the outbreak spread westward, it infected at least one European head of state- Monaco’s 62-year-old Prince Albert II, who continued to work from his office. And it appeared to be opening an alarming new front in Africa, where health care in many countries is already in sorry shape.

At the United Nations in New York, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the world is “at war with a virus” and warned that “a global recession, perhaps of record dimensions, is a near certainty.”

""If we let the virus spread like wildfire - especially in the most vulnerable regions of the world -- it would kill millions of people,” he said.

Italy, with 60 million citizens, recorded a total of at least 3,405 deaths, or roughly 150 more than in China, a country with a population over 20 times larger. At the same time Italy reached its bleak milestone, Chinese health authorities reported Thursday that Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus first emerged three months ago, had no new infections, a sign that the communist country’s draconian lockdowns had worked.

Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit, a virologist at Germany’s Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, offered another reason for Italy’s high death rate- “That’s what happens when the health system collapses.”

In a measure of how the fortunes of East and West have shifted, New York officials were sent to China to buy more ventilators. And in Italy, the leader of a delegation from the Chinese Red Cross openly castigated Italians for failing to take the country’s national lockdown seriously.

On a visit to the hard-hit city of Milan, Sun Shuopeng said he was shocked to see so many people walking around, using public transportation and eating out in hotels.

""Right now we need to stop all economic activity, and we need to stop the mobility of people,” he said. “All people should be staying at home in quarantine.”

Worldwide the death toll crept toward 10,000 and the total number of infections topped 240,000, including nearly 85,000 people who have recovered.

In the U.S., where deaths reached at least 178, and infections climbed past 11,000, Army officials announced plans to deploy two hospitals, probably to Seattle and New York City. Washington state had the highest death toll, 74. President Donald Trump said earlier this week that he would send a Navy hospital ship to the West Coast as well as one to New York City, which is rapidly becoming a U.S. epicenter, with more than 4,000 cases.

Damage to the world’s largest economy kept piling up, with the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits surging by 70,000 last week. On Wall Street, though, stocks rose modestly amid optimism over efforts by the Federal Reserve and other central banks to shore up the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained almost 200 points, or 1%.

Congress is weighing a proposed $1 trillion emergency package that would dispense relief checks to households in as many as two rounds, the first of which would consist of payments of $1,000 per adult and $500 for each child.

Around the country, governors and mayors sounded increasingly alarmed and took ever more drastic measures to fend off the crisis.

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf ordered the closing of all “non-life-sustaining” businesses in the state, with exceptions for gas stations, grocery stores, pharmacies and takeout restaurant service, and warned that violators could be subject to fines or imprisonment.

At a video conference with Trump, governors complained that they were having difficulty obtaining such things as swabs and protective gear for doctors and nurses.

And New York Mayor Bill de Blasio lashed out at the president as “the Herbert Hoover of your generation,” referring to the man who was president when the stock market crashed in 1929 and the Depression set in.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state does not have enough ventilators for the expected surge of patients in need of help breathing, and needs to acquire thousands before the outbreak overwhelms hospitals.

""Every state is shopping for ventilators. We’re shopping for ventilators. We literally have people in China shopping for ventilators which is one of the largest manufacturers. So this is a major problem,” he said.

A Houston hospital that opened its doors to drive-thru testing quickly saw a line of hundreds of vehicles back up for more than a mile. At a white tent, workers in masks and head-to-toe protective gear swabbed motorists. Petra Sanchez waited to find out whether she had the virus.

""I have an 80-year-old dad, and I haven’t been around him for the same reason,” she said. “I don’t know what I have.”

The U.S. State Department, meanwhile, warned Americans in the strongest terms yet not to travel abroad under any circumstances.

Around the world, the British government, criticized as slow to react to the virus, shifted gears and drew up legislation giving itself new powers to detain people and restrict gatherings. The bill is expected to be approved by Parliament next week.

The British supermarket chain Sainsbury’s reserved the first hour of shopping for vulnerable customers. Among them was Jim Gibson, 72, of London, who was concerned that the country wasn’t ramping up testing fast enough.

""You can’t go on ignoring World Health Organization guidelines - if they’re wrong, who the hell is right?” he said. “Let’s have no shilly-shallying.”

French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe pleaded with people to keep their distance from one another to avoid spreading the virus, even as the crisis pushed them to seek comfort.

""When you love someone, you should avoid taking them in your arms,” he said in Parliament.

In China, Thursday marked the first time since Jan. 20 that the locked-down city of Wuhan, where thousands once lay sick or dying in hurriedly constructed hospitals, reported no new locally transmitted cases. Authorities said all 34 new cases recorded over the previous day had come from abroad.

""Today, we have seen the dawn after so many days of hard effort,” said Jiao Yahui, a senior inspector at the National Health Commission.

China is slowly coming back to life, with the government saying about 80% of economic activity has been restored, although millions of workers remain stranded by travel bans. Beijing’s tourism industry is still on hold, just as it should be ramping up for the summer season.

The World Health Organization warned, though, that the virus is spreading quickly in Africa, from about five countries a week and a half ago to 35 of the continent’s 54 nations - an “extremely rapid evolution,” said WHO’s Africa chief, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bflrvm/article31062722.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13IN-VENICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-italian-death-toll-overtakes-chinas-as-virus-spreads/article31114941.ece
32,2020/03/20,Weinstein moved to state prison day before 68th birthday,"The disgraced film mogul, who will turn 68 on Thursday, is locked up at the maximum security Wende Correctional Facility near Buffalo, according to state prison officials. He is known behind bars as inmate No. 20B0584.

Harvey Weinstein was transferred to a state prison in New York on Wednesday as he begins to serve a 23-year sentence for rape and sexual assault in his landmark #MeToo case.

The disgraced film mogul, who will turn 68 on Thursday, is locked up at the maximum security Wende Correctional Facility near Buffalo, according to state prison officials. He is known behind bars as inmate No. 20B0584.

The prison, six hours by car from Manhattan, is likely just a temporary stop for Weinstein. While he’s there, he’ll be evaluated to determine which state prison facility meets his security, medical, mental health and other needs.

Weinstein’s spokesman called the move harsh. Weinstein, convicted Feb. 24 and sentenced last week, had been splitting time between New York City’s notorious Rikers Island jail complex and a Manhattan hospital.

Weinstein left court in an ambulance after the guilty verdict and detoured to Bellevue Hospital, complaining of chest pains and high blood pressure. He later had a stent inserted to unblock an artery. After his sentencing, he returned with more chest pains.

Weinstein, the Oscar-winning producer of Shakespeare in Love,” was convicted of raping an aspiring actress in 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex on a TV and film production assistant in 2006. His lawyers have said they’ll appeal.

Within hours of Weinstein’s sentencing, prosecutors in Los Angeles announced they were beginning the extradition process to send him there for an arraignment on charges he raped a woman and sexually assaulted another in 2013. That’s now on hold because of the coronavirus crisis that has shuttered courthouses and limited travel.

For Weinstein, being sent to the Buffalo-area prison is an inauspicious homecoming. He attended college nearby and got his start in the entertainment business in the area as a concert promoter bringing the likes of Frank Sinatra and the Rolling Stones to town.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rx4gz8/article31006463.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PEOPLE-HARVEYWEINSTEIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/weinstein-moved-to-state-prison-day-before-68th-birthday/article31114909.ece
33,2020/03/20,COVID-19 | Nikki Haley resigns from Boeing board over company’s bailout pursuit,"In her resignation letter, Ms. Haley said the Boeing board and its executive team are going in a direction which she cannot support.

Indian-American Nikki Haley has resigned from the Boeing’s board of directors over the major airline manufacturer’s pursuit of federal assistance to mitigate its financial crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Two-term Governor of South Carolina and former US Ambassador to the UN, Haley resigned from the board on March 16, according to a Boeing filing before the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Ms. Haley had joined the Boeing board on April 29 last year. She served on the Finance and Audit Committees.

“A variety of approaches are currently under discussion among policy makers in the administration and the Congress, as well as the private sector, to address the near-term liquidity needs of the aerospace, travel, and other sectors affected by the current COVID-19 crisis,” the Boeing said in its filing before the SEC.

“The Company is participating in those discussions and has informed the board about the options currently being considered. Ambassador Haley informed the company that, as a matter of philosophical principle, she does not believe that the company should seek support from the federal government, and therefore decided to resign from the board,” the company said.

In her resignation letter, Ms. Haley said the board and its executive team are going in a direction which she cannot support.

“As we encounter the COVID-19 crisis, Boeing, along with many other companies, face another major set of challenges. I want to be part of helping the company as it pushes through it. However, the board and executive team are going in a direction I cannot support,” she said.

“While I know cash is tight, that is equally true for numerous other industries and for millions of small businesses. I cannot support a move to lean on the federal government for a stimulus or bailout that prioritises our company over others and relies on taxpayers to guarantee our financial position. I have long held strong convictions that this is not the role of government,” Ms. Haley wrote.

Boeing in a brief statement said, “We appreciate her service on the board and wish her well.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/5fizvx/article24953452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-NIKKIHALEY-REUTERS-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-nikki-haley-resigns-from-boeing-board-over-companys-bailout-pursuit/article31114894.ece
34,2020/03/20,Online learning platforms for skill building while working from home,"An extended period of stay-at-home work translates to significant savings in commuting time and expense. This could also result in better well-being.

Many organisations globally have advised their employees to work from home to reduce the risk of coronavirus infections.

An extended period of stay-at-home work translates to significant savings in commuting time and expense. This could also result in better well-being.

It has been found that longer commute times are associated with lower job and leisure time satisfaction, increased strain and poorer mental health, according to a study on How commuting affects subjective wellbeing published in the journal Transportation.

35,2020/03/20,The living room edit: Indian artistes on how to social distance and chill,"Musicians, comics, artists and activists curate viewing lists and experiences to tide us over our social distancing woes

Jivraj Singh (of Parekh & Singh), musicians

The last few days, we’ve been writing songs, playing instruments, reaching out to friends and family, exercising, and sitting quietly. Watch:Ugly Delicious and Dave (Lil Dicky). Food+travel and comedy are good distractions. Learn: The MIT lecture, ‘How To Speak by Patrick Winston’. It is amazing. Also, the sound of chalk on blackboard is really soothing! Listen: Nischay has a playlist, P&S Top Picks, on Spotify — everything here sounds really good. Read: Anything that appeals to your interests, but doesn’t excite or disturb you overmuch. Good writing, like good sound, can be inherently soothing.

Kenny Sebastian, comic

Catch Don’t be that Guy (my comedy special on Amazon Prime Video), The Most Important Person in the Room (my soon-to-be-released Netflix special), and Bahubali part 1 and 2! And play Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Need for Speed Heat. They are so immersive, they help while away time effortlessly. My comfort viewing is usually classic Hollywood films from the ’80s and ’90s that I grew up with. I recently binged the Indiana Jones, Back to the Future, and Matrix series. I love watching older specials like Dave Chappelle’s Killin’’Them Softly. My favourite go-to platform is YouTube. From when I was 17, I love watching videos of all genres; it is how I learned my skills! I am also reading Creativity, Inc by Ed Catmull.

Radhika Vaz, comic

Most folks I know have way too many shows they need to catch up on. But if you are that rare human who is being confronted with free time for the first time, here is how you can do some quarantimepass. Exercise: while this is what I like to do least, I’m using this forced confinement to build the disciple muscle. Yoga is my weapon of choice. Try ‘Yoga for Beginners’, a free app (my favourite kind) and the routines can be short and sweet or longer and sweatier. It is up to you. Watch: I’ve just binged two shows on Netflix. After Life, the most darkly hilarious take on death [OK, I know that perhaps a show about death isn’t the best recco at a time like this, but if we are going to die then you really wouldn’t want to miss this], and The IT Crowd [it is so well done that even if you are as far from an IT nerd as it gets, you will find yourself fully identifying with everything that happens]. Listen/Watch: I am slightly obsessed with Hollywood gossip. I am pathetic. Why do you think I outted that whole ‘do yoga’ business up front! YouTube houses my beloved Wendy Williams and Heather MacDonald. Wendy has a TV show, but they stream long segments. Same for Heather’s podcast, Juicy Scoop. Both women are hilarious and give you their unfiltered take on stupid Hollywood celebrity behaviour. Our Bollywood celebs would never behave that badly.

Manoj Bajpayee, actor: I watched ‘The Irishman’ twice. ‘Fleabag’ is a must for all, just to see the brilliance of every department, all in sync. Its a great series to catch while you are isolated. Santosh Sivan, cinematographer-filmmaker: I am all alone in Mumbai feeding fish in the aquarium at home, doing terrace gardening, reading and browsing. Watch the web series, ‘Abstract: The Art of Design’ on Netflix. Taapsee Pannu, actor: I rarely watch films multiple times; I feel you’re wasting time when there are so many new ones you can watch. My advice to the homebound: watch ‘Homeland’. Adil Hussain, actor: I’m watching films and shows [many recommended by friends] on OTT platforms. I found the documentaries ‘Dirty Money’ and ‘The Bleeding Edge’ very revealing. I’m also working my way through a hard drive with films curated by my acting teacher in Pondicherry. I saw this wonderful Chinese film from 2013, The Nightingale, directed by Philippe Muyl. I think Mubi has some wonderfully-curated films. Twinkle Khanna, actor-author-columnist: I am reading books based on movies and then watching the movie with my family. We are watching ‘Electric Dreams’ on Amazon Prime Video and I am rereading an anthology by Philip K Dick. Ankur Tewari, singer-songwriter: Right now, I’m playing a lot of ‘Last of Us’, a zombie killing game in a post-apocalyptic world, because it is similar to what’s happening outside. I also suggest playing ‘FIFA’ because it is such a social game; you can play it online with your friends. I’m reading Leonard Cohen’s ‘The Flame’, compiled by his son Adam — a collection of his poems, some of which have been made into songs. Alicia Dsouza, Illustrator: 1) Salt, Fat, Heat, Acid: Based on Samin Nosrat’s best-selling book, the show premiered on Netflix in October 2018. ""It's my favourite food show."" 2) Pushpavali: The second season of Sumukhi Suresh's show is out (on Amazon Prime). ""I know and love the characters."" 3) Peep Show: The series follows the lives of Mark Corrigan and Jeremy ""Jez"" Usborne, two dysfunctional friends who share a flat in London. It's my favourite British comedy. Anurag Kashyap, filmmaker: Watch ‘Succession’ on Hotstar. Revisit ‘Watchmen’ and ‘Breaking Bad’, as well as the entire body of work from your favourite directors. Appupen, graphic artist: I enjoy anything by Mœbius [the pseudonym used by French artist, cartoonist and writer, Jean Henri Gaston Giraud]. Visually, it is the best parallel universe or escape fantasy. He has the key to that other world where I try to go. Then, there are films by Rolf de Heer, the Dutch Australian filmmaker. It is beautiful filmmaking. Bina Paul, film editor: Definitely feel-good films. Not the time to feel depressed and sad. My selection would include Hollywood classics such as ‘Casablanca’, ‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s’, ‘The Sting’, ‘Roman Holiday’, ‘Guess Who’s Coming for Dinner Tonight’ etc Geetu Mohandas, actor-director: I am re-reading for the nth time Amitav Ghosh’s The Hungry Tide. He is one of my favourite authors. In addition, I am fine-tuning my script for my next film. Naseeruddin Shah, actor-filmmaker: I’ve been catching up with the Anthony Burgess books I haven’t yet read. There are few better writers of the English language; I’d suggest giving him and Bernard Shaw a try. Jaya Jaitly: I have been watching ‘Dirty Money’ on Netflix... It has got me thinking that actually so much of what is wrong in the world, including the way we’re suffering now is about the loss or the desire for gain of money…. So much of this world is balanced on money; surely it’s time to rejig our minds and our priorities. Kajal Aggarwal, actor: Among podcasts, I enjoy listening to [Indian American entrepreneur and investor] Naval Ravikant. I [often catch] Ted Talks and one of my favourite motivational speakers is Brene Brown (in photo). I also listen to Simon Sinek. Kenny Sebastian, comic: Play ‘Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order’ and ‘Need for Speed Heat’. I love watching older specials like Dave Chappelle’s ‘Killin’ Them Softly’. My favourite go-to platform is YouTube. From when I was 17, I love watching videos of all genres; it is how I learned my skills! I am also reading ‘Creativity, Inc’ by Ed Catmull. Naveen Richard, comic: There’s something about those feel-good 90s films such as ‘Forrest Gump’, ‘Cast Away’, ‘You’ve Got Mail’, ‘Ferris Bueller’s Day Off’ and ‘Home Alone’. When you watch them, you feel like a kid again. Jivraj Singh of Parekh & Singh, musicians: Watch ‘Ugly Delicious’ and ‘Dave’ (Lil Dicky). Food+travel and comedy are good distractions. Nischay has a playlist, ‘P&S Top Picks’, on Spotify — everything here sounds really good. Radhika Vaz, comic: I’ve just binged two shows on Netflix. ‘After Life’, the most darkly hilarious take on death [OK, I know that perhaps a show about death isn’t the best recco at a time like this, but if we are going to die then you really wouldn’t want to miss this], and ‘The IT Crowd’. Raghu Dixit, indie musician: Watch Kannada movie ‘Love Mocktail’ — because I have made interesting music in it. ‘Ayyappanum Koshiyum’ has a simple storyline made powerful by incredible acting by Prithviraj and Biju Menon. Rajiv Menon, director: This time has given me a chance to catch up on fiction books. I just finished ‘A Man Called Ove’ by Fredrik Backman. Apart from Carnatic music, I’ve been listening to ‘The Planets’ [a seven-movement orchestral suite] by English composer Gustav Holst. From the UK Top 40, my picks are ‘Blinding Lights’ by The Weeknd and the new James Bond track, ‘No Time to Die’, by Billie Eilish. Rasika Dugal, actor: Having just finished ‘The Spy’, I’m now watching ‘Unbelievable’. I would recommend ‘I Lost My Body’, a drama/fantasy animation film. Beautifully scripted and skilfully visualised, it takes you through a journey of loneliness and love in a city. Richa Chadha, actor: I’m watching everything I think I should catch up on and some releases that I missed, like the Ayushmann Khurrana-starrer ‘Dream Girl’ and director Rohena Gera’s ‘Sir’. I’m also watching ‘High Maintenance’ on Hotstar, though I’m a little late to the party. I am also reading a book by [Serbian political activist] Srdja Popovic called ‘Blueprint for Revolution’, which is about laughter and activism.

Ankur Tewari, singer-songwriter

Right now, I’m playing a lot of Last of Us, a zombie killing game in a post-apocalyptic world, because it is similar to what’s happening outside. I also suggest playing FIFA because it is such a social game; you can play it online with your friends. This is a great time to read books. I usually pick up non-fiction, and William Dalrymple’s Anarchy is a great one to keep you away from screens and social media where there’s a lot of half-baked information and hysteria. I’m reading Leonard Cohen’s The Flame, compiled by his son Adam — a collection of his poems, some of which have been made into songs. I’ve also been making playlists and old-school mix tapes, and sending them to friends [I did a deep dive into the ’80s for a friend’s birthday]. And live jams on Instagram.

Appupen, graphic artist

When I am not well, I want to read Bone, the American comic book series by Jeff Smith. It is the most comfort I can think of. It has some darkness but it is also a fantasy, an epic kind of thing. I also enjoy anything by Mœbius [the pseudonym used by French artist, cartoonist and writer, Jean Henri Gaston Giraud]. Visually, it is the best parallel universe or escape fantasy. He has the key to that other world where I try to go. Finally, there are films by Rolf de Heer, the Dutch Australian filmmaker. It is beautiful filmmaking.

Naveen Richard, comic

There’s something about those feel-good 90s films such as Forrest Gump, Cast Away, You’ve Got Mail, and Home Alone. When you watch them, you feel like a kid again. There’s a show called Community, by the creator of Rick and Morty. It was super niche [every episode was a different genre] and hilarious, and something that people need now. At times you want an escape, just like The Office. This is also a good time to catch up on quality music. Some of my favourite tracks include ‘A little bit like magic’ by King Harvest [it reminds you that the world is not such a bad place], ‘Lovely Day’ by Bill Withers [a great morning song], and ‘A satisfied mind’ by Bobby Hebb [tells you to enjoy the simple things in life].

Raghu Dixit, musician

I’ve been spending time with my family for the last two weeks. I’ve watched Love Mocktail on Amazon Prime Video. It is a hit Kannada film and I have made interesting music in it. Ayyappanum Koshiyum is another one. It has a simple storyline made powerful by incredible acting by Prithviraj and Biju Menon. A good series is Mindhunter on Netflix, one of the best psychological investigative thrillers around. Heal is a documentary (on Netflix), if you need something to inspire you in troubled times as this. And finally, there is Punch Brothers - Live at Paramount Theatre on YouTube. One of the best live acts, it is a stimulating concert video by a great band performing live.

Jaya Jaitly, activist

I have been watching Dirty Money on Netflix. It has got me thinking how so much of what is wrong in the world, including the way we’re suffering now, is about the loss or the desire for money. Surely it is time to rejig our minds and our priorities. Vikram Sampath gave me his new book, Savarkar. There has been so much opposition to it by people who have not read it – it’s only archival material; they’re not taking anyone’s side. It’s just fact and we should know the facts before we take decisions or form opinions. I went to a lit fest recently, and the whole audience was not even prepared to even think about looking at it objectively. I don’t like that sort of thing, so I’m reading that now.

I’m watching Salt, Fat, Heat, Acid, the Netflix show based on Samin Nosrat’s best-selling book. It is my favourite food show. The second season of Sumukhi Suresh's Pushpavali is out on Amazon Prime Video. I know and love the characters. And there is Peep Show. The series follows the lives of Mark Corrigan and Jeremy ‘Jez’ Usborne, two dysfunctional friends who share a flat in London.

36,2020/03/20,The living room edit: A social distancing to-do list curated by the film fraternity,"Leading names from the entertainment industry curate viewing lists, and share their living room experiences to tide us over social distancing in this critical period

They say, rules are meant to be broken. We say, don’t. For some, the suddenly-imposed social distancing has a strange way of playing mind games. Misanthropes may get a strong urge to party, children and parents may drive each other up the wall. But while seclusion, and the uncertainty about coronavirus, could take a toll on our mental health — loneliness, anxiety about the future, concern for loved ones — it can also be a time to rediscover simple pleasures. Creative people across the world are sharing how self-isolation needn’t be all bad; they do it all the time, to introspect, learn, create. And they are extending a helping hand, curating what we could try in the days to come to keep our sanity and sense of self intact.

Naseeruddin Shah, actor-filmmaker

I’ve been catching up with the Anthony Burgess books I haven’t yet read. There are few better writers of the English language; I’d suggest giving him and Bernard Shaw a try. Read and spend time with the family rather than binge-watching some series. I’ve also been [brushing up on] Urdu poetry and teaching myself to read and write the script since it is time [approaching three score and ten and possibly Alzheimer’s!] that one must learn something new.

Adil Hussain, actor

With shoots cancelled, I’m mostly watching films at home. I spend most of my free time reading pending scripts. I’m watching films and shows [many recommended by friends] on OTT platforms. Succession; Nadine Labaki’s Capernaum; The Loudest Voice on the CEO of Fox News, Roger Ailes — it has Russell Crowe in a fantastic performance after Beautiful Mind. I found the documentaries Dirty Money and The Bleeding Edge very revealing. I’m also working my way through a hard drive with films curated by my acting teacher in Pondicherry. I saw this wonderful Chinese film from 2013, The Nightingale, directed by Philippe Muyl. I think Mubi has some wonderfully-curated films.

Twinkle Khanna, actor-author-columnist

Self isolating is not unique for people who write; I’ve had periods when I am trying to finish a manuscript. The only conundrum this time: you have a house full of people competing for the remote and desk space. I am trying to do an interesting experiment where we can all give each other space and yet do things together. So I am reading books based on movies and then watching the movie with my family. We are watching Electric Dreams on Amazon Prime Video and I am rereading an anthology by Philip K Dick. Strangely enough I never got around to reading RK Narayan’s Malgudi Days, so I am ordering a copy of Swami and Friends and then will see that on Prime as well. Since F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby is part of my son’s course work, we will also watch the movie. I’ve had Satyajit Ray’s Feluda Omnibus for a while and plan to do the same [read it and then watch the adaptation], so we can all discuss it together. I am listening to podcasts like the Slate’s The Secret History of the Future while I walk my dogs. I’ve visited the Van Gogh exhibit at the Tate last year, but now want to take a virtual tour of the one in Amsterdam. A lot of museums have virtual tours, so this would be the time to travel the world of art without leaving your couch. And finally, I had signed up for a masterclass with Margaret Atwood — because I adore her — and now I may just find the time to do it.

Manoj Bajpayee, actor: I watched ‘The Irishman’ twice. ‘Fleabag’ is a must for all, just to see the brilliance of every department, all in sync. Its a great series to catch while you are isolated. Santosh Sivan, cinematographer-filmmaker: I am all alone in Mumbai feeding fish in the aquarium at home, doing terrace gardening, reading and browsing. Watch the web series, ‘Abstract: The Art of Design’ on Netflix. Taapsee Pannu, actor: I rarely watch films multiple times; I feel you’re wasting time when there are so many new ones you can watch. My advice to the homebound: watch ‘Homeland’. Adil Hussain, actor: I’m watching films and shows [many recommended by friends] on OTT platforms. I found the documentaries ‘Dirty Money’ and ‘The Bleeding Edge’ very revealing. I’m also working my way through a hard drive with films curated by my acting teacher in Pondicherry.

Nischay has a playlist, ‘P&S Top Picks’, on Spotify — everything here sounds really good. Radhika Vaz, comic: I’ve just binged two shows on Netflix. ‘After Life’, the most darkly hilarious take on death [OK, I know that perhaps a show about death isn’t the best recco at a time like this, but if we are going to die then you really wouldn’t want to miss this], and ‘The IT Crowd’. Raghu Dixit, indie musician: Watch Kannada movie ‘Love Mocktail’ — because I have made interesting music in it. ‘Ayyappanum Koshiyum’ has a simple storyline made powerful by incredible acting by Prithviraj and Biju Menon. Rajiv Menon, director: This time has given me a chance to catch up on fiction books. I just finished ‘A Man Called Ove’ by Fredrik Backman.

I’m watching everything I think I should catch up on and some releases that I missed, like the Ayushmann Khurrana-starrer Dream Girl and director Rohena Gera’s Sir. I’m also watching High Maintenance on Hotstar, though I’m a little late to the party. Like the rest of the world, I watched Contagion and now I am watching Pandemic. I am also reading a book by [Serbian political activist] Srdja Popovic called Blueprint for Revolution, which is about laughter and activism. I’m enjoying my other hobbies, too, like gardening on my balcony. I’m getting back to a lot of work I had left behind and I’m writing my book finally [on an outsider’s struggle in Bollywood]. I worked on a pitch presentation for a show last night, for something that Ali [Fazal] and I are trying to set up. Comfort film:Mr India. Read:Autobiography of a Yogi because it is about spirituality and happiness. Watch: documentaries on health, environment and sustainability like What The Health and Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret.

Rasika Dugal,actor

I’ve scheduled specific activities for myself. A running challenge — 3 km a day for 10 days. I’ve always been scared of committing to a challenge, so this is a new one for me. I am two days down, let’s see how I fare. This is in addition to my regular workout/yoga class (we might all need good immunity soon). I am starting music classes from Monday. I love singing; it calms me. I’ve also signed up for a free online course on edX — on religion, conflict and peace. With all that’s been happening in our country, I’ve felt a sense of hopelessness like never before. An academic insight into polarisation and religious conflict might help. Meanwhile, I’m cooking — the only skill I feel I imbibed genetically. I’m also reading my backlog of scripts and watching a film or a series every day. Having just finished The Spy, I’m now watching Unbelievable. I would recommend I Lost My Body, a drama/fantasy animation film. Beautifully scripted and skilfully visualised, it takes you through a journey of loneliness and love in a city. A Marriage Story is another. I think the subject [a marriage gone wrong], though fairly common, is one of the hardest to capture in cinema. Yet this film makes you feel the frustration, sadness and confusion of a failing marriage as if you are in it. And, finally, Gulon mein rang bhare. Currently on top of my list of favourites is Ali Sethi’s version (from Coke Studio season 12) of the Faiz Ahmad Faiz ghazal. Interestingly, it was written when he was in jail in Rawalpindi in 1954.

Santosh Sivan, cinematographer-filmmaker

I am all alone in Mumbai, feeding my fish, doing terrace gardening, reading and browsing. I’m watching the web series, Abstract: The Art of Design on Netflix, reading The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time and listening to world music.

Kajal Aggarwal, actor

Among podcasts, I enjoy listening to [Indian American entrepreneur and investor] Naval Ravikant. I love how he talks about his learnings and gives his suggestions. This confidence comes from a place of knowledge and time invested in reading. The Stuff You Should Know podcast, hosted by Josh Clark and Charles W Chuck Bryant, is super interesting. I [often catch] Ted Talks and one of my favourite motivational speakers is Brene Brown. I also listen to Simon Sinek. There are a lot more fantastic talks out there. I like listening to audio books, especially while cooking, working out [doing my cardio] or any activity that doesn’t require my 100% attention. Listening to these while completing your mundane chores is a great way to multitask and make it interesting.

Anurag Kashyap,filmmaker

You should watch nothing soppy because that will make you touch your face to wipe away the tears. Or even horror because that will also make you touch your face. I would suggest thrillers and drama: Watchmen, the series; all seasons of Breaking Bad; Succession;stand-up comics; and the entire body of work of your favourite directors.

Taapsee Pannu, actor

Honestly, I am just catching up on films that I missed watching last year and reading all the scripts [on which] I have to get back with an answer. I rarely watch films multiple times; I feel you’re wasting time when there are so many new ones you can watch. My advice to the homebound: watch Homeland.

Bina Paul, film editor

I’m watching feel-good films. It is not the time to feel depressed and sad. My selection includes Hollywood classics such as Casablanca, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, The Sting, Roman Holiday, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, etc. Then there are some really good Iranian films to binge watch — works by Majid Majidi, Abbas Kiarostami and Jafar Panâhi. Old Indian films are always a favourite, like Guide, Umrao Jaan and DDLJ. It is also a good time to catch some good documentaries on Netflix.

Geetu Mohandas, actor-director

I’m not someone who binge watches. I enjoy my solitude and, when I am on a break, I enjoy reading. Right now, I am re-reading for the nth time Amitav Ghosh’s The Hungry Tide. He is one of my favourite authors. At one time, I wanted to adapt his Sea of Poppies and I wrote to him in Goa. He said the rights of the book were with someone else. However, I am so happy I was able to interact with him. In addition, I am fine-tuning my script for my next film. It is in the last stages. Now that my daughter, Aradhana, is at home, my ‘me time’ is extremely limited. I have to keep her engaged. She is allowed only one hour of TV viewing. So I am really busy.

Rajiv Menon,director

I was running a writers’ room that, of course, has been put on hold. But I still come into the office to write. This time has also given me a chance to catch up on fiction books. I just finished A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman; it was light reading. Apart from Carnatic music, I’ve been listening to ‘The Planets’ [a seven-movement orchestral suite] by English composer Gustav Holst. From the UK Top 40, my picks are ‘Blinding Lights’ by The Weeknd and the new James Bond track, ‘No Time to Die’, by Billie Eilish. It is quite distinct from earlier Bond theme songs, and I like the lyrics as well. I managed to watch a couple of Malayalam movies too — Anjaam Pathiraa and Ayyappanum Koshiyum. The latter’s soundtrack was also great.

Manoj Bajpayee, actor

I am stuck in Uttarakhand as my shoot got suspended for 10 days. I’m catching up on films and TV shows. I watched The Irishman twice. It is a must for actors. I am amazed at the sheer persistence of the legends to evolve at this age. I recommend Succession. There is something about the show that is so damn exciting. Apart from the performances, it is the complications and unpredictability of the relationship that I found so intriguing. Fleabag is also a must for all, just to see the brilliance of every department, all in sync. It is a great series to catch while you are isolated.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/rd05fk/article31119449.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/pjimage,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/the-living-room-edit-a-social-distancing-to-do-list-curated-by-the-film-fraternity/article31119450.ece
37,2020/03/20,‘Baby Doll’ singer Kanika Kapoor confirms testing positive for coronavirus,"The singer had returned to Lucknow from London recently, and had attended other events as well before her diagnosis

Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor has posted on Instagram, confirming that she has tested positive for the coronavirus in Lucknow.

Known for her songs like Baby Doll and Desi Look, the singer stated that she has had symptoms for the last four days, after she returned to Lucknow from London 10 days ago.

Also read: Four politicians, including Derek O'Brien, go into self quarantine

Kanika wrote, “Hello everyone, For the past 4 days I have had signs of flu, I got myself tested and it came positive for Covid-19. My family and I are in complete quarantine now and following medical advice on how to move forward. Contact mapping of people I have been in touch with is underway as well.”

She added, “I was scanned at the airport as per normal procedure 10 days ago when I came back home, the symptoms have developed only 4 days ago. At this stage I would like to urge you all to practice self isolation and get tested if you have the signs.”

“I am feeling ok, like a normal flu and a mild fever, however we need to be sensible citizens at this time and think of all around us. We can get through this without panic only if we listen to the experts and our local, state and central government directives. Wishing everyone good health. Jai Hind! Take care, KK.”

Kanika had travelled from London to Mumbai by the Air India flight AI130 on March 10, since there is no direct flight from London to Lucknow. It is expected that as per GOI orders, screening would have been done at Mumbai for the singer. Passenger screening is being done for international flights only in India.

According to reports, the singer is currently at the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI), where she has been kept in isolation. Kanika attended three events recently since her return: two in Lucknow and one in Kanpur, and had also thrown a party for friends and family, that was attended by politicians and socialites. Efforts are underway to trace the guests now, as well as quarantine the apartment Kanika was staying in.

According to a statement by the Lucknow District Magistrate the administration has temporarily shut down the Taj Hotel in Lucknow where Kanika stayed.

Taj Hotel staff in self-quarantine

In a statement, the Taj Hotels said: “Kanika Kapoor stayed at the hotel but did not host a function or gathering at the hotel premises. The room occupied by her has been quarantined and disinfected. The staff who intersected with her have withdrawn into self-quarantine. There have been no further symptoms or incidents reported.”",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/76kndu/article31126457.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG2885-1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/baby-doll-singer-kanika-kapoor-confirms-testing-positive-for-coronavirus/article31117476.ece
38,2020/03/20,COVID 19: Southern film buffs more reluctant to go to the movies,"69% in Mumbai say they will stay away from theatres

Film buffs in the south are far more cautious when it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic than the ones in the north, a survey has shown.

The latest State-wise figures from Ormax Media’s ongoing study of the impact of the outbreak on theatre-going behaviour show that 78% of Kerala viewers polled said they would stay away if theatres were open and a film they wanted to watch was showing. This was followed by 74% from Karnataka saying they would not go to cinema halls, while West Bengal was in the third spot with 70%, followed by Andhra Pradesh-Telangana with 63%.

The exception to the rule in the south was Tamil Nadu, featuring 12th among 13 States polled, with 48% viewers claiming they would stay away. Uttar Pradesh stood at the very bottom, with 45% viewers saying they won’t be flocking to cinema halls because of the virus.

“While 61% viewers in Maharashtra claimed they will stay away, the percentage in Mumbai alone was relatively higher at 69%,” said Ormax CEO Shailesh Kapoor. According to him, the constant conversations on media and social media have added to the awareness of the crisis and led to a rising restraint.

The fourth in the series of surveys, conducted between March 16-18, showed a sharper spike with 58% of the country’s regular theatre-goers likely to stay away from theatres till the threat of the novel coronavirus has reduced. This was an increase from the 23% in the poll conducted between March 6 and 8, 26% in the one conducted between March 9 and 11 and 33% between March 12-15.

As many as 57% viewers in the Hindi-speaking markets said they will stay away, as opposed to 39% in the previous one and 28% and 26% in the ones before that. In the south, the rise was far more substantial — 58% said they will stay away from 30%, 21% and 17% previously.

Mr. Kapoor said things look uncertain for the industry for some months to a year. But it is getting increasingly clear that it will be one of the most crippling years for the industry in recent times. “With shoots stalled, the planned October, November, December releases are looking uncertain and will get pushed further. Some single screens were thinking of renovating in this interim, but even for that you need people.”

According to him, even when theatres reopen, it will take at least four to eight weeks for things to get back to the normal routine. In other words, it’s a long haul ahead.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fqa27r/article31112347.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BMAvoiding-Cinemacol,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/covid-19-southern-film-buffs-more-reluctant-to-go-to-the-movies/article31112349.ece
39,2020/03/20,I think it is time I launch my campaign: H.S. Doreswamy,"The Bengaluru-based centenarian freedom fighter is more amused than perturbed by the vicious attack that has been launched against him by the ruling party

A frail old man, a few weeks shy of 102, is keenly watching the proceedings of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly on television, reclining on a cot in his modest house in South Bengaluru. H.S. Doreswamy — freedom fighter, Gandhian and civic activist — is more absorbed than usual in the cacophonous news telecast because it is him that the Assembly is discussing.

The Bharatiya Janata Party in Karnataka has launched a virulent attack on the centenarian, starting with a former Union minister calling him a “fake freedom fighter” who behaves like a “Pakistani agent”. Several BJP leaders have joined in, alleging that the freedom fighter was partisan because he had done the unthinkable — criticised Hindutva icon V.D. Savarkar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Despite a pushback by the Opposition for three days in the Assembly, the BJP did not budge and refused to apologise for their comments. Instead, there were more vicious attacks, even dubbing him “anti-national”.

Comfortable in khadi

Doreswamy, clad in his signature khadi dhoti and kurta, does not seem very perturbed by what he was watching on TV.

“My life is an open book and I am confident the people will stand by me,” he says, baffled though he clearly is by the virulence of the attack. The untiring activist has been a leading voice against the CAA-NRC-NPR in the past few months. This also explains why he has been in the crosshairs of the BJP and Hindutva activists.

“Despite ideological differences, I could count many as friends in the BJP, and our arguments have been civil till now,” he says. “It is testimony to the complete intolerance of this regime to any criticism. Other critics have suffered far worse, being jailed or even killed. There is a systematic campaign to discredit and attack all voices of dissent.”

Drawing parallels with the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi, he says the present regime is fast hurtling towards a situation that is far worse.

“Now you don’t need to impose Emergency,” he says with a wry smile. “During the Emergency, I wrote a letter to the Prime Minister saying the British were more magnanimous than her in dealing with political prisoners. I was arrested but the court let me off, saying that as a citizen I was free to write a letter to my Prime Minister, however critical it was,” he recounts.

What he is doing now is quite the same: exerting his rights as a citizen to be critical of government policies he thinks are disastrous. “I have called for the defeat of this regime and will continue to work towards that. It doesn’t make me anti-national. We need to differentiate between the government, the state and the nation.”

Witness to Partition

He has been a vocal critic of CAA-NRC-NPR because he believes that it not only seeks to polarise the country on religious lines, but is also antithetical to the founding principles of our nation. “I was a witness to Partition. Pakistan became a Muslim nation, we remained secular. Only a handful of Muslim families went to Pakistan from Karnataka. The Muslims here chose to be Indians. They cannot be asked to prove their citizenship now,” he says. Moreover, he believes that CAA-NRC-NPR is also a “tyranny of documentation” that is not part of the culture of a majority of Indians, and its implementation will only create chaos.

Freedom movement

The campaign against him has gone so far as to even question his age. The Opposition had to marshal documents to confirm that he had been jailed for over a year in the city in 1942 during the Quit India Movement, as proof of both his age and the fact that he indeed participated in the freedom movement. This “test” has left Doreswamy more amused than angry. “We have elected people who don’t know history, no harm telling them.”

He walks down memory lane to the early years of his association with the freedom movement. “Back then, we ensured three major textile mills in the city were shut down. These mills were preparing parachute cloth used by the Air Force. So this hit the war effor. I used to supply time bombs that were put into government record rooms to destroy records. But none were hurt,” he recounts. It was only later that he turned Gandhian in an absolute sense. He brought out a weekly, Pouravani (Citizen’s Voice), that the British banned, pushing him underground.

But post-Independence, he slowly distanced himself from the Congress and emerged as a leading voice of civil society. He was active in Vinoba Bhave’s Bhoodan Movement, the JP Movement against the Emergency and, more recently, India Against Corruption. He has also been an urban activist, fighting for Bengaluru’s lakes and sustainable solid waste management, asking the civic authorities to stop dumping waste into landfills in villages. As a result, the city got six waste processing plants in 2014. He led an effort to mainstream left-wing extremists, along with the slain editor-activist Gauri Lankesh, who often described him as a “rockstar.” He now heads a trust in her memory. He also leads a struggle that demands land for the landless.

Conscience of the state

Describing him as the “conscience of the state for the last 70 years,” historian Ramachandra Guha recounted how as a student in the 1980s he was part of movements for the rights of farmers and other vulnerable communities with Doreswamy. “He was already in public life for 40 years. I was inspired by him then. Now in my 60s, I am still inspired by him,” Guha said at a recent anti-CAA protest where the two shared a stage.

Doreswamy is enthused by the organic spurt of protests against CAA-NRC across the country, but cautions that unless well co-ordinated they may fizzle out. “Ideally such movements need leadership. But we have to accept there is no such leadership today even in the Opposition. This calls for more reflection, caution and strategy to ensure the movement is not misled,” he says. “Hindu-Muslim unity is key and we must not allow the regime to paint this as a ‘Muslim issue’. It is advisable that all protests have both Hindus and Muslims.”

Meanwhile, his well-wishers have been trying to “manage him emotionally” from the double onslaught of the recent death of his wife, a companion of over 70 years, and the attacks on him by the Hindutva right. But a seemingly unaffected Doreswamy is busy thinking of his next campaign.

“I have only participated in protests others have organised against this regime till now. I think it is time I launch my campaign. Narendra Modi has only been diverting attention from real issues. The economy is in the doldrums and there is severe unemployment. If the government doesn’t shift its focus to people’s issues by year end, I will launch a non-cooperation movement.”

I must have Corona! Am experiencing breathlessness, sweating, palpitations every time there is a new forward.

Washing and bathing so often, have single-handedly run our building out of water supply. Like I care. I have to protect myself.

Used up husband’s alcohol supply as hand sanitiser on self and child. Drank enough to sanitise my insides too.

Child has fever. Children are carriers of Corona. Must not keep child at home and risk her infecting us. Gave her paracetamol and sent her to school.

Do not panic, says PM. Be responsible.

Panic, says WHO, take this seriously. Be responsible. Be smart.

I was smart. I pretended to cough and bought up the pharmacy’s stock of masks. To be safe.

To be even safer, let me buy up rice and dal for three months at least.

What? Empty shelves? Which selfish slug has already bought up all the rice and dal that I wanted to buy up? Paranoid idiots! Let me buy up whatever is left. Toothpicks, red chillies, toilet paper. In an emergency shut down, we can eat toilet paper for the next few months.

I sneezed today. OMG, I have only a few days to live. Or is it the red chillies? I went around hugging neighbours. Life is short, spread love.

Nose is still itching. Must not tell anyone. They will not let me attend the building party.

They will not let me attend the building party! No crowds over 100 people. I was the 101st sign-on. How mean to enforce social distancing rules! I anonymously call the police. The building party is shut down. I am on a moral high.

I send three forwards about how bad times bring out the good in everyone. No one in the building is talking to me.

City shut down. Can’t go to theatres, malls, restaurants. How am I supposed to survive? Live like a caveman? Already, we are expected to read books! Books, imagine! Next they will expect us to spend time talking to family members. Sad times.

Finally! Wake up to no new forwards on Corona. The world is cured! Oh, Wi-Fi modem was turned off.

Thirty three new forwards, with statistics and graphs. Everyone is at risk of getting Corona. Not me. Demanded a year’s paid leave from office to stay home. I am a responsible citizen.

My maid wants to stay home for a week as a responsible citizen. Threatened to sack her.

No maid. No job. No friends. No rice and dal. But I have toilet paper. And my moral high.

41,2020/03/20,"Empty beaches, postponed weddings, people work from home: India grapples with COVID-19","The pandemic has hurt India but it can’t keep it down

When wedding season begins in Delhi, starting in November and lasting till April, it’s brisk business for Simran Bedi. The enterprising beautician always has a gaggle of excited aunts, cousins, grand-aunts and brides lining up at her tiny single-storied pink salon, ready to be rouged up. This year though, her 10-year-old business has taken a beating.

The big fat Indian wedding has been hit by COVID-19, and it has dragged salons down with it. For Simran, the name of the virus has become a verb. “I have been coronaad,” she says. From making ₹6,000-10,000 a day in wedding season, Bedi’s earnings have dipped to ₹2,000.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal shut down clubs, swimming pools, gyms and malls last week, but left out weddings from his list of proscriptions, leaving it to people’s good sense to not congregate. And they seem to be listening. Not just weddings but many social activities are skidding to a halt as people themselves decide to practise ‘social distancing’, that new health mantra.

Business is bad

Social distancing might be the way to fight the virus, but it also means that businesses, big and small, are feeling the coronavirus heat. The airline industry is the worst off, with losses crossing $500 million. Without government aid, carriers say they may shut shop by May.

Kerala’s hospitality industry is also badly struck. With business conferences, retreats and B2B meetings cancelled, room occupancy is as low as 20%. “It’s come down to one or two rooms. Our operational costs are not being met,” says Sooraj Ramakrishnan, Senior Sales Manager at Zuri Kumarakom, a five-star resort. Many hotel chains are talking of 15-30% pay cuts for upper management and unpaid leave for junior staff.

Bengaluru’s restaurants have seen a staggering 70% decline in footfall — be it fine dining or the small darshinis. “The impact is going to be long-lasting and deep,” says Manu Chandra, the proprietor of several restaurants and Bengaluru Chapter Head, National Restaurant Association of India. “Hospitality depends on daily transactions to break even. Human resources and rentals are our highest costs. If this crisis doesn’t abate soon, we could be looking at closures and layoffs.”

But it’s those on the lowest rungs who might suffer the most. Birender Yadav is a spot boy from Mumbai’s Juhu Koliwada, a daily wage earner whose earnings have stopped because Bollywood has stopped shootings. “Ghar par hain. Shooting ruk jaane se ghar ka kiraya to nahin ruk jaata. Gareeb log kya khayenge, bachche kaise paalenge? (I am stuck at home. The shooting is stalled but we still have to pay rent. How will the poor eat, feed kids?)” he says. Yadav was working on Hungama 2. He makes ₹1,500-1,800 a day for a 15-16 hour shift. He hopes the Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) will do something to help members.

With commutes dropping sharply, thousands of cab drivers just can’t make ends meets. And, as of Thursday, aggregator companies did not have any compensation plan in place. In other sectors too, companies are laying off people or sending them on unpaid leave. Without a vaccine in sight yet, things are beginning to look grim.

All shut down

Shows, movies, malls, gyms, pools, zoos, amusement parks — they are all closed. Says Mumbai-based comedian Kajol Srinivasan, “All corporate gigs have been cancelled — the OML circuit comedy fest, the Pune Comedy Festival 4.0, all cancelled. And most producers have shut open mics until March 31.” Srinivasan has turned to designing to make money. How is she coping? “I am trying to write,” she says, “but mostly making gloomy calls to other comedians. And oh, I made orange marmalade, I am so bored.”

People have begun self-isolating. They have begun to call off addas, birthdays, gym and yoga classes. “I decided to stay away from yoga class today as it was pranayama day, which involves inhaling and exhaling air,” says Nirupa, who lives in a gated community in ATS Society in Delhi’s Indirapuram. She has just received a residents WhatsApp alert that the society gym and club have also closed. Her housing society plans to get infra-red thermometers to screen visitors.

Many complexes in Chennai and Bengaluru have already acquired these. Even though its efficacy is disputed, it’s being wielded faithfully everywhere — outside gyms, gated communities, office buildings, even Parliament.

In the heart of New Delhi is the sprawling Lodhi Gardens, a 15th-century legacy of the Lodhi dynasty, which doubles up as the capital’s green lung. Young couples can always be found here, romancing under the trees, oblivious to the walkers and runners around them. But Corona has frightened them away, and only a few couples can be seen now.

The famous middle-class mantra of shaping up for summer has also been put on hold. But Chirag Khurana of Anytime Fitness club, with its 45 centres around Delhi, has not given up. His 32,000 members have paid steep annual fees ranging from ₹28,000 to ₹50,000, and he has plans to e-mail them fitness tips, balanced diets and more. “We are not even looking at how the closure will impact business right now. Who knows, we may open by end-March,” he says with optimism, adding, “After this phase is over, more people might become health conscious.”

Cities are shutting down one after another. Even Mumbai, nonchalant till last weekend, got cautious. As the number of patients reached 48 in Maharashtra on Thursday, its jam-packed trains, metros and stations are no longer so full. Marine Drive is finally deserted, and restaurants have begun to down shutters.

Although Chennai’s malls, cinemas and shopping districts are shut, it is otherwise looking normal. Bengaluru seems more circumspect, with people staying off the streets. The railway station in Kerala’s capital wears a deserted look. In Kochi, we saw a deliveryman waiting outside the gate, hands resting on the bars. The lady of the house came out, took the package, then started wiping the gate down to sanitise it. This scene has quickly become a part of daily life.

In Pune, a retired Army officer says they have “stocked medicines, hygiene supplies, a month’s dry rations and drawn cash to prepare for coronavirus.” With 50-plus members and two cancer patients in his family, “we are proactively social distancing,” he says. “No visits except the most essential and we have stopped the domestic help too.” Even the protesting women of Shaheen Bagh have decided to limit their numbers at the protest site and take all the precautions prescribed by the Ministry of Health.

Panic stations

The bigger crisis right now seems to be panic. People have begun to stockpile: flour, rice, lentils, milk and medicines. Many stores are seeing empty shelves as people prepare to stay indoors. BigBasket’s website says deliveries will be delayed as there’s “an unprecedented increase in demand”. Grofers says “average ticket sizes are way higher than normal,” and warns customers that “excessive buying or multiple orders to bypass inventory limit can lead to order cancellation.”

Hand sanitisers and masks are in great demand even though medical advisers have repeatedly said that soap and water is a better cleanser. Both have vanished from shelves, despite the government requesting people not to hoard. A ₹100 pack of hand wipes sells for ₹190 in Mumbai while in Kochi, masks were ₹18 apiece. In Tamil Nadu, the Health Ministry issued notices to shops warning them against selling masks, sanitisers and thermometers at higher prices.

Stay home

“Mass work from home — this is uncharted territory,” says Amit Hardi, CEO of Bengaluru-based gaming firm Nukebox Studios. He began working from home this week, converting his guest bedroom into a home office. His colleagues are doing the same. “The dynamics will evolve over time, but we have no choice but to make this work for now,” he says.

Many offices along Chennai’s IT Expressway have declared work-from-home, with some firms insisting their employees sit in front of videocams as proof of working!

This might have an unexpected fallout. As more people stay home, infrastructure in these suburbs is likely to be hit hard. Residential complexes are worrying about how many more water tankers they have to order and how much oftener the sewage trucks have to come by.

With schools and colleges shut, people are trying to “reinvent family time”. Ranju B. in Bengaluru has ordered home several board games; the old dusty carrom board has been brought out, while some families say they are gardening together. People gather in fours and fives for yoga or dance and music lessons, while parents struggle to keep young kids engaged. Streaming services are in high demand, as are online schooling resources, virtual museums and operas, and free online Ivy League courses. Is the virus going to lead to deeper bonds being forged between family members?

Gods must be careful

The pandemic is changing how people pray. In Mumbai, the hugely popular Siddhivinayak and Mumbadevi temples have shut their doors. March is festival season in Kerala but temples, including Sabarimala, have cancelled cultural programmes and feasts, holding only rituals. Even the hugely popular Venkateswara Temple in Tirupati has been shut down, but Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has allowed Ram Navami celebrations in Ayodhya to go ahead.

Mosques are asking the faithful to pray from home; while some worshippers are coming to prayer in masks. It is Lent, but many Kerala parishes have cancelled daily prayers and religious heads are asking devotees to pray from home. Some churches have cancelled confessions, holy communion, and blessings by hand.

“Last Sunday, our priest forbade touching or kissing statues and the cross,” says Nitin Antony Francis, an entrepreneur in Kochi. The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India has sent out a list of dos and don’ts, which includes asking people to make the sign of peace with folded hands, to not kiss the cross on Good Friday, and for priests to dip their hands in sanitiser before holy communion.

Funny side up

As virus fears get stronger, governments are getting tougher against people who break rules. In Pune, a case was registered against the father of a young woman who encouraged his daughter to escape quarantine. In Kerala, when Bigg Boss contestant Rajith Kumar’s fans thronged Kochi airport on March 15 to welcome him, the police filed cases against 79 of them, including against Kumar.

But every depressing story has a silver lining. And nothing breaks the ice like the irrepressible Rakhi Sawant’s Twitter video imploring all the gods she knows to halt the virus in its tracks. Corona memes and COVID-19 jokes are at their best. Sex isn’t being ignored either, as people circulate images of complicated positions where face-to-face contact can be avoided during the act, and social media asks people to stockpile copies of the Kamasutra.

As India prepares to hunker down and wait for the virus to reach its expiry date, perhaps people might turn to books, writing and old-fashioned friendships? Life as we know it might have come to a halt but it’s certainly not at an end. Who knows, this sense of an ending might also herald a year of magical thinking.

42,2020/03/20,SEBI steps in to tackle volatility,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India has raised the margins in the cash segment while tightening norms for position limits in derivatives, as volatility continues to rise in the stock market.

The aim was to ensure effective risk management and market integrity, a statement said. The marketwide position limit in certain stocks in derivatives has been revised to 50% and the penalty on an entity found to exceed permissible limits has been enhanced to 10 times of the current minimum and five times of the maximum penalty structure.

Further, for stocks with a price band of 20% and witnessing an intra day (high-low) price movement of more than 10% for three or more days in the last one month, the minimum margin rate would be increased to 40% in a phased manner.

Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and mutual funds among others will be allowed to take short positions in index derivatives only to the extent of the notional value of their holding in the underlying stocks.

“Unlike most markets where short-selling was banned to curb speculation as a fallout of COVID-19, SEBI has prudently restricted market-wide position through this initiative,” said Ajay Kejriwal, president, Choice Broking.

“With increase in margins for cash segments in selective stocks, it will also reduce the volumes in the market and ensure less leverage and volatility for an investor worthy market which in recent times had seen India VIX at the highest level since the 2008,” he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/samik4/article31113574.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19bmarr-SEBITHG9G791FUD3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sebi-steps-in-to-tackle-volatility/article31122261.ece

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has appointed R. Gandhi and Ananth Narayan on the reconstructed board of private sector lender Yes Bank as additional directors.

Mr. Gandhi is a former RBI Deputy Governor. He was in the earlier board that was superseded by the banking regulator after a moratorium was imposed on the lender earlier this month.

Ananth Narayan is an associate professor, S. P. Jain Institute of Management and Research.

He was earlier with Standard Chartered Bank, Deutsche Bank and Citibank.

45,2020/03/20,Tata Sons tells staff to work from home,"Pay assured for temporary workers

Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran has announced that all the employees of the Tata Group will work from home and assured full payment to temporary workers and daily wage earners for March and April 2020.

The announcement comes amid the outbreak of COVID-19. “At the Tata Group, we have asked all of our companies to exercise extreme caution. The health and safety of our employees, their families and our suppliers, vendors and our larger ecosystem is of paramount importance.

“Our companies have largely enabled a ‘work from home’ (WFH) environment,” said a statement from Tata Sons, adding the group has asked its companies in India to rapidly and extensively adopt WFH to ensure that the employees travel only in the most essential cases, excluding situations in which they are involved in the delivery of products and services for the larger public good.

The current situation is likely to have a large and deep financial impact on the weaker socio-economic segments of the society.

“During this time of crisis, our group companies commit to ensuring full payments to the temporary workers and daily wage earners who are working in our offices and at our sites in India for the months of March and April, 2020, even if these workers are not able to work due to either quarantine measures, site closures, plant shutdowns or other reasons,” said the statement.

The other segment of particular focus is the micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) sector.

“Our group companies follow a policy of making timely payments of legitimate dues. Under the current situation, we will monitor this closely to ensure that such dues are paid on an immediate basis in order to provide liquidity,” said the statement.

The government is taking many proactive steps and precautionary measures to contain this threat in India.

“These are tough and uncertain times, and the nation needs our collective efforts. As our Honourable Prime Minister mentioned yesterday, resolution and restraint are important to combat this pandemic. Each day matters in our fight against this disease.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has put in motion a contingency plan in the wake of the spread of COVID-19 to ensure that the financial markets continue to function smoothly.

A property in the vicinity of the primary data centre has been identified to host 150 personnel of the RBI and service providers. About 70 support staff were also isolated within the hotel on a continuous basis.

Since information technology infrastructure forms the backbone of most businesses, and especially the financial system, RBI data centres play a crucial role.

About 600 people belonging to third-party service providers are generally deployed at data centres for non-IT and IT services, apart from 60 RBI officials.

“All residents have been asked to be prepared for the separation, while being assured that one can leave the group in case of any family or other emergency,” said a source. This plan was implemented from Thursday to ensure continuity of critical services of the RBI.

Similar arrangements have been made at other data centres too to run systems with maximum services whenever there is a need to shift operations from the current location.

The data centres of the central bank run critical systems like real time gross setllement, national electronic fund transfer, services for government and interbank transactions, currency management, among others.

Under the minimum staffing plan, two batches are formed, with the second batch kept on ready standby to take over when required. A backup replacement pool was also prepared.

After four days of continued sell off in the equity markets, Indian benchmarks gained strong ground on Friday amid a global rally in stocks.

The 30-share Sensex gained 1,627.73 points, or 5.75%, to close at 29,915.96. The broader Nifty settled the day at 8,745.45, gaining 482 points, or 5.83%.

This was the first gain for the indices after four consecutive days of losses. The India VIX index, a barometer for volatility, also fell a little over 7% on Friday.

The benchmarks of Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Singapore and Philippines all ended Friday with strong gains. “Indian markets bounced back on the back of positive global cues,” said Gaurav Dua, head, capital market strategy and investments, Sharekhan. “The news flow on COVID-19 continues to be mixed with an exponential jump in new cases in the U.S. though there is an improving trend in China. Volatility could persist in the near term,” he added. While most frontline stocks gained ground on Friday after falling to multi-year lows, many side counters lost ground as well, as a little over 1,000 stocks declined against 1,426 gainers.

Foreign investors, however, continued their selling activity with net sales pegged at ₹4,623 crore even as their domestic counterparts were net buyers at ₹4,367 crore.

In the Sensex pack, 28 of the 30 stocks gained on Friday with stocks like ONGC, HUL, Reliance Industries, TCS, Tata Steel, Asian Paints, HDFC, Tech Mahindra and ITC all gaining over 8% each.

The State Bank of India (SBI) has taken the lead in providing relief to its customers to tide over the crisis caused by the spread of COVID-19, by opening emergency credit lines with a maximum limit of ₹200 crore.

The scheme will be in force till June 30. The loan tenure will be 12 months with an interest rate of 7.25%. All standard accounts that have not been classified as SMA (Special Mention Account) 1 or 2 as on March 16 and till the date of sanction are eligible, a circular issued by the SBI said.

“With a view to provide some degree of relief to borrowers whose operations are impacted by COVID-19, it is decided by the bank to make available additional credit facilities to eligible, existing borrowers by way of ad-hoc facilities to tide over the current crisis situation,” the circular said.

Customers can avail up to 10% of the existing fund-based working capital limit and the maximum amount they can get is ₹200 crore. The loan can be availed of in one go.

“However, the total additional exposure, including the present facility, should not exceed 25% of the fund--based working capital exposure,” said the circular reviewed by The Hindu.

There will not be any processing fee or prepayment penalty for such a loan.

The loan is repayable in six equated monthly instalments after a moratorium of six months from the date of disbursement of the loan.

“The company has filed an interlocutory application today before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India seeking relaxation of the deadline set for sale or registration of BS-IV vehicles i.e. 31.03.2020,” it said in an exchange filing.

The company said it has sought the three-month extension, “in view of the completely unforeseen developments that have arisen out of the prevailing force majeure situation on account of COVID-19...as this has hampered all aspects of our industry..”

51,2020/03/20,Over half of India Inc. catches a cold,"Many companies see huge reduction in orders, cash flows, says FICCI survey

Over 50% of Indian businesses are seeing marked impact on their operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while about 45% companies believe that it could take at least six months for the situation to come under control, according to a study by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).

“A significant 53% of Indian businesses indicate the marked impact of the coronavirus pandemic on business operations even at early stages,” the survey, which saw participation from 317 companies between March 15-19, 2020, said. Almost three-fourth of the businesses indicated big reductions in orders. “Of these, almost 50% indicated a 20% and more decrease in the orders,” it said.

Likewise, almost 80% of companies reported a decrease in cash flow, with more than 40% respondents reporting a fall of 20% or more in cash flows. Asked about the expected time for normalcy to return, 45.21% respondents said it would take six months, while 42.47% expected it in three months. The survey added that nearly 30% organisations have put in place work-from-home policies for their employees.

However, it added that for some sectors, including manufacturing units, banking and IT, the work-from-home proposition is posing implementation challenges. “A combination of monetary, fiscal and financial market measures is needed to help the businesses and people cope with the crisis,” it said.

Among other things, it suggested that the cost of funds be brought down through reduction in policy rates, increase credit limits for all regular banking accounts by 25% across the board and bring in flexibility in the banking system to reschedule payment terms without the need for provisioning. It added that the government should not pare down its capital spending plans despite any shortfall in tax collections.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/nyo5si/article31122251.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THBUIT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/over-half-of-india-inc-catches-a-cold/article31122252.ece
52,2020/03/20,"Egg, broiler prices slump as virus fears take heavy toll on sector","Ex-farm broiler price at all-time low of ₹10-15 per kg; maize, which goes into poultryfeed, also sees fortunes plummet

Chicken prices have crashed from ₹90 a kg last month to ₹20 in Mumbai, as retail buyers are staying away from consuming poultry for fear of the COVID-19 disease.

Despite several awareness campaigns to demolish misconceptions that poultry had something to do with the dreaded virus, people are still steering clear of chicken.

Poultry companies listed on the exchanges, such as Venky’s (India) Ltd and Simran Firms Ltd (SFL) are likely to report lower revenues this quarter as business has suffered. “Poultry prices are at all time low. Ex-farm broiler price is ₹10-15 per kg ( cost of production is ₹75 per kg) and egg prices are ₹1.5 per egg ex-farm (cost of production is ₹3.50 per egg).

Due to reduction in chicken and egg production, feed demand and prices are coming down on daily basis. The price of the main raw materia, like corn and soyabean meal, have dropped more than 10% over the last 2 weeks,” said a spokesperson for Godrej Agrovet Ltd.

As per a previous estimate, the poultry trade in Maharashtra was losing more than ₹10 crore a day due to lack of appetite for chicken.

“Though there is no direct link between chicken and the virus, people will stay away from poultry as long as the fear is there. It will impact poultry firms like Venky’s and SFL and any other company linked to this business. In this quarter, their revenues will be lower and the trend has been reflected in their share prices on account of this direct impact,” said Ambareesh Baliga, independent equity analyst.

Poultry farmers are bearing the brunt due to the price crash. “The business has collapsed. Now, prices have crashed to ₹20 a kg. Earlier, I used to sell 150 birds day, now it has come down to a dozen,” said Salim Momin, a poultry dealer from Lalbaug, Mumbai.

In Tamil Nadu, which produces nearly one crore broiler chicken a week, the industry is badly hit.

“The broiler sector in the State has suffered nearly ₹600 crore loss in the last one month,” said R. Lakshmanan, MD of Shanthi Feeds and president of Broiler Coordination Committee.

He told The Hindu that the farmgate price for broiler in Tamil Nadu was fixed at ₹15-₹20 a kg on Thursday and ₹25-₹30 a kg on Friday. “The prices went to almost nil level and are reviving for the last two days. Retail off-take is improving now,” he said.

The poultry sector has appealed to the Centre for restructuring of bank loans, moratorium for a year and interest subvention support. “We fear the industry will lose sustainability if there is no support from the government,” Mr. Lakshmanan said.

Prices of eggs have also seen a decline.

P. Selvaraj, zonal chairman of the National Egg Coordination Committee, Namakkal, said egg prices had slumped to ₹1.25 each (farm gate price). “We fixed the price at ₹2 an egg. The actual price at which it is sold by farms is ₹1.25,” he said. The normal farmgate price at this time of the year used to be ₹3.50-₹3.60. Tamil Nadu produces nearly three crore eggs daily. Eggs are also supplied to Kerala, Bengaluru and in winter, to north India as well. With the virus impact, “there is a daily loss of nearly ₹7.5 crore,” he said. Farmers have reduced production from 3.5 crore eggs to 3 crore. They have stock worth ₹15 crore, he said.

Prices of maize that goes into making poultry feed has reduced significantly.

Grain merchant Devendra Vora, proprietor, Friendship Brokers, APMC Market, Navi Mumbai, said maize prices have been falling over the last 2-3 months.

“Since demand for poultry feed has come down, maize prices have suffered. Due to the coronavirus effect, prices have fallen to ₹1,500-₹1,600 per 100 kg from ₹1,900 in January.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/cwxy2p/article31122207.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THBUBROILER,https://www.thehindu.com/business/egg-broiler-prices-slump-as-virus-fears-take-heavy-toll-on-sector/article31122209.ece

57,2020/03/20,Coronavirus | Lack of clarity left Indians stranded abroad,"Airlines blame the language used in the advisories issued to them;

Many Indians have been left stranded in different parts of the world owing to airlines “misinterpreting” travel advisories issued by the government, according to a senior official of the Ministry of External Affairs.

Also Read Coronavirus | Janata curfew on March 22 between 7 am and 9 pm, says Modi

However, several airlines operating on international routes assert that the circulars lacked clarity, causing utter confusion on the ground.

“At least 20 Indians in London and 32 at Schipol, Amsterdam, were left behind by airlines because of the misinterpretation of guidelines. Travel advisories barred the entry of passengers coming from Europe or the U.K., but airlines barred those who had travelled from Canada or the U.S. to these countries from boarding,” Dammu Ravi, Additional Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs, told The Hindu.

Multiple instances

He was referring to passengers transiting through the Heathrow airport in London and Schipol in Amsterdam and being carried by foreign carriers. He added that Indian missions in these countries had requested the airlines to board these passengers but the carriers asked for a clarification in writing.

It is evident from social media accounts that such instances are not restricted to one or two countries, but are widespread. Business consultant Rajesh Saigal took to Twitter to post his appeal to External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and ask how India could deny the return of its own citizens. He was offloaded by Singapore Airlines as he transited through Manila.

“Almost every country has banned tourist visas, so people have to be allowed back to their countries. I am only asking you to open your doors to Indians,” Mr. Saigal said in a video.

Transit ignored

The Hindu spoke to executives of several airlines, who blamed the language of different advisories banning entry of passengers for the chaos. A senior executive of an international airline said many advisories omitted the status of passengers in transit, i.e., those travelling from a country from where there is no ban but catching a flight from which there is, or vice versa. This led to much confusion.

For instance, a circular issued on March 16 read, “Travel of passengers from member countries of the European Union, the European Free Trade Association, Turkey and the United Kingdom to India is prohibited with effect from 18th March 2020. The airline shall enforce this at the port of initial departure.”

When asked, officials of the Ministry of External Affairs said Indian missions were exploring all options for the return of passengers home, but with the government deciding to suspend all incoming flights from March 22 for a week, thousands of Indians around the world wanting to return have only one day, Saturday, to find a way home.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9p0zkp/article31122117.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THINDIANSSTRANDEDABROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lack-of-clarity-left-indians-stranded-abroad/article31122118.ece
58,2020/03/20,Coronavirus | Left slams PM on steps to counter COVID-19 outbreak,"‘PM failed to outline concrete steps on COVID-19’

The Left parties slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the nation on the COVID-19 saying that the PM failed to outline any concrete measures to contain it and its economic fallout.

The CPI(M) has made 11 demands, including cash transfer of ₹5,000 to Jan Dhan accounts and all BPL (Below Poverty Line) beneficiaries to temporarily tide over the crisis. The party also demanded that the public distribution system hand out free rations for a month to all BPL and APL families. With the ongoing lockdown, the country is staring at a spiralling unemployment rate and to counter its impact, the MGNREGA should be extended from 100 to 150 days, the CPI(M) Polit Bureau said.

It demanded that a financial package be instituted for sectors particularly hit by the pandemic. The informal sector should also be remembered during such a hand- holding exercise, the party said.

“Workers and employees who have to stay away from work due to the outbreak should be given paid sick leave. There should be a moratorium on bank loans for a year for SMEs and retail traders,” the party said in a statement.

The Communist Party of India too flagged similar concerns. Calling Mr. Modi’s speech extremely disappointing, party general secretary D. Raja said no concrete measures were announced to help the daily wagers.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) produced former Yes Bank MD and CEO Rana Kapoor before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court here on Friday.

Kapoor was remanded in judicial custody till April 2.

The ED has been maintaining that during his tenure, Kapoor was instrumental in sanctioning ₹30,000 crore in loans, of which ₹20,000 crore had turned non-performing assets (NPA). There are allegations that while granting loans, Kapoor accepted illegal gratification, and money was diverted through these companies.

Kapoor told the court that he was suffering from low immunity and acute depression. His lawyer Aabad Ponda submitted that a person with low immunity would be susceptible to COVID-19 and said if he was sent to jail, Kapoor might contract something serious.

60,2020/03/20,LS passes Bill to tag 5 more IIITs as institutions of national importance,"Such institutes have recorded 100% placement and follow reservation policy, says Ramesh Pokhiriyal

The Lok Sabha on Friday passed a Bill to confer the status of Institution of National Importance (INI) on five more Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs).

The Bill proposes to bring the five institutions — located in Surat, Bhopal, Bhagalpur, Agartala and Raichur — under the Indian Institutes of Information Technology (Public-Private Partnership) Act, 2017, similar to the other 15 IIITs established under the scheme through public-private partnership.

These five IIITs, along with the 15 others, will be able to use the nomenclature of Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) or Master of Technology (M.Tech) or Ph.D degrees. The status will also help the institutes attract students required to develop a strong research base in information technology.

Human Resource Development Minister Ramesh Pokhiriyal, replying to a debate, said such institutes had recorded 100% placement. These institutes followed the reservation policy announced by the government, he said, clearing the doubts raised by some MPs.

Ram Kripal Yadav of the BJP underscored the need for opening more such institutes in Bihar.

Saugata Roy of the Trinamool Congress supported the Bill and urged the government to look into the curriculum of these IIITs to put them on a par with the IITs. The Indian institutes were lagging in hardware education, he said, and it was essential for the country to make its own computers.

The Supreme Court on Friday stayed the interim orders passed by the Kerala and Allahabad High Courts to defer Central and State tax recovery proceedings, including the GST, till April 6 on account of the COVID-19 outbreak.

A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar ordered a freeze on the implementation of the High Courts’ orders on an urgent mentioning made by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta for the Centre.

Also read: MPs call for concrete steps to deal with COVID-19

Mr. Mehta said the “broad and omnibus” directions arbitrarily passed by the High Courts would have a “catastrophic” strain on national finances, and in fact, on the nation's ongoing battle against the pandemic and its monthly commitments like payment of salaries.

“The government is conscious of the prevailing situation and will take suitable measures to alleviate any hardship... The government is fully committed to using all its resources at its command to deal with the situation arising out of the coronavirus pandemic and it is taking pro-active precautions and measures... It has also been praised by the World Health Organisation for its response,” Mr. Mehta told the court during the mentioning.

The orders were passed by High Courts on March 19. The courts also extended limitations to conclude tax assessments, etc.

Also read: Janata curfew | Railways to cancel several long-distance and passenger trains on March 22

A special leave petition filed by the Centre through advocate Zoheb Hossain said the postponement of payment of taxes would result in a “severe cash flow and liquidity crisis and cash crunch and consequently the government will find it extremely difficult to run even its basic maintenance and development activities and pay salary to its crores of employees, pensioners, wage earners including armed forces, police, and health workers”.

The Centre said such judicial orders would serve as an unwarranted impetus to those financially capable to pay taxes in time. Even they would wait till April 6 because the consequences of late payment such as late fee, penalty, interest, etc. have been deferred.

“It has been the common experience that that almost 90% of the taxes get paid only on the last date or one or two days before the last date,” the petition said.

The directions of the High Courts would severely impact the monthly revenue collections of the Government of India, which are to the tune of two lakh crore. The High Courts have encroached upon purely executive functions and policy decision-making, which should be best left to the Executive.

“Have the High Courts failed to consider that most of the taxes are made online without human to human contact and there is no legal basis or rationale behind the broad direction to defer recovery proceedings till 06.04.2020"" the Centre asked in its appeal before the Supreme Court.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-sc-stays-hcs-orders-to-defer-central-state-tax-recovery-proceedings-till-april-6/article31121880.ece
62,2020/03/20,Courts can order passport surrender in contempt cases: SC,"The Supreme Court has held that courts are empowered to order parties in a contempt case to surrender their passport in order to ensure their presence in the proceedings.

“In order to ensure the presence of the parties in the contempt proceedings, the court is empowered to pass appropriate orders, including the surrender of passport,” a Bench of Justices R. Banumathi and A.S. Bopanna held in a judgment pronounced on March 19.

The apex court clarified that contemnors would only be depositing their passport with the court.

The court was hearing a contempt case in connection with a civil suit on partition of a disputed property in Delhi. A Single Judge of the Delhi High Court had ordered one of the parties in the dispute to surrender his passport. However, a Division Bench of the court set aside the Single Judge order on August 1, 2018. It held that there was no need to “detain” the passport and ordered its return.

But Justice Banumathi agreed with the Single Judge’s order. “The order [of the Single Judge] was passed to ensure the presence of the first respondent [contemnor] and compliance of the order of the court. It cannot be said that the Single Judge exceeded the jurisdiction or committed an error in ordering the surrender of the passport,” Justice Banumathi wrote in a 21-page judgment.

The court referred to a 2003 decision in David Jude vs. Hannah Grace Jude, in which the apex court directed the Centre to cancel the passport of the contemnor to ensure her appearance before the court on the date of hearing. The top court finally set aside the Division Bench order of the High Court. The Bench asked the Single Judge to continue with the civil suit over the property and dispose it of expeditiously within a period of nine months.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2at24b/article31121764.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TH-SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/courts-can-order-passport-surrender-in-contempt-cases-sc/article31121765.ece
63,2020/03/20,"In new Defence Procurement Procedure, MoD creates category for leasing equipment","The draft DPP 2020 will come into effect on April 1, 2020 and be in force for five years

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has for the first time introduced leasing of defence equipment as a new category for acquisition in the draft Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) 2020.

The draft was released by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday for further suggestions from industry before being finalised for promulgation. It will come into effect from April 01, 2020 and supersede DPP 2016. “This DPP would remain in force till 31 March 2025,” the draft said.

Other proposed measures include making after-sales support part of the capital acquisition contract, higher indigenous content in acquisitions and incentives for local material and software and emphasis on product export under offsets.

The draft was finalised by a committee headed by Director General Acquisition, which was set up in August 2019.

Leasing has been introduced as a new category for acquisition in addition to the existing ‘Buy’ and ‘Make’ categories to substitute huge initial capital outlays with periodical rental payments, the draft stated.

“Leasing is permitted under two categories, Lease [Indian] where Lessor is an Indian entity and is the owner of the assets and Lease [Global) where Lessor is a Global entity. This will be useful for military equipment not used in actual warfare like transport fleets, trainers, simulators, among others,” the draft stated.

The draft proposed increasing the indigenous content stipulated in various categories of procurement by about 10% to support the ‘Make in India’ and a simple and realistic methodology had been incorporated for verification of indigenous content for the first time, the MoD said. It included “assurance of procurement on a single vendor basis from Aero Engine manufacturing unit and chips from FAB manufacturing units established in the country.”

New chapters

New chapters have been introduced for procurement of software and systems related projects due to fast obsolescence, Post Contract Management to facilitate and provide clear guidelines, given long time of defence deals. Another new category introduced is ‘Buy’ (Global – Manufacture in India) with minimum 50% indigenous content on cost basis of total contract value.

The scope and options for product support have been widened to include contemporary concepts like Performance Based Logistics (PBL), Life Cycle Support Contract (LCSC) and Comprehensive Maintenance Contract (CMC) to optimise life cycle support for equipment. “The capital acquisition contract would normally also include support for five years beyond the warranty period,” it added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/96ksr4/article30727879.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAJNATHSINGH-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/in-new-defence-procurement-procedure-mod-creates-category-for-leasing-equipment/article31121754.ece

“Justice has prevailed. It is of utmost importance to ensure dignity and safety of women. Our Nari Shakti has excelled in every field. Together, we have to build a nation where the focus is on women empowerment, where there is emphasis on equality and opportunity,” he said without directly mentioning the Nirbhaya case.

Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani told reporters, “I greet this day with aplomb that justice has finally been done to Nirbhaya. The hanging is a message for every criminal that one day law will catch up with you. It will send out a strong message to criminals that they cannot escape the law”.

Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said it was time for introspection by the judiciary, the government and ensure that capital punishment convicts not be allowed to manipulate the system to delay for seven years. “It’s a day of satisfaction that a daughter, who underwent so much pain, has got justice,” he told reporters outside the Parliament House.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called for a collective resolution to remove loopholes in the system so it doesn’t happen to any daughter again. “After seven years, Nirbhaya case convicts were hanged today. It’s a day to take a resolution that we will not allow another Nirbhaya case. Police, courts, state governments and the Centre should resolve to collectively remove loopholes in the system to let this not happen to any daughter,” he tweeted in Hindi.

Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said Nirbhaya had got Justice. “Let us always remember that anyone who outrages the dignity of women will not be forgiven. Let us create new India where every woman is respected and given equal opportunity,” he tweeted.

Nirbhaya Fund

The Congress, however, targeted the Modi government for not doing enough including non-utlisation of the Nirbhaya Fund that was meant to enhance the safety of women.

Party leader Amee Yajnik said, “I think Nirbhaya’s justice is delivered by the judicial system because of whatever evidence was there but the implementation of the Nirbhaya Fund is not happening. It is a sorry state of affairs. I think the government should speak up about the plan or the road map for giving safety and security to the women of this country”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/q9nkmh/article31121744.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TH-AMBULANCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/justice-done-say-pm-ministers-on-nirbhaya-convicts-hanging/article31121745.ece

Dr. Vardhan made the intervention during the Question Hour, while his Cabinet colleague, Minister for AYUSH Shripad Naik, was facing questions on his Ministry’s advisory on traditional medicine systems with regard to COVID-19.

“I want to assure all the members that we’re doing testing and treatment as per scientifically advised protocols,” Dr. Vardhan said in response to Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MP Ritesh Pandey’s question on why more testing was not being done.

Dr. Vardhan said the many theories over the origin of the coronavirus in China were not something to dwell on.

“I do not think there is any need for any apprehension. A lot of things are making the rounds in Whatsapp and all. At the moment, as per our conversations with the WHO, there is neither any authenticity nor any substance in those reports,” he said in response to a direct question from Congress member Manish Tewari, who had apprehensions over the origin of the virus as not being “naturally occurring” but the result of a scientific experiment gone wrong.

Dr. Vardhan said that as far as the reports of origin of the virus was concerned, it was an ongoing process and that the Chinese government had informed the WHO at various stages. “Every time a new virus comes, it gets mutated and a new virus comes. China reported the first case in their country to whole world on 30th of December when they said that they have noticed some cases of pneumonia, which have an unknown aetiology and they were not able to pinpoint the actual cause of that. On 7th January, 2020, they reported to the World Health Organisation that they have been able to establish that this is probably a new corona virus,” he said.

67,2020/03/20,"Is Parliament exempt from its own laws, asks Opposition","Parliamentarians again demanded a closure of House over COVID-19 outbreak.

Opposition parties once again reiterated their demand to close Parliament in the face of the COVID 19 outbreak, questioning whether Parliament was exempt from the laws it makes.

By Friday evening, at least seven MPs had gone into self-quarantine after coming directly or indirectly in contact with affected patients.

Three of them — BJP MP Dushyant Singh, Apna Dal MP Anupriya Patel, and TMC MP Derek O’ Brien — announced the self-quarantine on Friday.

Earlier, Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan, BJP MP Suresh Prabhu and Sukhendu Shekar Ray of the Trinamool Congress had gone into self-quarantine after coming in direct or indirect contact with affected patients. Another BJP MP Varun Gandhi is the latest lawmaker to self-quarantine.

Age factor

“About 44% of MPs in Rajya Sabha and 22% in Lok Sabha are 65 years or above. The government preaches one thing and practices another,” Mr O’ Brien said.

Earlier in Rajya Sabha, Chairman Venkaiah Naidu read out the leave application of Mr Ray, who sought leave for “self- quarantine” because of growing number of coronavirus affected persons. In his leave application he quoted the government’s orders to avoid large gatherings.

This prompted deputy leader of the Congress Anand Sharma to point out that Parliament is functioning as an exception to the government’s own decisions.

“Firstly, the Epidemics Act has been invoked in Delhi and in the rest of the country. So, is Parliament exempt from the laws which Parliament makes? Government has invoked the Epidemic Act in Delhi,” Mr Sharma said. Flagging a Press Information Bureau notification which recommended that those above 65 years should not venture out of their houses, he said, “I am above 65. Hon. Chairman is above 65. There are so many Members above 65. So, what example is Parliament setting about the respect for the laws of the land and government's notification?”

At this Mr. Naidu immediately responded with: “God Bless you! Nothing will happen to you and me.”

Suspend biometrics

Speaking during the Zero Hour, when parliamentarians are allowed to raise issues of public importance, at least three members spoke on issues related to the outbreak.

CPI (M)’s Jharna Baidya demanded that biometric authentication for public distribution system should be suspended till the outbreak was reined in. She said the Left government in Kerala had already brought in this change. Two BJP MPs Satish Chandra Dubey and Kirodi Lal Meena both raised the issue of Indian students stranded in the Philippines.

68,2020/03/20,Janata curfew | Railways to cancel several long-distance and passenger trains on March 22,"Railways have asked all its zones to regulate all trains in their respective regions including suburban railway network.

Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a “janata curfew” on March 22, the Indian Railways has decided that no passenger train will originate from any railway station in the country from midnight to 10 p.m. on March 22. In addition, no mail, express or intercity trains originating between 4 a.m. and 10 p.m. will operate on March 22.

In its directive, the Indian Railways stated that the demand for rail travel would be “vastly reduced during the Janata Curfew” and asked all Zonal Railways to regulate all trains, including suburban railway networks.

However, the Railways clarified, “Wherever long distance trains and intercity trains have huge occupancy, Zonal Railways may at their discretion decide to not cancel such trains and run them as per schedule/revised schedule so that large numbers of passengers do not get stranded on 22.03.20.”

It also directed Zonal Railways to keep a close watch on the situation at major railway stations, and where needed order special trains to clear the rush of passengers who may be stranded at stations despite advance public notice.

The move will impact about 2,400 passenger trains and approximately 1,300 long-distance mail/express, and intercity trains. As per the order, such train services that are already running at 7 a.m. on March 22 will be allowed to reach their destination.

The Railways stated that suburban services in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai and Secunderabad will be reduced to “bare minimum levels” only to cater to essential travel requirement, keeping in view that March 22 falls on a Sunday.

“Passengers alighting at en route stations from trains already on run and desirous of staying at the station may be accommodated in the waiting halls, waiting rooms and concourse without creating overcrowding conditions. Provision of drinking water, refreshments (on payment) shall be arranged to cater to these needs of such passengers,” the Indian Railways said.

Further, the order instructed that adequate arrangements may be made to facilitate hassle-free refund to passengers affected by train cancellations.

70,2020/03/20,Chidambaram says coronavirus ‘does not respect moral armaments’,"₹5 lakh crore will be needed to deal with economic crisis because of COVID-19, says the former Union Finance Minister.

Former finance minister P. Chidambaram says the government should seize the moment and go for a lock-down in view of the coronavirus crisis, and suggests a roadmap to deal with the economic fallout. Edited excerpts of an interview with Sandeep Phukan.

You would have heard Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech carefully. What did you make of it?

I can understand the Prime Minister’s desire to not cause panic. At the same time, the Prime Minister should not give the impression that things are under control and will be under control by these symbolic measures. Coronavirus does not respect moral armaments.

You supported the Prime Minister's message last night and have changed your position now...?

I have not changed my position. As a citizen, I am bound to support the Prime Minister when he appeals to the nation in an emergency or a crisis. But immediately thereafter, I pointed out that the Prime Minister’s appeal does not go far enough. I have no doubt that he will be compelled to come back to the people in two or three days with tougher measures, including social and economic measures. I believe they [the Modi government] are borrowing the idea of NYAY [minimum income guarantee scheme], which was in our manifesto, and they are planning [to provide] a certain monthly allowance to the very poor people, whether it will cover 20% or 25%, I do not know. I am very happy about it.

Do you think that the government will have the fiscal space to do so?

The government has to create the fiscal space for itself. I think the shortfall in Budgeted revenues will be more or less made up by the savings in crude oil prices. So let’s assume that net-net there is no gain or loss there. The total government expenditure of the Central government in 2020-21 will be a little over ₹30 lakh crore and all State governments put together will spend between ₹40 lakh and ₹45 lakh crore. We are, therefore, talking about a scale of expenditure in the region of ₹70 lakh to ₹75 lakh crore for the whole country. To tide over the crisis, caused by a lock-down, and economic hardship, the government may have to mobilise about ₹5 lakh crore. I am sure we can find this amount.

You have been advocating a partial lock-down if not a complete lock-down. Many would argue that that's not feasible in India without better social security. Moreover, the Constitutional system doesn’t allow it.

You will be surprised how resilient people are. I am convinced, after reviewing developments in the rest of the world, that it is imperative to lock-down our towns and cities for two to four weeks. I agree it will be more difficult to implement a lock-down in rural India. We have done it in times of curfew. Therefore, the only way to ensure that we don’t move from stage two to stage three [in the coronavirus epidemic] is to seize the moment now. Every epidemiologist tells us that this moment will pass in 10 to 14 days.

We are suggesting a number of economic measures to be taken. The first thing the government should do is, by law, direct that all registered employers shall maintain current levels of employment and wages. The economic losses that they will suffer must be compensated by tax credits, deferred credits and outright grants in some cases. Once you ensure that all registered employers maintain current levels of employment and wages, the informal sector will also be partially compensated. There will be some in the informal sector who will not be compensated. For them, you will have to make a monthly payment on the lines of the NYAY programme.

Second, in agriculture, I think the PM KISAN [Pradhan Mantri Krishi Samman Nidhi] amount should be doubled straightaway, the other half amount should be paid straight away, and tenant farmers should be brought within its scope. The bulk of agricultural labour will also be partially protected. Those left out will have to be helped by a monthly payment.

I think the Prime Minister should have addressed a video conference with all Chief Ministers several days earlier, which he is doing today. I don’t think there are any Constitutional prohibitions. I think our Constitution is resilient enough and flexible enough to be interpreted to give such powers to the executive. Several State governments are, even as we speak, ahead of the Central government. Punjab has stopped all public transport, Maharashtra has declared Section 144 in many parts of Mumbai.

In terms of numbers, what do you think would be the impact of Covid19 on the Indian economy?

If the world economy slows down by 2%, our economy will also slow down by up to 2%. I have no knowledge about the length of the impact of COVID19, but let’s assume that the worst phase will be contained, say, in four to six months. So the economic package we are talking about is for four to six months.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cvif5j/article31119030.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHIDAMBARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chidambaram-says-coronavirus-does-not-respect-moral-armaments/article31119031.ece

FIR lodged

An FIR has been lodged against the singer for negligence. She is booked under sections 188, 269 and 270 of the IPC.

While section 188 pertains to disobedience, section 269 charges her for negligent act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life and section 270 refers to malignant act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life.

The FIR was lodged at the Sarojini Nagar police station on the complaint of the Chief Medical Officer, Lucknow.

74,2020/03/20,Rana Kapoor sent to judicial custody; lawyer fears he may get coronavirus,"The CBI, meanwhile, obtained a production warrant against him in another case.

Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor, arrested in a money laundering case, is “easily susceptible” to getting infected by the coronavirus in prison, his lawyer told a court here on Friday.

Kapoor, arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) earlier this month, was remanded in judicial custody till April 2 as the investigation agency did not seek his further remand.

The CBI, meanwhile, obtained a production warrant against him in another case.

As his earlier remand ended, the ED produced the 62-year-old Kapoor, former MD and CEO of the beleaguered Yes Bank, before the court here.

Also Read Special court sends Rana Kapoor to ED’s custody till March 20

When the judge asked if he had any complaints, Kapoor said he has been suffering from asthma for the last six-seven years, has low immunity, and he was in acute depression.

Advocate Abbad Ponda, his lawyer, said a person with low immunity is “easily susceptible” to catching coronavirus.

“The virus is spreading very fast....It is a very precarious situation. If he goes there (to the jail) he might catch something which is very very serious,” the lawyer said, requesting that Kapoor should be kept in a larger cell.

The court asked the jail authorities to take proper care and provide him medicines as per the advice of the medical officer.

As the ED did not want his further custody, judge Parashuram Jadhav sent Kapoor in judicial custody till April 2.

According to the ED, loans of ₹30,000 crore were given by Yes Bank when Kapoor was at its helm, and of these, advances of ₹20,000 crore became bad loans.

The central probe agency also claimed that over ₹202 crores of loans given to a joint venture company of the HDIL group were used to repay previous dues of the real estate company which has now become bankrupt.

The Reserve Bank of India earlier this month put the bank under moratorium, restricting withdrawals to ₹50,000 per account.

The ED has accused that Kapoor, his family members and others got benefits worth ₹4,300 crore through companies controlled by his family as kickbacks for sanctioning huge loans.

He is also accused of receiving bribes for going easy on loans given to a few big corporate groups that had turned into non-performing assets (NPAs).

Meanwhile, the Central Bureau of Investigation, which is also conducting a probe against Kapoor, has obtained a production warrant against Kapoor to produce him before CBI court and seek his custody, its lawyer said.

Last week, the CBI had registered a case against Kapoor and his wife Bindu for allegedly obtaining ₹307 crore bribe through the purchase of a bungalow in an upscale Delhi area from a realty firm at half the market price.

The agency suspects that the discounted transaction for the 1.2 acre-bungalow on Amrita Shergill Marg was a gratification to Kapoor through the company Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd in return for non-realisation of over ₹1,900 crore in loans from Yes Bank to Gautam Thapar-promoted Avantha Realty and group companies.

79,2020/03/20,"COVID-19 | Two more test positive in Ladakh, total cases 10","Officials said the condition of all the coronavirus patients in the Union Territory was stable.

Two more persons have tested positive for COVID-19 in Ladakh, taking the number of such patients in the Union Territory to 10, a senior government official said on Friday. Commissioner Secretary (Health) Rigzin Samphel said both the latest cases were from Choshot village of Leh, which was already notified as a containment area by the district administration.

“After the reports of the two patients came positive, they were immediately shifted to an isolation ward in a hospital here by health officials,” Mr. Samphel told reporters here.

He said the test reports of 55 more patients, including 11 taken on Friday, were sent to a laboratory in Delhi.

Officials said the condition of all the coronavirus patients in the Union Territory was stable.

Responding to a question on the government’s decision to shut a bank branch in Leh, Mr. Samphel said it was part of the preventive steps being taken to control the spread of coronavirus.

“A family member of a health department official (who had tested positive for coronavirus earlier) is working in a local branch of the State Bank of India. Though an earlier sample of the bank employee was found negative, we are sending his fresh sample for testing again as the latest cases are also from the same family,” he said.

Once the test report came, the bank will reopen, Mr. Samphel said.

Earlier, a total of eight patients, including an Army jawan, had tested positive for coronavirus in Ladakh, forcing the authorities to impose prohibitory orders under section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), banning the assembly of five or more persons.

All educational institutions, hotels, restaurants, bars, food courts and community kitchens were closed down in the region till March 31 while a notification against organising conferences, workshops, rallies, gatherings, sit-in-protests, labour gatherings at Balkhang Chowk, Skampari and Indoor-Stadium was issued, the officials said.

The authorities had also issued an advisory, restricting the entry of international tourists within the territorial jurisdiction of Leh district till April 30 and said if the need arose, similar steps might be initiated regarding domestic tourists as well.

Entry of labours from other states into Ladakh has also been banned till March 31.

As regards the concerns regarding non-availability of left-over food for stray dogs due to the closure of restaurants and food courts in both the districts, Samphel said the running campaign for stray dogs by the Animal Husbandry Department would be intensified and dog sanctuaries created.

Meanwhile, an official spokesperson said the Indian Air Force’s publicity programme and recruitment rally, which were planned in the Union Territory, were postponed till further orders.

“Fresh dates for the conduct of the Indian Air Force recruitment rally at Leh and the publicity campaign in the Ladakh region will be communicated as and when finalised and approved by the Central Airmen Selection Board (CASB), New Delhi,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bgsf2m/article31116547.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAPHILIPPINES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-two-more-test-positive-in-ladakh-total-cases-10/article31117793.ece

85,2020/03/20,"Coronavirus | AIIMS Bhubaneswar superintendent concealed son’s travel history, say resident doctors","They demand action against the official

The Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) of AIIMS Bhubaneswar on March 20 demanded action against the medical superintendent of the premier institute as he reportedly hid the travel history of his son, who tested positive for coronavirus.

In a representation to B. Geetanjali, Director of AIIMS-Bhubaneswar, the association said it was gross negligence on the part of the medical superintendent to conceal the travel history of his son who was admitted in the AIIMS isolation unit and kept in doctors room.

“One of the doctors didn’t disclose the details. He himself filled up the case sheet of the patient while hiding the relevant travel history. This patient tested positive on Thursday (March 19) and is the second case of COVID-19 in Odisha. On further enquiry, it was found that the patient was son of the medical superintendent himself and had returned from the U.K. three days back,” alleged the RDA.

Resident doctors pointed out that it was both medical and administrative negligence on the part of the medical superintendent that he did not reveal he was in direct contact, thus risking the spread of COVID-19.

“As we RDA members, along with the residents of concerned departments, had been in regular contact with the medical superintendent in the last few days, we feel betrayed by one of our own,” they said.

86,2020/03/20,Madhya Pradesh crisis | Kamal Nath resigns ahead of floor test; BJP set to form government,"With a strength of 104 MLAs in truncated House, saffron party has clear majority.

Ending 18 days of political drama, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Friday afternoon submitted his resignation to Governor Lalji Tandon, ahead of the Supreme Court-mandated floor test.

Mr. Nath said he would rather stick to his political values and principles of 40 years than compromise. “I will continue to stick to my values. This is my strength,” he told reporters at his official residence.

“I will continue to struggle along with each member of the Congress family in people’s interest.” Mr. Tandon accepted his resignation and asked Mr. Nath to continue as caretaker Chief Minister, Raj Bhavan sources said.

Earlier on Thursday night, M.P. Assembly Speaker N.P. Prajapati accepted the resignation of 16 rebel Congress MLAs, who have been in a resort in Bengaluru since March 9, sealing the fate of the embattled government. The Speaker had accepted resignation of six rebel MLAs on March 14.

The strength of the Congress in the 231-member House was down to 92. On Friday morning, BJP MLA Sharad Kol, who in the past had crossvoted with the Congress, also quit. With the resignations, the strength of the Assembly stands at 205, with the simple majority mark at 103. The BJP with 104 MLAs has a clear majority. Moments after the government fell, BJP leader Arvind Bhadoriya said independent MLAs as well those from the BSP and the SP had shifted their support to the saffron party.

In his resignation letter to Mr. Tandon, Mr. Nath wrote: “In the 40 years of my public life, I have always practised politics of principles and given precedence to democratic values. Whatever has happened in the past two weeks, it is a new chapter in the devaluation of democratic values.”

Mr. Nath offered his best wishes to the next Chief Minister and said his cooperation would be with him in the development of the State at all times. “I have never fallen for the politics of auction and transactions. I have done clean politics,” the Congress leader said.

Speaking to reporters later after Mr. Nath’s resignation, former Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan, who is the front runner for the top post again, said the Congress-led government had fallen under its own weight.

“The BJP has never been in the game of saving or toppling governments. The situation turned so explosive that Congress’s own friends got upset seeing the State’s downfall under Mr. Nath,” he added. Those around Mr. Nath, including Congress MP Digvijaya Singh, created such a situation that the government fell, Mr. Chouhan said, adding: “They must introspect.”

Other BJP leaders in the running for chief minister are party chief whip Narottam Mishra as well as Union Ministers Narendra Singh Tomar from Gwalior, and Thawar Chand Gehlot from Nagda, a prominent face for the party from the Scheduled Castes.

Taking to Twitter, former Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, whose switch to the BJP along with a bloc of 22 MLAs triggered the collapse of the 15-month Nath government, declared that the people of the State had won.

“I have always believed that politics should be a medium of public service, however the State government strayed from this path. Truth has won again,” he said.

""It is my resolve,"" Mr. Nath avowed, ""that whether we are in power or not, we'll continue working for the youth, the backward and farmers.""

Claiming that the BJP was worried that the State was moving ahead in a new direction, Mr. Nath said, “They feared our pro-people politics. And the State’s people are witness to their betrayal towards them. I worked day and night to transform the profile of the State, elevate it to an international pedestal.”

The BJP thought its conspiracy would succeed, he added, but it wouldn’t. “Our MLAs were whisked away to Bengaluru; who paid for it, who pressed them, everything will come out in the open soon. One needs to remember after today, there is tomorrow, and after tomorrow there is the day after. And the day after tomorrow will come. The public is witness.”

Listing his achievements during his tenure, Mr. Nath claimed the government had kept 400 poll promises in 15 months. ""We waived loans, gave electricity subsidy and land titles to adivasis and tried to arrest the spiralling unemployment rate among the youth. The BJP couldn't accept any of this.""

Mr. Nath further accused the BJP, which ruled the State for 15 years previously, for nurturing the mafia that he attempted to get rid of the State. ""Along with Maharaj (Jyotiraditya Scindia) and 22 others, they scripted this game to murder democratic values. They have been on it from Day 1. Throughout my term, my attempt was not to take the Congress to the palace, but bring the palace to it. ""

“The entire State has watched. The public is a witness,” he cautioned. “Luring our 22 MLAs and holding them hostage in bengaluru, crores of money being spent as lurements. Everyone has watched it, and people won’t forget those who betrayed them.”

On three occasions in the past, the Congress-led government had proved its majority in the past 15 months, he said. “The BJP couldn’t digest our welfare schemes. We were given the opportunity for five years to course correct the State, so that it is compared with bigger and not smaller States.”

In the evenning, Mr. Chauhan met Mr. Nath at the latter’s residence. It is not clear what was discussed.

The Congress once again reiterated its demand to close Parliament in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, questioning whether it was exempt from the laws it made.

The party raised the question when Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu read out the norms following the leave application of TMC Chief Whip Sukhendu Sekhar Ray, who sought leave for “self-quarantine” because of the growing number of COVID-19-affected persons. In his leave application, he quoted the government’s orders to avoid large gatherings.

This prompted deputy leader of Congress Anand Sharma to point out that Parliament was functioning as an exception to the government’s own decisions. “The government has invoked the Epidemic Act in Delhi and elsewhere in the country, is Parliament exempt from the laws that it makes?” he asked.

Flagging a Press Information Bureau notification that recommended that those above 65 should try not venture out of their houses, he told the Chairman, “I am above 65 years of age and so are you.” At this, Mr. Naidu immediately responded, “God Bless you and me, nothing will happen to us.”

What began after dusk on a cold December evening over seven years ago with Nirbhaya’s murder and gang-rape, ended with the execution of Vinay Sharma (26), Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25) and Akshay Singh (31), at Jail No. 3 of Tihar prison, at dawn on March 20.

People gathered outside the jail and began a countdown when one minute was left for the clock to strike 5.30 a.m. The moment the news of the execution was confirmed by Tihar authorities, people started clapping and thanked the judiciary and Delhi police for delivering justice to Nirbhaya.

“I was passing through the area when I got to know about the hanging. I stepped out of my car with my six-year-old daughter and explained why people are celebrating. I am happy that, finally, Nirbhaya got justice. The convicts should have been hanged much earlier but they made a mockery of our judicial system,” said Jagvir Singh, a local.

According to jail authorities, all preparations related to the hanging were done and the convicts were put under watch. On Thursday night, Mukesh and Vinay had dinner but Akshay and Pawan refused.

“They had a sleepless night and all of them kept asking the on-duty jail staff about any update from court regarding their execution. At 3.30 a.m., jail staff reached their respective wards to prepare them for the execution and asked them to bathe,” said the officer.

The officer added that all of them refused to bathe and even refused morning tea when it was offered to them. Then, they were taken for a final medical check-up.

As per procedure, prisoners of all categories were kept in lock-up until the execution was over and the bodies were removed from the prison.

Mukesh, Pawan and Akshay changed their clothes but Vinay refused to do so and fell on the ground seeking forgiveness. Vinay was sobbing and requested jail staff to leave him as he did not want to die, the officer said.

The convicts were taken to the gallows and the execution was done. They were hanged together and the bodies remain suspended for half an hour before being brought down, after which the resident medical officer declared them dead, said a senior officer.

The convicts had reportedly not expressed any “last wish” or will to authorities. Their belongings and money they earned during their stay in jail will be handed over to their respective family members, the officer added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/u0k1fz/article31115939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NIRBHAYA2003,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nirbhaya-case-convicts-did-not-express-any-last-wish/article31115944.ece

Denouncing the executions, the ICJ urged the Centre to abolish death penalty and introduce “systematic changes” to the legal framework to deter violence and improve access to justice for women.

Frederick Rawski, ICJ Asia-Pacific Director, said: “State-sanctioned executions are little more than public theatre that risk celebrating and perpetuating violence at the expense of the ‘rule of law.’ As heinous as these crimes were, the imposition of the death penalty — the deterrent effect of which has been widely debunked — does nothing to improve the lives of women.”

The family of incarcerated separatist JKLF chairman Yasin Malik alleged on Thursday that he was “not being getting a fair trial.”

“I met Malik in jail recently. It felt like our last meeting. His health condition has worsened,” said Malik’s sister, at a press conference in Srinagar.

Family sources said she and her mother met the JKLF leader in Tihar jail two days ago.

“If Malik is not being given a fair trial, he has decided to go on an indefinite hunger strike from April 1. He has already decided to withdraw his lawyer and fight his case on his own,” she said. “The [Srinagar attack] case has been reopened after 30 years to frame my brother,” she said.

Malik’s Pakistan-based wife Mushaal Hussein Mullick, in a tweet, said, “The hunger strike is against ill-intentions of the Indian government and against the attitude of the Jammu TADA court judge.”

Malik has also penned an open letter, which was shared by the family. “During my stay in jail in 1992, top intelligence officers and several civil society members, like Kuldeep Nayar, Rajmohan Gandhi, ex-Chief Justice Rajinder Sachar and Wajahat Habibullah visited me. They wanted me to give peace a chance. I was told that if I shunned the path of armed struggle and returned to peaceful non-violent struggle, we would be provided with a genuine political space and efforts would be made for the resolution of Kashmir dispute,” the letter reads.

Malik said he accepted the transformation “without surrendering his ideology” and declared a unilateral ceasefire in 1994. “It was an unpopular decision and I was declared a traitor by many. I miraculously escaped a bid on my life when I was kidnapped by some militants. Many of my colleagues lost their lives,” he claimed in the letter.

He said there was not a single evidence that could link him or his JKLF colleagues to any armed struggle, overtly or covertly, or to providing any kind of help to any armed group since the ceasefire. “All the governments from 1994 led by Prime Ministers like P.V. Narasimha Rao, H.D. Deve Gowda, I.K. Gujral, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh honoured the pledge made to us by the Indian government in 1994,” he said.

97,2020/03/20,COVID-19 fears rock Parliament,"MPs raise concerns over stranded Indians, call adjourning session

Parliament on Thursday reverberated with concerns over the spread of COVID-19, the large number of Indians, students and others stuck abroad, and also the racial profiling of those from the northeast as carriers of virus.

As soon as Question Hour concluded, leader of the Congress legislative party in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Choudhary expressed concerns over the handling of the Coronavirus, as well as the fate of many Indian students and others stuck abroad.

Call for PM’s statement

Trinamool Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Sudip Bandopadhyaya too demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi make a statement in the House on the efforts to combat coronavirus. Prime Minister Modi address the nation via a television broadcast at 8 p.m. on Thursday.

Shiv Sena's Vinayak Raut referred to the 58 Indian students struck at Singapore airport and urged the government to bring them home. He said out of the 58, 25 are women and they should not remain stranded there. “We have conveyed these concerns to Prime Minister Modi also, as he met with us this morning,” said Mr. Raut.

As matters under Rule 377 began, more and more members raised specific issues with regard to the pandemic. Raju Bista, BJP MP from Darjeeling said his constituency sees a large number of tourists but facilities for screening for the disease is not adequate. He raised the issue of racial profiling of people from the northeast.

“Lately we are seeing that people from the northest with different facial features are being singled out and racially profiled as carriers of coronavirus. I would like the government to give attention to this aspect of the issue as well,” he said.

Tackling rumours

MP from Mandya Sumalatha Ambareesh said while the virus was a big challenge, combating rumours circulating on social media was also a challenge. “This is the first pandemic in the age of social media and combating rumours is also important in the fight against the disease. I want to ask the government to set up a dedicated social media account just to bust fake rumours,” she said.

Margani Bharat Ram of the YSRCP also raised the issue of Indian students stuck in the Phillipines and said arrangements should be made to bring them back and put them in quarantine here.

In Rajya Sabha again Congress members demanded that the Parliament session be deferred.

Congress MP B.P. Bhattacharya during Zero Hour raised a concern about the large quantities of official papers that each member receives every day, asking whether these papers are sanitised. “We have requested the Prime Minister to adjourn the House but unfortunately it is not being done,” he said. The House, he said, should be adjourned without any further delay.

Sandeep Goel, Director-General of Tihar jail, confirmed to reporters outside the prison that the four convicts were hanged together at 5.30 a.m. A doctor has examined and declared all four dead, he said.

A five-member panel of DDU forensic department, under the supervision of Dr. B.N. Mishra will perform the postmortem at 8 a.m., said a Tihar Jail official.

Akshay's family reached the mortuary as of 9:50 p.m., over an hour after the bodies reached. Vinay's family reached the DDU Hospital an hour later. The families of the other two convicts too reached the premises shortly, and postmortem of the bodies of all four started. As per procedure, the postmortem is conducted only after the family members officially identify the body.

An official said that the convicts had not expressed any 'last wish' or will to authorities. Their belongings and money they earnt during their stay in jail will be handed over to their respective family members, the official added.

A last ditch hearing at 2.30 a.m on Friday before a Supreme Court Bench failed to stay their hanging. Earlier, the convicts had approached the Delhi High Court, too, on Thursday night, but to no avail.

The country was rocked by the brutal nature of Nirbhaya's gangrape and murder in December 2012, which led to a major reform in rape laws. Tens of thousands of students took to the streets, putting pressure on the then UPA government to act swiftly.

On the fateful night, the 23-year-old victim and her friend, after watching Life of Pi at a cinema hall in south Delhi’s Saket, had boarded a chartered bus from Munirka Bus Stand at 9 p.m. when the gangrape took place.

The victim was rushed to the Safdarjung Hospital, after being spotted by passers-by on National Highway 8 near Mahipalpur flyover. The girl was later airlifted to a hospital in Singapore, where she died after 13 days.

Arrest and conviction in record time

Within days of the incident, the police arrested all six convicts including the driver of the bus – Ram Singh and the lone juvenile assailant.

A fast track court began proceedings against the five adult accused on January 17, 2013. The same month, the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) ruled that sixth accused is a minor, who would be dealt with differently.

On March 11, 2013 Ram Singh, the bus driver, was found hanging in his cell in Tihar jail. The juvenile assailant was on August 31, convicted by the JJB for gangrape and murder and awarded three years term at a probation home.

In September 2013, nine months after the incident, the Delhi court convicts the remaining four men of 13 offences including gangrape, unnatural offence and murder of the woman and attempt to murder her male friend. It awarded death to all four convicts.

On March 13, 2014 the Delhi High Court upholds the death sentences awarded to the four convicts. Three years later, the Supreme Court on May 5, 2017 upheld the death penalty.

Changes in rape laws

The nationwide public outcry, following the incident, led to the passing of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act in 2013 which widened the definition of rape and made punishment more stringent.

The 2013 Act, which came into effect on April 2, 2013, increased jail terms in most sexual assault cases and also provided for the death penalty in rape cases that cause death of the victim or leave her in a vegetative state.

It also created new offences, such as use of criminal force on a woman with intent to disrobe, voyeurism and stalking.

The punishment for gang rape was increased to 20 years to life imprisonment from the earlier 10 years to life imprisonment.

String of death warrants

Having exhausted all their legal remedies, the four convicts went on pleading spree after the first death warrant was issued against them for January 22 at 7am inside Tihar Jail.

The second death warrant was issued by the Delhi court on January 17 for February 17, but it too got postponed as Vinay’s mercy plea was decided by the President then.

This led to an unprecedented event, in which the Delhi High Court sat for a hearing on a Sunday where Solicitor General Tushar Mehta argued that the four convicts were intentionally delaying the process of execution of death sentences.

On February 17 the Delhi court issued fresh death warrants for the execution of the four convicts on March 3, at 6 a.m.

Vinay Sharma, during this time, also moved the Election Commission of India questioning the timing of the rejection of his mercy plea. In the representation, he contended that the Code of Model Conduct for the Delhi elections was still in force when the Delhi Government made its recommendation to the President to reject his mercy plea.

Finally on March 5, the Delhi court issued the latest death warrants for the convicts to be executed on March 20 at 05:30 a.m. inside Tihar Jail.

Even a day before their execution, the convicts moved a Delhi court seeking stay of the executions on various grounds. They referred to numerous pending cases involving them including - second review mercy petition by Pawan.

They even pleaded that a divorce petition by Akshay's wife was pending before a Bihar court.

But the Delhi court rejected their plea remarking, “One who seeks protection of law first needs to learn to respect it. Therefore, I do not find any plausible reasons to suspend the execution of death sentence simply because convict Pawan has opted not to exercise his legal remedy”.

100,2020/03/20,Nirbhaya case convicts to be hanged at 5.30 a.m. as Supreme Court dismisses plea against rejection of mercy petition,"A three-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Justice R. Banumathi refused to consider the juvenility claim of Pawan Gupta

Barely three hours before the scheduled hanging, the Supreme Court in a pre-dawn hearing on Friday brought down the curtain on the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case by dismissing a plea of one of the four death row convicts against rejection of his second mercy plea by President Ram Nath Kovind.

A bench comprising Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan and A.S. Bopanna rejected the fervent plea of Pawan Gupta that his mercy plea had been wrongly rejected by the President without considering the fact that he was a minor at the time of offence in 2012.

“The consistent view of this court is that scope for review of President’s decision in mercy petitions is very limited,” the bench said.

“What are the grounds on which you are challenging rejection of mercy plea by President...You had relied on school certificate to claim juvenility and are using it again and again. You are asking us to review judgement, your juvenility claim has been rejected by lower court, Delhi High Court and us as well,” it said.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre and the Delhi Police, objected the juvenility plea of Pawan Gupta and said that this had been dealt earlier by all the courts.

The court also did not consider the plea of lawyer A.L. Singh, appearing for the death row convict Pawan Gupta, that his execution be deferred for one or two days so that he can record his statement in an assault case.

Singh alleged that the convict was assaulted in prison by policemen last year.

The bench asked the Centre to consider the fervent request of the lawyer for the convicts that the family members of Pawan Gupta and Akshay Singh be allowed to meet them for 5-10 minutes before hanging.

Mr. Mehta said that though this is painful, the jail manual does not permit convicts to meet family members just before the hanging.

On March 5, the trial court issued fresh warrants for hanging on March 20 at 5.30 am of all convicts in the case - Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Singh (31).

A 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was gang-raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012, in a moving bus in south Delhi by six people before she was thrown out on the road.

One of the six accused in the case, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide in Tihar Jail in 2013.

A juvenile, who was among the accused, was convicted by a juvenile justice board and was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.

Earlier, in a last-minute plea three of the convicts had moved the Delhi High Court on March 19 evening, challenging a trial court order declining to stay their execution. The High Court said there was no foundation in their plea. A Bench, headed by Justice Manmohan, heard the matter at 9 p.m.

103,2020/03/20,"Coronavirus | Will back government in fight against virus, says Congress","CPI(M), Trinamool criticise speech as short on specifics.

Moments after Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation on COCID-19 on Thursday, the Congress said it would support “every initiative of the government to fight coronavirus”.

The party also offered some specific suggestions, including getting ready for a complete lockdown if India faces community transmission.

Addressing a press conference, senior Congress leader Ajay Maken said: “We will fully back the government’s efforts...”

Health workers and other workers exposed to high risk areas such as airports, and quarantine centres should be provided with personal protective equipment (PPE) such as PPE kits, masks, sanitizers among others, the Congress leader said.

Mr. Maken also said the government should increase the number of containment or isolation centres, number of beds in intensive care units, respiratory devices among others.

While Mr. Modi talked of a Janata curfew, the Congress said the government should prepare in advance to deal with a situation such as a complete lockdown.

The Congress also urged the government to pay special attention to slum clusters with very heavy population density and little scope for social distancing.

Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, who has been demanding a partial lockdown, tweeted his support.

“In effect, the PM has asked the people to wage the war against COVID with moral armaments. We shall do so on Sunday and in the following days I have the feeling that the PM will come back in the next few days to announce tougher social and economic measures,” Mr. Chidamabaram said.

The CPI (M) and Trinamool, however, were critical of the Prime Minister's speech.

“It is unfortunate that the PM has not spelt out in his much advertised address, anything about the government’s preparation and actions taken to help people fight the pandemic,” CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said in a tweet.

However, CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the PM did not talk about the government’s preparations. “Apart from the symbolism that PM proposed, what is the govt doing to mitigate the crisis faced by the majority of India that cannot ‘work from home’ and survive on their daily earnings?” he asked.

Trinamool leader Derek O’Brien called Mr. Modi’s speech high on gimmicks.

“Parliament in session. Isn’t this ‘temple of democracy’ hallowed enough to address the nation from? Or a pre-recorded video message? CMs were watching on TV. Chronology? Announce today. Talk to CMs tomorrow. Cooperative federalism? High on gimmicks ? Low on solutions,” Mr O’ Brien said in a series of tweets.

Many shopping malls, cinemas and hotels have voluntarily closed down their activities. Srikakulam municipal authorities have forcibly closed Rythu Bazaar to prevent mass gathering in the market area.

All these factors led to curfew like situation in the district headquarters. Normally, the GT Road, Palakonda Road, Old Bus Stand Area are always jam-packed with brisk business activity. In normal course, the business will reach its peak ahead of Ugadi festival which will be celebrated on March 25 this year.

112,2020/03/20,New edible freshwater fish discovered in Andhra Pradesh,"It has been named after the Alluri forest of the Eastern Ghats in Visakhapatnam district, where it was found

Scientists have discovered a new species of freshwater fish from the Alluri forest of the Eastern Ghats in Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh. The species, small in size, has been named Parapsilorhynchus alluriensis, in recognition of the Alluri forest, where it was found. The specimens were collected from the Dharamattam waterfall, with details published in the peer reviewed journal Zootaxa earlier this month.

“The freshwater fish is small in size, measuring between 35 mm to 45mm. The colour of the species is dark grey, ventral surface uniformly cream white. Dorsal fin of the fish bears a yellowish tinge and a distinct oblique black bar near its free margin,” S. S. Jadhav, one of the scientists behind the discovery, said.

The specimens were collected by M. Karuthapandi from the waterfall in November 2018 and the fish was later described by Dr. Jadhav, who is associated with the Freshwater Biology Regional Centre (FBRC), Zoological Survey of India, Hyderabad.

Endemic to India

The discovery is interesting because the species belonging to genus Parapsilorhynchus is endemic to India, particularly peninsular India. Parapsilorhynchus alluriensis is the seventh species of genus Parapsilorhynchus,

Two other species of the genus P. odishaensis and P. swaini were discovered in 2017 from Odisha. This discovery makes for three species to have been found in the Eastern Ghats, and the first to be discovered in Andhra Pradesh.

Four other species of the genus (P. tentaculatus, P. discophorus, P. prateri and P. elongatus) were discovered from the Western Ghats, all in Maharashtra.

P. tentaculatus was discovered in 1921 by Thomas Nelson Annadale, the Scottish botanist and founder of ZSI.

‘Unique features’

According to scientists, many of the earlier discovered species are found in the local markets of Maharashtra, and are consumed by locals. Deepa Jaiswali, In-Charge of FRBC and among the scientists behind the discovery, said that like other species of the genus Parapsilorhynchus, the species Parapsilorhynchus alluriensis is also edible.

“The fish has unique morphological features that allow it to thrive well in clear hill streams with rapid currents,” she added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/2q62ge/article31114932.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20th-Palluriensis-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/new-edible-freshwater-fish-discovered-in-andhra-pradesh/article31114933.ece

118,2020/03/20,Bringing the house sparrows back home,"Sighting the once-ubiquitous bird is now a rarity in the city

The house sparrow was ubiquitous in the city till the 1970s. From around 1976, their population started to decline, and today, sighting a house sparrow is a rarity.

Birdwatchers and environmental activists cite many reasons for the disappearance of the common avian species that once was part of every household.

“A main reason is the change in the model of construction. From the earlier roofing system of using bricks and wooden beams or terracotta tiles, the construction moved towards the reinforced cement concrete (RCC) roofing model. This model prevents birds from building their nests. This has caused a large-scale migration,” said J.V. Ratnam, founder of Green Climate Team.

This apart, pollution and other factors such as electronic-magnetic radiation from mobile phone towers and large-scale urbanisation have reduced their population drastically. Rampant use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides is also another reason.

Mr. Ratnam was speaking at a function organised at the KDPM High School, Peda Waltair, by Paryavarana Margadarsi Vaisakhi and Green Climate Team, on the eve of World Sparrow Day.

Based on this year’s theme ‘I love sparrows’, a programme was organised at the school to create awareness on the protection of the endangered bird species.

“We have been creating awareness on sparrow protection by keeping food and water for these birds and also urging people to come forward to place bird nests made with clay pots, coconut shells and bamboo baskets at available places in the city,” said Mr. Ratnam.

PMV and Green Climate have so far organised awareness programmes at 280 locations, and people are now able to see the sparrows chirp.

Simple steps

“It has been over two decades since I last saw a sparrow or heard its chirping sound. Recently, we placed a clay pot on the terrace and put some hay in it. We also placed some food and water for the birds. Within a few days, a sparrow family built its nest and have now started inhabiting it,” said Amit Sharma, an environment enthusiast.

Tirumala Sri Devi, a teacher at KDPM School, said that one can celebrate Sparrow Day by keeping a bowl of water and grains for the sparrows to feed on and allow them to build their nests.

“Sparrows are farmer- and human-friendly birds. They help in pollination of plants and help farmers by eating insects harmful to plants. By bringing them back, we will help safeguard our children’s future with a green and healthy environment,” Ms. Sri Devi said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/5uq7gh/article31112245.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20-VZ-SPARROWDAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bringing-the-house-sparrows-back-home/article31112246.ece

As the threat posed by COVID-19 increased with each passing day, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy took stock of the situation in a high-level review meeting on Thursday.

He advised the officers and staff of all the departments concerned to conduct themselves in such a way that the public fear of a major outbreak of the virus was not aggravated.

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy asked whether the door-to-door survey had been done and what was the outcome of it, and whether the employees of the ward and village secretariats were involved in the exercise.

He ordered that the auxiliary nurse midwives and accredited social health activists be deployed to do mapping of their areas to facilitate effective containment measures and to give them access to a mobile application developed for the purpose.

Information related to 50 households as a unit should be updated at regular intervals, he instructed.

Following Education Minister Adimoolapu Suresh’s resolve to implement the State government’s order requiring the closure of all educational institutions till March 31 as part of the larger effort to combat COVID-19, the Andhra Pradesh School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission (APSERM) has appealed to all the institutions to follow the instructions in letter and spirit.

Addressing the media here on Thursday, the commission’s member V. Narayana Reddy said that the commission was empowered to initiate punitive action on erring institutions, recalling complaints of violation by some corporate schools and junior colleges in the State. “From a distant scare, the virus is becoming a reality that cannot be wished away. We know the lack of toilets and poor sanitary conditions prevailing in several schools and it is all the more important to keep them closed now in view of the pandemic,” he explained.

He said the panel would make random visits to private and State-run schools and junior colleges and DIETs across the State to ensure compliance and any violation observed would be taken seriously. “Only State-run welfare hostels and residential schools shall continue to function till the board and entrance examinations are completed and all other students in hostels shall be vacated immediately,” prof. Reddy said.

Fee fixation

He said that the commission had been vested with the responsibility of fixing the fee for schools and junior colleges and as such, any institution demanding fee in advance for the ensuing academic year would face action. He recalled the spate of surprise visits and inspections conducted on corporate schools and colleges in the last few months. The commission had sought a report from the institutions and would initiate action if satisfactory reply was not forthcoming, he said.

122,2020/03/20,"More screening, isolation facilities at tourist centres: Muttamsetti","Coronavirus testing machine to be installed at KGH virology lab

A coronavirus testing machine (RTPC) and other equipment, all worth ₹1 crore, will be installed at the virology lab of King George Hospital (KGH) here, Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao has said.

The Minister was addressing the media here on Thursday after conducting a review meeting with the MPs, MLAs, district officials and medical officers on the steps being taken to ensure that COVID-19 did not spread.

Mr. Srinivasa Rao said that a task force had been constituted at the State-level under the purview of the Chief Minister to oversee the implementation of the preventive measures.

Stating that not even a single COVID-19 positive case was detected in the city so far, the Minister commended the district administration and the health officials for putting in place the safety measures despite being busy with the election work.

At the meeting, it was suggested that the screening capacity should be increased further as the city was home to an international airport and two major sea ports.

Domestic passengers too were being screened for COVID-19 at the airport from Wednesday. More personnel were required to screen these passengers, it was felt.

The number of screening and isolation facilities would be increased at tourist places in the district, the Minister said.

Facilities would be set up for screening tourists visiting Araku and Borra Caves. An isolation room was already functioning at Paderu, and based on the need more would be opened at Araku and Borra.

MNCs and private industries at Atchutapuram would be urged to the install screening facilities, he said.

‘More masks needed’

The meeting also saw the need to make available more masks and other protective gear. The district Collector would place an indent for the same.

Police Commissioner R.K. Meena suggested provision of thermal scanners at private hospitals also. A help desk would be set up at the Collectorate.

The Minister appealed to the people not to panic, but advised them not to be complacent either. He also appealed to the people not to encourage meetings and functions.

District Collector V. Vinay Chand said home quarantine was being advised to persons returning from high-risk countries when they did not have any symptoms of the disease.

“It is being done according to a standard protocol and their movements will be under constant watch of government officials during the quarantine period, and there is no cause for worry,” the Collector added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/qw1je0/article31112148.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20VJPG4-MUTTAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/more-screening-isolation-facilities-at-tourist-centres-muttamsetti/article31112142.ece

CPI(M) district secretary Prabhakar Reddy accused the Kurnool Municipal Corporation of being negligent towards maintaining hygiene in the city. “Especially in times of coronavirus, it’s necessary to clean our surroundings,” he said.

Addressing reporters at the party office in the city on Thursday, the district secretary claimed that the pig menace had gone up in the city. “There used to be fewer pigs in the past. Now more people are rearing them and their population has shot up,” he said. He requested the corporation to immediately initiate necessary action in this regard.

“If the municipal corporation does not care about hygiene who would?” he asked and advised the corporation to hire more people in case there is a shortage of staff.

128,2020/03/20,"‘Modern cities, railways pushing up demand for lifts, escalators’","Company looking at new segments and ramping up exports

Johnson Lifts & Escalators, the Chennai based elevator and escalator maker, is betting big on modern cities, urban infrastructure programmes, etc., for growth. Despite a visible lull in the realty sector, the company perceives that numerous public infrastructure projects in the country have compensated for the reduced demand.

On the 56th year of establishment, Johnson Lifts is looking at new segments and ramping up exports, according to its country head, marketing, Albert Dhiaviyam. Speaking at a press conference here, he said: “We could see a substantial growth in demand for our products owing to the Central government initiatives such as urban infrastructure development projects, metro rails, regional airports and other mass rapid transit systems in India. With over 12% growth, we could surpass the industry growth figures which are at around 10%.”

The company general manager P. Chaitanya added that the metro rail and railways had ordered 828 escalators and 365 lifts in Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru. “The total value of the contracts is over ₹673 crore. The number will go up as many metro rail projects are yet to be announced by the government,” Mr. Chaitanya said.

The company, which produced over 10,000 lifts in the last fiscal, claims 22% market share. The turnover of Johnson Lifts is expected to be over ₹2,000 in the current fiscal.

The negative impact of demonetisation, GST, RERA and other related aspects was balanced by the new infrastructure developments in the country, according to him.

Based on the demand from the new segment, independent buildings and villas in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Kolkata and Delhi, the company had recently released lifts that run on single phase power connections. These lifts consume less power and can have huge application to the buildings which are up to three floors, according to the company.

This apart the company is also focussed on ramping up its export. “We are exporting lifts to the Middle East, South Asian and African countries. Right now, 2% of our products are exported. We plan to increase it as much as possible,” Mr. Albert said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sa7pav/article31111999.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20VJESCALATOR2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/modern-cities-railways-pushing-up-demand-for-lifts-escalators/article31112000.ece

130,2020/03/20,CID files chargesheet in two cases related to Mangaluru violence,"Protest against CAA had resulted in death of two last year

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has filed preliminary chargesheet in two cases registered in the city after a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act turned violent resulting in the death of two persons in police firing here on December 19 last year.

Deputy Superintendent of Police Balraj from the CID Special Enquiries Division filed the preliminary chargesheet before the 2nd Judicial Magistrate First Class court here on March 16. The CID has sought time to file the final chargesheet.

Police limits

The chargesheet was filed in the cases registered with the Mangaluru North and Mangaluru South police station limits respectively on December 19.

The case in Mangaluru North police station was registered on the basis of a compliant filed by Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Arunangshu Giri. In the complaint, Mr. Giri alleged that a group of about 2,000 persons violated prohibitory orders on December 19 and threw stones on police present at the Mangaluru North police station. The police lathicharged and then fired in the air resulting in the death of two persons.

The case was registered under Sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with deadly weapons), 188 (disobedience to an order promulgated by public servant), 353 (assault to deter a public servant),332 (volutarily causing hurt to deter a public servant), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons), 427 (mischief), 307 (attempt to murder), 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and under Section 2 (A) of the Karnataka Prevention of Destruction and Loss of Property Act 1981.

They were accused of throwing stones, glass bottles and other objects on policemen at the State Bank of India Circle, near the office of the Deputy Commissioner. The police arrested Mohammed Marwan in this connection.

These two cases were handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department’s Special Enquires Cell for further investigation.

131,2020/03/20,Dakshina Kannada-Kerala borders to be sealed from today,"It will be closed from 2 p.m. on March 21 to midnight of March 31

In a stern measure to contain the community spreading of COVID-19, the District Magistrate and Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner Sindhu B. Rupesh ordered that the road borders with Kerala will be sealed and closed for all kinds of traffic from 2 p.m. on March 21 to midnight of March 31.

No vehicles will be allowed to operate between Dakshina Kannada and Kasaragod district in Kerala, the Deputy Commissioner said in a late night order on Friday.

Ms. Rupesh said that in case of any emergency, vehicles will be allowed only through the Talapady checkpost on the National Highway 66, which is about 17 km away from Mangaluru city.

The Deputy Commissioner’s order came after the Kasaragod district reported six COVID-19 positive cases on Friday.

The order said that many vehicles operated between Kasaragod in Kerala and Mangaluru and hence, there is a need to take precautionary measure.

Pvt. buses to not ply tomorrow

Private bus operators in Dakshina Kannada will not operate their buses on March 22 to support the ‘Janata Curfew’ called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

132,2020/03/20,Govardhana Murthy sentenced to life for killing budding actor,"High Court also imposes a fine of ₹5 lakh on him in the 2008 murder case

Reversing the trial court’s verdict of acquitting realtor-turned-film producer B.M. Govardhana Murthy, the High Court of Karnataka on Friday found him guilty of murdering budding actor Vinod Kumar in 2008 and sentenced him to life imprisonment.

The court also imposed a fine of ₹5 lakh on Murthy and directed the State to pay ₹4.5 lakh of this sum as compensation to the mother of the victim.

A Division Bench comprising Justice S.N. Satyanarayana and Justice H.P Sandesh delivered the verdict while allowing an appeal filed by the prosecution questioning the trial court’s December 26, 2012 verdict. The Bench directed the Bengaluru rural district sessions court to secure the presence of Murthy for serving the sentence.

Murthy killed 32-year-old Vinod by using his licensed pistol during a party organised by the former at a farm on the outskirts of Bengalur on October 7, 2008.

The Bench held that there were eyewitnesses to the incident who had taken the victim to the hospital, and the injured actor had given a statement to the doctor before he breathed his last. And all the material available on record are enough to conclude that Murthy, using his licensed pistol, killed Vinod, the Bench said.

Though the complainant, Shankar Reddy, was not examined in the case, there were other witnesses who were consistent in their statements before the police as well as court during the trial, to establish that Murthy had killed the actor, the Bench observed.

Miscarriage of justice

The High Court observed that the trial court had failed to consider the materials in proper perspective and acquittal had resulted in miscarriage of justice.

Apart from convicting him for murder, the High Court also found him guilty of violating the licence conditions under Section 30 of the Arms Act for using his licensed pistol for taking the life a person, and sentenced him to simple imprisonment for six months.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/96hdql/article31122466.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGGOVARDHANMURTHY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/govardhana-murthy-sentenced-to-life-for-killing-budding-actor/article31122468.ece
133,2020/03/20,Hubballi-Ankola railway line gets clearance despite opposition,"Forest Minister skips meeting at which leaders from across parties favour project

Steamrolling opposition to the Hubballi-Ankola railway line, Chief Minister B.S. Yediurappa cleared the controversial project at the State Wildlife Board meeting convened in Bengaluru on Friday.

Intriguingly, the Board meeting was convened for the second time in less than two weeks after the project faced vehement opposition from some of its members in the March 9 meeting.

Politicians united

What is more, leaders from across the political spectrum, including Congress leader R.V. Deshpande and Minister Jagadish Shettar, attended the Friday’s meeting and argued in favour of the project.

Though the project entails felling and destruction of nearly 2 lakh fully grown trees and destruction of forest, Forest Minister B.S. Anand Singh was absent.

Also, some of the senior bureaucrats not connected with wildlife and environment were present, according to sources.

In the meeting held last week, Mr. Yediyurappa preferred to put off the subject without taking a call on it having sensed the opposition to it. But within 10 days, the board meeting was convened again and has now received official clearance despite opposition from a few members present.

Sources told The Hindu that the Chief Minister overruled various reports filed by environmental experts, including a comprehensive report filed by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) representatives that the project was inimical to environment and the perceived economic gains would be neutralised by the immense environmental devastation.

The Chief Minister and the officials supportive of the project depended heavily on a report submitted by a scientist from Indian Institute of Science. But even senior Forest Department officials have dismissed the mitigation measures suggested by the IISc. scientist as highly impractical and unrealistic.

Over to NBW

The issue and the State Board’s decision will now go before the National Board for Wildlife. The project entails felling nearly 2 lakh trees to lay a 164.44-km length railway line whose benefits too are questionable, according to environmentalists.

The alignment of the tracks is between Kali Tiger Reserve and Bedthi Conservation Reserve and more than 80% of the line cuts through Western Ghats. It requires diversion of 727 hectares of pristine forests for a line which could become redundant owing to depletion in mining activity.

According to an NTCA report on the project, the forests through which the railway line cuts, supports 29 species of mammals, 256 species of birds, 8 species of reptiles, and 50 species of butterflies. Majority of the mammals are in the IUCN red list and also protected under the Wildlife Conservation Act 1972.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vr4nr4/article31122448.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BgHubballiAnkolacol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hubballi-ankola-railway-line-gets-clearance-despite-opposition/article31122449.ece
134,2020/03/20,"Restrictions impact vendors, daily wagers in Kalaburagi","The city was shut down following the first COVID-19 fatality in the country

After India’s first fatality of COVID-19 — a 76-year-old man who was later code-named ‘P6’ — was reported from Kalaburagi, the northeastern city of Karnataka went into shutdown mode.

As part of the collective fight against the viral disease, Deputy Commissioner and District Magistrate B. Sharat, in his bid to prevent spread, not just put the entire State machinery on a war-footing to combat the disease, but went on to impose restrictions on religious, social, trade and commerce, educational, and cultural activities to minimise large gatherings.

Within a few after March 12, the day P6 tested positive for the diease after his death on March 10, the city had almost come to a standstill. All educational institutions, including schools, colleges, universities and tuition centres, were closed down. Restrictions were imposed on religious events like jatras and temple-car events. Sections of government offices that offered public services were closed. Except for those selling essential goods and services such as hospitals, pharmacy outlets, grocery shops, vegetable and fruit outlets, petrol pumps, and milk parlours, all other establishments such as the shopping malls, cinemas, multiplexes, roadside eateries, hotels, lodges, garages, APMC trading units, and units that were categorised as ‘non-essentials’ were forced to close down. On top of this, Section 144 was clamped to further beef up preventive measures. Police patrolling was intensified. As a result, the city wore a deserted look. Most people remained indoors. The vehicular movement got very thin.

The restrictions might have been very much necessary to combat the deadly disease. They might have had a little impact on the upper strata of society. However, they hit those living from hand to mouth, the daily wagers, street vendors, roadside eateries’ runners and alike, who survive on daily earning.

Saifan, 25-year-old roadside fruit vendor near China Market in Kalaburagi’s supermarket area, for instance, is finding it difficult to manage. His business is allowed to operate as it comes under ‘essential commodities’. But, there is a little business as people remain indoors. As a result, his profits have dropped from ₹500 a day to just ₹150. “I will not get even ₹150 on Sunday as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for people’s curfew. It’s difficult to manage my family. I don’t know how I will sustain if the restrictions continue for another month,” he said on Friday.

Sudhishna, a 26-year-old banana vendor who sells fruits in SBI colony, Old Jevargi Road, P&T Quarters, Santosh Colony, and New Jevargi Road areas in the city between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. before going to work as a maid in an educational institution, is finding it very difficult to procure the fruits. On regular days, she would invest around ₹300 every morning and take home around ₹150 profit by 10 a.m. Now, she turns up in the locality once in four days as the fruit supply to wholesale market is disrupted due to restrictions. She does not have a job most of the week as the has been closed.

Syed Naseer, a 25-year old man who used to sell undergarments, had to stop his business as the products were categorised as ‘non-essential commodities’. But, he cannot afford to sit at home as he is the sole breadwinner of his family. An idea of selling masks, which were in demand now, paved the way for him to continue his business in a new form. He and his friend immediately got cloth masks stitched, loaded them on their carts and sells them near Jagat Circle. “I used to do business up to ₹8,000, with a profit of up to ₹2,000 a day. Now, I make around ₹500 and get a profit of ₹150 by selling masks,” he told The Hindu.

Other street vendors whose businesses were categorised as ‘non-essential commodities’ were not seen on the streets.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fds062/article31122446.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGMASKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/restrictions-impact-vendors-daily-wagers-in-kalaburagi/article31122447.ece

137,2020/03/20,Owners of illegal buildings have to pay double the tax,"Bill also aims at levying fee and annual track rent on OFCs

The Legislative Assembly on Friday passed the Karnataka Municipal Corporations (Amendment) Bill, 2020, that allows for imposing double tax in the form of penalty on buildings constructed without permission or in violation of building bylaws.

The Bill is aimed at controlling unauthorised construction of buildings in the jurisdiction of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) by collecting tax and levying penalty equal to property tax on the owners of buildings constructed without permission.

Responding to questions raised by members, Law Minister J.C. Madhuswamy made it clear that the Bill was not aimed at regularising unauthorised construction of buildings, and levying penalty would not be a permanent feature, it would be until demolition or the corporation takes action. The Ministers also said it would increase revenue for the BBMP. The imposition of penalty existed in other city corporations, except in the BBMP, he said.

Rent on OFCs

The Bill also aims at levying fees and annual track rent on cables, including optical fibre cables (OFCs). Minister for Home Basavaraj Bommai said so far there was no clarity on fee fixation while installing OFCs. The law so far provisioned for levying fees or annual track rent. “Now, through this amendment, we have said levying fees and annual track rent, so that after laying fibres, rent should be paid every year for maintenance and other things.”

Dinesh Gundu Rao, H.K. Patil, and Priyank Kharge (all Congress), and Satish Reddy (BJP) welcomed the Bill. Mr. Kharge said the city has more than 75,000 km of OFC network and it was necessary to lay all OFCs underground.

Other Bills passed

The Karnataka State Universities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, was passed in the House. It is aimed at bifurcating Gulbarga University and establishing Raichur University. The new university will cover Raichur and Yadgir districts.

The Assembly also passed the Karnataka Municipalities and Certain Other Law (Amendment) Bill, 2020. It provides the option of NOTA (none of the above) to voters in the ballot papers and EVMs in elections to urban local bodies.

The Karnataka Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement) (Amendment) Bill, 2020, was also passed. It aims to extend the applicability of provisions of the Act to any other area falling within municipal corporation area or areas falling under the BDA or any other urban development authority constituted under the relevant law.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/owners-of-illegal-buildings-have-to-pay-double-the-tax/article31122154.ece
138,2020/03/20,Government has ‘open mind’ on appointment of 2011 KPSC candidates,"We will discuss the issue in Cabinet: CM

The State government on Friday informed the Legislative Assembly that it would keep an “open mind” on the appointment of 2011 batch of 362 candidates selected by the Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC) for the gazetted probationers (Group A and Group B) posts.

In a reply to the debate on the appointment of 362 candidates for gazetted posts, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said, “We will take a suitable decision after discussing a issue in the State Cabinet.”

Earlier, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C. Madhuswamy said the government was sympathetic towards candidates who have been selected for the posts. “We are considering various options on whether to promulgate an Ordinance or executive order or go before the court again to find a way out,” he said.

The erstwhile Siddaramaiah government, citing “corruption” and “malpractices” in the selection of candidates by the KPSC, had rejected the appointment of the probationers. The Karnataka State Administrative Tribunal (KSAT) had, however, rejected the State government’s order of annulling selection. Later, the High Court had set aside the KSAT order and found that the entire selection process of main examination was vitiated. This order was upheld by the apex court.

In the Assembly, Mr. Madhuswamy said there was no evidence to prove involvement of corruption by members of the KPSC or candidates selected for the posts. He pointed out that the CID, instead of submitting the report to the court, had submitted it to the government.

During the discussion, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah said, “The only way out is to Ordinance” to help the 362 candidates selected by the KPSC.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/government-has-open-mind-on-appointment-of-2011-kpsc-candidates/article31121036.ece

144,2020/03/20,Attack on Kannadigas in Goa: Yediyurappa to make statement on March 23,"Opposition takes exception to Ravi’s remarks

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa will make a statement on problems of Kannadigas in Goa on Monday after Opposition members trooped into the well of the Legislative Council on Friday urging the government to provide details on steps taken by the State, forcing an adjournment.

The Opposition, which has been urging the State government to send a delegation to understand the ground situation, demanded a statement by the Chief Minister after Kannada and Culture Minister C.T. Ravi’s statements did not satisfy them, and they also took exception to his statements. Finally, yielding to pressure, House Leader Srinivas Poojary announced that the Chief Minister would make a statement on Monday.

Last week, Janata Dal (Secular) leader Basavaraj S. Horatti had raised the problems that Kannadigas were facing in Goa where a ‘Pogo Andolon’ has been launched to allegedly drive away non-Goans. He had said that several thousands of Kannadigas were facing attacks and discrimination.

On Friday, Mr. Ravi said, “It is the responsibility of the Goa government to protect Kannadigas. Do not panic. Governments in Goa, Karnataka, and at the Centre are working in the national interest. We will not allow regional sentiments to go against the national interest.” He also said that he spoke to the Goa Chief Minister, who had informed him that the Pogo Andolan did not have any government or local people support.

However, Opposition leader S.R. Patil and Mr. Horatti said that if the government takes a delegation, it would instil confidence among Kannadgias. When Mr. Ravi cited the rescue missions sent to Iran, Iraq, and Syria by the Centre and said it would protect Kannadigas in Goa too, Mr. Patil said, “You are indulging in politics,” and all the members entered the well, forcing an adjournment. Later, when the House met again, amid demand for a statement by the Chief Minister, Mr. Poojary assured the House that he would make a statement on Monday.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/attack-on-kannadigas-in-goa-yediyurappa-to-make-statement-on-monday/article31120418.ece

Most Aadhaar seva kendras in Bengaluru have stopped providing services as they have to take biometrics of people for every service. On the other hand, appointments at passport seva kendras have been reduced by half effective Friday as a precautionary measure.

“We have reduced appointments by 50% effective today. Applicants themselves are also refraining as footfalls have reduced. There are also a lot of travel restrictions in place. As a result, we have halved the number of appointments in all seva kendras across the State. In Lalbagh, for example, instead of 1200 appointments, 600 will be given,” Regional Passport Officer, Bengaluru, Bharath Kumar Kuthati told The Hindu.

With the Ministry of External Affairs’ directive to reduce appointments coming in on Thursday evening, officials had to request applicants at the Lalbagh passport seva kendra on Friday to return home if they were suffering from symptoms or did not want the passport service as an emergency.

“We are also encouraging applicants to refrain. Normally, applicants are allowed to reschedule appointments up to three times. But as this is a special situation, we have lifted the cap,” Mr. Kuthati said, adding that these arrangements would continue until April 4.

At the seva kendras, applicants are being asked to sanitise their hands before entering the facility. Thermal screening is also expected to be deployed soon at the seva kendras.

COVID-19 precautions are announced at regular intervals and people are asked to maintain distance while waiting for their turn.

“The staff are also getting sanitised and common areas are also being frequently sanitised. At Koramangala, we have completely stopped receiving any applicants till March 31. The biometric equipment is also being sanitised after every applicant. We are taking all basic precautions and not leaving anything to chance,” the regional passport officer added.

A person who had returned from a foreign country and who refused to undergo medical check-up for COVID-19 at the Government Hospital in Kundapur on Thursday, is finally in home quarantine at his village in Udupi district.

This 32-year-old man was one among the 13 persons from Udupi district present in the Dubai-Mangaluru Air India Express flight on March 14 in which a person from Kasaragod district of Kerala had travelled and tested positive for COVID-19 on March 16. The 32-year-old man refused to have a medical check-up at the Isolation Ward at the Taluk Government Hospital in Kundapur.

This man said that he wanted to leave for Mangaluru despite entreaties from the hospital staff, and left the hospital premises. The hospital then informed the Police Department about the incident.

Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha said here that the district police later traced the man and he was produced before doctors and the doctors had examined him. The person had now been put under compulsory home quarantine. People need not panic about the incident, he said.

13 in home quarantine

Mr. Jagadeesha said that 13 persons from Udupi district were present in the Dubai-Mangaluru Air India Express flight on March 14.

Speaking to presspersons here, Mr. Jagadeesha said that all these 13 persons, though not having symptoms of COVID-19, were under home quarantine in Udupi district.

154,2020/03/20,COVID-19 | Stern action to be taken against those violating restrictions,"Tahsildars, EOs asked to oversee implementation

Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha said on Thursday that stern action would be taken against those found violating the restrictions announced by the district administration for checking the spread of COVID-19.

Addressing presspersons here, Mr. Jagadeesha said that the administration had already announced the restrictions under Section 144(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code throughout the district. He had directed the officers and the Police Department to take stern action against any violation of the restrictions.

Stricter restrictions were announced on March 18 because the administration had found the restrictions announced earlier were not being followed properly. Tahsildars and executive officers of taluk panchayats had been instructed to oversee the implementation of the restrictions. A monitoring committee under him was keeping a close vigil on the implementation of the restrictions, he said.

Already, there were a 10-bed isolation ward at the District Government Hospital, a five-bed isolation ward at the Kundapur and Karkala taluk government hospitals and a 20-bed isolation ward at Kasturba Hospital in Manipal for handling COVID-19 cases.

Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 should contact these telephone numbers: 9663957222 or 9663950222 or the health helpline 104 and the Health Department would send an ambulance to pick them up. They should not use any other mode of transport to reach the hospitals, he said.

There was adequate supply of laboratory equipment, masks and personal protection equipment with the District Surveillance Unit. Proper directions had been given to the Manipal Academy of Higher Education Student Affairs Committee with regard to COVID-19.

Since February 27, 237 persons had come to the district from foreign countries, and at present, 27 were under home quarantine. Necessary precautionary measures had been taken in the district as per the Epidemic Act, he said.

People should not unnecessarily visit the government departments at the District Offices Complex except for emergency work. They could telephone the departments concerned for their work and it would be carried out. This measure was being taken to avoid unnecessary crowding at the complex, he said.

To a query, Mr. Jagadeesha said that if any person under home quarantine was found moving outside, action would be taken against him. The administration had banned the performance of Yakshagana shows and holding of weekly markets in the district. Yet, if anyone was found violating the order, cases would be booked against them, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ogikc7/article31114898.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20MNUDUPICOVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-stern-action-to-be-taken-against-those-violating-restrictions/article31114899.ece
155,2020/03/20,Supreme Court dismisses pleas against post-based reservation in Karnataka,"‘Provisions can be challenged in independent proceedings’

The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a series of pleas to apply post-based reservation and creamy layer principle at entry level with regard to promotions to SC and ST employees in Karnataka.

A Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and D.Y. Chandrachud said the pleas challenged the State’s move to implement its Reservation Act of 2018 after the constitutional validity of the law was upheld by the apex court in May 2019. The 15-page judgment suggested that the applicants could challenge the provisions in “independent proceedings.”

“The present MAs [Miscellaneous applications] are, in effect, a substantive challenge to the actions of the State government in implementing the Reservation Act 2018 through the government order dated May 15, 2019 and the circular dated June 24, 2019. If the applicants are aggrieved by the steps which have been taken by the State government, it is open to them to pursue a substantive remedy for challenging the steps taken by the State in independent proceedings,” the apex court said.

The application sought a direction from the apex court to “re-work” all promotions on the basis of ‘post based reservations’. Secondly, they asked the court to direct Karnataka to apply ‘creamy layer’ principle. Thirdly, the applications had urged the court to ensure that the State implements its Reservation Act 2018 in compliance with the apex court decision in Nagaraj case, that is to extend reservation for SC/ST to promotions with certain conditions.

The court said the pleas were “not maintainable.”

The Bill envisages that students who have studied for 10 years at the State’s educational institutions will be eligible for 25% of the seats at the university.

Earlier, the Siddaramaiah-led government had introduced a Bill seeking 50% reservation for Karnataka students, but it was rejected by the Governor.

It said there are 19 national law school universities in India wherein horizontal reservation of seats has been provided. Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C.

157,2020/03/20,MLAs urged to speak up on Centre’s treatment of Karnataka,"Predicting “dark days” ahead for Karnataka in terms of finances, Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah on Wednesday appealed to all MLAs to raise their voice against Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for not accepting the 15th Finance Commission’s recommendation to provide a special grant of ₹5,495 crore to the State.

Participating in a debate on State Budget in the Legislative Assembly, Mr. Siddaramaiah said the Finance Commission had come out with the recommendation as Karnataka had lost out a lot in the devolution of Central funds. But the Finance Minister had, on January 30, written to the chairman of the commission asking him to reconsider the recommendation.

“Should we tolerate this and keep quiet?” he asked. “It is an injustice to Karnataka. Take up the demand for accepting the Finance Commission’s recommendations with the Union Finance Minister.”

Expressing concern over Karnataka losing out on over ₹11,000 crore of Central funds, including compensation towards GST losses, the Congress leader cautioned that if this was tough, darker days were ahead for the State. The system of compensating losses on account of GST ends in 2022. Also, the projections of the Finance Commission indicate that there will be a reduction in the annual devolution of funds to the State in the coming years, he said.

“This will mean that the State will have to face a revenue deficit of about ₹30,000 crore in 2022-23 and ₹46,000 crore in 2023-24,” he said. He said this would put the State in a precarious position, leaving it with no funds to take up development schemes as the available resources would go into meeting the “committed expenditure” such as salaries, pensions and grants to local bodies.

He blamed such a scenario on the reduction in collection of Central taxes to the extent of ₹2.26 lakh crore, which he argued was because of the impact of demonetisation and the GST regime.

Seeking to debunk the claims of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa that he had given emphasis to the agricultural sector in his Budget, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that, in reality, there was a reduction of 24% in terms of fund allocation to the sector.

Similarly, there was a reduction in allocation to various social and economic services sectors, he said. He also alleged that funds had been reduced particularly for welfare schemes meant for SCs, STs, OBCs and minorities.

Will look to borrow from World Bank: CM

Seeking to allay fears that development schemes may not get adequate funding due to the State’s precarious financial position, Mr. Yediyurappa on said Karnataka would try to raise loans from the World Bank to fund ongoing irrigation work and other schemes.

“We will try to get World Bank loan... Already we have held consultations with the NABARD authorities,” he told the Legislative Assembly. “It is my commitment to the State that none of the major development works will be affected.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mlas-urged-to-speak-up-on-centres-treatment-of-karnataka/article31112613.ece
158,2020/03/20,‘Why is there no COVID-19 testing facility in north Karnataka?,"The State government on Thursday came under attack for not setting up testing facilities for COVID-19 in north Karnataka, even though the region has already reported a death and two others have tested positive.

“Is north Karnataka part of Karnataka or not? All testing centres are around Bengaluru and Mysuru in south Karnataka. The first death happened in Kalaburagi,” Leader of the Opposition S.R. Patil said in the Legislative Council.

Furthermore, he said that people were also transiting through airports in Belagavi, Hubballi, Bidar and Kalaburagi, and thus the region required testing centres. “The people of north Karnataka are living in fear and you are not bothered about the region,” he said. Janata Dal (S) member K.T. Srikante Gowda added that several districts in the State border Maharashtra, which has so far registered the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the country. He said the daily interaction between the people of the two States at the border increases the risk of transmission of virus.

Currently, according to Health Minister B. Sriramulu, two labs are in Bengaluru, and one each in Mysuru, Hassan and Shivamogga. “Steps are being taken to establish another lab in Kalaburagi,” he said.

Responding to the Opposition attack, Deputy Chief Minister and IT/BT Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan said there has been no discrimination between south and north Karnataka. He said that higher bio-safety levels are required for virus extraction and disposal, and the government had made provisions in the Budget for setting up such molecular labs in all district hospitals.

159,2020/03/20,"Probe two-fold rise in laptop price, says Siddaramaiah","Members of the Opposition Congress on Thursday demanded that the government order an inquiry into why the prices of laptops given to degree students at government colleges had doubled from ₹14,290 in the previous year to ₹28,320 now.

Participating in a debate on the State Budget in the Legislative Assembly, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah termed the doubling of prices a “scam”. He argued that only a thorough probe could bring out the truth of the matter. A total of 1,916 laptops have been purchased by paying a higher price of ₹13,380 per laptop, and this will cost the State exchequer an additional ₹145 crore.

Mr. Siddaramaiah demanded a probe by a competent authority into the matter. JD(S) leader Bandeppa Kashempur too supported the Congress demand.

In response, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said the laptop prices had been fixed by the State Cabinet headed by H.D. Kumaraswamy of the previous JD(S)-Congress coalition government on June 6, 2019, and the BJP government was only carrying out the task of distributing them.

Congress member and former Speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar intervened, saying that there should be a probe irrespective of which government procured the laptops. “The entire House, including yourself, will be guilty if an inquiry is not ordered,” he told the Chief Minister.

Mr. Siddaramaiah explained that the Congress had, through RTI, sought details of the laptop purchase, but the authorities concerned had evaded giving a direct reply to the query on why the prices went up.

Generally, the prices of electronic goods such as laptops come down in the competitive electronics market. The same company had delivered laptops at ₹14,290 the previous year, the Congress leader said.

In the wake of the cut in Union government grants and funds to the State, the government should be economical in its expenditure and should crack down corruption, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/probe-two-fold-rise-in-laptop-price-says-siddaramaiah/article31112594.ece

But the crew refused to do so, the leader said, urging the government to take stern action against the crew.

161,2020/03/20,Karnataka government considering supplying midday meals at home,"With schools being closed early this year to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the Department of Primary and Secondary Education is contemplating delivering midday meals to students at their homes. S. Suresh Kumar, Primary and Secondary Education Minister, said on Thursday that they were “envisaging the process”.

Sources in the department said a decision would be made in a day or two. “We are deliberating between giving groceries to the students or serving cooked meals at their homes,” a senior official said.

The demand came from several students’ organisations, who pointed out that students from many low-income households depend on these meals. They also pointed out that according to the National Family Health (NFHS) survey 4 data for Karnataka (2015-16), 36.2% of the children below the age of five were stunted, while 26.1% were wasted. The survey also reveals that 10.5% of the children were severely wasted, while 35.2% were underweight.

The department decided to close schools in a phased manner earlier this month. Even while the summer vacation is in progress, students in the past years, particularly in flood- and drought-hit areas, have been coming to school to get their midday meals. In Karnataka, 53.47 lakh students in government and aided schools consume midday meals. According to the norms by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, the midday meal should have at least 450 calories and 12 grams of protein for students from classes 1 to 5, while students from classes 6 to 10 should get 700 calories and 20 gm of protein.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-government-considering-supplying-midday-meals-at-home/article31112545.ece

164,2020/03/20,Kerala govt. to facilitate rapid movement of freight,"Neighbouring States step up screening at border check-posts following COVID-19 scare

Kerala on Friday moved to facilitate the rapid movement of freight, including perishables, from neighbouring States without loosening internal border disease surveillance against the backdrop of the strict vigil across the border following the COVID-19 threat.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in a videoconferencing, urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to enforce free movement of essential commodities such as food, fuel and medicine across the State borders.

On Friday, Tamil Nadu officials started screening all passengers entering the State from Palakkad. Long queues of vehicles were witnessed at the border as health officials went about screening the passengers.

There were uncertainties on Friday afternoon as news spread that Tamil Nadu closed the borders with Kerala. However, Palakkad District Collector D. Balamurali, after contacting his counterpart in Coimbatore, said the borders would not be closed.

He said people should restrict their movements in view of the COVID-19 scare.

In Kasaragod

To curb the spread of coronavirus, the Kasaragod administration decided to close 12 roads bordering Karnataka, while implementing stringent precautionary measures on five other border roads from Friday. The decision was taken by Collector D. Sajith Babu at a review meeting here.

In Wayanad

The Wayanad administration on Friday closed the check-posts at Bavali and Tholpetty on the Kerala-Karnataka border for all travellers, except emergency and long-distance travellers.

Moreover, Wayanad Collector Adeela Abdulla directed the public to avoid travel through Kodagu district.

Meanwhile, the Nilgiris Collector informed Ms. Abdulla that only emergency travel would be allowed across the districts from Saturday.

Ms. Abdulla said she had asked her counterpart in Chamarajanagar district in Karnataka to ease restrictions in public transport through the Muthanga check-post till March 22.

As many as 10 check-posts, five check-posts each on the Kerala-Karnataka and Kerala-Tamil Nadu borders, are functioning in the border areas.

In Idukki

The Collector of Theni and the Superintendent of Police visited the check-posts bordering Idukki and asked officials to only allow emergency travel across the districts. Idukki Collector H. Dinesan said the restrictions were in force for the past two days and it was being strictly enforced from Friday.

The border was not being closed but strict curbs were being imposed on vehicle traffic, he said.

Idukki administration also imposed curbs on travel from across the border, the Collector added.

In Kollam

Tamil Nadu has intensified screenings at the Aryankavu check-post, discouraging the entry of private vehicles.

Though surveillance measures were already in place, the authorities strengthened monitoring in the past two days and on Friday morning Kerala-registered vehicles were stopped at Puliyarai on the Tenkasi-Kollam border.

At a Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) worksite in Kallikkad grama panchayat here, the day starts with the local conveners reading out the day’s important news to the workers, especially the updates on COVID-19 and the latest government directives.

Before that, the workers line up to clean their hands with soap, and later sanitiser, for 20 seconds each.

Distance of 1.5 m

“Soon after the virus outbreak, health workers, including the staff from the local Primary Health Centre and health inspectors, had given us training on the measures to be followed at the worksite. Five times during the day, they are asked to clean their hands thoroughly. During work, they are asked to maintain a distance of 1.5 metres at least,” says Sujaya Paul, overseer at the panchayat. With around five lakh workers engaged in various works as part of the MGNREGS in the State, the worksites often witness the coming together of a considerable number of workers.

“The Break the Chain campaign [of the State government to promote personal hygiene] is being strictly implemented at all MGNREGS worksites. Every worksite has a mate who ensures that the workers wash their hands frequently and use masks and gloves. Every evening, photographs from the worksite are sent to the district heads, and from there to the State office,” says L.P.Chither, Additional Mission Director, MGNREGS State Mission.

With all houseboats, shikaras and canoes operating out of Ashtamudi Lake lying idle for nearly a fortnight, those working in the sector are bracing for bleaker times.

The blow came when they were all prepared for the forthcoming tourist season. There was a sudden dip due to the global pandemic and tourist traffic tickled down further and by the second week of March various restrictions were in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

While houseboat owners are worried about the accumulation of debt due to the non-payment of loans, those who operate small country boats and canoes say they will be reduced to penury.

“We have lost our only source of income and currently it’s impossible to find an alternative due to the temporary shutdown of other businesses. But what scares us most is the uncertain future as nobody seems to have any idea about when everything will be back to normal,” says Babu, who has been offering canoe rides for the last 11 years.

Big houseboats employ an assorted crew who includes a srank, an engine operator and a chef while small ones are mostly operated by one or two persons. The district has around 150 boats coming in different segments and the season going dry has affected hundreds of families depending on their income.

“We get maximum group packages during summer months and we had several bookings for April-May, which is also the peak season for domestic travellers. They were all cancelled and there is no point awaiting bookings since we can’t predict when we will be able to contain the pandemic. We know it has affected all sectors, but we are the worst-hit group. This was totally unexpected and the outbreak has left us in dire straits,” says Rajeev, who operates two house boats.

Munore Thuruthu, a destination known for its idyllic waterways, has the maximum number of canoes operating in and around the island. With all tourist-related trades bearing the brunt, the islanders are staring at mass unemployment.

Dependent families

“Here we have around 100 canoe operators and some eight shikaras that employ two staff each. Several families are dependent on them and currently they all are struggling. They cannot go to the city in search of jobs now and if the situation continues like this we will have to face a huge crisis,” says Munroe Thuruthu grama panchayat president Binu Karunakaran.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tbrsig/article31122247.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv21houseboatss,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/houseboat-sector-in-dire-straits/article31122242.ece
170,2020/03/20,Family courts told to consider cases of custody of children,"All other matters to be adjourned to dates after March 31

The Kerala High Court has instructed family courts in the State to consider matters related to interim custody of children and maintenance as matters of “extreme urgency” during the COVID-19 preparedness period.

Barring the cases related to children, all other matters considered by the family courts will be adjourned to dates after March 31.

The Hindu had on Friday reported the plight of parents who were engaged in legal battles over custody and visitation rights of their children in family courts after the courts postponed such cases.

Many parents were in deep despair after family courts across the State postponed such cases to dates after March 31 in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak.

An order prioritising the maintenance and interim custody of children was issued by K. Haripal, Registrar General of the Kerala High Court, on Friday.

Visitation rights

Incidentally, it is during the summer vacation, which starts in March, and during Christmas vacation that the most number of applications seeking visitation and guardian rights of children are moved by parents.

In most of the cases related to visitation rights, the parents are forced to spend the allotted hours of visitation with their kids in court complexes. As the courts cut down their activities in the wake of the pandemic, such avenues were denied to parents and children.

The Registrar General has also instructed the civil courts to postpone the trial of all cases and execution petitions to dates after March 31 and to take up only urgent applications such as injunction matters.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/family-courts-told-to-consider-cases-of-custody-of-children/article31122140.ece
171,2020/03/20,Rural police crack down on those violating COVID-19 protocol,"Cases registered against those not following norms

The Ernakulam Rural police have begun cracking down on those who have not reported to the Health Department or other government agencies on their return from abroad as mandated by the protocol set in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19. One case each was reported in this regard from Aluva and Perumbavoor.

In the case registered in Aluva, the offender was found to have returned from the U.K. on March 9. As per the prevailing protocol, he should have remained in quarantine for a minimum of 14 days, but was found working at least on three days on March 17, 18 and 19.

After being informed about this, the Aluva police stepped in and registered a case under Section 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Kerala Police Act. The charge entails imprisonment, which may extend to two years, or fine, or with both.

In Perumbavoor, the person was found to have returned from Saudi Arabia on March 9 and had not bothered to report to the Health Department.

The police have asked the public to pass on information about such people who were moving around in violation of the protocol with the police station concerned or the Aluva control room (94979-80500, 0484-2620172). Those placed in quarantine may also contact these numbers for any assistance, from food supply to medical help.

172,2020/03/20,Thermal scanners at 11 metro stations,"Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) has joined the league of Southern Railway by introducing thermal scanning devices at 11 major stations in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak across the globe. Policemen attached to the Kochi Metro Special Police (KMSP) will manually check passengers before allowing them into the platform. The device that checks the body temperature of every commuter will be introduced at other stations shortly, said a press release.

Medical aid

Any passenger found ill or showing COVID-19 symptoms will be advised to seek medical aid. The metro authorities have also initiated steps to ensure that passengers are not seated very close to each other. Instructions in this regard will be given in trains as well as on LED screens at stations.

“Passenger safety is the prime concern for us. We have to ensure that they avoid unnecessary social contact,” said KMRL managing director Alkesh Kumar Sharma.

As part of the Break the Chain campaign, the metro agency has also set up health kiosks at stations. Volunteers will urge passengers to wash their hands and use sanitiser before travel. Besides, KMRL has intensified cleaning of stations, sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/thermal-scanners-at-11-metro-stations/article31122124.ece
173,2020/03/20,COVID-19 hits transport hard,"Railways, metro, private bus operators and cab companies scale down services

Stakeholders in the public transport sector are staring at an unprecedented crisis following the steep fall in the number of commuters due to fear of venturing outdoors, curbs on social gatherings, and companies promoting work from home in the wake of COVID-19 scare.

Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) has considerably scaled down operations, with the frequency of train services being reduced from a train every six minutes to one every seven minutes during peak hours and every 10 minutes during off-peak hours. “However, a few commuters have shifted to metro as a safe, convenient and reliable service consequent to the fall in bus services and other modes of commute. Apart from thermal screening of passengers, hand sanitisers have been kept at metro stations. Also, coaches are disinfected three times every day,” said a KMRL spokesman.

Close on the heels of the cancellation of over a dozen train services following the steep fall in patronage, the Thiruvananthapuram Division of the Southern Railway is likely to further curtail services, it is learnt. “This will be done only on the basis of ground-level feedback. Moreover, commuters are showing a marked preference for non-airconditioned coaches, despite curtains being removed from AC coaches and stepping up of disinfecting measures,” railway sources said.

The cancelled services are being operated to Guwahati to cater to the rush of migrant labourers returning to their home States.

Bus commuters too are thinning down, following which trips have been reduced.

“The fall in the number of passengers has been attributed to textile showrooms and other establishments providing accommodation to their workforce,” said Nisar Karukapadath, managing partner of My Metro private bus company.

“Aimed at minimising health risks, bus crew members have been directed to make optimal use of card swipe machines. It will bring down reliance on currency. Our company has kept hand sanitisers at Vyttila and other bus stations. Moreover, masks have been provided to bus crew members,” he added.

Online cabs

Online cab services have been hit to the tune of 75% in cities across Kerala, said Shajo Jose, secretary, Online Taxi Drivers’ Association. There is low demand, while most drivers are cancelling trips to hospitals. Many others have returned to their home districts since they will have to operate up to 20 trips a day.

The fall in income will ultimately affect repayment of vehicle loans. We will take up with the government our demand to extend loan repayment moratorium to all banks, he said.

In order to regain commuters’ confidence, the association has tied up with shops for provision of interior washing and vacuuming at a discounted rate of ₹200.

“We have recorded approximately 50% fall in bookings,” said sources in Ola Cabs.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-hits-transport-hard/article31122115.ece

The confirmation of a dozen new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, after a brief lull, has again set the alarm bells ringing in Kerala.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, briefing media, spoke of tightened regulations to keep people more at home. He announced a virtual lockdown of Kasaragod district after it emerged that the violation of home quarantine norms by a Non-Resident Indian, who has since turned positive for COVID-19, could have passed on the infection to the entire community.

Of the 12 new confirmed cases, six were in Kasaragod, five in Ernakulam and one in Palakkad district. The number of patients in the State at present is 37. This is in addition to the three Wuhan-based cases reported in the first wave of infection.

They have all been moved to the isolation ward at Government Medical College Hospital, Ernakulam.

The Palakkad case is a person who has come from the U.K. He has also been admitted at the Ernakulam MCH.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to channel National Disaster Relief Funds (NDRF) to people under home isolation.

In a video conferencing with Mr. Modi and Chief Ministers of other States against the backdrop of the COVID-19 outbreak on Friday, Mr. Vijayan requested the Centre to announce income support schemes for the aged, the poor and those working in the unorganised sector to help them tide over the current crisis caused by the pandemic.

The Centre should increase the number of days of employment under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme from 100 to 150. He requested Mr. Modi to allow Kerala to front-load the State’s market borrowing for April 2020.

He hoped the Centre would disburse during April-May 2020 at least 40 per cent of the revenue deficit grants recommended by the 15th Finance Commission. The Centre should allow Kerala to raise its borrowing rate to at least 4 per cent of the GSDP for 2020-21.

The free movement of essential commodities such as food, fuel and medicine across State borders should be enforced. The Centre should direct banks to double their micro-credit allocation at reduced interest rates.

The Chief Minister sought a special package for the hospitality sector and export industries, including an extended moratorium period on loans and interest waiver.

178,2020/03/20,Man held on cheating charge,"He has deceived many investors over ₹100 crore

The Central police on Thursday arrested a person on charges of cheating over ₹100 crore, including the lifetime pension benefits of numerous investors retired from public sector units.

The arrested was identified as Unnikrishnan, 56, of Adoor in Pathanamthitta. He was accused of having duped several investors by setting up a company by the name Kerala Housing Finance Corporation, which was similar to the name of a government-run institution.

Attractive interest

The firm had 29 branches across Kerala and Tamil Nadu with the major attraction being fixed deposits at an attractive interest rate of 14%. Among those who lured into the dubious firm were largely retirees from public sector units.

The accused sold them a seemingly tantalising offer of an assured monthly return akin to salary against the investment of their retirement benefits. Among the victims lured by this offer included those retired from public sector institutions such as Hindustan Newsprint, Cochin Shipyard, Kochi Refineries, etc.

In the initial months he paid the returns as promised thus gaining the trust of the investors who then encouraged their acquaintances also to invest in the firm.

However, all the branches were closed down and the accused went into hiding one-and-a-half years ago.

Following this, a special investigation squad was formed comprising of K. Laljy, Assistant Commissioner, and Central Station House Officer S. Vijayasankar.

Tip-off

The squad received a tip-off with the aid of the cyber cell that the accused was in a rented apartment in Kolani, near Thodupuzha.

He was taken into custody by the police.

According to police, the accused had bought several plots and luxury buses using the money he duped from the investors.

The accused had 17 cases registered against him in Central station, one case each in North and Hill Palace station, 12 cases in Alappuzha, and two each in Cherthala and Thiruvananthapuram.

Central police had already arrested Krishnan Nair, general manager of the company, and Gopalakrishnan, manager of Ernakulam branch. Police are expecting more complaints to emerge with the arrest of the accused.

A team led by sub-inspectors K.X. Thomas and Kiran C. Nair made the arrest.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/man-held-on-cheating-charge/article31120990.ece
179,2020/03/20,TDB told not to permit pilgrims to Sabarimala,"Tantri, Melsanthi support govt. stand, TDB decision today

The government has directed the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), Pathanamthitta District Collector and District Police Chief (DPC) not to permit pilgrims to Sabarimala Ayyappa Temple during the annual festival that begins on March 29 due to COVID-19 threat, Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran has said.

The temple will open on March 28 afternoon for the 10-day festival that begins with the customary Kodiyettu on March 29. The festival will come to a close on April 7 with the arat.

The Minister said a total of nine persons had been tested positive for the virus in the district. As many as 235 primary contacts and 501 secondary contacts of the infected persons had been home quarantined, he said.

Mr. Surendran said the government launched a series of disease prevention measures following the second spell of COVID-19 in the State with Ranni in Pathanamthitta as its epicentre.

The District Medical Officer in Pathanamthitta reported to the District Collector on the serious implications of permitting pilgrims coming from different parts of the country.

The Collector submitted a report to the government recommending denial of permission to the pilgrims to Sabarimala, he said. The Minister said the government directive to the TDB was on the basis of the report submitted by the Collector.

TDB stand

Meanwhile, TDB president N. Vasu told The Hindu that the board would take appropriate decision on the matter at its meeting to be held in Thiruvananthapuram on Saturday.

Meanwhile, the Tantri (chief priest) said the directives issued by the Union and State governments were applicable to Sabarimala pilgrims too and hence they should avoid journey for the time being in the larger interests of society.

The Tantri further called upon the devotees to display their devotion by not visiting the temple.

Melsanthi clarifies

The Melsanthi (head priest) said that rituals such as Utsavabali and Sreebhoothabali would have to be conducted. He said that devotees should keep themselves away from Sabarimala. Those who have already booked certain offerings (puja) need not worry as it would be performed as decided, Mr. Namboodiri said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tdb-told-not-to-permit-pilgrims-to-sabarimala/article31120745.ece
180,2020/03/20,Kannur deputy mayor ousted in no-trust vote,"LDF likely to move no-trust motion against Mayor

The Left Democratic Front (LDF) has successfully moved a no-confidence motion against deputy mayor P. K. Ragesh with support of an Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) member who defected to the LDF at a council meeting of the Kannur Corporation on Friday.

The United Democratic Front administrating the 55-member council has 28 councillors, including Mr. Ragesh, who is an Independent, while the LDF has 27 members.

Help of League member

But the no-confidence motion was passed in favour of the LDF with a majority of 28-27 following the support of IUML member K.P.A. Saleem, who decided to go against the UDF. The vote turned out to be a huge jolt for Mr. Ragesh and the UDF.

Leader of the Opposition in the council K. Balakrishnan moved the no-confidence motion in the presence of District Collector T.V. Subhash.

Mr. Ragesh was deputy mayor both during the period of the LDF and UDF rule of the Kannur Corporation.

With both the UDF and the LDF tied with 27 members in the council, the vote of Mr. Ragesh became crucial for the LDF to rule the Corporation for the first time in 2015. He was made the Deputy Mayor.

However, soon after the Lok Sabha election, he switched sides and went ahead to support the UDF and toppled the LDF from the power.

Later, interacting with media, Mr. Saleem said he decided to vote in favour of the motion in protest against the arrogance and opportunistic attitude of Mr. Ragesh. To a question whether he evaded the whip of the UDF to boycott the voting, he said he got no such message.

He denied getting any offers from the LDF for the post of deputy mayor. The UDF councillors said they would take legal action against him for disobeying the whip of the UDF

Mr. Saleem had distanced himself from the UDF for the past two months and he had switched off his mobile phone for the past two days. However, he appeared along with the CPI(M) leaders just before the no-confidence motion was moved. LDF sources said they were planning to move a no-confidence motion against Mayor Suma Balakrishnan as well.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bsa9pj/article31123111.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TVKR-MANNUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/deputy-mayor-loses-confidence-vote/article31120513.ece

182,2020/03/20,CBI moves HC for cancellation of bail,"Six accused police officers in Nedumkandam custodial death case

The Kerala High Court on Friday admitted a petition filed by the Central Investigation Bureau (CBI) seeking to revoke the bail granted to six accused police officers in the Nedumkandam custodial death case.

When the petition was taken up for hearing, CBI counsel submitted that the offence committed by the police officers was brutal and heinous. Rajkumar, a remand prisoner was tortured to death on June 21, 2019, at the Nedumkandam police station.

The CBI further submitted that the then sub-inspector K.A. Sabu and other accused police officers had taken Rajkumar into illegal custody on June 12, 2019, kept him in lock-up till June 15 and tortured him.

According to the CBI petition, the accused in such a grave crime were leading a free life which might lead to loss of faith of society in the rule of law and administration of the criminal justice system.

Besides, releasing them on bail had impeded the ongoing investigation. The CBI sought to cancel the bail granted earlier by the High Court to C.B. Rejimon, S. Niyas, Sajeev Antony, K.M. James, Jithin K. George and Roy P. Varghese.

The CBI pointed out that the investigation had revealed involvement of more police officers either as conspirators or abettors. If the accused police officers’ bail was not cancelled, they might influence the witnesses and tamper with evidence.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cbi-moves-hc-for-cancellation-of-bail/article31119157.ece

The Kerala government has postponed all school, higher secondary and university examinations until further notice, given the COVID-19 threat.

The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the capital on Friday morning.

An estimated 4.2 lakh students are in the middle of their preparations for the final phase of the Class X board examination that commenced on March 10. The tests were scheduled to conclude on March 26.

The government has also cancelled the higher secondary Plus one and Plus two examinations, which had commenced alongside the SSLC examination on March 10 and roughly followed the same calendar.

As many as 8,91,577 students are appearing for the higher secondary examinations in Kerala with the maximum number of candidates, 80,051 from Malappuram district.

All university examinations, including those planned for Friday, have been postponed. The move caught hundreds of college students by surprise. Even as the decision could upset the academic calender, government officials said the measure was inevitable to preempt the community spread of the infection.

The epidemic situation in the State had caused the government to abruptly reverse its earlier plan of action to push ahead with the examination calendar for students ranging from Class VIII and upwards.

The administration had also factored in the recommendations of various examination boards and the Central government to postpone the tests.

It also considered the reduced availability of transport and hostel facilities. Several teachers organisations had also expressed their concern about holding examination during the outbreak. The State will review the academic situation on March 31.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-govt-postpones-sslc-higher-secondary-university-examinations/article31117066.ece

The move by Kasaragod MLA N.A. Nellikunnu and Manjeswaram MLA M.C. Kamrudheen comes in the wake of stringent steps taken by the district administration to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The MLAs came in contact with the 47-year-old person from Kasaragod who tested positive on Thursday.

185,2020/03/20,"COVID-19: SC stays Kerala, Allahabad HC order of not levying taxes till April 6","The orders were passed by High Courts on March 19.

The Supreme Court on Friday stayed the interim orders passed by the Kerala and Allahabad High Courts to defer Central and State tax recovery proceedings, including the GST, till April 6 on account of the COVID-19 outbreak.

A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar ordered a freeze on the implementation of the High Courts’ orders on an urgent mentioning made by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta for the Centre.

Mr. Mehta said the “broad and omnibus” directions arbitrarily passed by the High Courts would have a “catastrophic” strain on national finances, and in fact, on the nation's ongoing battle against the pandemic and its monthly commitments like payment of salaries.

“The government is conscious of the prevailing situation and will take suitable measures to alleviate any hardship... The government is fully committed to using all its resources at its command to deal with the situation arising out of the coronavirus pandemic and it is taking pro-active precautions and measures... It has also been praised by the World Health Organisation for its response,” Mr. Mehta told the court during the mentioning.

The orders were passed by High Courts on March 19. The courts also extended limitations to conclude tax assessments, etc.

A special leave petition filed by the Centre through advocate Zoheb Hossain said the postponement of payment of taxes would result in a “severe cash flow and liquidity crisis and cash crunch and consequently the government will find it extremely difficult to run even its basic maintenance and development activities and pay salary to its crores of employees, pensioners, wage earners including armed forces, police, and health workers”.

The Centre said such judicial orders would serve as an unwarranted impetus to those financially capable to pay taxes in time. Even they would wait till April 6 because the consequences of late payment such as late fee, penalty, interest, etc. have been deferred.

“It has been the common experience that that almost 90% of the taxes get paid only on the last date or one or two days before the last date,” the petition said.

The directions of the High Courts would severely impact the monthly revenue collections of the Government of India, which are to the tune of two lakh crore. The High Courts have encroached upon purely executive functions and policy decision-making, which should be best left to the Executive.

“Have the High Courts failed to consider that most of the taxes are made online without human to human contact and there is no legal basis or rationale behind the broad direction to defer recovery proceedings till 06.04.2020"" the Centre asked in its appeal before the Supreme Court.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/xw471w/article31116557.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COVID-19KERALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-sc-stays-kerala-hc-order-of-not-levying-taxes-till-april-6/article31116558.ece
186,2020/03/20,Youth Congress activists stage auction in ‘reverse mode’,"Protest against govt. holding auction of liquor shops amid COVID-19 threat

The Youth Congress (YC) staged a unique protest outside the Civil Station here on Thursday by conducting a reverse auction of sanitary goods worth nearly ₹3,000.

It was a protest against the government for conducting the auction of liquor shops while everything else was in a shut-down stage in view of the COVID-19 scare.

The YC district committee distributed masks, gloves, and hand sanitizers through reverse auction. People turned more and more curious as they could win a sanitizer costing ₹150 for 50 paise.

Unlike usual auctioning, the YC’s auction was in reverse order. “The person bidding the lowest amount could win the auction,” said Riyas Mukkoli, YC State vice president, while inaugurating the auction.

The bid values ranged from ₹1 to 10 paisa. The organisers could collect ₹16.20 through the auction of sanitary goods worth ₹3,000. “We held the reverse auction at a time when toddy auction was going on at the collectorate. This is our simple way of protest,” said Mr. Mukkoli.

He described the toddy shop auction as a folly on the part of the government at a time when there was strict warning against all kinds of assemblies. He also came down on the government for arresting protesters instead of trying to correct its own folly. YC district president Shaji Pacheri presided. State general secretary Haris, district general secretaries Umerali Karekkad, and Sunil K.

187,2020/03/20,₹1 crore for Mahe to fight COVID-19: Puducherry CM,"Help sought from Kerala to contain spread of disease

Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy has assured of immediately releasing ₹1 crore from the State Disaster Relief Fund and taking immediate preventive measures in the wake of the confirmation of a COVID-19 case in Mahe.

The Chief Minister along with Health Minister Malladi Krishna Rao held a review meeting with officials in Mahe on Thursday to assess the situation and discuss steps to be adopted to curtail the spread of the disease.

Addressing the media after the meeting, Mr. Narayanaswamy said of the total ₹1 crore allocated from the disaster relief fund, ₹40 lakh will be released as first instalment, of which ₹10 lakh will be used to purchase medical equipment, ₹25 lakh to provide facilities such as treatment in isolation wards, and ₹5 lakh for awareness work.

The Chief Minister said medical equipment, including ventilators, would arrive soon. The State government is taking all measures to prevent the spread of the disease. “People should not panic, but they should follow instructions from the Health Department,” he said.

Mr. Narayanaswamy said he had contacted Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, seeking help to prevent the spread of the disease.

He further said that in Puducherry, Karaikal, and Yanam, as many as 123 persons were under observation, and that the test results of 23 people had returned negative. Meanwhile, checks have been tightened along Puducherry’s shared border with Tamil Nadu.

On the condition of the 68-year-old patient who was tested positive for COVID-19 at Pallur Kunjipura Mukh, he said it was satisfactory. The patient’s daughter-in-law is also under observation in the isolation ward, and her test results are awaited, the Chief Minister added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/1-crore-for-mahe-to-fight-covid-19-puducherry-cm/article31112916.ece
188,2020/03/20,Multipronged strategy for LSGIs to fight pandemic,"CM asks local bodies to take proactive role in checking spread of COVID-19

As the country stares at the possibility of community transmission of COVID-19, the State government has evolved a multipronged strategy for local self-government institutions (LSGIs) to contain the proliferation of the disease.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who addressed leaders of local bodies across the State on Thursday through videoconferencing, for which he was joined by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, instructed the people’s representatives to take up proactive roles in ensuring the efforts being made by the government in combating the virus spread reached fruition at the grassroots level.

With around 26,000 people placed in home quarantine, the unfolding scenario demanded the implementation of extraordinary measures that could not longer be confined at the State level or within a team of experts, he said.

Community vigilance

Advising local bodies to intensify community vigilance, Mr. Vijayan elaborated on their role in supporting all those who were under observation in their houses. Besides ensuring their basic needs such as food and medicines, and providing them counselling, civic bodies must be careful not to create an impression that they have been detained. At the same time, they must not be allowed to violate quarantine and roam freely.

Local bodies have also been asked to rein in gatherings by migrant workers and sensitise them to the precautionary measures that were being adopted. Community groups led by ward members and comprising government officials, ASHA, anganwadi and health workers must be constituted in each ward to identify and collect the details of bed-ridden patients and senior citizens who suffer from various ailments.

The Chief Minister also touched upon the impending crisis posed by the dwindling facilities to accommodate symptomatic travellers and homeless people. To circumvent the problem, the local self-government institutions have been instructed to identify hostels, defunct hospitals, uninhabited houses, colleges, schools and other institutions that could be spared for the purpose.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Chennithala stressed the need to learn from the mistakes of countries such as China and Italy that have been severely impacted by the pandemic.

189,2020/03/20,HC stays defamation proceedings against Ramadoss,"PMK leader had tweeted that Murasoli Trust was squatting Panchami land

The Madras High Court on Friday stayed all further proceedings in a criminal defamation case filed by Murasoli Trust against Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) leader S. Ramadoss before a Metropolitan Magistrate Court at Egmore here for having tweeted last year alleging that the trust was squatting on Panchami land meant for the Scheduled Castes.

Justice G.K. Ilanthiraiyan also dispensed with the personal appearance of Mr. Ramadoss before the trial court until further orders after advocate K. Balu moved a petition to quash the entire case.

The lawyer claimed that there was nothing defamatory in the tweet and hence the proceedings initiated by the trust were not maintainable.

In his petition, the PMK leader said the Managing Trustee of Murasoli Trust M.K. Stalin, who was also the president of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), had watched a Tamil movie titled ‘Asuran’ last year. Since the movie was based on the travails faced by the Scheduled Castes, he tweeted that it was not just a movie but a lesson to be learnt.

In reply, Mr. Ramadoss tweeted saying, the trust should first learn a lesson from the movie and return the Panchami land on which it was reportedly squatting for long. This, by no stretch of imagination, would amount to defamation, Mr. Balu contended.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-stays-defamation-proceedings-against-ramadoss/article31122581.ece
190,2020/03/20,VCK chief slams PM for not making specific announcements,"Unorganised workers hit by lack of business: Thirumavalavan

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi founder Thol. Thirumavalavan on Friday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech on Thursday for not making any concrete announcements in the wake of coronavirus problem and demanded that the Tamil Nadu government announce an economic package like the one announced by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

In a statement, Mr. Thirumavalavan said, “The coronavirus pandemic is not just an health crisis but also an economic one. Prime Minister Modi spoke about what people should do and didn’t utter a word about what the government was doing. The speech was disappointing since it didn’t prescribe any constructive solutions to the COVID-19 problem.”

“Unorganised sector workers have been affected as businesses have shut down throughout India and industrial production has reduced greatly. Daily wage agricultural labourers who can have their meals every day only if they work have been severely affected. Business houses have already requested that GST, income tax and loan interests should not be collected till April. Unorganised sector workers demanded an immediate relief for them. In this situation, it was expected that PM Modi would speak about all this – but he didn’t speak a single word on it,” said Mr. Thirumavalavan.

He pointed out that Prime Ministers of Great Britain, Canada and Chancellor of Germany had clearly spelt out how their governments were planning to allay the economic hardships faced by people due to coronavirus pandemic.

“They explained various economic steps taken by the government and the amount of money that has been allocated by the Government. PM Modi didn’t speak about these things at all,” he said.

Mr. Thirumavalavan said the Kerala government announced ₹20,000 crore as an emergency measure to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. He criticised the Central and the State Governments for not performing more tests as prescribed by the World Health Organisation.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/vck-chief-slams-pm-for-not-making-specific-announcements/article31122570.ece
191,2020/03/20,‘Government taking efforts to make Tamil official language in HC’,"CM has written to the Centre on the subject, says Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam

The State government has been taking steps to urge the Centre to make Tamil the official language in Madras High Court, even though the plea was rejected twice by the full Bench of the Supreme Court, Law Minister C. Ve. Shanmugam told the Legislative Assembly on Friday.

In his reply to P. Sivakumar alias Thayagam Kavi (DMK), who raised the issue in the House, Mr. Shanmugam said the Chief Minister had written to the Centre on March 3 in this regard.

Countering Mr. Sivakumar’s question on the delay in adopting Tamil as official language in the Madras High Court, Mr. Shanmugam questioned why the DMK was unable to ensure this when in power between 2006 and 2011, although it was a partner in the coalition government at the Centre then.

The plea for adopting Tamil as official language in the Madras High Court was rejected twice — once in 2012 and again in 2015, he said. “However, we have been repeatedly urging the Centre over the issue,” Mr. Shanmugam said. He recalled that both the AIADMK and the DMK were of the same opinion in this regard.

S. Semmalai (AIADMK) urged the State government to take action on adopting Tamil as official language in the High Court. “When the courts in four States can have Hindi as official language in respective States, why not Tamil,” he asked.

As for Mr. Semmalai’s request to set up a Supreme Court Bench in Chennai and contention that there were attempts to lobby for setting it up in other States, Mr. Shanmugam said that the Supreme Court maintained that there was no such proposal. “The Principal Bench [of the Supreme Court] is against having its Benches anywhere in the country,” the Minister said. Mr. Semmalai urged the government to prevent efforts to shift the Intellectual Property Appellate Board out of Chennai and Tamil Nadu.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/government-taking-efforts-to-make-tamil-official-language-in-hc/article31122539.ece
192,2020/03/20,"Provide food, shelter to street dwellers during ‘Janata Curfew’: HC","Government asked to utilise community halls, schools to house them

The Madras High Court on Friday directed the State government to accommodate all street dwellers in ‘night shelters’ run by local bodies and provide them free food during the ‘Janata Curfew’ called for by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday when most of the eateries are likely to be closed throughout the day.

Justices N. Kirubakaran and R. Hemalatha issued the direction at the request of advocate A.P. Suryaprakasam, who pointed out that the poor living on pavements and roadsides would be the most affected during the self-imposed restriction on public movement, except for emergencies, across the country from 7 am to 9 pm on Sunday.

During the course of a habeas corpus petition argued by him, the lawyer apprised the court of the difficulties the homeless poor could face during the curfew.

He said the government should take steps to house the homeless poor in schools, community halls and marriage halls as it was done during calamities such as floods.

Agreeing with him, the Bench, in its order, said: “As rightly pointed out by Mr. Suryaprakasam, in these days of crisis, the interest of daily wage labourers and poor workers should be taken care of by this court, especially during ‘Janata Curfew’ as this court is a constitutional court. Therefore, it has to incidentally consider the plea made by him. “Though it is submitted by Raja Srinivas, standing counsel for Greater Chennai Corporation, that 51 night shelters were available in the city, the government and the corporation are directed to inform through media about the availability of such shelters to those who dwell on roadsides. It is also the duty of the government to provide food to them during ‘Janata Curfew’.

“If necessary, the government and the corporation shall utilise community halls, marriage halls and schools for this purpose on March 22, 2020,” the court ordered.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/provide-food-shelter-to-street-dwellers-during-janata-curfew-hc/article31122532.ece
193,2020/03/20,Opinion | Tamil Nadu should consider covering COVID-19 testing under Chief Minister’s health insurance scheme,"Tamil Nadu’s Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme, unlike any other including PMJAY, offers distinct advantages.

Tamil Nadu has been lauded for its proactive response to contain the coronavirus’ spread, while at the same time has come under criticism for turning away patients who do not fit the three criteria required for testing — cough, fever, breathing difficulties combined with a travel history to affected nations.

The second case from Chennai, of a young man who did not have foreign travel history, has raised suspicions of community spreading and the need for increased testing is more likely to become a reality sooner or later in the State. While there are four designated centres in Tamil Nadu, if larger screening and testing procedures need to be introduced, two crucial questions remain — which diagnostic centres should be allowed to do testing, and who will bear the costs?

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

The Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme (CMCHIS) of Tamil Nadu, unlike any other scheme (even the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana or PMJAY) has the distinct advantage of providing for diagnostic procedures irrespective of whether or not it leads to hospitalisation. According to a World Bank Report, more than half the population of Tamil Nadu (14.2 million families) is already enrolled in the CMCHIS.

The government pays ₹699 per enrolled family (8.6 billion per annum in total) as premium to the insurance underwriter. Post 2017, when CMCHIS was integrated with PMJAY, 38 diagnostic procedures are covered under the scheme and more than 238 private diagnostic facilities have been empanelled. Unlike surgical and medical procedures, the utilisation of CMCHIS for diagnostics has remained low (less than 5% of total claim value in 2017).

Amidst the impending need to expand the centres to collect samples for COVID-19 testing, it might be an effective and efficient idea to provide the testing facilities under the CMCHIS. The advantages are many. Firstly, the empanelled diagnostic centres, especially the private facilities, would have already been checked for quality standards during the enrolment process. Second, coverage under CMCHIS would reduce out-of-pocket expenditure for patients at a time where the test cost at the primary level is ₹1,500 and confirmatory level is ₹5,000. The costs may go up as we continue to import the probes from Germany.

Coronavirus updates | March 20, 2020

Third, the government being the final authority in CMCHIS, this arrangement can ensure that the existing facilities at private diagnostic centres are leveraged, monitored closely so that continuity of treatment for patients testing positive under the scheme is ensured.

Fourth, the scheme would shed its image that it only helps for high-end tertiary level cases. In fact, T.N. has been a forerunner in taking bold moves during crisis periods such as covering dengue during the 2017 outbreak, and medical camps during the 2015 floods.

Tamil Nadu recorded its second positive case of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease, COVID-19, on March 18. The person in question is a 20-year-old youth, who had travelled from Delhi to Chennai in a train, tested positive for COVID-19, and is in the isolation ward of Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH).

The government says that India is in Stage 2 of the outbreak, in that all Indians who have tested positive have a history of travel to affected countries or have been in contact with those who have so travelled. An instance of community transmission — someone who tests positive without any such link — would indicate widespread prevalence of the virus and put India in Stage 3 of the World Health Organisation’s classification and necessitate a different plan of action at containment or mitigation.

PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Friday demanded that the TASMAC liquor shops be shut down to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in India.

Dr. Ramadoss urged Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to shut down liquor shops to stop the spread of COVID-19.

He said: “All the precautionary measures and awareness undertaken by State Government to prevent the spread of corona virus are appreciable, but the crowds are swelling in liquor shops. The liquor shops shouldn’t become sites for corona virus infections to spread.”

Dr. Ramadoss also welcomed Prime Minister Modi’s ‘janata curfew’ on Sunday for 14 hours during the day and urged people to isolate themselves and respect the Prime Minister’s call.

201,2020/03/20,"COVID-19: Work from home leads to spike in demand for laptops, but supplies hit","Since a majority of the production takes place in China, supplies have been impacted, experts said

With an increasing number of companies looking at work from home options amid the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a sudden spike in the demand for laptops. However, there is a shortage in the market due to supply issues, according to industry players.

“The demand has been very sudden, and more companies have been looking to procure laptops, as they adopt work from home options. The availability is not at a level to match the demand in time,” K. Purushothaman, former director at Nasscom, said.

“For large corporates the supply works on built-to-order basis and is shipped as per requirements. In case of this segment, no one holds inventory, unlike in the consumer segment. Over the last 45 days the demand has spiked due to the work from home policies adopted by firms,” Mahesh R, Business Head, Digital Products, Croma, said.

Mr. Mahesh pointed out that the majority of production happens in China and most factories were based in Wuhan, and as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic, supplies have been impacted. “Normally what happens, is that those who need supply in April, will have to shift stocks in February, which is essentially the Chinese New Year time frame. This was impacted due to the extended holiday there,” Mr. Mahesh said. He also pointed out that Intel accounted for 85% of the processors and they have been facing shortages for the last one year and are focusing on premium models.

The annual size of the Indian personal computing market (desktops, laptops, tablets) is 12 million, out of which 4.5 million is the consumer segment and the remaining is the commercial segment. “The processor issue and supplies impacted due to the situation in China and the weaker rupee pushing up prices will all result in not being able to cater to the current demand. Also, our outlets in malls have been shut,”” Mr. Mahesh said.

Jaipal Singh, Associate Research Manager, Client Devices, IDC India, pointed out that the entire supply is dependent on China. IDC India is a research firm which tracks PC shipments. “Even now, factories are operating at only half capacity in China, and this is expected to continue till April. So it would be difficult to meet the demand. Companies are looking at buying refurbished devices and also at rental options to reduce the business impact,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/4eis49/article31117010.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20MARTH--LAPTOP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-work-from-home-leads-to-spike-in-demand-for-laptops-but-supplies-hit/article31117011.ece
202,2020/03/20,Lawyer seeks cancellation of activist’s citizenship,"Petitioner says Sri Lankan native overstayed in the country

The Madras High Court on Wednesday sought the response of the Centre to a public interest litigation petition filed by a 25-year-old woman lawyer from Andhra Pradesh to cancel the Indian citizenship of a self-proclaimed animal rights activist S. Muralidharan, who migrated to Chennai from Sri Lanka in 1983.

A Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and Krishnan Ramasamy directed Senior Central Government Standing Counsel K. Venkataswamy Babu to take notices on behalf of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs as well as the Ministry of External Affairs. They also ordered notice to Mr. Muralidharan, returnable by April 22.

The orders were passed after senior counsel AR.L. Sundaresan, representing the PIL petitioner Mandalapu Sandhya of Nellore, claimed that the citizenship obtained on the ground of marrying an Indian citizen was invalid since the activist had overstayed in the country and was also not in possession of a valid foreign passport while making his application.

In her affidavit, the litigant said she was shocked to come across social media posts of Mr. Muralidhar who had denigrated almost all acclaimed animal rights activists in the country by calling them names and denouncing the work done by them. He had not spared even former Union Minister Maneka Gandhi.

The petitioner’s lawyer was also equally shocked by his supposed claim that commercial exploitation of animals, in events such as circus, would actually prevent them from extinction and that he was responsible for gathering protesters in favour of jallikattu in 2017. She also accused him of soliciting funds from people for INCARE, a NGO, run by him.

A deeper probe into his background by the petitioner revealed that he was born at Kandy in Sri Lanka in 1969 and migrated to India in 1983. After completing his school and collegiate education in Chennai, he got employed in New Delhi in 1994, when he was issued an Indian passport after cancellation of his Sri Lankan passport.

Thereafter, he shifted to Chennai and married an Indian citizen in 1996. When his Indian passport expired in 2004, the Regional Passport Officer here refused to renew it. Hence, Mr. Muralidharan filed a writ petition in the High Court in 2007 and obtained an order from a single judge in 2014 to consider granting him citizenship on the ground of having married an Indian citizen and residing here for long.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/p5iixm/article31095902.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th17HCcovidAGEQ78OFJQ3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/lawyer-seeks-cancellation-of-activists-citizenship/article31112570.ece

206,2020/03/20,Demand for hand sanitisers goes up,"Supply chain disrupted, retailers left clueless

Demand for hand sanitisers spiked considerably from December to March, according to medical representatives and suppliers.

An assistant manager from a supermarket in Sankarampalayam, claimed that the supply chain was cut some three weeks ago, as soon as the news of COVID-19 spread in India. “We did not see this much demand earlier, when we supplied huge quantum of sanitisers during the last few months,” he said.

Similarly, a retailer had no idea when the supply would reach his shop, located on the Officers’ Line, Vellore.

An exclusive survey on the availability was taken on Thursday, where its was found out that bigger supermarkets, which normally stock hand sanitisers, were left out of supply for the past three weeks. Similar was the situation in Sankarampalayam, Thorappadi, Velapadi, Bagayam, Vellore Town, Katpadi and Tharapadavedu.

Whereas handwash, tissue papers are available in super markets run by the multinational companies.

Health officials advise that people should disinfect countertops and other frequently touched surfaces to help contain the virus, as well as use alcohol-based hand sanitisers and soap to clean their hands.

A market supplier from Vellore said, “We are making every effort to meet two ends meet. But the supply level had come down due to the virus outbreak, as we are facing huge labour shortage.”

“Many of the local brands use women workforce in their factories for this job but due to the declared holidays for school and college children, they are not coming to work,” he said.

The demand has increased as number of offices, commercial centres, educational institutions have placed orders in large numbers, for which the manufacturers are toiling now. This could be adjusted once we get the first batch of supply by this weekend, he added.

Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar informed the Assembly on Thursday that the State government was making efforts to bring back hundreds of fishermen from Tamil Nadu who are stranded in Iran.

He said 170 students from T.N. who had been stranded in the Philippines had landed in Visakhapatnam on Wednesday.

Responding to a special calling attention motion, the Minister said the Tamil Nadu government was making efforts to bring back hundreds of fishermen stranded in various places across Iran, since air traffic had been disrupted in the country in the wake of the coronavirus scare. “The fishermen are in touch with the authorities. It is not true that they are struggling in Iran without food,” he said.

211,2020/03/20,"Woman, mother-in-law held for poisoning child","Police exhume body of baby girl; both women remanded in judicial custody

A 27-year-old woman has confessed to the police that owing to extreme poverty, she killed her five-day-old daughter at Ramanathapuram in Mottanoothu panchayat.

She was arrested along with her mother-in-law and charged with murder on Thursday.

The police exhumed the child’s body in the presence of revenue, health and social welfare officers and ordered a post-mortem by a team of doctors from the government hospital.

The shocking incident came to light after some neighbours asked the woman about the whereabouts of the newborn as there was no sign of the baby.

Police said that Suresh, 34, a mason, married Kavita 12 years ago and they had two girls, aged 10 and 8. Kavita delivered a girl on February 26. After two days, the mother and the newborn were discharged.

It has come to light that Suresh’s mother expressed unhappiness about Kavita delivering another girl child. She reportedly told her daughter-in-law to kill the baby, a woman police officer who conducted the probe said.

On the night of March 2, the woman and her mother-in-law administered milk laced with poison to the baby. Under cover of darkness, the duo buried the body near their home, police said.

Neighbours suspicious

When the neighbours enquired, Kavita gave evasive replies. A young woman from the village alerted ChildLine, following which a team visited the hamlet and informed the Rajadhani police station.

After recording their statement, both Kavita and her mother-in-law Chellammal were arrested and produced before a judicial magistrate court, which sent them to judicial custody.

ChildLine officials have been conducting sensitisation programmes about the cradle baby scheme by the State government along with the Social Welfare Department. R. Sasikala, working with an NGO in Usilampatti, Madurai district, urged the government to be proactive and monitor women who had delivered recently and newborns by periodically visiting their dwellings.

212,2020/03/20,"The romantic idealism of 'Moneyball', the pre-eminent sports movie of our times","The biographical baseball drama subverts the underdog formula by presenting digital pragmatism as the unlikely hero

At its core, sport is the celebration of physical traditionalism. Primal instincts like survival, speed, endurance, athleticism and courage become tangible traits under the guise of entertainment. Consequently, like any visual medium, sport becomes an inherent endorsement of beauty over mechanics. We admire winners who turn sport into a science of technical efficiency: Modern-day Australian cricket teams, Cristiano Ronaldo, Novak Djokovic, Michael Schumacher. They make domination look mundane. But we adore winners who turn sport into an art of irresistible naturalism: West Indian cricket teams of yore, Lionel Messi, Roger Federer, Ayrton Senna. They make domination feel memorable.

Transformative technology

In context of storytelling, these two schools of style are mutually exclusive: Raw oldness is the heroic underdog, while slick newness is the impersonal antagonist. Which is why I believe Moneyball is the pre-eminent sports movie of our times. On the face of it, Bennett Miller’s Moneyball, based on Michael Lewis’s non-fiction book, examines the technological transformation of baseball at the turn of the century.

The two protagonists, Oakland Athletics’ General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and assistant Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), would have been the soulless anti-heroes of any other sports film. They use sophisticated sabermetrics. They disregard scouts’ intuitive experiences. They ditch high-profile players. They turn winning into dry math.

Trouble with the Curve released a year after Moneyball, starring Clint Eastwood as an aging baseball scout in an age of tech-savvy young managers. Eastwood wins with old-fashioned instinct against Matthew Lillard, the film’s corporate newbie. In other words, Moneyball’s Beane and Brand desensitise a sport – stripping it off flourish, fluidity, subjectivity – by reducing it to advanced analytics. Yet, this biographical baseball drama subverts the underdog formula by presenting digital pragmatism as the unlikely hero and paperback sentimentalism as the default setting. Beane is in fact the one engulfed by a stubborn system – an arrogant head scout, skeptical CEO, cynical coach, distrusting players.

Science or art?

But this isn’t to say idealists are the bad guys. A distinct feature of Moneyball is its elusive balance between the two incompatible schools of style. The story might be a rare endorsement of science in sport, but art informs its filmmaking. For instance, the central music theme (The Mighty Rio Grande) isn’t a conventional sports score: It evokes the wistfulness of memory, of the future becoming history in real time. It suggests that Billy Beane is an incurable romantic. He is driven by chafed affection, by superstition, by the prospect of transcending logic. The understated personality of Moneyball thrives on this paradox – of the old guard updating a purist’s passion. Necessity is the mother of invention. But in Beane’s case, heartbreak is the father of invention. His love – of family (divorced), baseball (scouts ruined his playing career), competition (crippled by budget) – has failed him over the years. Almost reactively, he hires the epitome of reasoning: an Economics graduate for whom science is simply an elevated form of art.

Moneyball’s Peter Brand is emblematic of modern sport’s robotisation. The game is an academic project for him. But the film’s finest scenes have the two men silently feeding off one another. Brand’s calculative head shows signs of Beane’s heartbeat when he celebrates – with a comical fist-pump – on securing a last-gasp transfer deal.

Brand even agrees to engage with the players, and fire them in person. Only in a late scene does he reveal himself as a modified pragmatist. He shows Beane the footage of an obese hitter tumbling at base before realising his shot is a home run. Brand’s nostalgic narration breaks character, eventually prompting the older man to remember his own love: “How can you not be romantic about baseball?”.

Triumph of romanticism

Beane, too, evidently adopts some of Brand’s cold objectivity. On the cusp of a record streak, Billy Beane breaks his no-game-watching protocol and drives back to the stadium. (The camera continues in his lane even as he abandons it). The team blows a 11-0 lead. The winning play, however, is a hypnotic combination of Beane’s romanticism and Brand’s realism. The coach overrules his own instinct to bat Hatteberg, an undervalued sabermetrics pick. At first glance, Hatteberg scoring looks like a Brand moment – a mathematically inevitable shot. But Beane’s idealism defines it: seconds earlier, Beane left the stands to unjinx the game. Moreover, the home run came from a defensive first-baseman – against strategy, wisdom and...science.

Mundanity is usually sacrificed at the altar of a miracle. But the miracle of Moneyball, like the team it reflects, is merely a sum of tangible mundanities. The Athletics lose the playoffs, because both men eventually resist getting consumed by method; they retain a glimmer of madness. The film closes with Beane on the freeway, contemplating the fickleness of sport. He plays a tape of his daughter’s song. Here’s a die-hard romantic who hates losing, but has lost plenty without shedding a tear. Yet, it’s only when the girl’s unblemished voice breaks into an extra verse of “You’re such a loser, dad,” his eyes finally go glassy. With proud tears.

Even when there isn’t a shoot, I prefer being at home, except for perhaps stepping out to watch a movie. For me, cinema is the best way to unwind. Right now, I have a long list of movies on my to-watch list. A few are on my computer and the rest from Netflix and Amazon Prime. I enjoy films of all genres and can’t wait to see those that have won recognition at film festivals. Another activity that keeps me occupied is sketching. That has always been my favourite pastime, even during breaks on shooting sets. I think it was a welcome move to halt shootings because if one person gets infected, it affects a lot of other people too.

Since the remaining scenes were to be shot with a crowd featuring junior artistes, we felt that it was better to stop the work because these artistes were to come from different parts of Kerala. However, the editing of the film is on since the scenes were filmed in the same order as they appear in the movie. I am also working on a film that I am producing with a new director at the helm. Otherwise, I am mostly at my home in Changanassery, spending time with my daughter. We even go for a bike ride at times!

I am also taking care of my health and giving myself the rest I deserve. I was acting in my debut Tamil film, Karnan, opposite Dhanush when it was decided to stop shootings. Nobody knows what is going to happen. The best thing I can do now is stay at home as much as possible.

Waiting list

Among the films that have been halted are Madhu Warrier’s Lalitham Sundaram, starring Biju Menon and Manju Warrier; Martin Prakkat’s untitled film; Lal Jr’s Tsunami and Basil Joseph’s Minnal Murali. While the release of Mohanlal’s Marakkar- Arabikkadalinte Simham and Tovino’s Kilometers and Kilometers have been postponed, Aju Varghese’s Sajan Bakery Since 1962 and Mahesh Narayanan’s Malik will have to push their release dates. Other upcoming releases are One, Kunjeldo, Mohankumar Fans, Halal Love Story and Keshu E Veedinte Nadhan.

214,2020/03/20,"'The Outsider' review: Extensively-plotted, emotionally-layered, and keeps you hooked till the end","HBO's adaptation of the 2018 Stephen King novel is a treat for lovers of slow-burn investigative dramas

It mustn’t be easy to sell the “slow-burn procedural unfolding against the backdrop of a shocking murder in a small town” pitch to a TV audience any more, and so it is no surprise that HBO decided to back “a slow-burn procedural unfolding against the backdrop of a shocking murder in a small town — with a supernatural twist” plot to reel in viewers.

The Outsider is an adaptation of a 2018 Stephen King novel that combines elements of two genres that enjoy red-hot popularity on TV: supernatural fantasy and true crime. There could not be material more ideal for a miniseries, because while the show offers the comfort (discomfort?) of dark investigative dramas, it also throws in bone-chilling scares and several jump-out-of-your-chair moments associated with adaptations of King’s works.

What highly works in The Outsider’s favour is an unusual yet riveting pilot episode, which sets up the shows’ world beautifully. Detective Ralph Anderson (Ben Mendelsohn) is on his way to a baseball game with his fellow officers to arrest high school coach Terry Maitland (Jason Bateman) for the gruesome murder of a young boy. There are multiple witnesses who have offered up damning testimonies, and a mountain of forensic discovery to suggest Maitland is the killer.

A case that seems like a slam dunk, however, takes a turn when overwhelming evidence about Maitland being present in a different town at the time of the murder turns up. Both scenarios — that of Maitland having murdered the kid, and him being nowhere near the child at the time of the death — seem equally likely. Has Maitland concocted the perfect crime? Is there a doppelgänger on the loose? At one point, I even began wondering if there is an alternate timeline being hinted at.

A lot of this — the crime, the arrest, the conflicting evidence, Maitland’s incarceration, etc — emerges in the first episode itself; an hour packed with enough plot developments to make you wonder what the rest of the show will cover. This is where screenwriter Richard Price (The Night Of, The Wire) excels: the pacing of each episode — and not just the pilot — is exquisite, even as the point of intrigue often seamlessly shifts from one plot-point to another.

And there is a wonderful ensemble to boot. Ever since Mendelsohn broke onto the scene with his marvellous performance on Bloodline, he has been picking up substantial roles in Hollywood movies. But here, he gets to truly dig in and display his wide range as a performer. Bateman plays Maitland with eerie efficiency. Bill Camp, Jeremy Bobb and Mare Winningham are all terrific, and watching all these great actors in the same frame is a real treat. There is also Cynthia Erivo, who only appears in the third episode as a private investigator with a taste for the supernatural — a complete foil to Anderson’s character, who only goes by hard evidence. Their beliefs often clash, making them the perfect duo to play off each other.

The Outsider’s USP, apart from that stellar cast, is that it is a whodunit and a howdunit and a whydunit and even a whatdunit all rolled into one, and it does so without ever turning messy. I did feel that the veil was lifted off its big mystery a bit earlier than desirable, resulting in the show peaking mid-season, but the final act is not disappointing by any stretch of imagination. As far as book adaptations go, it embodies all the qualities of a great novel: it is extensively-plotted, emotionally-layered, and keeps you hooked till the very end.

The Outsider is now streaming on Hotstar.

215,2020/03/20,Cinema journalism in the time of COVID-19,"The film industry has been wrenched out of its cocoon and we need to pay attention

As I start this column, the one and only press screening in the near future — Kleber Mendonça Filho and Juliano Dornelles much-celebrated Cannes jury prize winner Bacurau — stands cancelled. I bring out my notepad to strike things off from my to-do list.

No meetings lined up at Soho House, no events at any of the suburban five-star hotels, no interviews in Oshiwara and Lokhandwala. Life in the time of COVID-19 can seem mournfully desolate for a film journalist. Yet, at the same time, it has become decidedly challenging and stimulating. When the world, as we know it, is changing drastically and irredeemably, cinema can’t stay complacent and comfortable in its aesthetic and escapist isolation. So too when it comes to writing about it.

It comes with the awareness that the sense of void I might be feeling is of little consequence given the critical state of affairs across the world. But I cannot brush aside the fact that it’s barely a few days and I am already missing my filmi routine. I miss the American Beauty-inspired interiors of PVR Le Rêve in Bandra and the cheese sandwich and small samosas at Juhu’s Sunny Super Sound preview theatre. I thought this year I would participate in making history by attending the first-ever film festival in Saudi Arabia. Far from it. The fate of one of the grandest celebrations of cinema, Festival de Cannes, also hangs in the balance.

But more than any of these banalities, it’s your very place in the larger journalistic scheme of things that calls for introspection in such times. Cinema and cricket, two of the most popular news topics, suddenly seem weirdly out of place. In my immediate memory as a journalist, I have felt the churn most during 9/11 and 26/11; it happens briefly during elections (the filmi candidates and campaigners notwithstanding); and it has been happening consistently over the past three months, ever since the Delhi police barged into the Jamia library.

Beat of the times

It was a defining moment, a tipping point. Disturbed, enraged, not knowing what to do about the unrest within, I had gone the next day to a small, spontaneously held protest at Mumbai University’s Kalina campus only to find a bunch of known faces from Bollywood mingling with the ‘hoi polloi’, perhaps trying to reclaim their supposedly airy world of images and anchoring it in the real. Just as I was subconsciously trying to attune the journalist in me (that is always a step ahead of the cinema writer) to the beat of the times. Protests became sites to forge a larger intuitive connect with the film fraternity in asserting the fact that cinema can’t be peripheral to national discourse.

Much like the stars we mingle with, film journalists are assumed to live in ivory towers. It’s time to step out of the bubble and engage with the real world. More so at a moment of reckoning of the kind we are facing now. Yes, many more people are presumably lapping up mounds of content from the cable and the web within the confines of their homes. I have two Berlinale films and several indies in my inbox, Road to Roma to watch on Netflix, and Virus to revisit on Prime Video.

Cinema has been wrenched out of its cocoon. There are huge losses and uncertainties across the spectrum — from big producers to daily-wage earners, from theatre owners to audiences. The creation, distribution and consumption of cinema is set to change unalterably, and this demands our attention. And give it, we must. Until it’s safe once again to return to feel-good, escapist entertainment.

Several top stars of the industry, including Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Alia Bhatt, Ajay Devgn, Madhuri Dixit and Ranveer Singh have come together for a special video to spread awareness about the novel coronavirus. The video is an initiative by Rohit Shetty Picturez in collaboration with the Maharashtra government, features actors appealing to citizen to tread with caution and safety amid the pandemic.

Bachchan took to Twitter to share the clip, writing, “The film fraternity pleads and cautions for safety and precaution... an initiative by the Industry and the CM Maharashtra.”

The video begins with the 77-year-old saying that by taking necessary precautionary measures, “We can stop it from spreading.”

“During this difficult time, it’s very important that all of us together fulfil the responsibilities of a good citizen so that we can fight with this virus with caution and precaution rather than fear,” Bachchan says.

The clip features actors giving out important do’s and don’ts in times of the pandemic.

Actor Anil Kapoor says it’s time to pay attention to one’s personal hygiene by washing hands regularly using soap, while Madhuri highlights the use of tissue or handkerchief to cover mouth while coughing or sneezing and disposing them off in a closed box.

Ranveer says, “If there’s no facility available to wash hands at a place, then apply alcohol sanitiser in your hand.”

Actor Shilpa Shetty advises against subscribing to any fat diet and asks to increase intake of nutritious food to boost immunity.

“Avoid unnecessary travel, maintain one metre distance from those who are ill,” Varun Dhawan says in the video.

Arjun Kapoor urges to take “extra care of kids and elder people” because their chances of getting inflected are the highest.

Ayushmann Khurrana says whenever possible, people should work from home and asks not to crowd public places.

“Don’t touch your face and eyes without washing your hands. If you have cough, fever or experience breathlessness, don’t come in contact with anyone. Immediately see the doctor,” Alia Bhatt adds.

Devgn says one step by the citizens towards safety “can save a lot of lives.”

“If every citizen contributes by following these rules, then we all can prevent this danger. Stay healthy, stay safe,” Akshay adds.

The video ends with a message “Together we can and we will fight this.”

According to the Health Ministry data, the novel coronavirus cases in India rose to 195 on Friday after 22 fresh cases were reported from various parts of the country.

The cases include 32 foreign nationals including 17 from Italy, 3 from the Philippines, two from the UK, one each belonging to Canada, Indonesia and Singapore.

217,2020/03/20,"Actor Sudheer Babu shares home workout video series, in the wake of coronavirus outbreak","Through a five-part series, he emphasises on the need to stay fit and build immunity

Actor Sudheer Babu is among the fittest in the Telugu film industry and often, on social media, he has been asked by his fans to post workout videos. “But I haven’t had the time,” says the actor. Until now, when film shootings across the country have come to a grinding halt.

Since most of us are increasingly working from home and practising social distancing in a bid to curb the spread of COVID-19, Sudheer felt the time is right to share fitness videos. “When we are home and not moving around enough, we burn fewer calories. It’s important to take up some activity or the other. Gyms are shut, so I thought I’ll share videos of how to do a few bodyweight exercises and use easy-to-find props at home,” says the actor.

An image from Sudheer Babu’s video

The first video uploaded on Thursday is a ‘chest and biceps’ routine that requires a warm up and a set of exercises — flat chest press, incline chest press, decline chest press, chest press using a ball, reverse palm push-ups, bicep curls and bicep concentration curls. His step-by-step demonstrations teaches the right form to avoid injuries. In addition, he suggests a cardio regimen too.

The second video Sudheer shared on Friday morning targeted ‘back and triceps’ with back extension, rows, superman, pull ups, tricep dips, extensions and diamond push-ups.

If push-ups are easy for you, Sudheer shows how you can step up the intensity using a backpack for increased resistance.

The next three days, Sudheer will be uploading exercise regimens for shoulder and abs, legs and High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT).

Fitness is a way of life for Sudheer. He talks about having been diligent with his regimens for years, with a 45 to 60-minute duration. For his next film, the action thriller V directed by Indraganti Mohanakrishna and co-starring Nani, Aditi Rao Hydari and Nivetha Thomas, he tweaked his fitness routine to be “more agile and stronger.”

V, initially scheduled to release during Ugadi, has been postponed owing to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Sudheer has a word of caution for those who’ve stocked up on junk food. He believes that good bodies are made both at the gym and in the kitchen, and says, “Chocolates and candies are bad any day, even on normal days when you go out to work or are regular with your gym sessions. While spending more time at home, one needs to cut down on needless carbs.”

Just a few days after France president Emmanuel Macron put the country in full lockdown mode, the organisers of the Cannes Film Festival have announced that the event will be postponed.

According to Variety, the organising team confirmed that the festival would no longer be scheduled on the original dates of May 12 to 23, and that other options were being considered, such as towards the end of June.

A statement was also released by the festival, that comes after weeks of wondering if it were to happen, particularly after the cancellation of other film festivals like Tribeca, South by Southwest, and so on, in the recent few weeks.

“At this time of global health crisis, our thoughts go to the victims of the COVID-19 and we express our solidarity with all of those who are fighting the disease,” read the statement, adding, “As soon as the development of the French and international health situation will allow us to assess the real possibility, we will make our decision known, in accordance with our ongoing consultation with the French Government and Cannes’ City Hall as well as with the Festival’s Board Members, Film industry professionals and all the partners of the event.”

The organisers also stated, “In the meantime, the Festival de Cannes lends its vocal support to all of those who firmly call on everyone to respect the general lockdown, and ask to show solidarity in these difficult times for the entire world.”

South Korean-American actor and producer Daniel Dae Kim has become the latest Hollywood star to test positive for the coronavirus.

“My experience fighting the coronavirus: Hi everyone, yesterday I was diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Looks like I’ll be ok, but I wanted share my journey with you in the hopes that you find it informative or helpful. Hope you all stay safe, calm, and above all, healthy,” he posted on Instagram.

The actor, who is known for his roles in TV shows like Lost and Hawaii Five-0, took to Instagram to post a video message, advising everyone to take the pandemic seriously.

Daniel said, “For all those out there, especially teenagers and millennials who think this is not serious, please know that it is.”

He went on, adding, “If you treat this without care, you are potentially endangering the lives of millions of people, including your loved ones. So for the sake of everyone else, please follow the guidelines: social distancing, self-isolate, stop touching your face, and wash your hands.”

Daniel also apologised to the cast and crew members he had worked with recently, who he may have exposed to the virus and also expressed his gratitude to the healthcare workers helping patients. “I believe that healthcare for all is a right, not a privilege. Everyone who meets the qualifications to be tested should be, because the virus doesn’t care about race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, whether you’re rich or poor,” he added.

Finally, Daniel also addressed the racial discrimination and violence that Asian people have been facing since the outbreak of the coronavirus across the world, including a reference to USA President Donald Trump terming COVD-19 as the “Chinese virus”.

“Please, please stop the prejudice and senseless violence against Asian people. Beating elderly, even homeless Asian Americans is heartbreaking and inexcusable. I’m Asian, and yes I have coronavirus, but I did not get it from China. I got it in America, in New York City.”

“Despite what some political leaders want to call it, I don’t consider the place where it’s from as important as the people who are sick. If I had, I would call this thing the New York virus... but that would be silly. This name-calling gets us nowhere. What matters is how best we take care of ourselves and each other.,” he concluded.

Daniel Dae Kim was shooting on the NBC series New Amsterdam, when he was diagnosed.

221,2020/03/20,"Coronavirus | 12 Vietnamese, two guides shifted to Hyderabad","‘They came to Nalgonda on March 9 from Delhi’

District Superintendent of Police A.V. Ranganath announced on Friday that 12 Vietnamese, including two children, and two other accompanying guides, who toured the town for the last 10 days, were shifted to Fever Hospital in Hyderabad.

The operation was carried out around midnight on Thursday after police came to know about their stay in Nalgonda. A preliminary test was conducted on them, with the help of medical and revenue officials, and all 14 were shifted to Hyderabad.

“Though nobody in the group showed any symptoms of COVID-19, they were shifted as they are foreign nationals, as a precautionary measure,” Mr. Ranganath said.

The 12 Vietnamese landed in Delhi on March 4, and reached Hyderabad by train on March 9. They went to Nalgonda on the same day in a hired vehicle, along with the two guides, police said.

According to the Masjid-e-Mahbas, where all of them stayed, the Vietnamese looked healthy.

“They are Islamic preachers allotted here by the Nizamuddin Markas Masjid of Delhi. Such preachers visit here once in six months and stay in mosques,” a member said.

It was also learnt that the preachers visited a few other mosques in the old town.

On Friday, as the news spread with the arrival of electronic media outside the mosque near the District Prison here, Mr. Ranganath was forced to clear the air.

Meanwhile, police and committee members locked the mosque and sterilised the area.

222,2020/03/20,Coronavirus | Telangana HC orders postponement of SSC exams scheduled between March 23 and 30,"No change in SSC exams to be held from March 31 to April 6

Telangana High Court on Friday directed the State government to postpone the ongoing SSC exams scheduled to be held from March 23 to 30, in the backdrop of rising COVID-19 cases.

Two exams have already been completed and there will not be any change in the third exam scheduled for Saturday. The deferred exams (from March 23 to 30) should be rescheduled, a division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy said after hearing a PIL seeking deferment of the exams due to coronavirus.

As of now, there will be no change in the SSC exams to be held from March 31 to April 6. If the situation deteriorates, even those exams should be deferred and rescheduled for a future date, the bench ordered. Though the government had the discretion to decide upon rescheduling the exams, the HC hoped that the ‘government would be alive to the great danger being posed by coronavirus in the State’.

The PIL was filed by a private educational institute faculty member M. Bala Krishna stating that it was not fair to conduct SSC exams while the coronavirus was spreading and the Central board exams like CBSE and ICSE have already been deferred. The petition was moved as lunch motion and taken up as an urgent matter by the bench.

The petitioner’s counsel K. Pavan Kumar contended that congregation of students, teachers and parents at the exam centres would unnecessarily expose them to possible spread of COVID-19. Despite this, the government was going ahead with the exams risking the lives of students, the lawyer said. Seeking to know why the State government was conducting the exams while similar Central board exams were postponed, the bench initially asked Advocate General B.S. Prasad to secure instructions from government on the matter by lunch break. When the AG said the government had taken all precautions and prepared to hold the exams, the bench reminded him that authorities imposed prohibitive orders in Karimnagar town while the Centre government decided to observe ‘Janata curfew’ on Sunday.

“Life of our children is important. Where is the question of career when the life is at risk,” the bench observed. “If one among 30 students confined to a single room has the virus, all others would get infected,” the bench noted. Citing an advisory issued by Union HRD Ministry, the bench observed that even if the government had taken all measures to prevent spread of coronavirus, the health and safety of children, a potential victim of the virus, needs to be safeguarded at the highest level. “Therefore it would be unwise on the part of the State to compel students to write the exams during pandemic period,” the bench said in its order. The bench observed that the country was undergoing second stage of COVID-19 pandemic and was about to enter third stage. The virus has devastated Iran and Italy. “In this highly charged atmosphere, it would not be advisable to compel students to travel from their homes to examination centres,” the bench said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hflncq/article31122485.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy21SSCcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hc-orders-postponement-of-ssc-exams-scheduled-between-march-23-and-30/article31122486.ece
223,2020/03/20,Police on a mission mode to trace foreign returnees,"Teams are creating awareness among public about the potential health risks

Telangana police along with the officials of health and other departments are on mission mode to trace all people (Indians and foreigners) who have come from foreign countries after March 1.

The agenda is to know where they are living, if they have any symptoms, and to follow up on their health condition for 14 days from the day they returned from abroad.

The Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) team, comprising a Station House Officer, Tahsildar and a medical staff follow up their condition for 14 days. If anyone develops symptoms during this duration, they will be taken to isolation centres at Hyderabad and samples collected for tests.

The process started from December 17, after Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar held a video conference with collectors, superintendents of police, commissioners of police and officials of various departments across the State. However, the exercise intensified on Friday, a day after Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao held an emergency meeting with collectors, SPs and CPs and directed them to trace people who came to the State after March 1.

While speaking to foreign returnees and their family members, the IDSP teams are taking a precaution of maintaining at least two metres distance.

Speaking to The Hindu a senior police officer said that the foreign returnees are the potential carriers of COVID-19, as all the patients tested positive in the State have returned from abroad.

“Our task is to know that they are healthy and safe, which will act as a preventive measure,” the officer said, adding that the probability of those people getting affected and spreading the virus is more.

The officer said that in the last few weeks a large number of people from Karimnagar, Nizamabad and Rangareddy districts who migrated to various Middle Eastern countries have returned home.

“Our teams are visiting their houses and are asking them to go on self-isolation for 14 days and if they have any symptoms they must approach the nearest health facility or call 104 for help,” said Rajanna-Sircilla SP Rahul Hegde.

In Sircilla they have identified 560 people who returned from Gulf countries after March 1 and 99% of them are under self-isolation, he said. “Only two persons had symptoms, but they were tested negative,” Mr. Hedge said.

Jagtial SP Sindhu Sarma said that they have identified over 1,100 people who came back to the district from different countries in the last two weeks. “Our SHOs, along with tahsildars and medical officers are visiting them to know their current health condition. We are creating awareness about the virus in the community and asking them if anyone in the neighbourhood fell sick,” she said. Ms. Sarma said that community watch is necessary and plays a key role to prevent the spread.

Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao has requested Prime Minister Narender Modi to utilise the facilities at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) for testing of samples for COVID-19 cases.

He brought it to the notice of the Prime Minister that the CCMB lab facilities at Hyderabad could be used not only for people of Telangana but also for people from any State. The CCMB was under the purview of the Central government and it carried out research related to life sciences. If the CCMB was permitted to test virus cases, it has capacity to test 1,000 samples at one go, he said.

Mr. Rao spoke in the video conference organised by the Prime Minister on measures to be taken for the control of COVID-19 here on Friday and explained about the steps taken by the Telangana government and made suggestions on measures to be taken by the Centre. He said the State would work along with the Centre in its endeavour to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

He said that passengers from overseas would come to big cities like Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad in huge numbers and they should be thoroughly examined. Special attention should be paid to these cities of high density population and measures taken. As there was a possibility for the coronavirus to spread from those who came from overseas, he appealed to the Prime Minister that all international flights be suspended for some days.

As people across the country were likely to travel by trains, he suggested that screening should be conducted at the railway stations. High sanitation standards be enforced at railway stations and train coaches.

The Chief Minister told the Prime Minister that they had taken measures to prevent mass gathering of people and religious celebrations like Srirama Navami and Jagne Ki Raat were cancelled.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/3l3vnm/article31121459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY21KCR1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/utilise-ccmb-facilities-to-test-samples-for-covid-19-kcr/article31121460.ece
226,2020/03/20,Biometric attendance to be discontinued in power utilities,"Officials instructed to stock up stores and spares at district level

The four power utilities of Telangana have decided to open control stations at zonal and circle levels to channelise their resources to attend to emergencies and to minimise the response time to restore supply in the event of any breakdown in supply.

A high-level meeting of the power utilities chaired by Chairman and Managing Director of TS-Genco and and TS-Transco D. Prabhakar Rao was held here on Friday to discuss and review their preparedness to ensure 24×7 power supply to all categories of consumers during the increasing spread of coronavirus cases. Several senior executives of the power utilities, including CMDs of southern and northern discoms G. Raghuma Reddy and A. Gopal Rao, respectively, also attended the meeting.

To begin with, it has been decided to discontinue biometric attendance at corporate and other offices of the utilities since one of the main sources for the spread of coronavirus is known to be direct contact. Now, the attendance would be registered in the traditional system of signing a register meant for the purpose till further orders. Thermal scanners would be made available at all important offices.

Since the next couple of weeks are considered very crucial to contain the spread of coronavirus, the operations and maintenance department has been told to procure all the required material and spares in advance and keep them available at all district stores. It has been decided to keep all communication channels and wireless sets at important power plants and sub-stations.

It has been decided to restrict visitors to utilities’ offices as much as possible and to encourage consumers to utilise online complaint mechanism. Hand sanitisers and washing facilities would be arranged at all strategic points and all employees have been advised to use masks at their own cost.

In Vidyut Soudha here, canteen would be kept closed from March 23 and all employees have been told to maintain utmost restraint and not to post or forward any unconfirmed news about coronavirus to avoid spread of misinformation.

To minimise the exposure of its staff to the possibility of contracting virus, the meeting has decided to postpone all overhauling and new capital works in all hydro-electric and thermal power plants and take them up only after the situation becomes normal. All generating stations have been instructed to open control rooms headed by the respective Chief Engineers to take care of all unit-side emergencies.

Mr. Prabhakar Rao stated after the meeting that the power utilities were fully geared up to ensure continuous supply of 24×7 power to all categories of consumers by combating the spread of COVID-19. He assured that continuous supply would be maintained throughout the State with all precautionary measures to ensure that the staff of the utilities do not contract the virus.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/biometric-attendance-to-be-discontinued-in-power-utilities/article31121383.ece

229,2020/03/20,Coronavirus | Uttam slams AYUSH for prescribing medicines without scientific evidence,"Ridicules propagation of cow urine to treat Coronavirus

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president and Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy has questioned the rationale behind the Union Ministry for AYUSH distributing corona preventive medicine when the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi also admitted that there was no preventive medicine as of now.

Raising the issue during Question Hour in the Lok Sabha on Friday, Mr. Reddy pointed out that the AYUSH Ministry has issued an advisory prescribing some medicines for treatment of coronavirus and this was in contradiction to the advisory given by the Union Ministry for Health.

Mr. Reddy said based on the advisory note given by AYUSH Ministry, the government of Telangana has set up stalls distributing those medicines, including at the airport. He said 10 to 15 crore people believe in AYUSH and when there is no scientific evidence and no clinical trials, how has the Ministry specifically recommended some medicines.

Speaking about ‘disinformation’ and ‘misinformation’ in the media, Mr. Reddy said a number of persons, particularly of the ruling party, have been giving statements that cow urine and cow dung is useful in treating coronavirus. Some Yoga gurus were also prescribing some herbs. Unforunately this ‘misinformation’ has not been contradicted by anybody in the government.

The TPCC chief also highlighted the absence of a mechanism in the country for testing coronavirus. “As a citizen, if I want to go and test myself for coronavirus, there is no system in the country or procedure now,” he said. Further, he also pointed out that the quarantine facilities where people coming from abroad were being kept were unhygienic.

Union Minister of State for AYUSH Shripad Yesso Naik, in his reply clarified that the medicines were prescribed based on previous experiences and they could only boost respiratory system and increase immunity. “We did not call them medicines for coronavirus,” he clarified. Further, he said there was nothing to fear as the coronavirus was being controlled.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ddsrto/article31092452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18UTTAMKUMARREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/uttam-slams-ayush-for-prescribing-medicines-without-scientific-evidence/article31121186.ece
230,2020/03/20,Don’t question Uttam’s sincerity: Jayaprakash Reddy,"Faults Revanth Reddy for his criticism of TPCC chief

Sangreddy MLA T. Jayaprakash Reddy has said that ‘hurting’ TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy was not good for Telangana Congress and advised the Congress leaders to stay away from criticising him.

Speaking to reporters here, he said Mr. Uttam did not get the top post through some agents but was appointed by AICC chief Sonia Gandhi given his innate strengths, loyalty and his clean image. “If deliberate attempts are made to hurt him or his image or his sincerity is questioned we all will be hurt and its not good for the party,” he said.

Mr. Jayaprakash Reddy was reacting to the comments made by TPCC working president A. Revanth Reddy after his release over the Congress leaders not coming to meet him in the jail. Mr. Revanth Reddy had said that people had questioned why the TPCC chief did not visit him in the jail.

The Sangareddy MLA said it was not easy to function as TPCC head coordinating with leaders but Mr. Uttam Reddy did that. He reminded that the late Chief Minister Y.S. Rajashekara Reddy succeeded only after he took everyone in the party along.

Reacting to the social media campaign against Mr. Uttam Reddy apparently by the supporters of Mr. Revanth Reddy, he said likes on Facebook posts would never translate into votes though they might give some satisfaction.

He also took objection to the call by Mr. Revanth Reddy to stop watching some news channels saying they were against the Congress party. He said Congress believes in media freedom and would never ban a channel.

Mr. Reddy said he would take up with AICC Telangana incharge R.C. Khuntia on giving permission to Mr. Revanth Reddy to ‘expose corruption’ of the TRS rule. “How can they decide without discussing with all the seniors and sitting MLAs,” he asked.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/dont-question-uttams-sincerity-jayaprakash-reddy/article31121141.ece
231,2020/03/20,Coronavirus | Left parties want Telangana govt to declare health emergency,"Favour package on the lines of Kerala

The Communist Party of India and CPI (Marxist) have demanded that the government declare health emergency in the State in the light of spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and announce a package on the lines of Kerala.

They wanted the government to announce a financial package for workers in organised and unorganised sectors as their livelihood was adversely affected because of the spread of the virus. While several countries had announced financial packages to withstand the impact of coronavirus, there was no action initiated in the country or the State in this direction so far.

CPI State secretary Chada Venkat Reddy said the State and Central governments initiated steps to check the spread of the virus and there was need to further intensify and strengthen them. The government should ensure free supply of essentials to workers of organized and unorganized sectors who were losing their earnings because of the spread of coronavirus.

Speaking to reporters here on Friday, Mr. Venkat Reddy urged the State government to take adequate steps to check the spread of the virus and announce a special package. The Kerala government had announced a huge financial package, he recalled stressing the need to safeguard the interests of small and marginal traders who were facing problems on account of coronavirus.

CPI Central Council member and former MP Azeez Pasha said steps should be taken to create awareness among the people on the ill effects of the virus. Steps should also be taken to set up more number of testing centres to meet the increasing demand while the isolation centres should be equipped with all facilities to effectively treat the patients.

CPI (M) State secretariat member B. Venkat wondered why Prime Minister Narendra Modi who gave a call for Janata Curfew on Sunday did not take steps to supply masks and sanitisers free of cost to the people. He lamented that workers were being terminated from the companies in the name of coronavirus and the government should take steps to ensure that they were provided with the essentials at least for the next one month.

In addition, steps should be taken to ensure adequate stocks of essentials in the fair price shops under the public distribution network so as not to give scope for enhancement of prices by vested interests. The CPI (M), he said, deferred its door-to-door campaign to create awareness on the ill effects of the CAA, NPR and NRC slated from March 23 in view of the widespread coronavirus.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/tqlix3/article31121119.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY21CPI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/left-parties-want-govt-to-declare-health-emergency/article31121121.ece

234,2020/03/20,Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao puts off visit Karimnagar,"The visit would obstruct ongoing work in the field, the Chief Minister felt

The proposed visit of Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao to Karimnagar on Saturday has been postponed.

The Chief Minister who rescheduled his visit to Karimnagar city has decided to postpone the visit as it could obstruct the work undertaken by different departments to ensure that there was no scope for spread of the virus. The Chief Minister planned to visit Karimnagar on Friday, but deferred the programme because of the video conference convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with chief ministers and health ministers of all States.

The district administration had initiated a series of measures to prevent the spread of the virus after it was revealed that some people who came from Indonesia to Karimnagar have tested positive for the virus.

The Chief Minister himself is personally monitoring the situation from time-to-time giving necessary suggestions to the administration which gave good results. Except for those who came from Indonesia, none was tested positive so far in Karimnagar. In this background, the Chief Minister, accompanied by a high level team of officials, has decided to visit the city on Saturday to get first hand information about the measures taken to check the spread of the virus.

Nirmal district is among the high risk places in terms of spread of COVID-19 owing to a large number of people from the district living abroad. But it has been made safe thanks to monitoring people coming from overseas.

There were as many as 585 people who had returned from abroad to various places in the district in the recent past and were under surveillance, according to district Collector Md. Musharraf Ali Faruqui.

Precautions and preparedness

The Collector and Superintendent of Police C. Shashidhar Raju addressed a press conference on the preparedness of the district in tackling the COVID-19 scare.

Parley with religious elders

Mr. Faruqui and Mr. Raju later held a meeting with elders of various religious groups and impressed upon them the need to curtail upcoming religious functions. They also appealed to owners of function halls to restrict assemblage at weddings to below the 200 mark.

238,2020/03/20,SHGs race against time to stitch masks,"KMC initiative to distribute masks to sanitation workers, health functionaries

Around 150 women, who are members of the town-based urban women self-help groups (SHGs), are racing against time to stitch a little over 45,000 cloth masks in the next few days to supply them to the Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC).

The KMC has placed an order for production of nearly 60,000 cloth masks with these women SHGs, to be distributed to sanitation workers, health functionaries and others free of cost, sources said.

Task to MEPMA

The civic body has entrusted the task of supervising the work to the officials of the Mission for Elimination of Poverty in Municipal Areas (MEPMA), three days ago.

The move was necessitated to overcome the shortage of masks and augment their supply to the key front-line field level functionaries of the sanitation wing of Khammam Municipal Corporation, Health, Panchayat Raj and other allied government departments, in the wake of COVID-19 threat.

Members of as many as 10 women SHGs had already produced nearly 15,000 cloth masks in the last two days at different centres set up for this purpose under the aegis of the MEPMA officials, sources said.

Handy expertise

Several of them are well-trained tailors and their expertise is proving to be handy for other members to expeditiously execute the task, said MEPMA district mission coordinator Sujatha.

With the support of the slum-level federations, nearly 150 members of as many as 10 women SHGs are working in a coordinated manner to complete the stipulated task and handover the remaining 45,000 cloth masks to the KMC in the next few days, she said.

Secunderabad station’s two main platforms -- one and 10 -- have been equipped with thermal scanners to randomly check passengers arriving at the premier station to get onto the trains for their onward journeys, to arrest the spread of COVID-19 from Thursday onwards.

General Manager Gajannan Mallya held discussions with the top department heads at the Rail Nilayam to discuss further measures to control the contagion, and following directions received from the Railway Board, it was decided to cancel 42 trains till the month end on various days due to low occupancy.

“Trains are cancelled keeping in view the availability of alternate trains for passengers and ensuring that no passenger remains stranded. Full refund is being given to all the passengers whose train has been cancelled,” informed railway officials.

It was also decided to stop providing concession on both reserved and unreserved railway tickets for senior citizens from March 20 to dissuade them from travelling because those above age of 60 are considered to be more vulnerable to the corona virus as per the World Health Organisation (WHO).

No cancellation charges are to be levied on tickets purchased before Friday and in case of any travel, the difference in the fare - full fare minus the concessional fare, is to be collected online or in the train from the senior citizens, said chief PRO Ch. Rakesh.

Railway authorities also appealed to the passengers to avoid non-essential train journeys and to ensure that they do not have running fever while they are commencing the journey. And, at any point of journey if a passenger feels that he or she is having fever, the railway staff can be contacted for medical attention and further assistance. The staff on its own will not disembark any passenger despite any visible signs of sickness in view of the sensitivities involved, he said.

242,2020/03/20,"With social distancing now the norm, this Delhi artist is taking her work to social media","House of sparrows

With public areas shutting down in the wake of the Coronavirus spread, and people staying home, artists are using social media like they would a gallery space. There are the stills being streamed of course, but also short yet informative videos, with an emphasis on educating people about the artworks.

Today, on World Sparrow Day, Rupa Samaria, a sparrow lover who operates from her Shahpur Jat studio, will showcase her acrylic-on-canvas paintings on Instagram (@rupasamaria) and a short film on Facebook (look for A Bird Call).

“Today’s generation may not be as familiar with the house sparrow, fondly called chidiya by Delhi-wallahs who grew up in 1970s and 1980s. Sadly, with rapid urbanization, these tiny house guests have vanished from our lives. The sparrow is not just a bird but a sentiment attached to the place we call home. To recreate this sentiment, I am showcasing five of my best sparrows on social media,” says Rupa. Her paintings have touch sensors that play the bird sound via a tiny speaker, which she will demonstrate online.

Rupa Samaria

With a heavy heart, Rupa cancelled her second solo show, A Bird Call, to take place at the Visual Arts Gallery of India Habitat Centre hours after the Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s announcement that no social event with more than 50 people would be allowed.

Female and male sparrows

Rupa feels that people can forge a connection with her paintings as they have been inspired from real life experience of watching house sparrows building nests on fans of her home at Patna’s Boring Canal Road. When she moved to Delhi in 1993, wondering what the new city would have in store for her, she was pleasantly surprised when she was greeted by sparrows in the morning hours. “Those days I was at Greater Kailash. This hide and seek with sparrows continued for 10 years.”

The bird was declared Delhi’s state bird in 2012 by then Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit.

Her interest in birds was kindled when, as a teacher at the American Embassy School in Delhi, she accompanied students of Class V to Ranthambore for four years in a row. She took a number of photographs during these trips. This exposure drove her to bring alive birds on canvas.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/16j421/article31118132.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thumbnailHouse-sparrow-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/house-of-sparrows/article31118135.ece
243,2020/03/20,Abijit Ganguly on his life as a comedian,"The funnyman talks about his journey in the comedy circuit, why he loves travelling and how he keeps trolls at bay

The spotlight, stage, mic and the laughter have fuelled him, says comedian Abijit Ganguly. “Being on the stage in front of so many people gives you a kind of adrenalin rush that is hard to explain. I love being able to make people laugh,” says the man who has been in this job for over a decade.

The Mumbai-based comedian, Abijit recently performed at Hotel Novotel. “I have performed in the city twice before this. Once at the Naval base and almost six years ago at The Park. Unfortunately, I have never had enough time to explore the city. All I have seen in the city is RK Beach,” he says.

An economics graduate, Abijit was doing his masters at Delhi School of Economics when he was introduced to stand up comedy. “I used to attend a lot of theatre at the India Habitat Centre, one day I accidentally saw the performance of Abish Mathew and I was blown away. I enjoyed the show so much that I mailed the organiser of the show asking if I could try my luck at it. Surprisingly, he wrote back inviting me for an open mic, and that is how the journey began,” he says.

But back then comedy as a profession seemed like a distant dream. “Though I started performing regularly at open mics, I still took up a corporate job after my education. It was only when the money from the gigs matched my salary did I let go of the job.”

With over four lakh YouTube subscribers, each of his videos has at least two million views.

“Observational comedy has been my forte. Everything that I see around me influences my acts especially travel as I get to met new people and understand new cultures. However, I never limit myself to it, my acts do have some political or religious jokes,” says the comedian from Delhi who now lives in Mumbai .

While the internet has helped him to reach out to millions , it has also made him vulnerable to criticism and trolling.

“It is a wrong assumption that people will troll you only for off-limit topics. They troll you even for silly things like airport or school jokes. I have developed a thick skin and no longer care about the comments. I would rather take it seriously if a person comes to me after a live show and says he or she found something offensive, but that rarely happens. The anonymity on the internet has given people the power to speak rubbish I do not pay heed to them.”

Abijit is currently touring with his show called Millennial Couples which humorously highlights the differences between marriage then and now. “I got married almost two years ago, so most of the content comes from what my wife and I have experienced. The act talks about our trouble dealing with relatives who keep asking us to have kids or the way social media has changed the dynamics between a couple. It is hilarious how so many people find it relatable,” he says.

Though he has travelled a long way from the open mics in small cafés, Abijit says there is a lot more he has to do.

“Getting famous is just the first step. Once you have established yourself there is the constant urge to keep getting better . If I should look back at a video I uploaded three years ago and do not feel I need to improve on it, then I am not honing my skills. And the day you stop getting better at your art is the day you have lost it,” he says.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/b3vzui/article31116675.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Abijit,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/abijit-ganguly-on-his-life-as-a-comedian/article31116676.ece

The financial assistance is not for NRIs or people who have been working or studying for a substantial period of time and have houses or hostels to stay in.

“We will be notifying an email ID tomorrow (Saturday) for Assamese people stranded because of shutdown of communication due to the pandemic. We will transfer $2,000 to their accounts if they went abroad in the last 30 days according to the date of stamping in their passports,” Assam’s Finance and Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Friday.

“This is for tourists and people who went for training, workshops or seminars and short-term assignments and not for those who have been living abroad permanently or for more than 30 days. If they remain stranded for a longer period of time, we will deal with the situation accordingly,” he said.

Mr Sarma also said the State government will help the stranded people if their visa or passport expires. “We will take up such cases with the embassy concerned,” he added.

Hand-stamping

The Finance Minister said all passengers arriving at airports, railway stations and bus stations across the State from outside would be stamped on the hand from March 22. The stamp on the hand of such incoming passengers will read: “Assam needs social distancing. I volunteer to be home quarantined up to...”

He justified the move as a necessity so that people who might be symptomatic do not spread the virus.

Other measures include instructions to railways and operators of public and private commercial vehicles to carry as many passengers as there are seats. “Buses violating this rule will be confiscated,” he said.

Markets under watch

Mr Sarma also said that municipal officials have been asked to assess the major markets and shopping malls so that they do not accommodate more than a specified number of people calculated on the basis of floor space.

“Shopkeepers and traders have been asked to decide the number of people they can entertain at a time and provide them soap or sanitiser before dealing with them. If not, we will be forced to close their establishments,” he said.

Till date, 79,378 people have been screened at airports and railway and bus stations in Assam, all of whom have tested negative for COVID-19 at four special labs across the State. Besides, 41 people have been kept in isolation wards of hospitals while 1,003 were advised home quarantine. Of these 1003 people, 164 have come out of quarantine after 28 days at home.

“We hope people will cooperate with all the measures being undertaken for their own good. From tomorrow (Saturday), 50% of government employees will be attending office on rotation. This will not apply to health, electricity, water supply and other essential services,” Mr. Sarma said.

The shutdown order of educational institutions, gyms, beauty parlours, libraries, museums and other public facilities that attract large crowds is in place till March 31.

The Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha has called for a special session at 2 p.m. on March 20 to conduct a floor test in line with the Supreme Court order for the Congress-led government to prove its majority.

The business of the House, confined to a single agenda, was declared post-midnight, after Leader of the Opposition Gopal Bhargava reached the Assembly in the midst of uncertainty over the test despite the order. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Kamal Nath announced he will hold a press conference at his residence at noon.

In the order, the Supreme Court directed that the Assembly be convened on March 20 to hold a floor test before 5 p.m. to assess whether the Kamal Nath government continued to enjoy the confidence of the House. On Monday, the Speaker adjourned the Budget session to March 26 in view of the novel coronavirus threat, which the BJP saw as an excuse to put off a vote.

The order has prescribed voting by show of hands during the proceeding that must be videographed. While the Congress has issued a whip to its MLAs to vote in favour of the government during the test, the BJP directed its MLAs to do otherwise.

Terming the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR) as absurd and unconstitutional, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday said half of Punjab, including himself, could not produce birth certificates to prove their Indianness.

Pointing out that most people in Punjab came from Pakistan, Captain Amarinder asked if the Centre expected them to go to Pakistan to look for proof of birth.

“Even I don’t have a birth certificate. These things did not exist when I was born,” said the Chief Minister, quipping that this would make him too a “doubtful character” under the government of India’s new census system.

Speaking at an event here, he made it clear that his government was totally opposed to these exercises. He said while a routine census would be conducted in Punjab, it would not be based on religion, caste and creed.

“It is not a time to do business and not follow rules. It is a time to help each other,” Ms. Banerjeee said during a meeting at the State Secretariat.

Currently, only one coronavirus infection has been reported in the West Bengal.

More beds

While the Chief Minister applauded the work of the State’s primary referral hospital, the Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General Hospital (ID&BGH), she said it was necessary to reduce the pressure on the facility. Over the past few days, patients who have arrived from abroad have queued up at the ID&BGH, causing a lot of rush there.

“There are 22 beds there. We will have to increase it to 100. At the Bangur Hospital, there is a new building. 150 beds can be arranged there. But the entrance of the hospital should not be same as the main hospital,” the CM said.

The Chief Minister also advised that another 50 beds be provided at a building at the R. G. Kar Medical College and Hospital, which is serving as night shelter. She assured those present at the meeting that the State government has made necessary arrangements.

“We have started a ₹200 crore fund. Let it be set up as a fund where private sector [entities] who want to help can help share the cost to solve the problem. If the corporate sector can sponsor equipment, it will help humanity,” she added.

When the issue of demand for masks was brought up, the CM said that people could not be denied: “Please give mask to whoever wants. Let’s not do this [deny masks]. Give them masks. Order 4 lakh more if required.”

A Cabinet sub-committee to decide the fate of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) in Maharashtra will visit Bihar and Tamil Nadu to study how the provisions can be implemented “in its 2010 form” with one amendment.

The committee, headed by State Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab, held its first meeting on Thursday and decided that Maharashtra must reject the latest NPR amendments, including those related to the contentious clause related to ‘date and place of parents’ birth’. Maharashtra is willing to implement the NRC/NPR if the clause is dropped like in Bihar and Tamil Nadu, committee members believed.

The two States were among the first to pass resolutions not to implement NRC, and said the NPR should be implemented “in its 2010 form” with one amendment. “We want to study their model and will soon visit these States. Once the visit is complete, we will submit our report to the Chief Minister, who will decide what stand Maharashtra has to take,” said a senior State minister.

263,2020/03/20,All international travellers arriving at Pune airport to be quarantined,"Bus services cut by 50%; number of commuters falls from 12 lakh to 4.84 lakh

The Pune district administration on Thursday announced a 24-hour compulsory ‘institutional quarantine’ for all international travellers disembarking at Pune Airport.

Pune Divisional Commissioner Dr. Deepak Mhaisekar said all elective surgeries that could wait for the time being were being postponed thus giving medical staff more time to focus on tackling the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

“Henceforth, all passengers disembarking at Pune airport would be sent straight to an institutional quarantine facility. We will also start screening at certain points in different railway stations either tonight or tomorrow morning to make sure that we have not skipped screening anyone landing at the airport who should decide to travel by rail,” said Dr. Mhaisekar, adding that the number of flights landing at Pune airport had reduced from 110 to 67.

Earlier, only those international passengers who arrived at the airport and were found with symptoms were sent to Naidu Hospital. The administration was looking at increasing their quarantine facilities across the district to accommodate 10,000 persons either suspected or who had tested positive for COVID-19.

On the question of postponement of elective surgeries, he said the decision had been taken following a meeting of doctors and that there was no blanket ban on this from the administration’s point of view.

“We are making it clear, in case of postponement of an elective surgery, the decision would completely rest with the doctor depending on the patient-doctor relationship. We have not put any ban in this regard,” he stressed.

Shops to shut

Meanwhile, the Federation of Trader Associations of Pune (FTAP), which has nearly 40,000 shops under its umbrella, has called for a shut down until further directives from the district administration.

This means that barring essential commodities like foodgrains, vegetables and medicines, all other shops including jewellery, apparel, automobiles, stationery across the city are to remain closed.

The FTAP had earlier called for a three-day shutdown on March 16. Today, after reviewing the situation and considering the gravity of the crisis, its representatives have decided to extend the duration of the shutdown with a view to preclude mass gatherings in shops.

A number of areas in Pune city wore a deserted look following the District Collector’s order of Wednesday issued under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and the Epidemic Act 1897 banning the assembly of five or persons in public as well as private places, including work spaces.

District Collector Naval Kishore Ram said that all restaurants and hotels, too, would be closedwith the aim of discouraging assembly. However, there would be no stoppage of online food services.

Following the Pune district administration’s order urging all the private firms involved in non-essential services to facilitate ‘work from home’ for their employees, the city police on Thursday visited offices in the major IT hubs at Hinjewadi and Magarpatta city to ensure that this was being adhered to.

“While 25,000 personnel are seen on an average on a given day at Phase 1 of the Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park, today only 1,400 were present. We are trying to reduce even these numbers by exhorting IT firms to permit their employees to work from home,” said an official from the Hinjewadi Police Station.

The Pimpri-Chinchwad police registered FIRs against 16 shop owners for not keeping shops closed as per the administration’s order.

Meanwhile, Dr. Mhaisekar said that the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML) had cut down its bus services by 50% in a bid to enforce social distancing and discourage commute.

“As a result, the number of commuters using public transport has come down from12 lakh to 4.84 lakh. We expect the numbers to go down further in the coming days. This gradual process will be on to restrict movement within the city,” said Dr. Mhaisekar.

Stressing that there was no shortage of masks in Pune, he said that 43,980 homes had been surveyed till date with more than 1.74 lakh persons screened for signs of the virus of which 10 persons had been referred to Naidu Hospital.

264,2020/03/20,"Maharashtra may release 5,000 prisoners to reduce congestion","Government affidavit in SC says jail inmates may be released on temporary bail or medical furlough

In an unprecedented move, the State Government will facilitate the release of thousands of inmates from the State’s overcrowded jails as the number of COVID-19 cases rises in Maharashtra.

In an affidavit before the Supreme Court (SC), the State Home Department has suggested a proposal to release over 5,000 inmates on temporary bail or medical furlough as one of the several measures to reduce congestion in jails.

The recommendation says those facing a jail term of three to five years for petty crimes may be released on bail while medical furlough be given to first-time, low-risk, non-violent, and bailable offenders. The government response was filed as part of the affidavit submitted to the SC on Thursday.

Senior officials hope the numbers will bring down congestion by about 15%, from the current 36,000.

The population of inmates is nearly 50% higher than the actual capacity in almost 60 jails in the State. The temporary release will bring down the numbers closer to the capacity of 24,000 inmates, officials said. “We expect the congestion to come down between 15% and 20% if such a move is implemented. The SC can facilitate this by way of a decree or order and the States can follow suit depending on the congestion in prisons. We are prepared,” said a senior official.

The SC had last week asked chief secretaries of all States to respond by March 20 on measures against overcrowding in prisons following the COVID-19 outbreak. The court will take up the matter again on March 23.

Maharashtra has already started measures to curb congestion and prevent a coronavirus outbreak in jails. It has moved a number of inmates from the overcrowded Arthur Road Jail to Taloja prison in Navi Mumbai. One ward in Taloja has several barracks of 50 prisoners in each while the ward populations often add up to 500, officials said. “We have also started screening and regular cleaning of the prison in the wake of the outbreak,” said an official.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wj4bki/article31113058.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BMARTHURROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-may-release-5000-prisoners-to-reduce-congestion/article31113060.ece

The Maharashtra Home Department has directed the police to take action against those found fleeing quarantine and isolation measures for COVID-19. This move comes on a day Western Railway (WR) deboarded 17 passengers from three separate trains. All had been asked to remain in home quarantine on their arrival in India.

Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the police have been directed to initiate action against such people under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897.

“Following repeated instances of people fleeing quarantine/isolation, the Home Ministry is compelled to ask the Maharashtra Police to act against such offenders endangering themselves and everyone else, under the Epidemic Diseases Act,” he said.

Senior officials said those being booked for violation will be charged under Section 2(3) of the Act, which says any person disobeying any regulation or order made under the Act shall be deemed to have committed an offence punishable under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860). The section deals with disobedience of an order promulgated by public servants, and carries a jail term of up to six months and a fine of up to ₹200.

“The Act also provides protection, since no person faces a suit or other legal proceedings for anything done in good faith,” said an official. The State has reported multiple cases of patients and those suspected to be infected with the coronavirus fleeing facilities or flouting directives to self-quarantine.

266,2020/03/20,"‘Denial of bail to Navlakha, Teltumbde alarming’","Case based on thin evidence, say human rights activists

Several prominent city-based organisations fighting for human rights and civil liberties called the recent Supreme Court verdict denying anticipatory bail to noted activists Anand Teltumbde and Gautam Navlakha “alarming”.

A statement released Mumbai Rises to Save Democracy (MRSD), an umbrella collective of over 40 groups and organisations in the city, said that it was deeply disappointed with the SC’s rejection of the plea, which had also been rejected by the Bombay High Court.

Nine other activists and intellectuals who have been accused in this case and charged with sections of the draconian Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) have been imprisoned since 2018.

“The top court’s order to deny interim bail is alarming given that the case against the activists is based on very thin evidence,” the statement said, adding that the government was sparing few chances for truth to emerge in this case.

“While full-blown attempts are being made by the government to incriminate the eleven intellectuals in a fabricated case, the investigation into the role of Hindutva brigade led by Milind Ekbote and Manohar Bhide in carrying out planned organised attacks on Dalits at Bhima Koregaon has come to a standstill. The Sstate government’s failure to set up a SIT shows that the real perpetrators of violence are being shielded from prosecution,” the statement said.

In January 2020, the case was transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) even as the newly-formed Maha Vikas Aghadi government announced a review of the case and the setting up of a Special Investigating Team (SIT).

“These developments in the case and now the rejection of pre-arrest bail to two of the stalwarts of the democratic rights movement in the country on the grounds of what is not just flimsy but manipulated evidence shows the desperation of the government to repress democratic voices and spread a sense of fear amongst those who oppose the anti-people policies and actions of the Hindutva Fascist regime. MRSD extends its solidarity to the eleven activists who have been relentless defenders of human rights and people’s movements in this country and who now stand wrongly accused in this conspiracy case,” the statement said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/2hkq1h/article31113012.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BMNAVLAKHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/denial-of-bail-to-navlakha-teltumbde-alarming/article31113013.ece

The Odisha government has shut down the Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri for devotees from Friday till April 1— a rare event in the hundreds of years of the temple’s history.

“The Puri district administration has restricted access of general public to Jagannath temple from tomorrow [Friday]. In this spirit, the State government has instructed religious institutions, including temples, mosques and churches, to enforce similar restrictions,” said Subroto Bagchi, chief spokesperson for Odisha’s fight against COVID-19, on Thursday.

Mr. Bagchi said essential rituals of all religious institutions would continue as usual.

For the past few days, the Puri district administration has been trying to restrict the entry of tourists to Puri by vacating places of tourist interest.

The government has suspended all examinations, and evaluation of papers of the already held examinations, indefinitely.

Samples tested

As of now, 61 blood and swab samples have been tested, of which 60 were found to be negative. As many as 23 persons who may be infected are under observation in various hospitals.

Shifting its focus from urban areas to rural pockets, the Odisha government is holding emergency meetings at the gram panchayat level. Currently, 2.37 lakh members of 6,798 gram panchayats have been sensitised, and 7,176 temporary medical camps have been established.

According to the State government, 3,183 isolation beds, including over 2,150 beds in Cuttack, have been created in the State. As many as 94 hotels having quarantine facilities for coronavirus-affected patients have been identified.

The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation on Wednesday came out with a list of three hotels that were offering rooms for quarantine on payment. More such hotels would be identified, officials said.

Work from home

Group C and D category government employees have been asked to work from home on rotational basis. Departmental heads are taking a call on deploying employees based on requirement. The government is also allowing employees to take 14 days leave if they show symptoms of flu.

Three people tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday taking the total number of positive cases in the State to 48. The patients include a 22-year-old woman from Mumbai with a travel history to London, a 47-year-old woman from Ulhasnagar with a travel history to Dubai, and a 51-year-old man from Ahmednagar with a travel history to Dubai.

According to civic health officer Dr. Daksha Shah, the woman from T ward had returned to Mumbai on March 15 and had walked into Kasturba Hospital when she developed symptoms. “She was admitted for testing on Wednesday and the results came positive,” said Dr. Shah. The Ulhasnagar woman returned to Mumbai on March 4 and was admitted on Tuesday.

Two critical

“We are constantly monitoring their condition. Both have many co-morbid conditions,” said Dr. Keskar adding that the remaining patients are stable. The two who are critical include a 59-year-old Islamic scholar from the Philippines and a 37-year-old man from Kalyan who had a travel history to the U.S. The Islamic scholar had travelled along with nine others to India. Two more from his group have tested positive but are stable. The Kalyan man’s wife and three-year-old daughter have also tested positive and are admitted at Kasturba Hospital. “Private hospitals in the city have now activated their isolation beds.

269,2020/03/20,OHRC recommends ₹15 lakh relief to apprentice who lost an arm,"A clear case of negligence on the part of employees of the utility, says rights panel

The Odisha Human Rights Commission recommended a compensation of ₹15 lakh to a youth who lost an arm after suffering an electric shock during his apprenticeship in the North Eastern Electricity Supply Company of Odisha Limited (NESCO).

Pabitra Kumar Barik was doing some repair work on an 11-KV feeder at Dhamnagar sub-station on April 13, 2015, when a high-voltage electric shock led to the amputation of his right arm.

Company’s contention

The victim moved the OHRC seeking compensation. During the hearing, the NESCO authorities said since the victim was engaged as an apprentice, he was supposed to observe the maintenance and electrical work and never authorised to do the repairing work. “The victim, on his own, climbed up the pole and interfered with the live-line as a result which the electrical accident occurred,” they argued.

The OHRC, however, rejected the company’s argument saying he was pressured to take up the repair work by a line man. “The commission is of the considered view that the victim as an apprentice trainee was not supposed to attend to the repairing work. But he was pressured by one line man to take up the repair work by climbing one electric pole. Therefore, merely on the basis of the fact that he was not supposed to attend to the repairing work and yet he took it up, it cannot be concluded that the victim had contributed to anything that led to the accident,” OHRC member Asim Amitabh Dash said.

“The electrocution occurred due to the charging of 11-KV feeder while the victim’s work was going on. Thus it is a clear case of negligence on the part of the employees of the NESCO utility... the employee is vicariously liable for any damages caused on account of negligence,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ohrc-recommends-15-lakh-relief-to-apprentice-who-lost-an-arm/article31112963.ece
270,2020/03/20,Sharp fall in Kolkata Metro traffic,"Average weekday ridership drops from 6 lakh to to 4.6 lakh, the lowest ever

The Kolkata Metro on Wednesday registered its highest-ever drop in daily ridership in its more than three-decade history as the COVID-19 global pandemic and ensuing government advisories on social distancing forced more people to avoid public transport. Data indicate that 4.6 lakh commuters used the metro on Wednesday against an average weekday traffic of six lakh passengers, a decline of about 1.4 lakh.

“We have never witnessed such a drop in passengers,” Chief Public Relations Officer of Kolkata Metro Indrani Banerjee told The Hindu. “The drop in passengers is almost over a lakh to the average number of people commuting on a weekday,” she said, adding that the decline was clearly a result of concerns over the spread of the coronavirus infection, which was forcing more and more people to stay indoors.

Fall in revenue

As a result of the drop in the number of passengers the Kolkata Metro has suffered a loss in daily revenue, running into lakhs of rupees. While on an average weekday the Kolkata Metro earns a revenue of about ₹85 lakh, on Wednesday the figure fell to around ₹60 lakh.

On February 3, the underground commuter railway network had registered a record number of passengers when as many as 6.33 lakh commuters used the service helping the Kolkata Metro earn ₹1 crore in a day.

One of the primary modes of transport in the city, the Kolkata Metro was the country’s first metro railway system when it started operations in 1984. It now connects Noapara near Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Airport to Kavi Subhash Metro station near Garia, on the North-South axis of Kolkata over a length of 27.2 km.

Addressing the people through social media, Mr. Thackeray said Indians who are returning from countries like Singapore will have to be careful. “There are people stranded in places like Singapore with whom I have spoken. These are our people. Appropriate steps will be taken for their return but at the same time they have to be careful when they arrive. A special quarantine facility will be provided to them. The government has set up isolation wards as well,” he said. He appealed to people to follow all government instructions thoroughly. “Please avoid trains and buses. We can close down public transport whenever we want. But the government does not want to ban anything. We want people to follow instructions given by us. Just follow what China did. Together we will defeat this virus,” he said.

‘A different war’

“This is a different type of war being fought the world over. This is a war against a virus and cooperation of every individual is of utmost importance. The government machinery is working on a war footing for people. All we are telling you is, stay inside, do not venture out unnecessarily,” said Mr. Thackeray.

Mr. Thackeray acknowledged that crowds on the streets and in offices have reduced significantly. “But cases of positive patients are growing. These are the cases of those who have come from outside. They have to be more careful,” he said.

The CM said he spoke with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan.

Ms. Banerjee suggested another 50 beds be provided at a building at the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, which is serving as a night shelter. She assured those present at the meeting that her government has made all necessary arrangements.

“We have ordered 300 ventilator machines, of which 70 have been delive-red. We have ordered 2 lakh masks and 30,000 gloves,” the Chief Minister said. During the meeting, several representatives of private health facilities and government bodies complained about shortage of protective gear. Ms. Banerjee said the State’s Chief Secretary had assured they would be delivered.

“We have started a ₹200 crore fund. Let it be set up as a fund where private sector [entities] which want to help can share the cost to solve the problem. If the corporate sector can sponsor equipment, it will help humanity,” she added.

When the issue of demand for masks was brought up, the CM said that people could not be denied: “Please give mask to whoever wants. Let’s not do this [deny masks]. Give them masks. Order 4 lakh more if required.”

Ms. Banerjee added that essential supplies should not be hoarded, and assured that markets and other essential services would continue functioning in the coming days.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dcql1k/article31112736.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE20PG4-2-COL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bengal-government-ropes-in-private-hospitals-to-tackle-covid-19-crisis/article31112737.ece
273,2020/03/20,Rajasthan wakes up to life in the slow lane,"Normal life disrupted with prohibitory orders imposed in State; fear of lockdown triggers panic buying

The prohibitory orders imposed in entire Rajasthan after the detection of three fresh COVID-19 positive cases in Jhunjhunu disrupted normal life in several parts of the State on Thursday, with the roads and markets wearing a deserted look, public and private functions being called off and people mostly staying indoors.

Residents of Jhunjhunu town, where curfew was clamped in a one-km radius area around the infected family’s house for two days, were in a state of shock. Jhunjhunu Collector U.D. Khan said about 350 teams of the Medical & Health Department had started an intense surveillance in three zones to trace those who came in contact with the COVID-19-positive couple and their daughter. “The screening of the entire population will be done to ensure that no positive cluster is formed in the town,” said Mr. Khan. About 20 persons whom the family had met during the last 10 days after their arrival from Italy were shifted to a special isolation ward at a medical facility in Churela village, situated 16 km away from the district headquarters.

The prohibitory orders imposed under Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code as a medical emergency, disallowing the assembly of 20 or more persons at public places, led to panic buying of essential items by people in Jaipur, who fear a complete lockdown in the days to come. Pappu Meena, handling the counter at Taza Phal Sabzi Bhandar in Jaipur's Jawahar Nagar locality, said buyers were stockpiling vegetables and fruits because of uncertainty. “I feel there is no need to panic because the supplies are unhindered, but Section 144 has instilled an apprehension among the people,” he said.

Rumours hit business

Arif Ali, a shopkeeper selling fish and chicken in the nearby Gole Market, said people were eating lesser quantity of non-vegetarian food after a rumour spread about infection in meat, which had also reduced consumption in hotels. “Prohibitory orders or no orders, we are in the market to sell our goods. Why should people panic?”

The tourism and hospitality industry in the desert State, which came to a grinding halt after the outbreak of COVID-19 was reported, is set to get the shock of prohibitory orders with the closure of all tourist places and historical monuments. Ramakant Saini, a security guard outside Pink Square Mall, said the government’s decision to curtail movements would lead to loss of livelihood for thousands of poor people in the city.

As the educational institutions were already closed and the Rajasthan University and the State Board of Secondary Education postponed their examinations till March 31, several colleges switched to the online mode of education. “We submitted our projects online for assessment today. In the normal course, our submissions are thoroughly scrutinised by the faculty in the class interactions,” said Daksh Mathur, a student of Aayojan School of Architecture.

R.S. Khangarot, principal of Agrawal Post-Graduate College, said though the teaching activities and exams had been suspended, the institution was open for routine administrative work and faculty members were attending the college for planning of the next academic session. “Section 144 is not applicable inside the college,” he remarked when asked about prohibitory orders.

The Rajasthan Tent Dealers Kiraya Vyavasaya Samiti has decided to get an undertaking from those booking the tents for their events that they will not invite more than 50 guests. Samiti president Ravi Jindal said a large number of bookings had been cancelled either by the customers themselves or on the request of dealers.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/k4n37w/article31112718.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE20JAIPURROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rajasthan-wakes-up-to-life-in-the-slow-lane/article31112719.ece
274,2020/03/20,Madhya Pradesh Speaker accepts resignation of 16 rebel Congress MLAs,"The effective strength of the House comes down to 206. The Congress-led government will require the trust vote of 104 to survive

Late night on Thursday, Speaker N.P. Prajapati accepted the resignation of 16 rebel Congress MLAs who are staying in Bengaluru.

With this, the effective strength of the House comes down to 206. The Congress-led government will require the trust vote of 104 to survive.

The development comes hours after the Supreme Court directed to hold a floor test in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly by 5 p.m. on Friday.

“I have accepted the resignation of the 16 MLAs who have filed petition in the Supreme Court. Based on what they have stated there, I am accepting resignation of these 16 MLAs also,” Mr. Prajapati told reporters.

Meanwhile, the BJP issued a whip to its MLAs to vote against the government in the floor test.

“Even I don’t have a birth certificate. These things did not exist when I was born,” said the Chief Minister, quipping that this would make him too a ‘doubtful character’ under the Government of India’s new census system.

Speaking at an event here, he made it clear that his government was totally opposed to these exercises.

277,2020/03/20,COVID-19 scare: 4.2 lakh train tickets cancelled in Punjab,"Many trains cancelled because of low occupancy

Amid the COVID-19 scare, the Ferozepur Division of Northern Railway has seen as many as 4.2 lakh passengers cancelling their reservation in the month of March, up almost double as against the corresponding period last year.

“During the month of March this year, 4.2 lakh passengers cancelled their reservations leading to refund of about ₹26 crore. Whereas for the same period in the year 2019, as many as 2.1 lakh passengers had opted for cancellation and the refund was about ₹14 crore on Firozpur Division,” Ferozepur Division DRM Rajeash Agarwal told The Hindu on Thursday.

“Practically it is double last year’s figure. It’s an indication of cooperation of our passengers in the national effort of containing the spread of COVID-19 virus,” he said.

Also, due to falling occupancy, the Ferozepur Division has suspended services of several trains from March 18 to April 1.

Mr. Agarwal said that there has been a considerable drop in occupancy and keeping that in mind it was decided to cancel a few trains. “Where the vacancy is more than 70%, we have suspended services of those trains,” he said.

Mr. Agarwal added that based on advisory issued by the Centre to avoid unnecessary travel, occupancy of some of trains have come down.

“Also in order to avoid unnecessary exposure to staff and make optimum use of cleaning resources, the train services have been suspended,” he said.

The cancelled trains included — Delhi Sarai Rohilla and Pathankot (from March 18 to March 30); New Delhi to Ferozepur Cantt and Ferozepur to New Delhi (from March 20 to March 29); and Jabalpur to Atari (from March 21 to March 28); Attari-Jabalpur (from March 22 and 29); Jabalpur-Attari weekly express (from March 24 to 31); Attari-Jabalpur weekly express (from March 25 and April 1).

278,2020/03/20,"Doctors warn of stir if masks, gear not provided","AMU’s hospital is a testing centre for COVID-19; front-line staff exposed, says RDA

Resident doctors at the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital (JNMCH) of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) have threatened to go on strike from Friday if the administration does not urgently provide N95 masks and other personal protective equipment to the front-line workers amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

“We are working with inadequate safety accessories and the number of patients in the outpatient department is growing,” said Hamza Malik, president of Resident Doctors’ Association, JNMCH. “We requested the university authorities last week to provide us N95 masks but we have been told they are out of stock. The ordinary surgical mask is not secure in case of testing a person who may be infected with the COVID-19,” Dr. Malik added.

JNMCH is one of the sample collection and testing centres for COVID-19 in Uttar Pradesh. “We have received 35 samples so far. Thirty-four have been found negative and one from Agra was found positive and was sent to King George’s Medical College, Lucknow,” Dr. Malik told The Hindu.

‘Anxiety increased’

He said anxiety among the doctors had intensified after a junior resident of KGMC tested positive for COVID-19. “It has been found that he got infected while collecting an oral swab... Similarly, in Kerala, a doctor treating a patient got infected. Both are said to be young and without any other complications. In such a scenario, it is important to take necessary precautions. Otherwise, we will be forced to go into self-quarantine from Friday. 10 a.m,” he added.

Dr. Malik further demanded that like other hospitals, the OPDs should either be closed or the number of working hours should be reduced. “Only an OPD for flu patients should continue for a few days,” he said.

279,2020/03/20,"Yogi calls for social distancing, but Ayodhya mega fair is on for now","District administration still awaiting directions on its possible cancellation

The Uttar Pradesh government was on Thursday yet to clarify if the annual Ram-Navami Mela in Ayodhya scheduled from March 25 would take place as per tradition amid an outbreak of COVID-19. The State has so far reported 19 positive cases.

The Ayodhya administration came under the scanner after it was reported by a portal that it was pushing ahead with the mega fair despite precautionary measures laid down by the State against any form of congregations.

A few lakh pilgrims from U.P. as well as other States visit the town for the festivities and to pay obeisance at the many temples there.

On Thursday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath appealed to people to “adopt social distancing” and avoid crowded places. Mr. Adityanath asked religious leaders to spread awareness about avoiding crowds at religious sites, a government spokesperson said.

‘Do rituals at home’

“Considering the special circumstances, he has appealed to the common public that for the prevention of COVID-19 people conclude the religious rituals from home,"" the government said.

The government, however, did not specify if the CM’s appeal would extend to the mega fair in Ayodhya, which would be the first to be held after the Supreme Court awarded the disputed land for the construction of a Ram temple last November.

While Ayodhya DM Anuj Jha, who is an ex officio trustee of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, was unavailable for comment, his office indicated that the administration was still waiting for directions from Lucknow on the possible cancellation of the gathering.

“There has been no order from the government yet. Whatever order it issues, that will be followed. As of now, it (the mela) is proposed,” said an official.

Another official said that the government could decide on the Ram Navami Mela and other upcoming religious festivals and fairs in the State, like in Devipatan and Mirzapur, in a day or two.

Precautions taken

SSP Ayodhya Ashish Tiwari said he was taking all measures to tackle the threat of COVID-19 in the pilgrim town and equipped police personnel with masks, gloves and sanitisers, as well as counselled them about the disease. The district police has also deployed the videoconferencing facility in all police stations to ensure communication, he said, adding that the Dial 112 emergency police services were also being roped in against COVID-19. “Based on the mobile network, we have created a videoconferencing infrastructure,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cg5khe/article31111955.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE19-YOGI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/yogi-calls-for-social-distancing-but-ayodhya-mega-fair-is-on-for-now/article31111956.ece
280,2020/03/20,"Olympics-IOC reviewing Games scenarios, cancellation not among them: Bach","“...we are contrary to many other sports organizations or professional leagues in that we are four and a half months away from the Games,” says International Olympic Committee president.

The International Olympic Committee is considering various scenarios for the Tokyo Games amid the coronavirus pandemic but cancellation is not one of them, IOC president Thomas Bach has told the New York Times.

Organisers of the world’s biggest multi-sports event have repeatedly said the Games would start on July 24 as scheduled, even as the rapid spread of the flu-like virus has brought sporting events around the globe to a standstill.

The coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, has killed more than 10,000 people worldwide, sparking fears that the Olympics might be postponed or cancelled.

Also read: Olympic flame lands in Japan as doubts grow over Tokyo Games

Mr. Bach, however, said the IOC was not even considering scrapping the Games.

“The cancellation is not on the agenda. We are committed to the success of these Games,” he said.

An IOC task force, which included the World Health Organization, had determined it was too early to make a decision on how to manage the impact from the pandemic on the Olympics.

“We don’t know what the situation will be,” he said.

“Of course we are considering different scenarios, but we are contrary to many other sports organizations or professional leagues in that we are four and a half months away from the Games.”

“What makes this crisis so unique and so difficult to overcome is the uncertainty. Nobody today can tell you what the developments are tomorrow, what they are in one month, not to mention in more than four months.”

Japan is expected to welcome 6,00,000 overseas spectators and athletes to the event, which has seen sponsors pump in billions of dollars and at least $12 billion spent on preparations.

Mr. Bach said the final decision on the Games would not be determined by financial interests. Protecting the health of everyone involved and containing the virus were the main objectives, he added.

“Thanks to our risk management policies that have been in place for four years and our insurance, the IOC in any case will be able to continue operations and continue to accomplish our mission,” he said.

“The 206 national Olympic committees and the international sports federations expressed that the world in this extremely difficult and concerning situation needs a symbol of hope.

“So for us, while not knowing how long this tunnel will be, we would like the Olympic flame to be a light at the end of the tunnel ...”

In recent days several athletes, including reigning Olympic pole vault champion Katerina Stefanidi, accused the IOC of putting athletes’ health at risk by urging them to continue to train while many countries are in lockdown mode.

Mr. Bach, a former Olympic gold medallist in fencing, said he sympathised with the athletes.

“For an athlete, the worst thing for preparation is the uncertainty that distracts from training and preparations,” he said. “I told the 220 athletes in the phone call March 18 that we cannot pretend we have answers to all your questions.

“We are in the same situation as you and the rest of the world. It is a unique exceptional situation, which requires exceptional solutions.”",athletics,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/r8bdwm/article31116133.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUSTRALIAOLYMPICSBACH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/olympics-ioc-reviewing-games-scenarios-cancellation-not-among-them-bach/article31116134.ece
281,2020/03/20,Coimbatore Corpn. intensifies cleaning work across city,"Residents in apartments, gated communities and welfare societies told to avoid using their club houses

The Coimbatore Corporation on Friday intensified its drive to clean public places, government offices, police stations, fire stations, religious establishments, bus stands, buses and other places.

According to officials, the Corporation has diverted 800 workers, who were earlier engaged to combat dengue, to disinfect the aforementioned places and public transport vehicles. By doing so, the civic body has not in any way compromised the routine waste management or cleaning work, they added.

The Corporation had deployed the workers in all the five bus stands in the city – Mettupalayam Road, Gandhipuram town and mofussil, SETC, Singanallur and Ukkadam – to clean the interior and exterior of buses, pavements, public seating areas, ticket checkers’ offices, toilets, etc. The workers work round the clock in three shifts. Likewise, at the request of the TNSTC officials, the Corporation had deployed its workers to clean the depots as well, the officials said.

Though there were some initial issues related to coordinating the work, those were sorted out. At present, all buses leaving the depots exit only after getting cleaned and spraying of disinfectants. And, after every trip, the workers disinfect the buses, the officials said.

Likewise, at bus stops, Corporation workers supervised by the sanitary supervisors, inspectors and zonal sanitary officers clean the shelters every half-an-hour or so. At important bus stops, they also spray disinfectants on tyres, footboards and handrails.

To spray the disinfectants inside and outside buses, the Corporation was using the automated sprayers that it brought to spray larvicide to combat dengue, Corporation Commissioner Sravan Kumar Jatavath said.

“The powerful machines that the civic body bought for each of the five zones have come in handy now. That the machines are vehicle mounted is another advantage.”

The Corporation had also set up mobile medical teams at its offices and a few government establishments, railway station, integrated court complex and a few other places to screen visitors, commuters for high body temperature. It had also set up makeshift hand wash facilities at its offices and a few tax collection centres, said the officials.

‘Pay tax online’

Commissioner Mr. Jatavath said tax payers who were yet to pay property tax or water charges could use the online facility to pay from their houses.

He further said that the Corporation had also appealed to residents in apartments, gated communities and welfare societies to avoid using their club houses as that was the next place that residents get together after being advised to restrict going out. The officials said that the Corporation would ask contractors executing its projects to educate their workers and provide safety equipment. With most of the workers coming from north Indian states and they speaking languages other than Tamil, the civic body had asked the contractors to take care of the labourers.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/s2vnfd/article31122579.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB21BUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-corpn-intensifies-cleaning-work-across-city/article31122580.ece
282,2020/03/20,The silk route; M Kanagaraj who won the Best Farmer Award from the Department of Sericulture shares his experience of rearing silkworms,"M Kanagaraj, who recently won the Best Farmer Award from the Department of Sericulture, on how he began rearing silkworms

M Kanagaraj’s day begins with milking his cows. But what he is really known for starts after that. “I harvest mulberry leaves at 7.00 am to feed my silkworms,” says the sericulture farmer from Solavampalayam who recently won the Best Farmer Award (which carried a cash award of ₹25,000) from the Department of Sericulture; Government of Tamil Nadu.

Kanagaraj, who earlier cultivated tomatoes, cucumber and lady’s finger, has been rearing silkworms for 13 years. “The crops then failed to give me a steady income, as the price always fluctuated,” he says. He learnt sericulture from his in-laws who were experts. “I started with 400 silkworm eggs. The first seven days after the eggs hatch are very difficult, as the larvae need a lot of care. They should be fed with only tender mulberry leaves. The temperature also should be maintained at 25°C,” he explains.

Now he buys larvae from the stores, which helps him “skip this difficult phase. The larvae is only half an inch long when I get them. In the next three weeks, the worms will grow to three and a half inches in length.” Kanagaraj usually rears 50,000 worms in one batch and 10 batches in one year.

The quality of the leaves and the space available for the worm’s growth contribute to the development of the cocoon. “The worms should not be crowded and have to be fed twice daily. In the first week, one batch of worms consumes around 40kg of mulberry leaves at a time. By the time the worms are mature, it can go up to five tonnes. If these two conditions are not met, the growth of the cocoon will not be uniform and it will affect the price.” Kanagaraj grows mulberry trees in one acre of land and uses organic manure once in two months. “The trees are low maintenance and resistant to pests. I water them once a week.”

The process It takes 21 days for the larvae to mature and, during this process, it sheds its skin five times.

On the 21st day, the larva’s colour changes from white to yellow, an indication that it is ready to spin a cocoon. This takes up to three days.

The cocoons are then dried in the shade for two days to remove any moisture before being taken to the market inside the District Sericulture Centre in the city.

Kanagaraj harvests 100-150 kg of cocoons from one batch. “One cocoon weighs around two grams and it requires six kilograms to make a kilogram of silk,” he explains.

The market price of the cocoon is based on the price of silk. “One kilogram usually sells for around ₹400,” he says. He attends workshops organised by Department of Sericulture regularly to keep himself updated. “It helps me understand the different government schemes and also how to maintain mulberry plants,” he says. He has also trained 10 farmers near his village. “I clear their doubts and also keep them informed of any new developments in the field. It is a good feeling to see that they are also succeeding in this,” he says, adding that his award was unexpected. “I was very happy,” he smiles.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/g85t2s/article31117925.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Silk-yarn,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/m-kanagaraj-who-recently-won-the-best-farmer-award-from-the-department-of-sericulture-on-how-he-began-rearing-silkworms/article31117928.ece
283,2020/03/20,Government delaying bridge work: DMK MLA,"It has been over 10 years since the start of the construction of the bridge across the railway crossing in SIHS Colony. But the State government has done little to complete the project, N. Karthik, DMK MLA, said while raising the issue recently in the Assembly.

The then DMK government issued a Government Order in December 2010 to construct the bridge. Work began soon thereafter and there was a change in government in the State. It had been over 10 years now but the AIADMK government had done very little to complete the project.

The Highways Department began the work before it could reach an agreement with owners of lands to be acquired for the completion of the project. During the initial phase of construction, a dispute regarding compensation that arose between the owners and government had led to the construction getting stalled.

As a result, more than 50,000 people living in the area had been so badly affected that it was difficult for ambulance to reach them during emergency.

Mr. Karthik also raised the delay in completion of the bridge projects across railway lines on Thanneerpandal Road, near Hope College, and Ganapathy- Avarampalayam.

285,2020/03/20,Census in Gudalur forest division incorporates butterfly count,"56 different species of butterflies spotted in Cherambadi and Gene Pool areas

Unlike in previous years, when the annual census exercise carried out by the forest department would only be used to estimate the population of large mammals, the Gudalur forest division roped in butterfly experts and enthusiasts from the Wynter-Blyth Association to chart the different species of butterflies that inhabit the region.

The exercise, which was carried out alongside the two-day long census in 15 blocks in the Gudalur forest division, resulted in over 56 different species of butterflies being spotted in the Cherambadi and Gene Pool areas.

‘Not enough data’

District Forest Officer, Gudalur division, Sumesh Soman, said that there was not enough recent data about the different varieties of butterflies and birds which inhabit the Gudalur region, as well as the state of their populations.

“As we had butterfly enthusiasts and birders who were taking part in the annual census exercise, we felt it would be an ideal opportunity to get a clearer picture of the overall biodiversity in a couple of forest ranges in the Gudalur forest division,” said Mr. Soman when contacted by The Hindu.

Among the 56 different species of butterflies that were spotted during the exercise were “rarities” such as the Pygmy scrub hopper (Aeromachus pygmaeus), Hampson’s hedge hopper (Baracus hampsoni), Medus brown (Orsotriaena medus), the commander (Moduza procris) and the peacock royal (Tajuria cippus).

Manoj Sethumadhavan, a trustee from the Wynter-Blyth Association, said that they had also witnessed the migration of the common emigrant (Catopsilia pomona), while they were undertaking the census.

“We informed the forest department of this migration too, so that they can keep a lookout for such yearly migrations in the future,” said Mr. Sethumadhavan.

“Gudalur is home to a variety of forest types, from semi evergreen forests in the higher slopes of Nadugani surrounded by grasslands and riverine tracts, to rivulets, swamps and vayals. The region also has moist deciduous forests and pockets of bamboo forests, meaning that there are perhaps many more species of butterflies which we were unable to record during the two-day exercise,” said Mr. Sethumadhavan.

He added that incorporating butterfly and bird counts to regular census exercises conducted by the forest department will help in understanding the biodiversity and health of a particular ecosystem much better than just solely focusing on the recording of data about the presence of large herbivores and carnivores.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/cml77s/article31112235.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OO20-BUTTERFLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/census-in-gudalur-forest-division-incorporates-butterfly-count/article31112236.ece

District Collector K. Rajamani released the credit plan here on Thursday and the first copy was received by H.G. Ramesh, Assistant General Manager of Canara Bank.

Bus terminus in Ukkadam and Mettupalayam saw less crowd. Amid the closure of educational institutions and most public places, autorickshaws and taxi services are affected due to fewer people venturing outside their homes.

“Even these bookings are for short distances,” he said. Mr. Mahesh said that people tend to avoid travelling in autos due to its “open space” and a perceived lack of hygiene, Mr. Mahesh said.

292,2020/03/20,Coimbatore district gears up to combat COVID-19,"Health Dept. in the front of measures taken to stop the spread; Police, Forest Dept. have swung into action

With impact of COVID-19 crippling normal life, Coimbatore district is vigorously adopting measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

District Collector K. Rajamani is taking the lead in coordinating various departments to fight against the threat posed by the virus.

While the Health Department is in the front of measures taken to stop the spread of COVID-19, even the Police and Forest Department have swung into action to contribute their part.

According to Mr. Rajamani, the district will have an advantage of preparedness against the spread of the virus with the testing facility becoming functional at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH).

CMCH Dean B. Asokan told The Hindu the testing centre was expected to be functional on Friday.

“All arrangements for the facility have been completed. We are waiting to have a reagent required for the testing centre which we expect to source by Friday,” the Dean said.

According to Mr. Rajamani, international passengers, who arrive Coimbatore International Airport, will be taken to the isolation facility at Tejaa Shakthi Institute of Technology for Women, Karumathampatti where they will be put under observation.

On Thursday, 118 passengers, who arrived from Sharjah, were taken to the facility for observation. They were later allowed to leave for their homes, after advised by Health officials.

An official at the airport said that the medical team started screening domestic passengers too from Wednesday.

The measure was taken as international passengers may land in other airports in the country and take a domestic flight to Coimbatore.

Health Department staff is already screening people who come from Kerala on the inter-State borders.

The Coimbatore City Police have instructed all police stations to provide mask and hand sanitiser to personnel for their safety.

On Thursday, several shopping centres and supermarkets in the city started screening customers with thermal scanner at entrance.

Several IT firms and companies in the district too have adopted the same precaution.

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) too have taken efforts to prevent the spread of the virus.

K. Tamilselvan, Designated Officer of FSSAI here, said that owners of all the hotels and restaurants had been advised to take precautions.

Awareness materials

“Apart from providing soap/handwash liquid/sanitiser, hotel owners have been advised to display awareness materials about COVID-19 for the benefit of the public. Boards that explain hand washing technique, tips to prevent COVID-19 spread and how to maintain personal hygiene are displayed at restaurants. They should also ensure that workers, who have fever or any symptoms of COVID-19, should not be allowed to work until they are fully recovered,” he added.

According to him, owners of restaurants on Kerala – Tamil Nadu border areas like Anaikatti and Walayar were given special instruction to take precautionary measures.

FSSAI has also created a WhatsApp group that has representatives from the managements of hotels including star rated and normal ones in the city.

“They have been asked to inform us if any foreigner or persons who come from COVID-19 affected areas check in,” he said.

The Drugs Control Department has taken measures to ensure that pharmacies do not fleece customers who buy mask and hand sanitiser, availability of which has decreased due to high demand.

“We have registered a case against a Pradhan Mantri Jan-Aushadhi outlet in Namakkal for selling hand sanitiser at excess prize using provisions of Drug Price Control Order and Essential Commodities Act. Licence of a pharmacy in Coimbatore was suspended for seven days on Thursday after it was found selling mask at higher price. Samples of hand sanitiser were lifted to check their quality,” said S. Gurubharathi, Assistant Director of Drugs Control, Coimbatore zone which comprises Coimbatore, the Nilgiris, Tiruppur and Erode districts.

293,2020/03/20,"COVID-19 | Cricket Australia, New Zealand Cricket Board not revoking NOCs as of now","Concerns over participation of foreign players due to travel restrictions

Even as COVID-19 continues to cripple major sporting events, the cricket boards of Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand are still open to the idea of sending their players to India for IPL-13, should it happen.

The final approval is subject to the respective governments giving the go ahead and providing adequate preventive measures to combat the pandemic.

The Indian Sports Ministry on Thursday issued a fresh directive to federations in the country to suspend all events, competitions and trials until April 15, and with the introduction of restriction on air travel from regions in Europe or Asia, there are concerns over the participation of foreign players in this year’s IPL.

Working with players

A Cricket Australia (CA) spokesperson said the board was working with players and their managers on ensuring, “they are aware of all the facts before they consider playing overseas. This information is being shared as part of ongoing discussions.

“The NOCs will most likely be issued along with information to ensure all players are fully informed before making individual decisions. As you can see, it is a very fluid situation.”

The IPL-bound Australian players are in a limbo after the country’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday issued an indefinite level-4 travel ban but Pat Cummins (KKR) and Josh Hazlewood’s (CSK) manager Judie Andersen of Maximum Group International said there was “nothing from CA (on revoking NOCs) at the moment but they are reviewing the situation. Regarding the IPL, other than a tentative date of April 15, there have been no further updates.”

Same sentiment

Meanwhile, the New Zealand Cricket Board (NZC) too has echoed the same sentiment. The two remaining ODIs between Australia and New Zealand were cancelled and the visitors were forced to return home to avoid new travel restrictions.

According to NZC, there has been “no consideration given to revoking NOCs. Instead, NZC is focusing on ensuring our professional players, men and women, receive the most relevant information, advice and guidance as it comes to hand.”

Elsewhere, sources close to KKR’s new signing Tom Banton have indicated that the England international was intending to play if the IPL went ahead. “Tom will follow government advice and be guided by his core employer Somerset CC as well as ECB. He really hopes the IPL can go ahead as long as safety is in place with regard to the coronavirus,” said the source, on condition of anonymity.

At home, after a washout of the series opener in Dharamshala, India’s two remaining ODIs against South Africa were cancelled as a precautionary measure. The call to reschedule the series came close on the heels of BCCI’s decision to defer the IPL until April 15.

However, CSA has refrained from taking a definitive stance — at this point — on its players featuring in the IPL. “Given the time still leftbefore the IPL, we have not yet contacted our colleagues at the BCCI about this. “On the next course of action, CSA will be guided by the provisions of the government of South Africa, in terms of what the sporting fraternity would be at liberty to do,” said CSA’s Head of Media and Communications.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/hmyr6k/article31122299.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21TOM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/covid-19-cricket-australia-new-zealand-cricket-board-not-revoking-nocs-as-of-now/article31122300.ece

Today is a day when we should all stand together and resolve that no such incident should ever happen in India,’ says the Delhi Chief Minister

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, reacting to the hanging of the convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, said here on Friday it was time to address the loopholes in the legal system which “favour the culprits.”

The tragic incident, he said, had occurred seven years ago and the whole country had been waiting for justice for the last seven years.

“The convicts were hanged today, it took seven years to get justice for Nirbhaya. Today is a day when we should all stand together and resolve that no such incident should ever happen in India,” he stated.

“We have time and again observed...how some people manipulated the legal system and delayed the whole process, despite repeated death sentences being issued. We have to work together to address the various loopholes in our judicial system that favour the culprits,” he said in a statement.

There was a need to resolve that another Nirbhaya-like incident would never happen again in India. This, he said, would require work at several levels and include strengthening the police system, swift investigation and relevant changes in the judicial process to ensure justice within six months in such cases.

“We need to ensure that police investigations are completed in a swift manner. There is also a need to change the judicial system so that in such cases, victims don't have to wait for seven long years but get justice within six months,” said the Chief Minister.

“For the last four to five months, we have been running to each and every court and finally, justice was delivered. Seven years later, justice was served. I thank all the media persons as well,” she added.

“I will keep fighting for the daughters who are fighting a legal battle. My daughter got justice and now I will ensure other women also get justice and what happened to my daughter should never get repeated,” she added.

300,2020/03/20,Coronavirus | Lay-off fear prevails among shopping mall workers,"This comes as malls in Millennium City have been directed to shut down amid outbreak of COVID-19

Deployed at MGF Metropolis on Mehrauli-Gurugram Road to frisk women visitors, Archana is worried about losing her job after shutting down of all shopping malls in the Millennium City, on Thursday, in the wake of COVID-19 scare.

“I lost my husband two years ago. I have a five-year-old son. This job is my only source of livelihood. I have no clue how will I manage if I lose it,” said Archana, 26, sounding dejected.

Montu Sharma, another security guard, said there was a sense of fear among the staff after shopping malls were directed to shut down. “If I lose my job. I will go back to Bihar,” he said.

Maintenance needed

Senior manager operations of the mall, Lalit Singh Rawat, however, said the management had decided against laying off the staff — including housekeeping, technical, security and parking — since the security of the shops inside the mall and the maintenance of other facilities was needed. “Let’s see how the situation unfolds. We have decided to keep the staff as of now. The order is till March 31. But we will try not to lay them off even if it extends,” said Mr. Rawat.

City Centre Mall security superviser Sudhir Yadav said, so far, there was no word on laying off staff. “A sense of fear is palpable over the prospects of losing jobs,” said Sudhir, a resident of Rewari. While all shops were shut down at the mall, only Batra’s Clinic was open. The security staff said though the mall remained crowded all through the day earlier, a few people had turned up on Thursday morning. “It seems most of them had got the news,” said Sudershan, a security guard.

In rotation

Senior manager security and administration, MGF Metropolitan, Major (retd.) R.S. Phogat, said the staff strength would be curtailed to around 60%. However, instead of laying off, they would be deployed in rotation.

Sonia Gupta, a shopper at Spar Hypermarket in MGF Metropolis, said that there was indeed a sense of panic and the shutting down of malls had added to it. “My family was worried when I told them about going to mall to get some groceries. A sense of panic seems to have gripped all. I had to visit six grocery stores before I could lay my hands on vegetable oil. People seems to be stocking up fearing for the worst,” said Ms. Gupta, a lawyer.

Hema, another shopper, said she was hopeful that the situation would improve with the rise in temperature in another fortnight. A resident of Sushant Lok, said that she was worried about keeping herself safe, but not panicky.

Footfall to reduce

The store’s assistant floor manager, Suresh Kumar, said the footfall had reduced to almost half from around 2,000 visitors per day earlier. He expressed apprehension that it might reduce further after the shutting down of malls.

Auto drivers outside malls said that passengers were hard to find these days after reduced footfall in the metro and now with the shutting down of malls, the situation would worsen. “I pay ₹900 per day rent for the autorickshaw. If I cannot earn even that much, I would be left with no choice but to go back to my village in Bihar,” said Ramnath, an auto driver, under the MG Road metro station.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/nhmtg9/article31112745.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE20-GURUGRAMMALLCLOSURE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lay-off-fear-prevails-among-shopping-mall-workers/article31112746.ece

302,2020/03/20,‘Home quarantined’ stamp for those suspected of COVID-19,"People coming from abroad undergo twin checks at IGIA

People arriving from abroad at the Indira Gandhi International Airport are being checked for COVID-19, and if directed to remain at home, are being stamped ‘Home Quarantined’. It also reads “Proud to protect Delhiites. Home quarantined” and has a date showing when the person was stamped.

“We started stamping people, who are directed at the airport to be home quarantined, from yesterday [Wednesday] evening,” a Delhi government official told The Hindu. People coming from abroad have to undergo two different medical checks and they are stamped at the second screening point at the airport, run by the Delhi government.

Visible symptoms

The first test is done by the airport authorities for visible symptoms, where, after an initial thermal screening, symptomatic passengers are isolated and moved to designated hospitals.

Others move to the second screening point, where they are either home quarantined or sent to a quarantine facility run by the government, depending on risk factors.

One of the first States to swing into action was Maharashtra, where four persons who were travelling from Mumbai to Surat were deboarded from Garib Rath train when co-passengers raised an alarm and the TTE noticed their stamps. All the four had arrived from Germany.

A total of 57 passengers are under quarantine at government facilities and 9,797 passengers are under home quarantine, AAP government said.

“Till date, 1,96,200 passengers from COVID-19-affected countries have been screened at the Delhi airport and placed under surveillance. At least 4,547 passengers from affected countries were screened today,” an official statement said.

Also, two people who were already in isolation at Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, tested positive on Thursday.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cph04q/article31112730.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE20-STAMPING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/home-quarantined-stamp-for-those-suspected-of-covid-19/article31112731.ece

304,2020/03/20,2 more test positive in Gurugram,"2,250 people screened in city so far

Two women, including a 22-year-old studying at the United Kingdom, have tested positive for COVID-19 in Gurugram, taking the total number of cases in the district to four.

Gurugram Chief Medical Officer J.S. Punia, told The Hindu that the woman student, a resident of Palam Vihar, had tested positive for COVID-19 and the samples of her three family members were taken for examination. All three are asymptomatic. She had returned from the U.K. on March 14 and went to Civil Hospital two days later for examination after she experienced fever and sore throat. She has been in quarantine since March 14.

In the second case, the 42-year-old wife of a resident of South Close in Nirvana Country also tested positive for COVID-19. Her husband, who had returned from the U.K. on March 7, had already tested positive. Results of seven more family members and acquaintances in contact with the couple are awaited, said Mr. Punia. Earlier, a 29-year-old woman in Sector 9A had tested positive after she had returned from a personal visit to Malaysia. A total of 2,250 people have been screened in Gurugram.

305,2020/03/20,"Coronavirus | Delhi govt. shuts restaurants, caps gatherings at 20 people","Home delivery services to continue; CM issues appeal to work from home

The Delhi government on Thursday ordered the shutting of all restaurants in the national capital till March 31, but the restrictions will not apply to home deliveries and takeaway orders.

Announcing a whole host of measures, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said all educational institutions have also been directed to remain shut till month-end for both teaching and non-teaching staff. Non-essential public services will be disallowed from Friday as well, he said after a meeting with Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal to assess the status of measures put in place to combat the COVID-19 epidemic in the city.

The number of people allowed to gather for any event was also modified from 50 to 20. “We had recently announced that no social, political, cultural, family, sports and seminar gatherings comprising of more than 50 people will be allowed in the city. We have brought down the number of people allowed to 20,” Mr. Kejriwal said at a press conference.

Seeking to allay people’s fears, the Chief Minister said the Delhi government is taking all relevant measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. “We have had 10 cases in Delhi until now, with the unfortunate demise of one of the patients. Two patients have recovered and 1 patient has left for Singapore. We currently have 6 patients, most of them are recovering now,” he said.

Existing capacity

The Delhi government, he said, has an existing capacity of 768 beds to be installed in quarantine facilities until now, of which only 57 beds are currently occupied.

Of the 550 isolation beds in Delhi government hospitals for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, 40 beds have been occupied with suspected cases. There are 95 beds available in the Central government-run hospitals, out of which 67 beds have been occupied by suspected patients.

“We have also started stamping all the people who have been advised to self-quarantine themselves, owing to many of the patients who have been escaping the quarantine premises... if you do not abide by the Dos and Dont’s, we will have to take strict measures like filing an FIR or taking you into custody,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

“We are disinfecting buses, ISBTs, and metros daily. We are also disinfecting private public service vehicles like autorickshaws, taxis, and cabs daily in two shifts,” he said.

The Chief Minister appealed to the people to realise the intensity of the situation and avoid stepping out of their homes.

“Stay at home as much as you can and work from home. I want to appeal to the private sector institutions to provide work-from-home permits to their employees. Senior citizens need to be the most cautious of all,” he said.

Baijal directives

In a related development, Raj Niwas, in a statement, said Mr. Baijal has appealed to everyone to follow government directives, practice social distancing and avoid unnecessary travel.

The statement said the L-G has directed several steps, including promoting contact-less digital transactions, stopping breath analyser tests by traffic police, waiving tax for hotel rooms for quarantined persons, and a fine on spitting in public places and its strict enforcement. The private sector has also been advised to work from home wherever possible.

The L-G also directed that the provision of mobile vans with essential commodities of daily use and medical items in different residential areas may be explored to minimise the need for people to visit markets.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/pfyz8i/article31112713.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19DELPRIYAKEJRIWALPCONCORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-govt-shuts-restaurants-caps-gatherings-at-20-people/article31112714.ece

307,2020/03/20,Partial lockdown in IIT-D; only staff to be on campus,"Foreign students allowed to stay back

Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi, which was among the first educational institute to instruct students to leave hostels due to the COVID 19 pandemic, has said that only international students and students with special needs can stay back and all others are requested to vacate at the earliest.

The institute said that faculty members are strictly discouraged from stopping students from going home.

The campus will function in a partial lockdown mode and visitors will be screened at the entry points and will be allowed inside only after providing valid reasons for their visit, it said.

Contingency plan

“If you do not need to be on campus, you should not be on the campus,” IIT Director V. Ramgopal Rao said in a letter to students, staff and faculty.

He added that the institute will essentially function with staff and faculty residing within the campus.

The goal will be to minimise disruption to the academic calendar and ensure that students will be able to complete their graduation requirements within the specified time, the IIT Director said and added that a contingency plan has been put in place by the institute for switching over to the online mode of instruction.

Virus scare

The institute on March 17 had a COVID-19 scare when it was learnt that a 33-year-old researcher on his way back from Italy stayed in one of the guest houses on the campus on March 7 and later tested positive for COVID 19 in Bhubaneswar on March 16.

All the persons at the guest house, who had come in contact with the researcher, had been quarantined and tested, the premier institute had said. The institute came to know about the researcher testing positive after health officials in Bhubaneswar alerted them about the case.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/partial-lockdown-in-iit-d-only-staff-to-be-on-campus/article31112687.ece
308,2020/03/20,Hostellers in a catch-22 situation as varsities ask them to leave,"Question before them is whether to travel home and expose themselves to COVID-19 or stay back and tide over the crisis

As universities are issuing advisories to clear out hostels, students are stuck in a catch-22 situation: whether they should travel home exposing themselves to COVID-19 or stay back and tide over the situation.

Ananya, a student at Jawaharlal Nehru University, said she felt unsafe taking public transport to her home town in Bihar’s Buxar due to the rising cases but preferred reaching home than being stranded in Delhi as her hostel was being vacated.

“We were advised to vacate hostels but the ones choosing to stay back were asked to give “genuine reasons” for their decision. We have also been asked to clear all mess bills till January. It is inevitable that the movement within the campus might be restricted soon which would put the hostellers in a fix,” she said.

Residents of Hindu College’s girls hostel resisted on grounds of fear of exposing themselves to the virus when they were being compelled to vacate the hostels. The hostel committee held meetings to discuss the feasible options and later gave a choice to stay. While most rooms are unoccupied, a few students are held back due to academic reasons.

“Hostel felt safe until I started getting anxious about the construction workers and janitors who had no restrictions on movements. It made more sense to me to take a train now rather than face a situation of complete public transport shutdown and being stuck,” said Ujasha Tripathi, a student of Hindu College, who strongly agrees with the administration’s advice of vacating the premises.

Hostels of Ambedkar University which cater to a strength of 250 students is left with just 50 occupants because of reasons ranging from “no internet at home for online classes” to “hesitation to travel due to corona scare”. Many preferred stockpiling items of personal use and ready to eat food to avoid frequent outdoor visits.

JNUTA’s reaction

Reacting to JNU administration’s measures like closing eateries, advising students in hostels to return home, the JNU Teachers’ Association said that it was causing great hardship to students. “Reducing the number of functional messes may not be in the best interest of either the students, the protection of others on the campus or from the larger social point of view. Apart from creating hardship and even impossible to implement in the face of cancellations of trains and flights and financial constraints faced by students, these measures may actually increase the chances and scale of transmission of the virus within the university and outside,” the JNUTA said.

The teachers said that a large number of residents will be on the campus and the flow of essential commodities to them has to be maintained.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/7b8stv/article31112682.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL20-CORONA3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hostellers-in-a-catch-22-situation-as-varsities-ask-them-to-leave/article31112683.ece

In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, railway stations, including the New Delhi railway station, bore a deserted look as compared to the usual hustle. With over 160 trains cancelled as of Thursday, officials of the Northern Railway said that several other precautionary measures were rolled out at stations.

Several passengers turning up at stations with masks on visited the help desks set up by the railway authorities meant to attend to such concerns. Passengers were at liberty to get “voluntary” thermal screenings at the kiosks set up by authorities, in case if they feel any discomfort.

“While there are a series of precautions undertaken by the Railways, there is provision for the passengers to get thermal screening done at the platform. In case there are symptoms, the person will be referred for further medical attention. There are special wards available at the Central Hospital for this purpose,” said an official of the Northern Railway.

Apart from increasing the frequency of cleanliness in coaches, their toilets and pantry cars, hoardings and display boards carrying messages pertaining to precautionary measures to be taken to prevent the spread of the deadly virus were put up at the platforms of the New Delhi station.

Drop in business

With a thinned out crowd at stations, auto drivers stationed outside also complained of a drop in business due to the epidemic.

“Increasingly we are seeing a drop in business. Now we hear that a lot of trains have also been cancelled which means the coming days will be worse for us.

After all four convicts in Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case came to know about their hanging on Friday morning, they started sobbing and refused the evening tea on Thursday.

The Tihar jail authorities held a meeting over preparations besides doing a final trial run.

A Tihar jail officer said that after the convicts were informed that the Delhi court has rejected a plea seeking a stay on their executions, they were found to be restless and sobbing. The convicts have been kept in separate wards.

Counsellor allotted

“They even tried to harm themselves but were stopped by the jail staff. They have been put under surveillance. A counsellor was asked to talk to them. The jail staff have been instructed to keep a watch on them. Staff will be stationed outside each of their [convicts’] wards to keep a watch on their activities,” said the officer. The officer said that they were following procedures as mentioned in the Tihar jail manual.

The bodies will be shifted to DDU Hospital by 8 a.m. for post-mortem.

The convicts have been allowed to meet their family members one last time. All took the opportunity except for Akshay as nobody from his family turned up.

The families have not informed the authorities whether they would take the bodies for cremation. The Tihar authorities will cremate the bodies as per procedure if the families refuse, said the officer.

He added that the money earned by the convicts during their stay in jail will be handed over to their family members since they have not mentioned any beneficiary or signed any will.

Just before the convicts will be taken to the gallows, the Jail Superintendent will meet them in his cell. The Superintendent shall read out a translation of the warrant in vernacular to the convicts.

A night before the hanging of the Nirbhaya convicts, the Delhi police on Thursday held a meeting to work out the modalities for handing over the bodies to the respective family members after their post-mortem.

A senior police officer said that they have deployed security personnel at Ravidas Camp in R.K. Puram where the convicts used to stay with their families. It is part of precautionary measures taken to avoid any confusion at the last moment, they said.

“We have also coordinated with Lodhi Road crematorium to keep all arrangements ready. The bodies will be handed over to family members after a post-mortem at Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital. The bodies will be taken to the crematorium under police protection and will be cremated,” the officer also said.

Arrangements at the electric crematorium at Lodhi Road are ready, but if the families of the convicts wish to take the bodies to their respective home towns, then arrangements will be done as per the procedure.

As per Tihar Jail manuals, the body of any prisoner who has died or has been executed in jail, shall be handed over to the friends or relatives of the deceased. If the family refuses to take the body, then it shall be cremated or buried in the jail burial ground in accordance with the custom applicable to the faith of the deceased.

“It was one of the horrific crime cases I have investigated. The victim had faced extreme cruelty and the accused deserved to be hanged. They should have been hanged long ago,” the officer added.

Pratibha Sharma, investigating officer in the case, said that she would achieve job satisfaction and consider her work done only after the convicts in the Nirbhaya case were hanged.

“When I was handing the case, I stayed at the police station for four days. My daughter used to call me every few days and ask about Nirbhaya’s condition.

316,2020/03/20,Govt. employee loses vision in Delhi riots,"The man was shot at near his house in north-east Delhi on February 24

Mohammed Nasir Khan was shot at on February 24 during the riots that broke out in north-east Delhi, a few steps away from his house. He has permanently lost vision in the left eye.

Ghonda resident Nasir (34), a Delhi government employee and a former CISF official, thought he would be safe in his area since locals knew him as a man who helped people prepare for civil services examination and fitness. But he was proved wrong.

‘Concealed identity’

Recalling the day, Mr. Nasir who works as Junior Assistant with National Cadet Corps, said that he was on his way back from a private hospital in Shalimar Bagh with his mother and sister in a cab when he was stopped by a mob in Khajuri Khas. “It was around 3.30 p.m. I knew the situation was turning tense. While in the cab, I had already asked my mother to remove her burqa so that we were not identified as Muslims. When the mob intercepted us, they asked my name and I lied. I told them my name’s Krishna. I also told them that my sister is ill and we were coming back from hospital. They let us go,” he said. The sister, he said, was admitted for a minor operation on February 22.

The cab driver then took the forested route and helped the family reach home safely. “Since the situation was tense outside, I offered the driver to stay at our house till it got better. An hour and a half later, he said he needed to go home because his wife was crying and worried for him,” he said.

Mr. Nasir decided to help the driver reach Gokulpuri junction safely and went with him in his car. While on his way back home on foot, he was spotted by a friend, a Hindu, who offered to drop him close to his house, till Vijay Park, to ensure his safety.

But when he reached the residential street, a mob caught hold of him and started thrashing him. “I told them I was a local and that we had been making sure the temple next to our house was safe, but they did not stop. They also kept on chanting ‘Jai Shri Ram’,” In the meantime, another group arrived and he was suddenly shot at after which the people fled, he said.

“I was bleeding...a part of my skull was visible. I somehow managed to reach home. My father was standing outside. On seeing my condition, he started crying. We called the police but no one came,” he said.

He was then rushed to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital by a neighbour in an autorickshaw. “The mobs even tried to stop the autorickshaw, but they could not as my neighbour was driving very fast,” he said.

Mr. Nasir went under the knife. He said his plastic surgery was conducted and that the doctors took good care of him, but his vision is lost. He was released from the hospital five days ago.

“I am not sure if the loss of vision will impact my work. Thankfully, the other eye is fine. My family is thankful for the fact that I am alive,” he said.

Mr. Nasir lives with his parents, two sisters and two brothers in a double-storey house. He had quit the CISF job while under training, in two months, and started working at the NCC.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/govt-employee-loses-vision-in-riots/article31112275.ece
317,2020/03/20,"Railway retiring rooms, dormitories shut till April 15","The South Central Railway (SCR) has announced that retiring rooms and dormitories in all stations in its jurisdiction are to be shut from Saturday (March 21) till April 15. It is also ensuring that the ‘social distancing’ of about one metre is followed at all the queues at booking offices and other places.

Hand sanitisers are being liberally sprayed on the passengers arriving at the stations and regular announcements are being made urging them to be vigilant. However, senior officials have made it quite clear that it is next to impossible to maintain the ‘social distance’ on board the trains as has been suggested by the Ministry of Health.

“The only way the rule can be enforced is to cancel the trains. We are right now cancelling trains having poor patronage only. Since the number of trains got reduced and domestic flights are being cancelled many are boarding our trains crowding them further. It sure is a dangerous situation considering the circumstances of spread of COVID-19,” point out senior officials.

And, wherever the trains are running to capacity, the railway authorities are not considering deboarding passengers even if found to be having symptoms of coronavirus. “Even running staff will find it tough to identify ‘sick’ passengers unless the symptoms are too obvious because our ticket examiners have to take care of four coaches and the security personnel are moving constantly. Unless the passengers themselves report, there is little we can do”, they say, expressing helplessness.

While the field staff have been issued masks and sanitisers to spray around on the passengers’ hands, most administrative and clerical employees are looking forward to the alternate-day-work-from-office proposal being seriously considered by the authorities. Currently, there is no screening of the 10,000-odd employees working in various human resource and other offices and sanitisers have been provided inside the rest rooms only.

“The staff are apprehensive about the spread of the virus and at least half of them are likely to be allowed to attend office on alternate days,” said senior officials.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/railway-retiring-rooms-dormitories-shut-till-april-15/article31121776.ece
318,2020/03/20,SCR trains to be off track from midnight,"Two more COVID-19 patients travelled on trains

The South Central Railway (SCR), like other railway zones across the country, has cancelled almost all its trains — passenger, long-distance and suburban services, from Saturday midnight till Sunday night (10 p.m.) to prevent further spread of Covid-19 and in view of ‘People’s Curfew’ call of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“About 80% — more than 650 — of 720-odd trains run by SCR everyday are going to be shut down. Suburban trains may be running skeletal services early in the morning and late in the night. Only those trains starting before 7 a.m. on Sunday will be running. About 3,700 trains across the country will be affected,” said senior railway officials.

Passengers alighting at stations en route from trains already on run during the period and wishing to stay at the station would be accommodated in waiting halls, rooms and concourse. Adequate arrangements would be made to facilitate hassle-free refund to those cancelling tickets, they said.

While the decision was taken by the Railway Board, SCR General Manager Gajanan Mallya had his own strategy session with top officials to take stock of the situation following the reports of more patients suspected of carrying voronavirus travelling in trains.

While all 10 Indonesian preachers with the contagion symptoms had travelled by AP Sampark Kranthi Express from Hazrath Nizamuddin to Ramgundam in a sleeper coach on their way to Karimnagar, another passenger suspected of having the virus symptoms was deboarded at Dhone after he had gone onto the same train moving towards Hazrath Nizamuddin, from Kurnool.

Senior railway officials said the patient was taken off the train after being alerted by AP health and medical department about his travel. “The entire coach was detached from the train and was fumigated,” they said and admitted that long-distance trains had become potential carriers of the virus in the last few days when the entire focus was on airport arrivals.

“Foreign travellers were taking our long distance trains taking advantage of the poor scrutiny. We realised that one of the COVID-19 patients at Visakhapatnam had travelled on ‘Garib Rath’ Express from Secunderabad on March 18. We are now tracing out the other co-passengers to check on them,” said senior officials.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/a4iq8c/article31125674.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-TRAIN-FILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/trains-to-be-off-track-from-midnight/article31121690.ece

320,2020/03/20,Telangana HC directs State government to defer SSC exams to be held from March 23 to 30,"Responds to a PIL petition seeking deferment in the backdrop of rising COVID-19 cases

The High Court of Telangana on Friday directed State government to postpone the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exams, which had begun on Thursday, from March 23 to 30. There will be no change in the exam to be held on Saturday, March 21.

The first of the annual SSC exams was held on Thursday. The second exam too was conducted on Friday. However, the exam scheduled on March 31 would be held without any change.

A division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy gave the interim direction, after hearing a PIL petition seeking deferment of the SSC exams in the backdrop of rising COVID-19 cases.

Seeks to know the reason

The plea was filed by a private educational institute faculty member M. Bala Krishna. Hearing the petition which was moved as lunch motion, the bench sought to know why the Telangana government wanted to go ahead with the exams while the central boards postponed the CBSE and ICSE exams. The bench said already authorities imposed prohibitive orders under section 144 of Cr.P.C. in Karimnagar town after a group of Indonesia nationals, who arrived there by train, showed symptoms of COVID-19.

The Centre too announced to observe Janata curfew appealing to people to stay put indoors on Sunday from 6 am to 9 p.m. Conducting SSC exams in such circumstances would amount to taking risk, the bench said.

The petition would be heard again on March 30.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/telangana-hc-directs-state-govt-to-defer-ssc-exams/article31118072.ece

322,2020/03/20,MANUU to be quarantine centre,"Varsity receives letter, tahsildar authorised to take possession

Maulana Azad National Urdu University (MANUU) will soon be taken over by the Telangana Director of Medical and Educational Department (DMED) to set up a quarantine centre for those suspected to have coronavirus symptoms.

The move is said to have taken the university by surprise. In a letter to the Vice-Chancellor’s office sent on Thursday, the Revenue Divisional Officer of Rajendra Nagar informed the administration of the intention to use the campus as a quarantine centre for international passengers who have landed in Hyderabad. The university will be taken over by revenue authorities and handed over to the DMED.

“As per the directions of the District Collector of Ranga Reddy, MANUU in Gachibowli is suitable as a quarantine centre and there is ample parking space,” an excerpt reads.

The tahsildar has been authorised to take possession of MANUU, and the authorities have also made the intentions of making necessary changes to the varsity infrastructure clear.

The move comes in accordance with Section 30 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. Varsity staff said that top officials went into a huddle soon after they received the notice and began to deliberate upon the next course of action, including whether the proposed take-over could be contested. They are said to have presented their case before the State government.

A major concern of the varsity is the students in hostels and within the over 200-acre campus, who cannot be asked to vacate immediately. Meanwhile, MANUU Students’ Union wrote a letter to the varsity registrar informing him of the presence of 500 students within the campus. The union also said that several trains have been cancelled that will make it difficult for students to leave for their homes. Many have not left the campus due to financial constraints, the union said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/manuu-to-be-quarantine-centre/article31112185.ece

325,2020/03/20,State set to flex digital muscle to fight fake COVID-19 news,"Telangana is not new to fighting the fake news menace

The Telangana government is planning to rollout a one-stop digital solution to fight the fake news menace that has become a challenge in the State’s effort against the coronavirus outbreak. “We are planning a WhatsApp number where citizens can get messages checked for authenticity, a website, as well as an archive of fact-checked information,” said Dileep Konatham, Director, Digital Media, Telangana government.

Even as Mr. Konatham was speaking, a fake news about an order from Prime Minister’s office began to circulate. “It is an order from Malaysian Prime Minister’s office but the mischievous elements have erased the word Malaysia from the letter to make it appear like Indian PM’s office. Fake news is not entirely fake but quoted out of context or with changed content,” said Mr. Konatham, who has been pushing up to the minute authenticated information about Covid-19 in the state.

“Miracle cures are a big category of fake news that keep on circulating,” says Rakesh Reddy Dubbudu who is partnering with Facebook and WhatsApp for checking fake news. Even information about moving individuals for testing of coronavirus at quarantine facilities are being spread as a confirmed case. On March 15, at about 9 p.m., a video of a person dressed in Hazmat suit entering an ambulance became viral as a case of COVID-19. But within hours, the news was dismissed as fake without as much as an apology. There are countless others that keep popping every few hours, including one asking people to stay indoors for spraying of a chemical to destroy the virus.

Telangana is not new to fighting the fake news menace. Two years back, the State government succeeded in creating a mechanism to check fake news in the initial days of mob lynchings based on WA forwards about organ harvesters and child lifters that killed dozens across the country.

In the case of COVID-19 pandemic, the State has been more aggressive. It has invoked the Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and sent a few individuals to the prison. The social media sites are also doing their bit. Any search of coronavirus shows up results hosted on the World Health Organisation site or the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. “To make sure you get the best information on the coronavirus (COVID-19), resources are available from the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and World Health Organization,” says one of the social media site.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/fwnq67/article31112015.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-BEDS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/state-set-to-flex-digital-muscle-to-fight-fake-covid-19-news/article31112016.ece
326,2020/03/20,Young player sets an example,"Knowing the gravity of COVID-19, the 20-year-old stays in self-isolation after return from Qatar and Oman

It is a threat which doesn’t care for reputations! And, not surprisingly, days after chief national badminton coach P. Gopi Chand has decided to be under ‘self-isolation’ on return from London last week after the All England championship, it is the turn of the young paddler S. Fidel R. Snehit to follow suit in the wake of the dreaded COVID-19.

Reason? The 20-year-old young table tennis talent has returned from Qatar and Oman after competing in international tournaments and had the mandatory tests done at Cochin International Airport and reached Hyderabad Airport on March 16.

“I am getting quarantined as suggested by the health authorities. I feel very happy to see the prompt reaction from the Telangana government. Every citizen should sincerely comply with the instructions and community should be the top most priority in this critical juncture,” Snehit said.

The bronze medallist (under-21 category) in the Oman Open informed the Table Tennis Federation of India and the Telangana State Table Tennis Association about his return and self-isolation in tune with the Sports Authority of India’s directive.

“Throughout the journey, I was very careful because I realised the gravity of the situation after meeting players from various countries. Since my return I have been in self-isolation in a room in my house keeping the safety of my family and society interest in mind. I felt happy to get a call from health authorities to track my condition,” says the young talent who won 25 international medals so far.

When the petition came up, Senior Public Prosecutor Suman Chakravarthy submitted that there was scientific evidence and statement of witnesses to substantiate offence alleged against the accused.

The Kochi Corporation will soon step up measures to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and prepare for possible exigencies in the next few weeks.

A helpdesk along with a helpline number will soon be set up at the corporation office to handle queries on the infection and connect to emergency services like ambulances. The corporation's health department will also inspect markets and other public spaces to ensure their hygiene.

Mayor Soumini Jain directed the health supervisor to determine the feasibility of placing a temporary stop on the sale of street food in the city. Masks, gloves, towels and soaps will continue to be distributed to sanitation workers. She also appealed to the general public to avoid visits to the corporation office unless it was for an urgent matter. The public must also avoid visiting the office with children, she said.

332,2020/03/20,Police act tough with spectators of ‘Kumbalanghi nights’,"Bioluminescence lighting up waterbodies of the village attracting crowds from all over the State

As spectacular as the sight of bioluminescence that lights up the waterbodies of the idyllic village of Kumbalanghi during nights, the phenomenon has left the Palluruthy police with a major headache as people continue to flock from far and wide to witness the spectacle in violation of directions against mass gatherings as a precaution against the spread of COVID-19.

With warnings continuing to fall on deaf ears, the police have started acting tough and arrested 16 persons who turned up on Wednesday night. They were charged with IPC Sections 143 (Unlawful assembly), 147 (Rioting), 149 (Every member who is part of an unlawful assembly is guilty of the offence committed in prosecution of the common object) and 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant).

Among the arrested were people from all age groups, though youngsters dominated, even from other districts such as Malappuram, Alappuzha and Thrissur. They were later released on station bail but not before summoning their parents and giving them an awareness session about the need to avoid gatherings in these times of the epidemic. Vehicles, mobile phones and cameras seized from them would be produced in court.

“We have intensified the night patrolling along the borders leading to Kumbalanghi and will now sternly deal with the offenders. Even families with small children are turning up. People start gathering around 8 p.m. and it goes on till around 3 a.m. We have also received complaints from the local residents,” said Y. Deepu, sub inspector, Palluruthy.

The phenomenon became popular after it was featured in last year’s Malayalam blockbuster movie Kumbalanghi Nights.

Earlier, the police had to turn away 12 families, including women and children, who had come to watch the phenomenon after explaining the situation to them.

333,2020/03/20,Police telemedicine to ‘break the chain’,"‘Swaraksha’ facilitates online consultations

Imagine you are quarantined on suspicion of COVID-19 or that you have the intuition that you are already infected and need medical assistance. But dropping in at a hospital or clinic unannounced may prove catastrophic and sabotage the government’s efforts to ‘break the chain’.

To overcome this dilemma, the Kochi City Police Commissionerate on Thursday launched a telemedicine platform, Swaraksha, facilitating consultations between doctors and patients in the virtual world. The Indian Medical Association, Rotary District 3201 and Jio Mobile are associating with the programme.

“The motto of the platform is ‘Protect and be protected’. So far, 25 doctors have volunteered to associate with the online service and they have been given dedicated mobile phones and SIM cards for addressing the concerns of people and extending medical help,” said District Police Chief (Kochi City) Vijay Sakhare. The link to the online service will be published on all social media platforms of the City Police Commissionerate and can be easily accessed with a single click. The home interface of the online service comes with a link to send a message in the form of a WhatsApp message, which could be text, audio or video.

Control room

The message lands at the control room set up by the commissionerate exclusively for dealing with COVID-19 related issues and will be handled by a team of police officers and paramedics.

“The control room will place a call to the number from which the message was received to confirm the genuineness of the message and weed out pranksters. The message then goes to a database accessible by doctors. The control room then arranges a conference call with the doctor and the one seeking medical assistance before disengaging itself from the platform leaving it to the other two parties,” said Mr. Sakhare.

He hoped that the online facility, accessible across the country and even beyond, will prove to be a blessing to those seeking medical assistance without getting infected or spreading the infection.

Mr. Sakhare also insisted on the importance of those in quarantine following the quarantine protocol to prevent the spread of the disease.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/uayqrt/article31113095.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RGCB-epidemiological-studies-COVIDIMG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/police-telemedicine-to-break-the-chain/article31113096.ece

A man undergoing the mandatory 14-day quarantine at his home as part of precaution against COVID-19 on his return from West Asia was found hanging in his room in an attempt to end his life, the North Paravur police said on Thursday.

He was rushed to the Government Medical College, Kalamassery, where his condition is said to be stable.

“He was already anxious about not being able to find any job, and that coupled with the isolation may have led him to the attempt to take his own life. This has nothing to do with the quarantine process,” the police said. The incident took place between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. on Wednesday. He was chatting with his wife before he retired for the night to his room. An unusual sound alerted the wife who rushed into the room to find her husband hanging from the fan.

336,2020/03/20,Help desk comes to the aid of stranded tourists,"Foreigners turned away by hotels

The help desk set up by Kerala Tourism has brought relief to numerous tourists who were turned away from hotels and other accommodation units in different parts of Kerala in the wake of the COVID-19 situation.

They include Miriam Skovgard Mahony, a 25-year-old Danish tourist who landed in Kerala this month. She could not find hotel accommodation at Willingdon Island. A resort in the area came to her rescue, offered her food and also contacted Kerala Tourism, which has just set up a help desk to swiftly address any problem tourists face in the State. In the early hours of Wednesday, the Kochi office of Kerala Tourism swung into action. “Our staff took Miriam to KTDC-owned Bolghatty Palace Hotel, not far from where she was stranded,” said Rani George, Secretary of Kerala Tourism.

Four other tourists stranded in another locale in Kochi and a few others in Alappuzha too were helped out. They included Australian Goodger Ben Julian, American Andrey Sergeevich and Singaporeans Thia Martha Augustine and Amy Marie, who had booked rooms in a hotel.

They had been refused accommodation because of the viral scare. At an Alappuzha hotel, U.S. national Alan was asked to present medical certificates that showed him disease-free.

Shifted to isolation ward

The man rang up the help desk, which took him to the nearest hospital on the advice of the District Medical Officer. As a precautionary measure, he was moved to the isolation ward of a hospital.

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran said there had been a one-off claim (in the social media) where a phone call to the help desk set up on Tuesday was not attended. “I believe it was an aberration. The facility has been functioning to the best of its capacity,” he said.

The Minister pointed out that all but two of the 19 British tourists who were sent back from the Nedumbassery airport continue to be taken care of at a hotel at Kalamassery. This was done after they were recommended to stay in quarantine last week. “Two others among them are a couple being given treatment. Of them, as you know, the husband had tested positive for COVID-19,” he said, adding that the government was meeting his medical expenses. “The wife is under observation”.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/help-desk-comes-to-the-aid-of-stranded-tourists/article31112893.ece

338,2020/03/20,Shakespeare in the era of social distancing,"While it can never really supplant the vibrancy and vividness of live in-the-flesh theatre, the showcasing of performing arts in the digital space has expectedly received a fillip over the past couple of weeks as Covid-19 containment measures are implemented the world over. Quarantine, statutory or self-imposed, has led arts-lovers to virtual pastures of congregation and communion where 2G bandwidth or grainy visuals or firewalls might be the only impediments to what are perfectly pleasurable armchair outings to these freshly minted citadels of culture. The new catch phrase of choice is, of course, ‘social distancing.’

Opera at home

As the portico sopranos of Italy or the impromptu orchestras everywhere have shown, the humble balcony has become the site of pop-up performances that are not ersatz or fleeting, but richly resonant and an essential ingredient of the perplexing zeitgeist that we have been propelled headlong into. While live arts is never one to cower down in the face of adversity, the latest profusion of cultural livestreaming on the Internet allows us new avenues of arts appreciation as performances that are delivered across what was the ultimate degree of separation — the pocket-sized or life-size screen at home — for theatre aficionados globally.

A recital by the Dafne string quartet of the Teatro La Fenice — shared under the hashtag #iorestoacasa (‘I’m staying home’) — was staged to a grand audience of none in a massive concert hall that usually houses a thousand. A live feed on YouTube notched ten times as many views.

Anything online has more reach is a given, but there was a certain urgency to this outing that spoke of access and distribution certainly but also human connections, with Beethoven and Borodin for company. The Venice-based opera house has since made available recordings of opulent operas from its current season.

Elsewhere, The Metropolitan Opera began crystal-clear nightly streams of performances on its site for free, with closed captions available and typically, a backstage tour-cum-introduction. This will continue for as long as the opera remains closed. Dubbed ‘Nightly Met Opera Streams’, its second all-Wagner week will commence on March 23, beginning with Tristan und Isolde, Wagner’s opera in three acts that was composed between 1857 and 1859. The Royal Opera House version ran into four hours and 55 minutes, so that’s one third of a regular day accounted for. All the opera streams will begin at 5 a.m. (Indian Standard Time) and will remain available via the homepage of metopera.org for the next 20 hours. Closer home, in Mumbai, the NCPA’s series of screenings of operas at the Met, sell off fairly quickly despite high rates of admittance, so this new initiative is likely worth a steal for that particular demographic.

Chain dramatics

A more interactive enterprise is Sofa Shakespeare, the brainchild of New York-based actor Julia Giolzetti. As has been the case with thousands, a play she was about to start work on got cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, so Giolzetti put up a Facebook post requesting registrations for an unusual collaborative project based on Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, wherein each minute of the play would be created by separate individuals, and the submitted ‘chunks’ would then be pieced together into a full-length digital production that would account for every line in the play.

Giolzetti got entries from around the world, and while Romeo and Juliet is still in post-production, slots for the next announced play, Twelfth Night, have already been filled. Giolzetti exhorts participants to “use animals, children, finger puppets, sing, translate it into another language, wear a silly hat, or just sit on the sofa and read it off your damn phone, I don't care!”

Giolzetti has herself spent more than two years as part of a self-proclaimed “drinking club with a Shakespeare problem” — New York’s Drunk Shakespeare Society — many of whose members are part of the line-up in the very first edition of Sofa Shakespeare outing.

Also premiering over the weekend is the disarming Social Distancing Festival, organised by the Toronto-based playwright, Nick Green. It specifically curates material from works that have been cancelled or delayed or disrupted due to the outbreak. So far, the hundreds of submissions from across the globe have included “clips from rehearsals, scenes done with cast-mates over webcam, recordings from previous workshops, [or] design plans.” The featured work includes a sonic rendering of Canadian Susanna Fournier’s Four Sisters, a new dance solo by Tanzania performing artist Tadhi Alawi, and British textile artist Jane Sanders’ exhibition Stitchin’ in the Kitchen.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/g0m6si/article31121101.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21bm-pg4-theatre-column-The-Gershwins-Porgy-and-Bess,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/shakespeare-in-the-era-of-social-distancing/article31121102.ece
339,2020/03/20,Drastic decline in flight operations,"17 international departures cancelled on Friday

With the travel ban imposed by all Gulf Cooperation Council countries on Indian nationals and restrictions in place in India as well, the Calicut International Airport almost wears a deserted look.

The newly inaugurated international terminal appears to be shut down with the airline companies slashing international flights. “Sixteen international arrivals and 17 international departures were cancelled on Friday,” Airport Director K. Srinivasa Rao said.

Flights to Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have already been cancelled. However, flights are operating to Oman, United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. The arrivals are Indian nationals. Of course, the departures are experiencing low occupancy following the ban on entry to GCC countries except their citizens. Some flights have taken off with even four passengers, “ he said.

The Calicut airport, which is the seventh top international airport in terms of actual passenger throughput, has seen a huge drop in volume of passengers from March 1. Normally the airport operates 60 international movements (arrivals and departures) and eight domestic flights daily.

The average flights per day was 26.84 during the March 1-December 31, 2019 period and it was 21.84 from March 1-19, 2020. The average passengers per day for arrival and departure combined for both international and domestic were 9,782. 81 before COVID-19 pandemic and 7.391.20 after the pandemic.

Mr. Rao said the real picture about the decline in passengers volume would emerge in the coming days. From Sunday, India has barred all international flights for a week. Domestic airlines are also cancelling flights either due to low occupancy or flights operating to Gulf destinations via Indian airports.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/drastic-decline-in-flight-operations/article31121654.ece
340,2020/03/20,Farmers and merchants seek moratorium on bank loans,"They plea for urgent intervention by State government

With the COVID-19 outbreak causing serious impact on the rural economy and small business, traders and farmers’ organisations have called for declaring a moratorium on all bank loans for at least a year. Finding it as a genuine concern, various political parties too have come in support of the demand and taken it up with the State-level banking authorities for proper action.

Leaders of various merchants’ forums say the business has been going through acute crisis since the outbreak of COVID-19. The intensified surveillance measures have largely affected the turnout of local buyers and it is likely to continue for several weeks in the existing situation, they point out.

“It has equally affected all types of traders who will not be able to survive without a favourable intervention on the part of the State government. Moratorium on bank loans covering the private and public sector banks will be one of the supportive measures for all those who go through the crisis time,” says K. Sethumadhavan, secretary, Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti. According to him, the State government is well aware of the need and is likely to come up with a favourable decision.

The farmers’ organisations which have sought moratorium for agricultural loans obtained from private and public sector banks claim that the price fall of agricultural produce and the poor demand in the open market have totally paralysed the rural economy and the lives of farmers. Those who have secured bank loan for farming projects and the production of value-added products are now helpless to pay back even the monthly interest, they say.

“The worst-hit is the poultry farmers in the rural areas of Kozhikode. Many of them have lost huge stock in the culling exercise following bird flu. There are many who ventured into poultry farming after obtaining bank loans,” said Joy Kannanchira, leader of We Farm hillside farmers’ collective. According to him, the affected farmers will not even be able to resume the collapsed ventures in the near future.

Like the farmers and merchants, the educational loan holders too have called for availing moratorium benefits for them to survive the crisis. They say the State government can help many through such a move which was implemented during the floods last two years.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/farmers-and-merchants-seek-moratorium-on-bank-loans/article31120806.ece
341,2020/03/20,Kudumbashree turnsto mask production,"The cloth bag manufacturing units of Kozhikode Corporation Kudumbashree have completely shifted to manufacturing of surgical cloth masks with the acute shortage of masks faced by the health professionals in the district. However, the non-availability of surgical quality cotton cloth has become a major hurdle for them to cater to the heavy demand.

There are 94 bag manufacturing units under Kudumbashree in the city with around 700 workers under it. The cloth bag units, under the brand ‘Fresh Bags’ were launched to cater to the demand for cloth bags when plastic carry bags were banned in the State. But when COVID-19 struck the units immediately switched to mask manufacturing.

“We have a capacity to make up to 35,000 masks a day. But, not enough cloth is available. Hence, we have not been able to meet the demand,” said T.K. Prakashan, Kudumbashree Project Officer of the Corporation.

At present, the units are manufacturing around 5,000 masks daily. The masks are handed over to the District Mission and distributed at hospitals though the District Medical Office. “It is not for distribution among the public; only for health professionals,” Mr. Prakashan said.

Besides, the contingent workers and Green Task Force members under the Corporation will also get these masks. “The Health Officer has demanded around 10,000 masks for our staff. But we have not been able to provide it completely,” he said.

With the transport sector on the verge of shut down, transportation of the masks is also a hurdle, he added.

The 6X4 inch size masks are being sold for ₹7. The specially dyed surgical quality cotton cloth used for the masks is manufactured in Kannur. The units expect to get fresh supply of the cloth by Monday.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/kudumbashree-turnsto-mask-production/article31120798.ece

343,2020/03/20,Taxi drivers told to take air passengers directly home,"Passengers not to be dropped at bus or railway stations even if they demand it

The Kozhikode district administration has directed taxi drivers to take passengers from airports directly to their homes. This is part of efforts to contain COVID-19 and follows a meeting District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao had with representatives of taxi drivers’ unions on Thursday.

The drivers were told not to drop passengers at bus or railway stations even if they demand it. They should not stop at shopping malls or hotels too en route. It was pointed out that the practice would avoid the possibility of suspected patients interacting with others.

The drivers should collect names, phone numbers, and address and inform the district office of the Disaster Management Authority. All taxi drivers should wear face masks, down windscreens, and not operate the air-conditioner.

As many as 80 police personnel will be deployed within the city limits and 142 in rural areas for infection control measures. All ward-level rapid response teams, which visit those under observation, should have at least one police personnel, Mr. Rao said. The district COVID-19 cell is getting around 200 calls a day now. The cell can be reached to clear doubts about the infection at 0495-2371471 and 2376063.

A special meeting of the corporation council held here on Thursday resolved to ensure help for everyone under observation for suspected infection. Mayor Thottathil Raveendran, who chaired the meeting, pointed out that those under observation should not feel imprisoned, and people should not view them as enemies. Whoever had returned from abroad should be under home quarantine for 14 days. Senior citizens and children should get special care, he said. Members of the council urged the government to shut the outlets of Kerala State Beverages (Manufacturing and Marketing) Corporation Ltd. (Bevco) within the city limits. Hygiene should be ensured in coastal areas. Electricity, drinking water, and provision items should be distributed for free.

345,2020/03/20,COVID-19 takes a heavy toll on railway revenues,"Kozhikode railway station reports 50% cancellation of trains

COVID-19 threat seems to be taking a heavy toll on the revenues of the Kozhikode railway station.

The station, falling in Category A of the railways is witnessing over 50% cancellation of long-haul trains on a daily basis. The cancellation of passenger trains is over 30%, which has made a dent into the revenues of the railways. The Mangaluru-Central Coimbatore Intercity Superfast conducted service with minimum passengers on Thursday. Only four passengers were seen in one of the compartments when it departed from Kozhikode.

“Passengers are cancelling their vacations. So also group bookings since last open week,” a senior official said.

Usually, the Kozhikode station caters for around 75,000 commuters during peak seasons. Now, the number of passengers travelling from the station on a daily basis is in the range of 12,000 to 15,000 daily.

The sale of tickets at reservation counters has significantly dropped to below 1,000 a day. A reason is that passengers have started booking tickets online, while vacation goers have deferred their journeys, the official added. The Central and State governments have already asked people to avoid non-essential travel during the crucial second phase of transmission of the disease.

Owing to low occupancy, the railways have cancelled some trains such as the Thiruvananthapuram–Kannur Janshatabdi Express, Kannur–Thiruvananthapuram Janshatabdi Express, Mangaluru Central-Coimbatore Intercity Superfast Express, and the Mangaluru Central–Thiruvanananthapuram Malabar Express till March 31. These trains have usually high occupancy.

An official said Inter-State and intra-State train travel had come down. This is likely to decline further in the coming days. The refund of cancelled tickets will be credited online, while those who have booked while the reservation counters of the railways should collect the refund from the stations, he said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/9s9xgv/article31112972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20-KI-RAILWAY-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/covid-19-takes-a-heavy-toll-on-railway-revenues/article31112974.ece

The students’ union of Government Medical College, Kozhikode, and the Calicut chapter of the Kerala Medical Postgraduates Association will launch a relay hunger strike from Friday on the college campus in protest against the delay in release of stipend for medical postgraduates.

Resident doctors have a vital role in the round-the-clock functioning of government medical college hospitals, especially their casualty wards and emergency services.

The highest number of them is at Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, and Government Medical College, Kozhikode.

Mohammed Thasneem, Calicut chapter president of the association, said on Thursday that despite repeated requests and protests, resident doctors were denied stipend for February. He, however, pointed out that the association had no plans to go for other protests that would affect the functioning of the medical college hospital in view of the COVID-19 situation. “We hope that the authorities will not escalate the situation further,” Dr. Thasneem added.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/medical-postgraduates-to-go-on-relay-fast-over-stipend-delay/article31112955.ece

348,2020/03/20,Imparting messages to those who cannot hear,"Videos being made on COVID-19 for aurally challenged

These are desperate times, and the right information is necessary to stay alive.

Yet, there is a section of people who are rather unaware of the threat posed by COVID-19 as information about the pandemic is largely propagated as sound for the aurally challenged. If not for some deliberate efforts made by the All Kerala Association of the Deaf (AKAD) in association with the State government, and the singular effort of Suneer Parambil, a aurally-challenged youth from Mukkom in Kozhikode, the deaf community in the State would still be unaware of major developments.

V.A. Yusuf, secretary of the Kozhikode District Association of the Deaf, is the front-runner in imparting critical information to the aurally challenged.

His videos, explaining the developments in the universal sign language, is being propagated by AKAD through its social media pages. There have been four videos so far, including those providing general information on the disease, instructions to those coming from foreign countries, and precautions to be taken by the general public. The written messages are scrolled beneath the video for the benefit of those outside the community. Government news portals, Facebook pages of district information offices, and YouTube channels are used to propagate the videos.

Even the Chief Minister shared some AKAD videos on his Facebook page. An employee at the Chelannur block office, Yusuf is also the State chairman of the Deaf Employees Forum.

On the other hand, Suneer is a lone warrior. He has been designing videos all by himself, and they are published through his YouTube channel ABC One Deaf TV. A graphic designer by profession, Suneer is self-taught and has been doing a number of videos on various topics for the aurally challenged for quite some time. Now, all his time is dedicated to making the community aware of COVID-19.

“Most deaf people cannot read Malayalam. But I can, because I learned it till Standard 4 before I lost my hearing ability. I came across several deaf people attempting to make videos on major topics and later realising that they were making mistakes as they were not able to read. Hence, I took it as a mission,” said Suneer.

Unlike the sign language translation of news on some TV channels, Suneer’s news videos are quite elaborate that the aurally challenged will have no difficulty understanding them.

Suneer hails from a financially struggling family. Yet, his dream is to set up his own studio, so that he could create more videos for the benefit of the aurally challenged. He hopes someone would aid him financially for setting up better infrastructure to promote his venture.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/fhc0dl/article31112876.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Deaf,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/imparting-messages-to-those-who-cannot-hear/article31112877.ece

District Collector J Jayakanthan has declared that there was no patient with COVID-19 symptoms and the official machinery was keeping a vigil on persons arriving from other notified States or from abroad.

Visiting a few of the hospitals in the district and in the taluks, the Collector inquired with the health department officials about the testing facilities. He advised the staffs to ensure that there was no crowding at the hospitals.

As a preventive measure, masks and disinfectant materials such as bleaching powder and others have been provided and can be sprinkled at regular intervals. He has advised the residents to stay indoors and avoid moving out or sitting in public places such as chavadis.

The State government had advised to put off the public grievance meetings, including mass contact programs for the next fortnight. Hence, the public need not visit the Collectorate, Mr. Jayakanthan said and added that however, in the event of any issues which required to be handled urgently, public can approach the officers and submit their petitions.

The Collector has advised people not to believe rumours or any unverified posts in social media on the COVID-19 situation.

Many public places, including the busy Kamaraj bus stand and Gandhi Market wore a deserted look on Friday. Besides educational institutions being closed, the scorching sun had forced the people to stay indoors.

A section of advocates practising in the High Court Bench here on Friday wrote to the Madras High Court Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi with a request to advance the court’s summer vacation to April from May.

The request was placed following preventive measures being implemented at the Principal seat in Chennai and the High Court Bench in Madurai, in the wake of the COVID 19 threat.

As per the directions given by the Chief Justice, the advocates said that the final hearing cases could not be heard. Also, the attendance in courts would be thin with restrictions on the entry of litigant public and not more than 10 advocates inside courts at a time.

This will have an impact on the disposal of cases. Therefore in view of the emergency situation, the advancement of the summer vacation shall be considered, they said.

The agitators, who were squatting on Jinnah Tidal for 36 days pressing the Centre to revoke Citizenship (Amendment) Act day and night gave their protest following the emergency situation arising out of Corona threat.

The protesters, including women and children, started the rally from Mehaboobpalayam and reached the railway station main entrance. The leaders demanded the State Government to pass a resolution in the Assembly not to implement NPR and NRC.

352,2020/03/20,Cheating case booked against marriage hall owner,"MADURAI

A case of cheating has been booked against a private marriage hall owner in the city.

Following a complaint, Commissioner of Police Davidson Devasirvatham directed the City Crime Branch (CCB) police to register a case.

The complainant M. Joseph Rathnasami of Germanus Construction Company on bypass road had alleged that David Pratap Singh and his wife Creeda Sudasini of Pallavan Nagar on Theni Road here had cheated him to the tune of ₹ 2.05 crore.

The complaint was that the couple had approached the construction company to build a marriage hall on a land owned by them. Subsequently, after discussions, they had entered into an agreement on March 2017 to build the mandapam as per the drawing/design of the architect engaged by the couple.

However, even after having completed the civil works, they delayed payment. Repeated pleas that the mandapam was ready for occupation and had been completed as per the architect’s drawings/designs, they did not honour the agreement, Mr. Joseph had stated in the complaint and informed the investigating officer that they had even started letting it out on rent to the public, but dilly-dallied his payment.

They neither made an interim payment nor settled the final bill submitted. Despite repeated reminders, they had dishonoured the agreement.

Based on the petition, the CCB had registered a case of cheating (under IPC Section 420) against the David Pratap Singh and Creeda. Further investigation is on.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/cheating-case-booked-against-marriage-hall-owner/article31121998.ece

Madurai

A total of five people, who flew down to Madurai from Dubai, will be isolated and monitored by health professionals for the next 14 days at a quarantine facility in Chinna Udaippu village near Madurai airport as a measure to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19.

This includes a person who flew down on Thursday and the rest of them are among the passengers who arrived on Friday.

Collector T.G. Vinay said that passengers are being screened and categorised based on the directions of the Government of India.

“Category A will include passengers who show symptoms of COVID -19 like sneezing, coughing or fever. Category B will include passengers aged 60 and above or those with comorbid conditions like diabetes, cardiac arrest, or those on immunosuppressive drugs. Category C will consist of passengers who are healthy and asymptomatic,” he said.

While those belonging to Category A will be immediately referred to the isolation ward at Government Rajaji Hospital, those belonging to Category C will be sensitised to safety practices and to social distancing and will be monitored from their homes for 28 days.

So, those belonging to Category B will be monitored at the quarantine facility for 14 days, the Collector said.

“So, these five people, who fall under Category B, will be monitored at the facility for the next 14 days,” he said. The Collector added that a dedicated nodal officer, medical personnel and required facilities will be available at the centre.

The 144 passengers who arrived on Thursday were quarantined at a facility in Chinna Udaippu village and the other one at Austinpatti.

Deputy Director (Health) P. Priya Raj said that with the help of the airport officials they were able to screen the 155 passengers who had arrived on Friday and categorise them at the airport.

“So, on Friday, all passengers from Category C were stamped with indelible ink on their forearms to identify them as those who had travelled from foreign countries. Also, an affidavit was signed by each of them promising that they will quarantine themselves inside their homes for the next 28 days,” said the Collector.

The health officials from different districts have been notified on the whereabouts of these passengers. The medical officers from each of the primary health centres will regularly track the passengers for the next 28 days, he added.

These passengers were also sensitised to safety practices that they need to follow during this period.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/five-persons-who-flew-down-from-dubai-quarantined/article31121353.ece

356,2020/03/20,"Export, import via VOC Port hit badly","As COVID – 19 scare has seriously affected the export of seafood and textile products and the import of timber and machineries, those who are in the business have appealed to the State and the Central Governments to give them ‘tax holiday’ for this period.

Since the Ministry of Shipping has banned the arrival of foreign ships in the harbours across the country, export of salt, seafood, textile products etc. has been badly hit while the import of timber and machineries has come to a grinding halt, leaving those in the business in the lurch.

According to the sources in the VOC Port here, volume of cargo traffic via the seaport had come down to 60%.

Timber importer S. Paramasivan said the port, which was handling anywhere between 3,000 to 4,000 timber containers a month before GST regime, has to content with less than 2,000 timber containers as the new tax system had landed severe blow on the trade

“Now, the COVID – 19 threat has further hit the business with only 100 to 150 timber containers are arriving here from foreign countries over the past three months. Consequently, allied industries like construction, furniture making, packaging businesses have been seriously affected. Besides reducing the GST, the union government should announce tax holiday for us,” Mr. Paramasivan said.

Like the timber business, the import of machineries from the foreign countries has almost been stopped, which has affected the small and marginal entrepreneurs having their fabrication units in the port town.

Similarly, export of seafood, salt, tea and garment via VOC Port has also been seriously affected with the containers stuffed with these products are either lying in the harbour or in the seaports of various countries due to the viral infection scare.

“The 9,000-odd small and marginal fabrication units, giving employment to over 5 lakh people, have been affected badly as we cannot import the machineries required for our units. So these entrepreneurs, who have already been seriously affected by the GST, are on the brink of being eliminated from the business. So the Central and the State Governments should give us tax holiday for this turbulent period,” said K. Nehru Prakash, president of Small Scale Industries’ Association.

Meanwhile, the flower traders are facing serious loss as there is no sale of flowers after COVID-19 scare became worse. “Though we’re getting 5 tonnes of flowers everyday as usual, none came to the market to purchase flowers, forcing us to dump the fresh flowers in the garbage yard,” said P. Selvaraj, a flower trader.

Meanwhile, District Collector Sandeep Nanduri and Corporation Commissioner V.P. Jayaseelan held discussion with the representatives from famous temples, churches and the mosques in the district on curtailing the crowd usually gathering in these places of worship for special prayers.

The enquiry counter at the Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) and Passport Office will remain closed from March 23 to April 3, said Passport Officer (Madurai Region) T. Arun Prasad here on Friday.

Keeping in mind the need to restrict public movement, the Ministry of External Affairs had taken a number of measures in view of the COVID-19 virus threat going global.

Only those who had to go abroad urgently and required passport may contact the office as per the appointment issued online. The objective is to prevent crowding at this juncture, when the people have been advised by the government to stay home.

Visiting the PSK in the next fortnight may be postponed by senior citizens and children for any passport related queries and they can reschedule the appointments accordingly online, the officer had suggested.

358,2020/03/20,"Railway intensifies disinfection, health screening of passengers done","The State Government Health Department, along with Railway Health Department, has jointly started screening passengers entering Madurai railway junction.

Besides taking up massive disinfecting exercise on the railway platforms and coaches of trains, all those entering the railway stations are asked to wash their hands with soap.

A health official said that medical officer from State Health Department, along with paramedical staff from the Railway Health Department, has set up help desk on both the Western and Eastern entrance of the railway junction since Wednesday.

While a facility has been provided for hand washing outside the railway platform, all those enter the premises are provided with hand sanitiser.

The passengers are screened with thermal scanners. The passengers’ travel history is asked and anyone who had travelled abroad in the recent past are asked to avoid travelling. Besides, they are asked whether they had any contact with foreigners or those who had recently returned from any foreign countries, the official added.

The railway health department has increased the frequency of disinfecting the entire railway premises. Besides mopping the floor with disinfectant, the common touch places like chairs, furniture, hand rails, lift buttons and charging points are taken special care.

“This work is taken up round the clock. All the frontline staff on the railway premises like health workers, railway booking clerks, travelling ticket examiners and other officials are given masks. Even at the railway offices, sanitiser bottles have been kept outside the offices,” an official said.

The mechanical department of Southern Railway has taken up cleaning of railway coaches. “Some 300 coaches are being cleaned every day. Disinfectant are being sprayed inside all coaches,” the official added.

Blankets were not issued to the passengers of AC coaches and curtains have been removed to reduce infection.

359,2020/03/20,Demand for thermal scanner increases,"Madurai

With COVID-19 spreading globally, there is a steep increase in demand for thermal scanner across the city, resulting in a spike in the price of the product.

The thermal scanner, which does not require any physical contact, is used to check the body temperature of a person from a distance. It is identified as a safe way to check if a person has fever without any physical contact.

T.D. Ramesh, proprietor, Modern Electronics, says that thermal scanners were earlier sold for a maximum of ₹3,000. “But, currently, even if customers are willing to pay ₹ 8,500, there is no availability of products in the market,” he says. He adds that hospitals, manufacturing units and hotels have been repeatedly enquiring about the availability of the product for the last few days.

A staff working at Sri Kumaran Surgical Traders says that there is a huge shortage of thermal scanners across the country. “Usually, the product is manufactured in China and is then imported to India. But, the outbreak of COVID-19 in China has affected the import of the products into the country,” he says.

Since work from home strategy is not viable for manufacturing units there is a need to screen employees before they enter the premises, says Sivakumar Jeyaraman, head HR, J. K. Fenner India Limited.

“Ten days back, we procured two thermal scanners for which we paid an additional amount of ₹ 1,000 and bought it for ₹2,500. But, at other branches across the country, including Mumbai, we are unable to procure the device,” he says.

Concurring with this view, M. Britto, partner in JVS Export, says that even on e-commerce platforms, there is no stock left. “Though we are ready to pay ₹8,000, we are unable to procure them. We have been enquiring about the availability of the device across the state,” he says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/d97lr1/article31120884.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA21CITY-THERMALSCANNERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/demand-for-thermal-scanner-increases/article31120885.ece
360,2020/03/20,Restoration of tanks is for public good: HC,"Madurai

Dismissing a batch of petitions filed by various Chairpersons of panchayats challenging Madurai Collector’s order that called for tenders to clean and de-silt tanks and ponds in the district, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court observed the petitions were an attempt to scuttle a scheme initiated for the welfare of the public.

The court was hearing the petitions questioning the Collector’s decision to call for tenders to clean and de-silt tanks and ponds to ensure free flow of water. The petitioners claimed that it was the exclusive right of the panchayats to frame schemes and utilise the funds allotted to carry out such works.

They contended that the order of the Collector was a direct encroachment on the power of the panchayats and their financial status. Also, the order directly encroached on the decision making capacity and the functioning of the panchayats, they said.

Justice C.V. Karthikeyan observed that there was no infringement on the rights of the panchayats. A decision had been taken for public good and welfare and it would be sanguine on the part of the panchayats to join hands in this welfare object.

The panchayats can pass resolutions to second the objects, but taking efforts to scuttle the objects cannot be appreciated. A panchayat chairperson would be expected to join hands with the government in the execution of such works and not put a spoke in the wheel to obstruct such work, the court said.

The court cannot be used to prevent a laudable scheme from being implemented, the court said.

The court took cognisance of the fact that tanks and ponds in 230 villages in Madurai district required deepening and strengthening works. These works were necessary and essential. The restoration works whether done by the panchayat or the government was for the benefit of the public, the court said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/restoration-of-tanks-is-for-public-good-hc/article31120746.ece
361,2020/03/20,Need to rehabilitate homeless amidst COVID- 19 scare,"It’s time to provide shelters with adequate food and healthcare facility

Madurai

In the wake of the spread of COVID -19 across the country, there is a need to provide proper shelters with adequate food and healthcare facilities for the homeless people in the city, for at least the next two weeks, say activists and social workers.

The homeless, who have very poor access to food, shelter and basic hygiene, are vulnerable to COVID - 19 infection, says G.R. Sivakumar, Director of Idhayam Trust, a non-governmental organisation involved in the rescue of abandoned elderly in the city.

“Due to lack of access to public facilities, most of the homeless in the city have not taken a bath in many days. Many of them are not even aware of the safety practices that they need to adopt regarding COVID- 19. Hence, it is important that officials rehabilitate them to prevent the possibility of the transmission of COVID- 19 infections,” he says.

V.P. Manikandan, an activist, says that among the homeless found in the city, most of them are aged above 60 years and have various ailments. “They have a weak immune system and are easily susceptible to be infected,” he says.

The officials must rehabilitate and quarantine them as a precautionary measure to prevent the possible spread of COVID -19, says Mr. Sivakumar.

With the help of the volunteers, officials must identify the spots across the city where the homeless people are present and rescue them immediately, says V. Ramachandran, policy researcher, Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities.

“For instance, in Madurai, the homeless are usually found at the railway station, MGR bus stand, Mariamman Teppakulam, Palanganatham and Arapalayam,” he says.

Activists point out that after rescuing them, the homeless can be rehabilitated at the Corporation schools, community halls, marriage halls or at old Madurai Corporation buildings in the city where adequate toilet and drinking water facilities are available.

“They must also provide food and medical kits for the homeless at these shelters for at least the next 15 days,” he says.

Mr. Sivakumar requests that philanthropists can give away some abandoned building as a shelter for the homeless for the next two days.

Collector T.G. Vinay says that there are urban shelters for the homeless in the city, which are under the purview of the civic body. In addition, there are old age homes run by the Social Welfare Department. “We will instruct the officials and take necessary action,” he says.

Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan says that he will inspect the places where the homeless are found and adds that he had instructed the health officials to sensitise the abandoned regarding safe handwashing practices. “The civic body has also set up water syntaxes and has provided soaps at public places,” he says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/f8ov1q/article31120376.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA21CITY-HOMELESSPEOPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/need-to-rehabilitate-homeless-amidst-covid-19-scare/article31120377.ece

Muthukumar said the single judge was hearing the case filed by a man from Madurai who had sought compensation for the death of his wife due to medical negligence. The husband had blamed the staff at K. Pudur Urban Primary Health Centre for his wife’s death.

However, the court had taken a serious view of the case and questioned both the Police Inspector and health officials as to why the reasons of the woman’s death were not properly communicated to the husband.

The Inspector of Police said that there was no negligence or lapse on his part and the husband in his writ petition had not sought any action against him.

“It seems the father was elated when the child was born because his mother who died five months ago said she would come back into his life in the form of a female child. The mother too was educated about feeding the child by anganwadi workers,” she said.

She added that on that fateful day when the child did not drink breastmilk and was instead crying, the child had died.

366,2020/03/20,Displaced residents demand more bus services to Rajakoor,"When buses arrive late, boys tend to avoid going to school fearing punishment

A maid residing in Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board tenements at Rajakoor off Sivaganga highway says her income has nearly halved after she shifted residence from South Gate in the heart of the city.

“When I was residing in the city, I used to work at seven houses. Now I can work at just three houses as I have to rush to Periyar bus stand to return home as buses to Rajakoor are very few. I wait for hours at bus stop every day to board 42B,” she says.

Another resident says she feels anxious every evening while waiting for the bus in which her 16-year-old daughter returns from school. “Due to the limited number of bus services, my daughter arrives late every day. Sometimes, in frustration, I even think of stopping her from going to school,” she says.

For around 400 families, who reside in the tenements at distant Rajakoor, infrequent bus services of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) has multi-fold consequences - restrained access to the city is affecting their very livelihood; it will lead to school dropouts, to cite a few.

All that the residents want is regular bus services throughout the day, especially during peak hours.

In 2011, 1,566 flats were constructed at Rajakoor under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. People from 14 places across the city, whose houses encroached upon waterbodies and government poramboke lands, were evicted and settled at these multi-storeyed apartments, to make Madurai ‘slum-free.’ However only about 400 families reside at these flats now. Many of them have returned to the city, citing lack of livelihood options at the distant place. Currently, an additional 1,088 flats are being constructed under ‘Housing for All’ scheme.

S. Pandiammal, a resident, says the first city bus comes at 5 a.m. This bus usually comes on time and many conservancy workers board it to reach their workplaces early in the morning. However, as the day progresses, the buses come at irregular intervals. Moreover, these buses are worn out and break down often,” she says.

“When buses do not come on time, we take share autorickshaws to Karuppayoorani and from there board buses to Anna bus stand. Again we have to board other modes of transport to reach our respective workplaces. So the one way fare alone costs ₹45. We are paid ₹150 a day and most part of it goes for the transport,” says R. Arivupandian, another resident.

If 42B to Periyar bus stand is run every hour, it will be a great relief to all, he says.

V. Ramachandran, policy researcher, Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities, a voluntary organisation, says infrequent bus service also acts as one of the factors for high dropout rate among boys. “When buses arrive late, some boys avoid going to their schools fearing punishment. Hence, many students bunk classes, go to places which normally see only a few visitors during daytime and are exposed to banned tobacco products,” he says.

Another problem at Rajakoor is defunct street lights, as women and girls feel unsafe when they return at night. Ms. Pandiammal says she and her family members, who are karagattam performers, sleep at bus stands and in front of community halls to avoid travelling through the dark streets of their complex. “Since we are living in the 35th block, we have to walk a long distance in the dark. I am also worried about the safety of my daughter who is also a karagattam performer,” she says.

All these factors have discouraged the women from rejoining the workforce, she adds. A senior official of the TNSCB says they have written to the TNSTC to increase the bus frequency to Rajakoor.

Bus stand work

A TNSTC official says the problem has arisen due to the construction work at Periyar bus stand. “Six buses used to serve Rajakoor through two routes (Simmakkal and East Gate).

Deputy Commissioner Sindhu B. Rupesh has said that officials from Thursday began categorising passengers from abroad during the screenings at Mangaluru International Airport to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Addressing presspersons, she said that those having symptoms of COVID-19 have been put under ‘A’ category and sent to hospitals for isolation, confirmation and for the next procedures as per the standard operating procedure.

Those who are diabetic, having high blood pressure and having other chronic diseases are classified as ‘B’ (medium risk) category even if they did not exhibit any symptoms and compulsorily put under observation in the government hospitals for 14 days.

Those who do not have any symptoms are classified as C (low risk) category and are allowed to go home and are home quarantined for 14 days. They are put ‘home quarantined’ marks on their forearms.

She said that of the total number of passengers who arrived by Dubai-Mangaluru flight on March 14, the passengers from Dakshina Kannada stood at 51. All 51 of them have now been home quarantined as one of the passengers in the same flight, who was from Kasaragod, had tested positive for COVID-19.

372,2020/03/20,HDFC sees lower credit card spend,"Card metrics for March show slump, says UBS report

Private sector lender HDFC Bank, the largest issuer of credit cards in the country, is witnessing reduced credit card spending in March after a steady January and February.

“Credit card spends remained healthy in January-February 2020 but have reduced in March. [The] management is currently tightening the underwriting standards for the bank,” UBS Securities wrote in a note to its clients after a conference call with the HDFC Bank management.

“People have shifted to online spending; and food delivery and online spending have increased. But in the case of a complete lockdown, the management expects a decline in customer spending,” the report noted.

The spread of COVID-19 is impacting consumer demand with some States contemplating a complete lockdown. The Maharashtra government announced on Friday that all shops, private establishments and offices in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Nagpur will be closed from midnight till March 31, with the exception of banks, essential services and shops selling essential commodities.

The HDFC Bank management has said that the trends in unsecured retail asset quality are stable as 80% of the unsecured loans are to salaried employees.

The bank said the SME portfolio is well diversified — geographically and industry wise — and the bank does not expect significant impact on the asset quality.

“[About] 70-75% of SME loans are secured. The bank also has accounts of promoters and employees that helps the bank in tracking the health of SMEs. The bank has low exposure to airlines. It has limited exposure to restaurants and hospitality business but believes the situation is too early to comment upon,” the report said.

HDFC Bank expects a 50 bps rate cut in the next two quarters. The lender has recently reduced fixed deposit rates but not the savings interest rates.

“The asset-liability committee is likely to take a call on the same. While some States have directed government departments to keep deposits with PSU banks, the recent RBI advisory should offset any impact,” the report said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rzfm97/article31122328.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THBUHDFCCARD,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/hdfc-sees-lower-credit-card-spend/article31122330.ece

374,2020/03/20,DPIIT notifies decision to permit NRIs to own up to 100% stake in Air India,"On March 4, the cabinet had taken a decision in this regard.

The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) has notified a decision of the union cabinet to allow non-resident Indians (NRIs) to control up to 100% stake in disinvestment-bound Air India.

The FDI policy earlier permitted NRIs to take only 49% stake in the airline.

In its press note, the DPIIT said: “Foreign investments in Air India including that of foreign airlines shall not exceed 49 per cent either directly or indirectly except in case of those NRIs, who are Indian Nationals, where foreign investment is permitted up to 100 per cent under automatic route”.

On March 4, the cabinet had taken a decision in this regard.

The decision came at a time when the government has sought preliminary bids for 100% stake sale in the national carrier.

It also said that the condition that substantial ownership and effective control (SOEC) of Air India shall continue to be vested in Indian nationals.

An official statement has earlier stated that in light of the proposed strategic disinvestment of 100% of Air India by the government, it has been decided that foreign investment in Air India be brought on a level-playing field with other scheduled airline operators.

The national carrier will have no residual government ownership and will be completely privately owned.

After four days of continued sell off in the equity markets, Indian benchmarks gained strong ground on Friday amid a global rally in stocks.

The 30-share Sensex gained 1,627.73 points, or 5.75%, to close at 29,915.96. The broader Nifty settled the day at 8,745.45, gaining 482 points, or 5.83%.

This was the first gain for the indices after four consecutive days of losses. Incidentally, the India VIX index also fell a little over 7% on Friday.

Elsewhere in Asia, the benchmarks of Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Singapore and Philippines all ended Friday with strong gains.

“Indian markets bounced back on the back of positive global cues,” said Gaurav Dua, head, capital market strategy and investments, Sharekhan.

“The news flow on the spread of COVID-19 continues to be mixed with an exponential jump in new cases in the U.S. though there is an improving trend in China. Thus, the volatility could persist in the near term,” added Mr. Dua.

While most of the frontline stocks gained ground on Friday after falling to multi-year lows, many of the side counters lost ground as well as a little over 1,000 stocks declined as against 1,426 gainers.

377,2020/03/20,Will Modi’s COVID-19 fund initiative revive SAARC?,"Only robust political will and cooperation, not conflict, can lead to development in the region

On Sunday, while addressing the leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) member states, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed the creation of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) Emergency Fund for SAARC. Mr. Modi’s sudden proposal came as a surprise to many, as the Indian government has maintained for many years now that SAARC has not been successful in containing the regional threat of terrorism. The last SAARC summit was held in Kathmandu in 2014. The 19th SAARC summit, scheduled to be held in Islamabad, was cancelled after the September 18, 2016 attack on the military base in Uri. Since then, India, the largest SAARC country, has held that the grouping has inherent problems and has instead highlighted the role of newer outfits like the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) as an alternative to SAARC to deliver on connectivity, development, and counter-terrorism efforts. In a conversation moderated by Kallol Bhattacherjee, Major General (Retired) Abdur Rashid and Qamar Agha discuss the relevance of SAARC today. Edited excerpts:

Do you think Mr. Modi’s initiative will help SAARC?

Major General Abdur Rashid: There are certainly many commonalities [among these nations] regarding threats and perceptions of threats. Such initiatives will always be welcome. This initiative [Mr. Modi calling for a SAARC meeting] came as a bolt from the blue since everyone thought SAARC is now in the coffin. But once the meeting was initiated by Mr. Modi, it was welcomed. The people of Bangladesh have also shown a positive attitude. Besides, there is concern about the problem in all these countries. We can talk and keep moving ahead. This will reduce tension and create robust cooperation.

Qamar Agha: I fully support the Major General’s argument. The region is integrated culturally and historically. There have been migrations for centuries within the region and we have always been cooperating with one another. It was after British rule that the visa passport regime was introduced. After SAARC, we thought cooperation would develop. It was, in fact, developing. We have common problems: not just COVID-19 but other enormous problems including water sharing and poverty. If we come together, that will once again lead to cooperation.

An initiative such as the creation of a health fund was not tried earlier, though the SAARC Charter hints at such cooperation. Given the absence of a collaborative spirit between India and Pakistan, is there a spirit in SAARC to prevent such front-line threats?

Major General Abdur Rashid: The concerns of every nation should be addressed in SAARC. Leaving Pakistan aside, you can see how other organisations like BIMSTEC are growing because every nation is on board there. Regarding SAARC, we have to see that all nations are on board and see if we can create a common platform. This fund is a good proposal. Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina accepted the proposal happily.

There have been concerns about the relevance of SAARC, especially after the Islamabad summit could not be held. Do you think India-Pakistan problems could once again create trouble for the grouping’s revival?

Qamar Agha: Pakistan should realise that the future of the region lies in cooperation with India. Not just India, the Afghan government is also having a very bitter experience in dealing with Pakistan as they say militants are coming from Pakistan. Nevertheless, Pakistan is a very important country and that is why we insist that Pakistan should come on board.

But over the last few years we have been repeatedly told by leading Indian policymakers and officials, including External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, that there are inherent problems in SAARC. So, is India’s effort sincere?

Major General Abdur Rashid: Security is of great concern in the region and the India-Pakistan security situation certainly affected SAARC. But India-Bangladesh cooperation has become a great example of security management. We in Bangladesh have also been quite concerned about Pakistan’s attitude towards terrorism as they have an internal force which always promotes terrorism. So automatically we have to take into consideration every nation’s concern [in SAARC] on this. I am sure if we can build a robust political will, SAARC may go higher. If we live with suspicion and lack of trust, then development will be reversed. I think Pakistan has also learnt that conflict and tension cannot take the country ahead. At the moment, Bangladesh has gone ahead with development plans and it has shown that ties with India can go ahead.

In view of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s recent statement which indicated that the country is not prepared to deal with the crisis, it’s natural to ask if Pakistan will show political will for a SAARC collaboration and, consequently, for its revival.

Qamar Agha: I think they are gradually coming around. The problem is so big that no country can handle this alone. Pakistan borders Iran and it’s a common problem for the whole region. The problem in Pakistan is that the elected government traditionally has tried to establish good ties with India. But all the leaders — whether Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto or Nawaz Sharif — have faced major setbacks. The Pakistani military establishment is still reluctant to deal with us but circumstances are forcing Pakistan to at least cooperate on this issue. Second, they are also facing a very serious economic crisis in the country. Earlier they used to get money from oil-rich countries but oil prices have fallen and these countries also have troubles such as the war in Yemen. Pakistan is totally dependent on China but this too cannot go on for long as China-U.S. ties are also evolving. So, a situation like the 1990s, when cooperation was possible, is once again a possibility. Later normalisation of relations may also be possible.

There are other problems that are emerging among SAARC member countries like the proposal for a country-wide National Register of Citizens in India. This has triggered concern in Bangladesh. There’s also the Madhesi issue with Nepal and the border dispute in Kalapani. Can the revival plan of SAARC overcome these challenges?

Major General Abdur Rashid: India is a big neighbour, so automatically all the smaller countries that surround it will have some concerns about it. So, cooperation from India to look after the concerns of its smaller neighbours is very important.

From Bangladesh’s point of view, we have solved the land boundary agreement (LBA) and exchanged the enclaves. We conducted it very peacefully without dislocating a large number of people. In comparison, 1947 was a humanitarian disaster as far as dislocation of lives was concerned. We have established that we can solve bilateral problems with India. All SAARC countries must have the political will on how to address such differences with India. Bangladesh maintains that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act is an internal matter of India’s. Bangladesh will respond when it creates an impact on us.

The most important thing is that government-to-government cooperation is not enough. The more long-lasting thing is people-to-people ties. In this, India and Bangladesh are far ahead than India and Pakistan. It is not just with India but also with Myanmar.

Ms. Hasina has emphasised a peaceful solution to the Rohingya issue. If India can emulate these ideals and mentality to support smaller neighbours, we can build a peaceful South Asian region.

Do you think issues like NRC and CAA can create hurdles for SAARC?

Qamar Agha: CAA is a difficult issue because there is some internal opposition too. Barring Pakistan, other SAARC states have accepted that it is India’s internal affair. But the security issue will remain important as far as Pakistan is concerned. But as far as other mechanisms are concerned, with other neighbours of India, they are working. We have organisations like BIMSTEC and bilateral engagements to deal with these differences. Almost with all the countries of the region, India has managed relation so far, except with Pakistan. Pakistan cannot achieve its objectives with the help of militancy. The economic situation is bad in Pakistan and foreign investment is not pouring in as there is a possibility that Pakistan could be placed on the blacklist in the Financial Action Task Force. I am hopeful that the SAARC summit will take place in Islamabad or in an alternative location.

When an organisation is not used for some time, it loses its strength. This is also true for SAARC. What can be done now to help boost SAARC?

Major General Abdur Rashid: SAARC lacked momentum for some time. After SAARC, we had started BBIN [Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal], BIMSTEC, BCIM [Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar Economic Corridor]. Leaving aside Pakistan, the security concern of India will not be resolved. This time an opportunity has been given to Pakistan, as pointed out by Mr Agha. Bangladesh is equally concerned about Pakistan’s patronisation of terror elements. Jaish-e-Mohammed supports outfits in Bangladesh too, and we have lot of examples on that front. Therefore, we need to build trust and Pakistan will have to give the first commitment that it will not support these unethical forces. As discussed here, Pakistan has a unique civil-military problem. But Bangladesh has shown the way as it exercises political control over its military and focuses on development and that is why we are in a better position. Neighbours will have problems but we have to solve these issues amicably. The LBA and maritime boundary agreements have also shown the way for SAARC. Social and cultural contacts should be fostered to help people-to-people contact within SAARC.

What can India do to boost SAARC at this juncture beyond the COVID-19 crisis?

Qamar Agha: Individual countries cannot develop because we are in the age of globalisation. Fostering economic integration and development, supporting social and educational development and integration are some of the important things that India can do. India has been developing connectivity with Myanmar, Bangladesh, Thailand. So similarly we sought to have connectivity with Pakistan but that did not happen. Now we are trying to build that in Chabahar. These are some of the things that need to be boosted further in SAARC.

378,2020/03/20,Waiting patiently for information during a pandemic,"It is difficult to contact officials but getting accurate information is worth the effort

For a reporter, not every phone call and not every effort to meet an official ends as expected. Our aim is to not only get information, but to get information that is accurate. Especially at a time like this, when we are at the centre of a global pandemic, no information can be published without ascertaining its accuracy first. Putting forth credible information is our most important responsibility.

For a State like Tamil Nadu, disease outbreaks are nothing new for public health officials. While these outbreaks — whether chikungunya, H1N1 influenza, or dengue — have provided them numerous lessons and experiences, they have also taught them how to handle queries from journalists covering health.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

But unlike the previous outbreaks, the COVID-19 outbreak has pushed the officials to take an important decision. After years of contemplating it and even mentioning it on a number of occasions, COVID-19 has forced the State’s Health and Family Welfare Department to issue health bulletins. The first such bulletin came out in the first week of February. What prompted the Department were numerous calls from journalists, and the need to provide daily updates to journalists.

These bulletins, released anytime between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. every day, have come in handy but they have limited information. There are many things that journalists need to know apart from what the bulletins provide. We need to know know many passengers have been screened at airports, how many patients are under quarantine in hospital, and how many are under quarantine at home. To get this added information, we call or try to meet officials. However, meeting them is almost impossible now, except at press conferences.

I made a quick count of the number of calls I made to various officials of the Health Department over the past two-three days. They ranged anywhere between 10 to 15 calls. Many of these calls went unanswered; often, the number was busy. Apart from this, I have also been spending a lot of time simply staring at WhatsApp or SMS, fervently hoping that the official will reply to my messages.

Some officials do make life easy for journalists. They provide the right information at the right time. However, there are some who never do so.

A reporter has to understand that he or she isn’t the only journalist trying to reach the official; there are several others. And these officials, who form the core team working to control and prevent the spread of the disease, have a series of meetings every day. Some of them do answer immediately or call back in between meetings, in hushed tones.

It is crucial to understand the seriousness of the ongoing global health crisis, and their role in tackling it. Journalists must remember that many public health officials and their teams, numbering hundreds, have been working across Tamil Nadu since mid-January. Every time I make a call, I ensure that I remember that he or she has a job at hand. Yes, it is important for them to provide information, but it is equally a responsibility for journalists like me to keep trying, to wait patiently to get authentic information.

The last few weeks have been challenging, especially in terms of reaching officials. These are days that cannot be planned until we are COVID-19-free. But it is worth the effort to keep dialling the officials.",comment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gd79s7/article26612518.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/diary-notebook,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/waiting-patiently-for-information-during-a-pandemic/article31111201.ece
379,2020/03/20,Need for re-orientation,"State universities will have to deliver more to the State where they are located

Out of about a thousand higher education institutions (HEIs) that are authorised to award degrees in India, about 400 are state public universities that produce over 90% of our graduates (including those from the colleges affiliated to them) and contribute to about one-third of the research publications from this country. That their quality and performance is poor in most cases is accepted as a given today. It is evidenced by their poor performance in institutional rankings, the poor employment status of their students, rather poor quality of their publications, negligible presence in national-level policy/decision-making bodies, poor track record in receiving national awards and recognition, poor share in research funding and so on.

Commonly stated reasons for these observations include government/political interference in the management of the university, lack of autonomy, poor governance structures, corruption, poor quality of teachers, outdated curricula, plagiarism, poor infrastructure and facilities, overcrowding, evils of the “affiliation” system and poor linkages with alumni and industry.

While many of these observations are no doubt valid, they appear to be only the symptoms and consequences of some deeper malaise and not the underlying cause. For example, it is often said that you cannot expect much quality from these universities as they are run by the government. This is a fallacious statement since many of the HEI s like the IIT s are doing relatively better than other institutions even though they are government institutions. Lack of a proper diagnosis of the problem has led to fragmented and ineffective approaches to improving the performance of state universities. An attempt is made here to identify a core causative factor for this malaise.

Support for Central institutions

Central government HEIs are valuable and should be supported in all ways. That they have hardly ever been short of funding and patronage has been ensured by the Central government and its arms; national-level parties, industries and businesses; and the national elite and the intelligentsia. It is the existence of such an unwritten contract at the national level that appears to be the key factor for the performance of these Central government institutions.

However, a similar consensus and contract has never been built between the State universities and State governments, State-level political parties and organisations, industry and businesses; and the elite and the intelligentsia. It is as though State-level players do not have much stake in the stability and performance of the State university system.

One reason why State-level players do not feel compelled to back the State university system more strongly could be that the latter does not commit itself to anything that may be of particular interest and value to the State where the university is located. The aims, goals, methods and priorities of these institutions are pretty much the same as those of the Central institutions. The only real value add that the State universities are doing for the State and its people seems to be that of enabling a few lakhs to become graduates every year.

For a state contract

In order to receive much more funding and support from the State system then, State universities would have to commit to delivering lots more to the State and its people where they are located. They must come up with a new vision and programmes specifically addressing the needs of the State, its industry, economy and society, and on the basis of it make the State-level players commit to providing full ownership and support to them. In other words establish a contract between the State universities and the State system similar to what seems to be existing between the Central institutions and the Central government and other national-level stakeholders.

The initiative to start a larger dialogue on the future of our State universities would have to be taken primarily by the academic community of these institutions.

380,2020/03/20,"Drastic, but necessary: On Supreme Court stripping Manipur Minister of his office","Speakers must realise that deliberate inaction on defection matters is no more an option

The Supreme Court’s order stripping a Manipur Minister of his office and barring him from entering the State Assembly may appear drastic and unusual, but is quite a reasonable and necessary course of action. T. Shyamkumar was elected as a Congress candidate, but defected to the BJP to join the Biren Singh Cabinet. In a landmark judgment in January, which put an end to the deliberate inaction of Presiding Officers on petitions for disqualifying defectors, a Bench headed by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman had ruled that courts have the power to fix a time-frame for Speakers to dispose of petitions under the anti-defection law. In the Manipur case, the court had given a reasonable period of four weeks — the defection complaint is pending since 2017 — but the Speaker failed to comply with it. On March 4, he had promised a decision within 10 days, but on March 18, he again sought time. It is in this background that the court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to take the sort of measures that would kick in if the defector concerned had been disqualified. The order is interim in nature, and the next hearing is on March 30. This means that the Speaker can still decide the matter, but a strong message has been sent out that courts will no more aid them in their attempts to protect defectors from the consequences of their floor-crossing.

The possible objections to the order keeping the Minister out are two-fold: that it goes beyond the court’s power of judicial review, and that any intervention in a matter under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution (the anti-defection law) can be made only after the Speaker’s final decision. However, it ought to be borne in mind that it was out of respect for the Speaker’s powers that the court refrained from deciding the matter itself, though there was ample evidence that the Speaker had failed to discharge his duty. His obvious reluctance to decide the matter even within an extended deadline necessitated the latest course of action. In any case, as pointed out in the January verdict, a 2007 precedent (Rajendra Singh Rana) is available to show that ‘failure to exercise jurisdiction’ is a stage at which the court can intervene. The order is a natural follow-on measure after the earlier decision opened a window for judicial intervention whenever Speakers refuse to act on legitimate complaints that some members had incurred disqualification. It is quite disappointing that the Manipur Speaker did not meet the court’s deadline even after it was made clear that inaction is no more a legal option for him. This only underscores the importance of the other limb of the court’s earlier judgment recommending that Parliament consider creating a new mechanism to replace the ‘Speaker’ as the adjudicating authority under the Tenth Schedule.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/drastic-but-necessary-the-hindu-editorial-on-supreme-court-stripping-manipur-minister-of-his-office/article31111519.ece
381,2020/03/20,Waiting for Rajini: On the super star’s politics,"Rajinikanth’s aspirations are far above the efforts he is willing to put in as a leader

Two years after declaring himself worthy of filling the perceived political vacuum in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth appears confused and doubting. Not only has he ruled himself personally out of the electoral race, but mandated his followers to show “a wave of resurgence” among the people for him to launch a party. By placing such an impractical condition a year before the Assembly elections, he has lent credence to the charge that he is a reluctant political player with a big gap between aspiration and effort. He expects people’s endorsement for his three-point strategy for an alternative model of politics. He envisages heading a party but appointing a young, visionary and knowledgeable person as Chief Minister; fielding young candidates, 65% of them aged below 50; and disbanding the party organisation structure after the election retaining only a minimal set of office-bearers, apparently to prevent party leaders from fighting for the spoils of power. Separating party leadership from elected office is not novel as the founders of the Shiv Sena and Pattali Makkal Katchi have shown. But this model, far from promoting abstinence as practised by Mahatma Gandhi or Jayaprakash Narayan, will result in creating extra-constitutional authorities. Though Rajinikanth insisted that there will be no parallel power structure, he had no qualms in saying he would replace the Chief Minister — a job legitimately belonging to legislators — should the need arise. Clearly, he wants to retain power in the very act of renouncing it.

Rajinikanth’s indecisiveness perhaps could be attributed to his reading of the ground situation and refusal to accept anything short of a spectacular victory. This goes against the essence of his stated goal to usher in political reforms to cleanse the system. At the dawn of 2018, he was confident of utilising the space created by the political exit of Jayalalithaa and M. Karunanidhi. Down the line, the AIADMK and DMK have filled the leadership vacuum. In fact, Rajinikanth has conceded that star power could at best make him a vote divider. He has also concluded that it is a “now or never” opportunity to oust the Dravidian giants. Referring to Gandhiji’s and Swami Vivekananda’s transformational moments in Tamil Nadu, he says he wants a 1967-like ‘revolution’, when C.N. Annadurai led a regional party to power for the first time. What he fails to realise is that these personalities had drawn people to participative democracy, and not expected their supporters to deliver political power to them in a neat package. If he desires to lead, Rajinikanth should show the way and not expect others to propel him to power to fulfil an as yet unarticulated political agenda.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/waiting-for-rajinikanth-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-super-stars-politics/article31111548.ece
382,2020/03/20,"Aadhaar services stopped, passport appointments cut by half","While the COVID-19 scare has kept most people at home, those who want to make use of the situation and get work such as updating of Aadhaar or passport services will have to wait.

Most Aadhaar seva kendras in the city have stopped providing services as they have to take biometrics of people for every service. On the other hand, appointments at passport seva kendras have been reduced by half effective Friday as a precautionary measure.

“We have reduced appointments by 50% effective today. Applicants themselves are also refraining as footfalls have reduced. There are also a lot of travel restrictions in place. As a result, we have halved the number of appointments in all seva kendras across the State. In Lalbagh, for example, instead of 1200 appointments, 600 will be given,” Regional Passport Officer, Bengaluru, Bharath Kumar Kuthati told The Hindu.

With the Ministry of External Affairs’ directive to reduce appointments coming in on Thursday evening, officials had to request applicants at the Lalbagh passport seva kendra on Friday to return home if they were suffering from symptoms or did not want the passport service as an emergency.

“We are also encouraging applicants to refrain. Normally, applicants are allowed to reschedule appointments up to three times. But as this is a special situation, we have lifted the cap,” Mr. Kuthati said, adding that these arrangements would continue until April 4.

At the seva kendras, applicants are being asked to sanitise their hands before entering the facility. Thermal screening is also expected to be deployed soon.

COVID precautions are announced at regular intervals and people are asked to maintain distance while waiting for their turn.

“The staff are also getting sanitised and common areas are also being frequently sanitised. At Koramangala, we’ve completely stopped receiving any applicants till March 31. The biometric equipment is also being sanitised after every applicant. We are taking all basic precautions and not leaving anything to chance,” the regional passport officer added.

Although the Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar had last week announced that biometrics would be stopped in Vidhana Soudha , that decision is yet to be taken.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/aadhaar-services-stopped-passport-appointments-cut-by-half/article31117606.ece

Shopkeepers claimed that these products were flying off the shelves and they were not getting new stock.

“We got supply of 82 bottles two days ago and they were sold out in less than an hour,” said a shopkeeper in Vidyaranyapura.

In Murgeshpalya, supermarkets that had stocks now have none, said Sanjana. S., who managed to buy two bottles a week ago.

The demand shooting up has also led to shops rationing sales of what’s available. When Rajanna found a shop that had disinfectant liquid, he was allowed to buy only two.

The mad rush for these have also given rise to many unknown brands making an appearance in the markets and on online. In one shop in Malleshpalya, a supermarket was filling smaller bottles from a big bottle of sanitiser and selling them separately.

Consumers said some shops were selling some unknown brands of sanitisers for ₹100 a bottle, which is more than the price of well known brands.

Measures taken by Amazon

An Amazon spokesperson said the company had already listed measures taken to tackle situations arising out of the pandemic.

According to a post on its blog, the company has seen an increase in demand for such products. ""We believe our role of serving customers and the community during this time is a critical one, and we want to make sure people can get the items they need, when they need them.

South Western Railway (SWR) has suspended an official for allegedly not disclosing the travel history of her son who later tested positive for COVID-19. She had also provided him accommodation in a rest house run by the Railways near Krantiveera Sangolli Rayanna (Bengaluru) railway station — one of the busiest stations in the city — in an attempt to isolate him from family members.

The rest house has 12 rooms and all of them were occupied during his stay there. In a statement on Friday, the chief public relations officer of the SWR said the suspended officer is an Assistant Personnel Officer in Bengaluru Division and had requested accommodation for her family in a rest house run by the Railways in the city. She, however, had failed to mention that her son had travelled abroad.

All the officers and families who stayed in the rest house are being informed to be on alert for symptoms, if any,” the PRO said in a statement.

The SWR has shared the details of people who stayed at the rest house, with the State government. The entire premises was fumigated. The statement from the PRO also states that the official’s son himself went to hospital for medical tests and on March 18 tested positive for COVID–19.

Divisional Railway Manager of Bengaluru Division Ashok Kumar Verma said, “The official had booked a room in the rest house to isolate her son from the rest of the family as there were elderly people.

At the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital where two patients, who tested positive for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are being treated, and a few others are under observation in isolation wards, a special diet is being provided for patients. Planned by the hospital’s chief dietician, the diet takes into account the various needs of the patients, including their health status and the State/country to which they belong.

RGGGH dean R. Jayanthi said a special diet plan was drawn up, and it was altered as per the needs of individual patients -- their health condition, co-morbidities, and calorie needs. “We also take into account the State or country they are from. For instance, when we had Chinese patients, we provided them noodles. We also have continental cuisine,” she said.

The food is served in eco-friendly and disposable plates and cups, she added. “We have placed dispensers in the isolation wards so that patients can have access to warm water. We are also taking care of our doctors, nurses and staff on duty at the isolation ward. We give them special food along with eggs, juice, soups and vitamin tablets. We are also installing dispensers to provide them with hot beverages such as hot chocolate,” she said.

391,2020/03/20,COVID-19: Chennai has two quarantine centres,"Each of the facilities has 50 beds, and these can be increased if necessary, Health Department officials said

Chennai now has two quarantine facilities for COVID-19, one at the Institute of Public Health (IPH), Poonamallee and one at the Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine (GHTM) at Tambaram Sanatorium. A 50-bedded quarantine facility has been set up at the new outpatient building at GHTM, and the capacity could be increased to up to 100, officials of the Health Department said.

As of now, passengers arriving from COVID-19 affected countries and who are asymptomatic are being quarantined at these centres. IPH, a training centre for the Health Department, has around 50 beds. An isolation ward has been created at the Tambaram Government Hospital (Chromepet GH) as well.

App to track contacts

The Health Department is all set to use technology to track down the contacts of patients who test positive for coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The Department, with help from the police, will put to use an app to trace contacts and alert them.

When persons test positive for COVID-19, contact tracing is one of the crucial tasks on hand for the Health Department. The State so far has three COVID-19 patients.

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said till now, the contact tracing of patients, who had tested positive for COVID-19 was done manually by health teams. For the second patient, who travelled from Delhi to Chennai and stayed in the city, the department had traced 41 of his contacts.

“All the work for tracing the contacts was done manually. Now, we are going to use technology. An app has been developed, and we will start tracing the contacts using mobile numbers,” he told The Hindu.

Superintendent of Police of Sivaganga Rohith Nathan, who had demonstrated the app, has helped the Department in setting it up in the State control room. This can track the movement of a person using mobile tower locations. Officials would be able to trace wherever the patient had moved and get the nearby contacts, thereby tracking all contacts and alerting them for home quarantine and testing, officials said.

The Minister, in the last two days, has been maintaining that there is no community transmission of COVID-19 in the State. The three COVID-19 patients in the State had travelled from Muscat, Delhi and Ireland respectively, he said.

However, he added that officials were still working on finding out how the second patient was infected as he had no travel history to an affected country.

Screening activities

“So far, we have been concentrating on screening international passengers. Now, we are taking up screening at the domestic terminal. We started this on Wednesday by screening passengers from Kerala and Delhi. However, we have now extended the screening. We were told that there are nearly 16,000 passengers arriving in 160 fights and from now on, all should be screened,” he said.

As the second patient, a resident of Uttar Pradesh, arrived in Chennai in a train, the department has tightened screening at three major railway stations in the city -- Central, Egmore and Tambaram, while continuing to screen at the districts at the inter-State borders.

“We do not have community spread now, and when it happens, it will be a huge challenge. People should avoid travel for two weeks, and this is important to prevent community transmission. We are ready to manage any situation. We have isolation wards in medical college hospitals and quarantine facilities,” he said.

On whether the number of samples lifted for testing was enough, he said they were following guidelines laid down for testing. “As of now, a person should have a travel history to an affected country or State and have symptoms of cough, fever and difficulty in breathing for testing. The Indian Council of Medical Research that provides us reagents for testing has made it clear when we should lift samples,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/5fvklp/article31116585.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20MARTH-Quarantinejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-chennai-has-two-quarantine-centres/article31116586.ece

Chennai Metro Rail will change the frequency of its trains, and there will now be a train every seven minutes throughout the day from March 23 to March 31 . Also, commuters will get direct train from Chennai Central to St. Thomas Mount every 14 minutes. Currently, Chennai Metro has been running trains every five minutes during peak hours.

394,2020/03/20,"Can be done, says Corpn. to HC poser on link between Foreshore Estate, Besant Nagar","Civic body submits pre-feasibility report that includes a suspension bridge

The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) on Thursday presented before the Madras High Court a pre-feasibility report for connecting the loop road on the Marina beach with the Elliot’s beach in Besant Nagar through an existing broken bridge.

According to the report placed before Justices Vineet Kothari and R. Suresh Kumar, a study conducted by the Corporation found it feasible to extend the loop road till Besant Nagar in order to decongest DGS Dhinakaran Road and divert vehicular traffic.

Explaining the need for the new elevated road, the report stated that the present main road which connects Santhome with Adyar was highly congested and severely traffic-prone despite being used almost on a daily basis by ministers, judges and bureaucrats.

According to drawings submitted in the court, the Corporation had planned a ramp from the loop road at Foreshore Estate leading to an elevated road which would run for about 2.4 km along the seashore before reaching the fifth avenue at Besant Nagar.

In between, the mouth of Adyar Creek could be sensitively crossed by means of a suspension bridge which shall carry two-way traffic apart from having exclusive bicycle tracks on both sides as well as pedestrian pathways to help people enjoy the beauty of the sea from the bridge.

CRZ clearance must

The existing broken bridge, constructed across the Adyar river in 1966 and washed away in the 1977 floods, should be demolished and the entire proposal could be begun only after obtaining Coastal Regulatory Zone clearance and eviction of encroachments, the Corporation added.

Stating that no development could take place without any impact or disturbance to the local populace, the civic body said, nearly 1,200 fishermen families in Srinivasapuram and Urur Kuppam would have to be relocated for the project.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/3s8kyd/article31112840.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th20citybridgecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/can-be-done-says-corpn-to-hc-poser-on-link-between-foreshore-estate-besant-nagar/article31112841.ece
395,2020/03/20,A technology to track infected persons,"Panel of Joint Secretaries gives in-principle nod to IPS officer’s proposal

Tamil Nadu IPS officer R. Rohith Nathan and his paediatrician-wife Kaveri Subbiah have submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Home Affairs to deploy a technology involving analysis of technical data, artificial intelligence and geo-fencing to effectively control the spread of COVID-19. Mr. Rohith, the Sivaganga SP, said the Ministry had approved the proposal in principle.

The focus is to use advanced technology to trace people who have come in contact with infected persons and assess their health condition for appropriate treatment or isolation. The system would also ensure that those recommended for isolation would follow the set protocol strictly and not pose a threat to the uninfected population. Analysing the precise location coordinates, movement and other activities of the infected/isolated persons to assess risk ratio and launch mitigation plans is part of the proposal sent to the Centre last fortnight.

The officer was invited to give a presentation to a panel of Joint Secretaries in New Delhi on Monday. “The panel has agreed in principle to implement the proposal across the country. We are in the process of formulating the Standard Operating Procedure to launch the digital surveillance system in Tamil Nadu to control coronavirus,” Mr. Rohith told The Hindu on Thursday.

“Using technology, we can aid the testing process to trace the coronavirus and contain its growth. Provisions of the Epidemic Disease Act 1897 can be used to permit live monitoring of cellular infrastructure without it being an infringement of privacy,” he said. “Today’s emergency health crisis requires authorities to remain one step ahead of the coronavirus. By using technology to bolster the healthcare professionals on the ground we can better contain the disease,” he added.

Presently, health officials are relying on the travel history shared by the affected person. Instead, cellular network meta data and digital footprints could be used to accurately assess the risk factors. “We will precisely know the number of people who were in the same tower location as that of the infected person. Health workers can reach out to those people and check their health status. There is technology to zero in on the proximity of other mobile phone users to the infected person,” the officer explained. “Persons who have symptoms or under the risk group can be quarantined and their compliance with the isolation standards can be ensured using geofence,” he said.

The platform once instituted could be used to contain the spread of any such epidemic and will be a long-term investment for the government’s disaster response infrastructure. Health authorities in Israel, China and Japan were working on similar lines to curb COVID-19.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/5lhvo7/article31112820.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th20ips,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-technology-to-track-infected-persons/article31112821.ece
396,2020/03/20,CJ takes serious note of protest near HC despite COVID-19 threat,"Lawyers file a memo to postpone hearing in anti-CAA protest case

Chief Justice of the Madras High Court Amreshwar Pratap Sahi on Thursday took serious note of a ‘Fill the Jails’ agitation conducted by Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath (TNTJ) right next to the court campus on Wednesday, despite the threat of COVID-19 looming large.

When advocate K.P. Chandrasekaran sought his permission to move an urgent public interest litigation petition seeking criminal action against the Jamath, the Chief Justice disapproved of such a protest having been organised unmindful of the Coronavirus outbreak.

After the lawyer claimed that the police had failed to prevent a huge number of protesters from gathering at the Esplanade Road on the basis of a call given by TNTJ, the Chief Justice warned that the court would have to take a very serious note of such lapse on the part of the police. However, State Government Pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayanan told the court that a huge batch of cases filed both for and against anti-CAA protests were pending before a Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and Krishnan Ramasamy and they were scheduled to be heard on Friday.

Following such submission, the Chief Justice told the advocate that he shall order listing of his case too before the same Bench. Later, in the day, a PIL was filed in the name of 31-year-old advocate P.C. Saranya seeking action against the Jamath for having organised the protest.

In the meantime, senior counsel R. Vaigai filed a memo in the High Court on Thursday urging the Bench led by Justice Sundresh to adjourn the hearing on the batch of cases by three weeks since a large number of lawyers gather in the court hall during the hearing of the cases.

The memo, signed by many other advocates including S. Jimraj Milton, K.C. Karl Marx and L. Parvin Banu, stated that the cases do not require any urgent hearing since newspapers had reported that the anti-CAA protesters across the State had suspended their agitations to avoid COVID-19.

Only urgent cases

Further, referring to a notification issued by the High Court on Tuesday, as per the instructions of the Chief Justice, the senior counsel pointed out that it clearly states that only urgent cases would be taken up for hearing and that other matters would be adjourned.

“During the hearing of these cases, there has been an extraordinary crowd of lawyers packing the court hall and causing a high risk of the spread of the virus. It goes against the advisory issued by the Chief Justice… Unfortunately, despite the advisory, we are exposed to grave risk,” the lawyers said.

Their memo went on to read: “As responsible members of the legal profession, we do not want to endanger others by crowding the court nor do we wish to put ourselves at risk. Therefore, this honourable court may be pleased to postpone the hearing until normalcy returns.” The memo would be placed before the Bench on Friday.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/cj-takes-serious-note-of-protest-near-hc-despite-covid-19-threat/article31112802.ece
397,2020/03/20,Because the mind matters,"How one copes with an outbreak like COVID-19 depends on three factors, the individual, the community and the health system

Pandemics have never been just medical events or crises, they have affected lives of societies and nations in many ways. The mental health sequel of many pandemics has been documented.

How one copes with an outbreak like COVID-19 depends on three factors, the individual, the community and the health system.

A study conducted in the early phase of the outbreak in China by Wang and colleagues found that 53.8% of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate or severe and 16.5% reported moderate to severe anxiety.

The mental health issues have been related to: how widespread the pandemic is, how fast the spread is and lack of control over it.

It is also related to the mortality rate due to the infection and availability of good and effective treatments and vaccines.

Symptoms of stress can be:

1. Excess worry about one’s health and that of family, friends, etc

2. Difficulty in sleeping, loss of appetite and fatigue

3. Some symptoms of depression including suicidal ruminations

4. If isolated at home, the need to use more of alcohol and other substances of addiction

5. Irritability, anger borne out of helplessness and disruption of routines

6. Exacerbation of physical ill health such as increase in blood pressure / blood sugar etc

7. Need to hoard items like sanitisers or masks or some essential medicines itself can result in anxiety

8. Fear of acquiring a novel, yet unpredictable disease can increase negative thinking and behaviours

Who is more vulnerable?

The individuals who are likely to be more psychologically distressed are:

1. Older people with chronic diseases such as diabetes or hypertension who are more vulnerable to contracting COVID-19.

2. Children/adolescents as their routines are disrupted and they perceive the parent’s anxiety, stress, and change in lifestyle.

3. Physicians and other health workers who face the constant threat of exposure, overwork, inadequate resources and experience secondary traumatic stress.

4. Persons with pre-existing mental health conditions who may experience new or exacerbation of their symptoms.

5. People in quarantine. They are confronted with uncertainty about their state, fear for their family and friends , guilty and depressed about their isolation. Research during the previous SARS outbreak found 29% of those quarantined showed signs of PTSD and 31% had symptoms of depression.

The connectedness and resilience of the community is strongly reflected in the mental health of the people during an outbreak. When a member / family are stigmatised, isolated and ostracised, mental health suffers.

Mental health consequences of short term social distancing has not been studied in detail. Dr. Lunstad suggests two competing hypotheses. One, that it may exacerbate those who are already isolated and might trigger others to connect less. The other is that heightened awareness will prompt people to stay connected and focus on reaching out to others.

Help yourself

1. Educate yourself about the infection

2. Maintain basic hygiene, but do not overdo it. Persons with previous Obsessive-compulsive traits may have an exacerbation due to constant washing

3. Do not over stimulate yourself with news from various sources, specially social media. This can lead to fatigue, anxiety and stress. Do not constantly engage in conversation on this subject

4. Find ways to relax — be it yoga, music, walks, reading, family time etc

5. Healthcare professionals must ensure they do not burn out in the process of caring

6. While physical social distancing is advocated, stay connected with friends, family and well wishers. Emotional isolation does not help

7. Do not hesitate to seek help if you are not able to help yourself

The schools have been closed and children at home also need support.

Talk to the child, share simple information, don’t underplay the seriousness since they pick up information from other sources also.

Reassure them they are safe and have all the support they need, do not make your own anxiety very evident while you are around them, limit their sources of information since they could get frightened or misinterpret what they hear and plan home based activities together.

People wanting to get to their native places from the city are rushing to the Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. MGR Chennai Central railway station, not realising that the Southern Railway has cancelled over 95 long-distance trains.

With 50 trains already suspended due to low occupancy on Wednesday, an additional 45 services were cancelled on Thursday. A total of 155 train services have been cancelled throughout the country as part of the Railways’ measures to prevent COVID-19.

The Railways on Thursday cancelled several services, including the Chennai-Vijayawada Jan Shatabdi Express, Chennai-Coimbatore Shatabdi Express, Chennai-Hazrat Nizamuddin Duronto Express, Chennai-Thiruvananthapuram Express, Mangaluru-Thiruvananthapuram Express, Chennai-Bengaluru Express, Tiruchi-Thiruvananthapuram Express and Mangaluru-Coimbatore Intercity Express. The services are being cancelled between March 20 and 31.

A total of 23 special-fare summer trains, that were to be operated in April, are being cancelled. Special-fare trains to be operated to Thoothukudi, Nagercoil, Tirunelveli, Velankanni and Rameswaram are among the services that will be cancelled.

A senior Railways official said that to discourage people from undertaking non-essential travel, concession tickets for senior citizens and students were being withdrawn with effect from Friday.

The cancellation of several trainscreated panic among passengers who were to leave the city. On Friday morning, commuters rushed to board trains at the Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. MGR Chennai Central railway station. The situation gradually normalised, said the railway official.

Regarding passengers who had booked tickets to trains that were cancelled, the official said that the department would refund the full price.

The official, when asked whether the stoppage of services to various parts of the southern States would cause confusion and chaos, said that only special trains and a few regular ones had been cancelled. No regular train services from Chennai Egmore or Central railway station have been cancelled, he added.

However, officials of the State Transport Department point out that if train services are not available, commuters have the option to travel in buses.

402,2020/03/20,Video lessons to keep students engaged,"Schools’ response to COVID-19 pandemic

Following the closure of schools to prevent the spread of COVID-19, institutions across the city have turned to video lessons and worksheets, recommending fun activities to keep the students engaged.

With a ‘learning continuity plan’ in place, students from K.C. High International School are sent work by their teachers, every morning, online, including assignments and fun activities. “Online classes too are being conducted through Google Hangouts Meet. At the end of the day, students are expected to fill in an end-of the-day learning form, which will give us an insight into how effective their online learning has been,” said Sindu Suneel, deputy head of the school.

The school, however, is keen on ensuring that the online sessions are not just focussed on rushing to complete the curriculum or readying the children for exams. Michael Purcell, head of school, in a live facebook video, addressed parents and students. He said that they wanted to stay connected with the student community.

“While we’ve addressed several student queries on COVID-19 through a video session with a doctor, we will also hold a special class on epidemiology on Friday,” Ms. Sindu added.

Students of SRM Public School, Guduvanchery, have been completing their assessments online, and K.R. Maalathi, adviser to the school, said that the parents had been extremely keen on ensuring that their children were kept engaged with the help of the school. “Platforms such as Moodle and Google classroom are helping teachers connect with the students. If schools remain closed in April as well, we can continue online classes through apps and web portals,” she added.

Balaji Sampath, founder, AhaGuru, said that nearly eight schools from the city would be taking up online mathematics classes for Class X students, who will be taking up boards in 2021. “We have given every school a separate login for our website, where video classes will be hosted and students will attend two sessions every week.

The Airports Authority of India (AAI) on Thursday started screening domestic passengers from Kerala and Delhi for COVID-19, at Chennai airport.

Around 3 p.m., passengers who came from Kannur were first screened at the domestic terminal. Officials said the screening commenced following the State government’s recommendation to AAI recently. “We were making facilities for the last two days and since we immediately received the manpower, we decided to start with Kerala and Delhi for now. We plan to gradually extend it to all passengers arriving in the coming days,” a source said.

Only 18,000-20,000 domestic passengers and around 3,000-4,000 international passengers are using Chennai airport these days, and this has been consistently dipping by the day as more passengers are deciding to call off travel plans. “The fall will be very significant next week as the government has planned to stop the arrival of all international flights. On Thursday, many airlines decided to call off flights to Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Colombo. Some domestic flights also are getting cancelled owing to lack of sufficient passengers,” an official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ojzoxr/article31112289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG8893,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/flyers-from-kerala-delhi-screened/article31112290.ece

As part of precautionary measures to check the spread of COVID-19, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Thursday ordered the closure of large textile and jewellery shops and departmental stores with central air-conditioning facilities from March 20. The closure will be effective till March 31.

“However, orders placed earlier in jewellery shops can be picked up through a specific counter. Supermarkets with essential supplies, those with vegetables and fruits, medical shops and eateries will function as usual,” an official release said.

The Chief Minister said IT companies and MSME units “must take steps” to allow “work from home” option for their employees. He also advised these organisations to create awareness among their employees and to keep their canteens clean. Following a review meeting chaired by the CM, he also ordered closure of weekly markets till March 31. Worship in major temples, including Murugan temple in Vadapalani, Parthasarathy temple in Triplicane, Kapaleeswarar temple in Mylapore, Meenakshi temple in Madurai, among others, would be “temporarily suspended” till March 31. However, “regular poojais will go on as per traditions (agama vidhigal)”.

District Collectors have been advised to temporarily suspend worship in churches, mosques and dargas till March 31. Since there is a possibility of spread of the pandemic from nearby States, “it has been decided to scale down inter-State bus transport” and GM of Southern Railway has been requested to reduce services to and from other States.

Isolation wards are to be set up in hospitals in all districts and those presently under quarantine are to be counseled by doctors through video conference. Sufficient gloves, masks and necessary equipment are to be provided to health department workers.

“Public places with high footfall in all Corporations, Municipalities and Town Panchayats are to be cleaned with disinfectants at least twice a day. Courts, airports, railway stations, Metro stations, bus stops and harbours are to be cleaned with disinfectants at least thrice a day,” it stated.

To transport quarantined persons, vehicles have been arranged at airports and railway stations and those driving the vehicles are to be provided with necessary gear. Also those who are home quarantined will be offered medical advice through video conferencing.

409,2020/03/20,One more tests positive for COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu,"39 persons in isolation wards across State

A third person has tested positive for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Tamil Nadu. The patient, a 21-year-old student who had returned from Dublin, tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday, after having been admitted to the isolation ward at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH).

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said the student arrived in Chennai on March 17 and underwent screening, following which he was placed under home quarantine. He developed symptoms on March 18 and reported himself to RGGGH. He was admitted to the isolation ward, and his nasal and throat swabs were taken for testing. The samples returned positive for COVID-19 on Thursday.

The Minister tweeted that the patient’s condition was stable. Contact tracing for the student is under way.

On Wednesday, a 20-year-old, who had travelled from Delhi to Chennai on the Tamil Nadu Express, had tested positive for COVID-19. He is currently undergoing treatment at RGGGH. In an overnight exercise, the department traced 41 of his contacts, including seven close contacts — persons who stayed with him. The seven have been quarantined at the Institute if Public Health, Poonamallee. The remaining 34 persons, with whom he came in contact, have been placed under home quarantine.

The Minister maintained that there was no community transmission of COVID-19 in the State.

“If any passenger travelling from an affected country arrives at the airport with symptoms, he/she is shifted to the isolation ward in a dedicated ambulance. If the passenger does not have symptoms, we quarantine them at the Institute of Public Health in Poonamallee, considering that they could be carriers,” he told reporters after inspecting the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital. The hospital has 31 beds in the isolation ward and a fever clinic. Efforts are on to establish a testing facility there.

As per a bulletin issued by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, 39 persons were in isolation wards in government medical college hospitals and 3,481 under home quarantine. At 1,135, Chennai has the highest number of those under quarantine.

A total of 1,94,236 passengers have been screened till date at the four airports in Chennai, Tiruchi, Madurai and Coimbatore. The total number of samples lifted till now is 320.

410,2020/03/20,Private hospitals allowed to set up isolation wards,"Health Dept. has given them a set of instructions and protocols to treat patients

Private hospitals — especially those empanelled under the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme (CMCHIS) — can now set up isolation wards for treating patients suspected to have COVID-19.

The Health Department has put in place protocols to allow private health facilities to establish isolation wards and treat patients, and this move is likely to bring more than 400 beds in isolation facilities in the private sector.

On Wednesday, the Health Department convened a meeting with nearly 150 private health facilities across the State through video-conferencing. Officials said many of these hospitals had expressed their willingness to establish isolation wards for COVID-19.

“Hospitals empanelled under the CMCHIS were part of the meeting. We have given them a set of instructions and protocols, allowing them to treat patients. If they suspect a person to be infected, they should immediately intimate the local health authority as it is a notifiable disease. This could be the deputy director of health services or Corporation health officials,” an official of the Health Department said.

A three-tier protected isolation ward should be set up, he said, adding: “There should be a reception area, ante-room and private isolation rooms that are single-bedded isolation rooms with attached restrooms. The entry to these isolation facilities should be restricted. All patients should be treated as per government-issued treatment protocols.”

If testing has to be done, the hospital should contact the respective health authority — deans, joint directors or deputy directors. They would take measures to conduct tests, only if required, he said.

Moderate or severe

“This is because not all patients suspected to have COVID-19 need testing. Testing is done only if a person has symptoms of moderate or severe intensity, travel history or contact with a person who has a travel history to any of the affected countries. In case of persons with moderate symptoms, we will look at extremes of age and co-morbid conditions,” the official said.

In addition, persons working at places that have public movement such as airports and railway stations would also fit the criteria. “The samples lifted will be sent for testing to government laboratories,” he said.

Officials said that the private hospitals should ensure that there is room for complaints. In case of queries, clinical establishments can contact the control room of the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/private-hospitals-allowed-to-set-up-isolation-wards/article31112171.ece
411,2020/03/20,COVID-19: What nature seems to be telling us,"It is reminding us that we need to acknowledge, with humility, our quintessential equality and interdependence

The outbreak of COVID-19 has created an unprecedented situation around the world. Humankind is no stranger to calamitous outbreaks of diseases. However, this is the first viral outbreak of this nature and scale in our lifetime.

Today, my thoughts are with all those battling the virus, with the families of all the victims around the world, and also with the doctors, paramedics and health officials and all others who have put their lives at risk for the rest of us.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

I commend people for their mature response in the face of the crisis. Their support is helping all institutions work in a coordinated manner to fight the outbreak. Our healthcare system has shown great alacrity and competence in meeting the extraordinary and evolving challenge. Our leadership and administration have proved their mettle in these testing times. I believe that together we will weather the storm. I also commend the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, for taking pre-emptive measures in right earnest to contain the pandemic at the very beginning and reaching out to our neighbours in SAARC to launch joint efforts to check its spread in the neighbourhood. Even the World Health Organization (WHO) has acknowledged India’s efforts as worthy of emulation for the rest of the world.

Quarantining oneself

The outbreak has forced us to keep a respectful distance from others. This isolation, self-imposed or medically mandated, can be taken as an ideal opportunity to ponder about our journey so far and the future path. As we are passing through a tough phase, let us turn this challenge into an opportunity and try to decipher what nature has been telling us through this crisis. The messages are many, but for the purpose of brevity I will dwell upon a few here.

We all know that hygiene is the first and obvious lesson. Precaution is the only cure for this new strain of coronavirus. As precaution, what doctors advise is basic hygiene, apart from social distancing. Sanitation and cleanliness are among the humblest of the civic virtues, and it is easy to underestimate their significance. It needed a Mahatma to attach the utmost priority to them. In South Africa and in India, his historic campaigns always began with or ran parallel to the question of sanitation and hygiene. In 1896, Gandhiji was visiting India, and plague broke out in Bombay. He offered his services to the State, and the offer was accepted. As he was in Rajkot, he volunteered there. Do you know what he did as a volunteer? He inspected latrines and exhorted people to pay attention to cleanliness. We need to imbibe all his lessons in our daily life, and in this year of his 151th birth anniversary we may begin by rededicating ourselves to the cause of personal and social hygiene. The nationwide ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ (Mission Clean India) is a precursor to this great social awakening.

Coronavirus | Narendra Modi calls for determination, patience and a ‘janata curfew’

Respect for nature may be the next lesson intended for us. Homo Sapiens is the only organism that has overpowered all other animals, taken control of the whole planet, and even set foot on the moon. Now it stands humbled by a microorganism. We would do well to keep in mind the fact that at the end of the day we are merely biological organisms, dependent on other organisms for survival. Humankind’s craving to control nature and exploit all its resources for profit can be wiped out in a stroke by an organism we cannot even see with the naked eye.

Let us remind ourselves that our ancestors saw nature as mother, and asked us to respect it. At some point in history, we forgot ancient wisdom. When pandemics and abnormal weather phenomena are becoming the norm, it is time to pause and wonder where we lost the way, and how we can still make a comeback.

The Hindu In Focus Podcast | PM Modi’s speech and where we stand now on COVID-19 in India

The whole world is a family

Equality may be a factor less apparent, but nature tells us that we are all equal. This new virus strikes beyond man-made distinctions of religion, race and region. The world has been busy drawing distinctions and waging wars over ‘us vs. them’. But we suddenly realise that in the face of a grave mortal threat like the present one, we have but one identity — we are human beings.

Interdependence is also something we tend to overlook in normal times. In my speeches, I have often referred to the Sanskrit dictum, “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”, which means the whole world is but a family. Today, it turns out to be truer than ever before. We realise how deeply each one of us is connected with everybody else. We are as safe as we take care of the safety of others, not only of human beings but also of plants and animals. Faced with an extraordinary crisis, most people tend to be selfish, but this is a crisis that teaches us to think equally of others.

Though voluntary services through social mobilisation are not encouraged due to the highly contagious nature of the disease, there are many ways in which people can help contain and mitigate the viral spread. Every citizen can contribute towards raising awareness and equally by refraining from spreading panic, taking prudent precautions advised by the government. Those who can should also share resources, especially with less resourceful neighbours, and senior citizens who are vulnerable to the disease. The coronavirus challenge underscores the necessity for “action in absence of crisis”.

Nature is reminding us to acknowledge, with humility, our quintessential equality and interdependence. It is a lesson — imparted at a heavy price — that will come handy in mitigating global challenges like climate change as well as in building a better, common future. In the meantime, I join you in reaffirming our resolve to come out of the present crisis at the earliest, stronger than ever as a nation.

412,2020/03/20,Giving Human Rights Commissions more teeth,"The Madras High Court is to decide on whether the recommendations made by such panels are binding upon the state

In 1993, the Indian Parliament enacted the Protection of Human Rights Act. The purpose of the Act was to establish an institutional framework that could effectively protect, promote and fulfil the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution. To this end, the Act created a National Human Rights Commission, and also, Human Rights Commissions at the levels of the various States.

The National and State Human Rights Commissions are examples of what we now call “fourth branch institutions.” According to the classical account, democracy is sustained through a distribution of power between three “branches” — the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary, with each branch acting as a check and a balance upon the others. However, the complexity of governance and administration in the modern world has necessitated the existence of a set of independent bodies, which are charged with performing vital functions of oversight. Some of these bodies are constitutional bodies — established by the Constitution itself. These include, for instance, the Election Commission and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Others have been established under law: for example, the Information Commission under the Right to Information Act, and Human Rights Commissions under the Protection of Human Rights Act.

In the two-and-a-half decades of their existence, however, the functioning of the Human Rights Commissions has come under scrutiny and criticism. There have been the usual critiques of the politicisation of autonomous bodies, and selectiveness. Even more than that, however, it has been alleged that for all intents and purposes, the Human Rights Commissions are toothless: at the highest, they play an advisory role, with the government left free to disobey or even disregard their findings.

Pending case

In this context, a pending case before the High Court of Madras has assumed great significance. A Full Bench of the High Court will be deciding upon whether “recommendations” made by the Human Rights Commissions are binding upon their respective State (or Central) governments, or whether the government is entitled to reject or take no action upon them.

Under the Protection of Human Rights Act, the Human Rights Commissions are empowered to inquire into the violations of human rights committed by state authorities, either upon petitions presented to them, or upon their own initiative. While conducting these inquiries, the Commissions are granted identical powers to that of civil courts, such as the examining witnesses, ordering for documents, receiving evidence, and so on. These proceedings are deemed to be judicial proceedings, and they require that any person, who may be prejudicially affected by their outcome, has a right to be heard.

The controversy before the Madras High Court stems from the issue of what is to be done after the Human Rights Commission completes its enquiry, and reaches a conclusion that human rights have been violated. Section 18 of the Protection of Human Rights Act empowers the Human Rights Commission to “recommend” to the concerned government to grant compensation to the victim, to initiate prosecution against the erring state authorities, to grant interim relief, and to take various other steps. The key question revolves around the meaning of the word “recommend.”

The Full Bench of the Madras High Court is hearing the case because different, smaller benches, have come to opposite conclusions about how to understand the word “recommend” in the context of the Protection of Human Rights Act. According to one set of judgments, this word needs to be taken in its ordinary sense. To “recommend” means to “put forward” or to “suggest” something or someone as being suitable for some purpose. Ordinarily, a mere “suggestion” is not binding. Furthermore, Section 18 of the Human Rights Act also obligates the concerned government to “forward its comments on the report, including the action taken or proposed to be taken thereon, to the Commission”, within a period of one month. The argument, therefore, is that this is the only obligation upon the government. If indeed the Act intended to make the recommendations of the Commission binding upon the government, it would have said so: it would not simply have required the government to communicate what action it intended to take to the Commission (presumably, a category that includes “no action” as well).

While intuitively plausible, I suggest that this view needs to be rejected, for many reasons.

The first is that there is often a gap between the ordinary meanings of words, and the meanings that they have within legal frameworks. Legal meaning is a function of context, and often, the purpose of the statute within which a word occurs has a strong influence on how it is to be understood. For example, the Supreme Court has held, in the past, that the overriding imperative of maintaining judicial independence mandates that “consultation” with the Chief Justice for judicial appointments (as set out under the Constitution) be read as “concurrence” of the Chief Justice (this is the basis for the collegium system). Recently, while interpreting the Land Acquisition Act, the apex court held that the word “and” in a provision had to be construed as “or”.

Constitutional commitment

Of course, there needs to be good reason for interpretations of this kind. This brings us to the purpose of the Human Rights Act, and the importance of fourth branch institutions. As indicated above, the Human Rights Act exists to ensure the protection and promotion of human rights. To fulfil this purpose, the Act creates an institutional infrastructure, via the Human Rights Commissions. The Human Rights Commissions, thus, are bodies that stand between the individual and the state, and whose task is to ensure the adequate realisation of constitutional commitment to protecting human rights. It stands to reason that if the state was left free to obey or disobey the findings of the Commission, this constitutional role would be effectively pointless, as whatever the Human Rights Commission did, the final judgment call on whether or not to comply with its commitments under the Constitution would be left to the state authorities (effectively, the state judging itself). This, it is clear, would defeat the entire purpose of the Act.

Indeed, in the past, courts have invoked constitutional purpose to determine the powers of various fourth branch institutions in cases of ambiguity. For example, the Supreme Court laid down detailed guidelines to ensure the independence of the Central Bureau of Investigation; various judgments have endorsed and strengthened the powers of the Election Commission to compulsorily obtain relevant details of candidates, despite having no express power to do so. It is therefore clear that in determining the powers of autonomous bodies such as the Human Rights Commission, the role that fourth branch institutions are expected to play in the constitutional scheme is significant.

And lastly, as pointed out above, the Human Rights Commission has the powers of a civil court, and proceedings before it are deemed to be judicial proceedings. This provides strong reasons for its findings to be treated — at the very least — as quasi-judicial, and binding upon the state (unless challenged).

Indeed, very recently, the Supreme Court held as much in the context of “opinions” rendered by the Foreigners Tribunals, using very similar logic to say that these “opinions” were binding.

In sum, the crucial role played by a Human Rights Commission — and the requirement of state accountability in a democracy committed to a ‘culture of justification’ — strongly indicates that the Commission’s recommendations should be binding upon the state. Which way the Madras High Court holds will have a crucial impact upon the future of human rights protection in India.

413,2020/03/20,"Letters to the Editor — March 20, 2020","Battling COVID-19

There has been a steady increase in the spread of COVID-19 across the country. At this juncture, there is an onerous task on the citizens to display some much-needed resilience by shouldering social responsibilities for ensuring the common welfare in the society (“Time for powerful display of humanity,” Editorial Page, March 19) . There should be no blame-game across nations on the origins of the virus; there should instead be timely awareness campaigns. In this connection, it would be very pertinent to follow the best practices adopted by places like South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong, where the people, apart from protecting themselves, have also played a significant role in preventing the spread of the virus by exhibiting high levels of humanity. Hence, we need to behave like ‘citizen warriors’ in our crusade against the virus.

G. Ramasubramanyam,

Vijayawada

The early adoption of screening, tracing and quarantining procedure adopted by India has definitely helped to lower the rate of spread of the COVID-19 virus in the beginning stages in the country (Editorial page, “Time for a powerful display of humanity,” Mar. 19). Not withstanding those efforts, the number of cases have started to increase rapidly in the last 15-16 days and have crossed 170 as of now. This seemingly low number for a large country like India could be deceptive and should not make us complacent about our response to the pandemic. The testing level of about 10 per million in India is one of the lowest in the world, which could be misleading us to believe that India has been spared from a bigger outbreak. If the total number of cases doesn’t go up substantially even after a better testing standard of say 120-150 per million, the nation can heave a sigh of relief. Instead of repenting later, the government should ramp up the testing levels immediately by at least 10 times the present level, at least to rule out an outbreak in the coming weeks. The all-important preventive norm of social distancing is not being strictly implemented throughout the country. To prevent a catastrophe later, people should be prepared to undergo smaller hardships like confining themselves to ones own houses, avoiding gatherings, maintaining at least a distance of about a metre between any two people while meeting, etc. Surprisingly, Parliament is still in session, though the nation is being told to avoid crowding. Politicians are still attending marriages, where thousands are gathering throwing all the preventive norms to the wind. Persons in authority should set examples to be followed by people at large. Government should increase the testing levels and rule out widespread presence of COVID-19 in a dormant state and people should strictly follow the preventive norms like social distancing, hand hygiene, avoiding gatherings, etc. as an effective response to the deadly pandemic that is confronting the humanity.

A Justice-turned-MP

Prashant Bhushan has literally ripped the veil off the nomination of former Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi to the Rajya Sabha, a mere four months after he demitted office as CJI (“In upper house nomination, a fall for ‘aloofness’,” March 19). It is an accepted fact that almost all the judgments delivered by the Supreme Court benches presided over by Justice Gogoi went in favour of the present dispensation. The grim irony is that Justice Gogoi was one of the four judges to come out openly in 2018 against the then-Chief Justice Dipak Misra whose role as ‘master of the roster’ was faulted by the quartet. While the other three have walked into the sunset without any fanfare, Justice Gogoi has blotted his copybook. By accepting the nomination without the least demur, he has clearly done a disservice to the judiciary which, as such, is hard pressed to assert its independence and sovereignty in a situation where the executive has never shied away from wielding the whip using weapons in its arsenal like transfers, elevations etc.

With post-retirement carrots to look forward to, our constitutional bodies are likely to overlook the guardrails of democracy where our current rankings are bleak. This is another version of a committed bureaucracy and judiciary which was promoted during the ill-fated Emergency era. It is time such carrots are altogether eliminated. Let all posts held post-retirement be during their active period of service, like membership of commissions, Upper house of the parliament, tribunals, regulatory bodies and a host of other constitutional institutions. If in the larger interest of administration or the nation, there is a compelling need to appoint a person of such exceptional competence and talent, there should be a cooling period of one or two years post retirement before such appointments are made. The sound principles on which our Constitution is based, like protection of fundamental rights, Rule of Law and separation of powers that the Constitution gave us and the courts have often upheld should be safeguarded.

Biden vs. Trump?

Joe Biden’s victory in Arizona and Florida on Tuesday has given him a near-insurmountable lead. Significantly, in 2016, Donald Trump took both the States. Mr. Biden spoke directly to Bernie Sanders’s supporters, saying he and his opponent “may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision” on the need to make healthcare more affordable, reduce income inequality and curb climate change. Mr. Sanders earlier pledged to support his opponent if he loses the nomination. Democrats are concerned about defeating Mr. Trump — and believe Mr. Biden is the best person to do it.

S.S. Paul,

Chakdaha, Nadia, West Bengal

Buoyed by the impressive wins in the recent primaries and backed by a string of endorsements from former presidential contenders, former Vice-President Joe Biden’s candidacy and campaign have gained considerable momentum. Americans will be sceptical of electing a democratic socialist like Bernie Sanders as their President. As of now, Mr. Biden has the best chance of unseating a deeply divisive and racial President like Mr. Donald Trump. It is time for Mr. Sanders to gracefully bow out of the race and whole-heartedly endorse Mr. Biden’s presidential bid.

Minority rights

The cultural and educational rights under Articles 29 and 30 of the Constitution have given the minorities a sense of security and belonging. A vast majority of madrasas in the country are run by Muslims with their contributions of zakat (an obligatory tax paid by the rich). The clergy who were earlier reluctant to introduce subjects like mathematics and science in the curriculum have changed their stand. The minority institutions established over the years have been contributing a great deal to bring the Muslim community to the national mainstream. This being the case, the ambiguity owing to different judicial interpretations on Article 30 is indeed a cause for concern (Op-Ed, “An SC verdict violative of minority rights,” March 19).

“To be a writer, start reading first,” said Pakistani author Mohammed Hanif in 2011. That year, the bookstore at Lit For Life (LFL), The Hindu’s annual literature festival, was just a table. By 2019, the store had grown exponentially. That year LFL drew around 40,000 visitors for 88 sessions across three days.

Unfortunately the 10th edition of the festival in January 2020 had to be cancelled due to a challenging environment.

The Hindu Prize 2019 was scheduled to be announced on March 28 at an award ceremony in Chennai. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been decided to cancel the event. Naturally, this is disappointing but social distancing is the need of the hour. It will now be announced in the pages of The Hindu on March 25.

In 2018, author Taslima Nasrin told the festival audience that “Freedom of speech cannot exist without the freedom to offend.”

The Hindu Lit For Life will be back in January 2021 with a refreshed, bigger and better programme. As Festival Director Dr Nirmala Lakshman once said, “The reason we called it Lit for Life is because we believe literature is for life and literature lights you up.”",lit for life,https://www.thehindu.com/lit-for-life/vrmiz7/article31118268.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LITFORLIFECHENNAI,https://www.thehindu.com/lit-for-life/update-on-the-hindu-lit-for-life-the-hindu-prize-2019/article31118270.ece
415,2020/03/20,Covid-19: How to stay healthy in times of social distancing,"Social distancing can be challenging. If you are working from home, and missing the gym, here are some ways to stay healthy. But first, put down those potato chips

A look at Google search trends shows that queries on the immune system have jumped in the last month. Obviouly an after-effect of the spread of the Coronavirus.

For those who don’t know what the immune system is: It is a complex network of cells and tissues that help fight any foreign particle trying to enter the body. Though genetics play a part, the immune system is largely determined by other factors like sleep, stress and eating habits, which play a major role. The germs we are exposed to throughout our life also play a role in our immune response.

“The immune system is generally stronger in people who have a balanced routine between work, food and exercise. So though we are helpless about the system we inherit, one can improve it with proper exercise, balanced diet and low-stress levels,” says city-based paediatrician Dr Ashok Kolluru.

While prevention is always better than cure, for those of us who cannot practise social distancing, Dr Ashok has some advice. “Social distancing is good even for people with a strong immune system, as they could be a carrier of the virus. But, for those who have to step out, it is advisable to keep at least three feet distance from people. Avoid physical contact as much as possible. Wash your hands regularly and touch minimum things from your surroundings.”

He says that children need special attention, as they do not have a very strong immune system because they “are not exposed to a lot of germs as compared to an adult. Encouraging them to be physically active and providing them with a balanced diet is key to keep them healthy.”

Ginger tea

You are what you eat

“The oldest trick in the book to boost the immune system is to use turmeric,” says dietician and nutritionist Anjali Dange. Drawing up a list of food items that will help, Anjali says, “Turmeric can bolster the body’s immuno-modulating capacity. Though turmeric is an essential part of Indian cooking, it is better to consume some of it in raw form. People can make neem and turmeric balls by grinding them into a fine paste and rolling them into small balls. Preferably they should be fresh, but they can also be stored.”

Recipe for Sukku coffee Ingredients

Two pieces of ginger, slightly crushed

Four tablespoons of coriander seeds

Palm jaggery to taste

Method

Bring four cups of water to boil. Add ginger and coriander seeds to it, lower the heat and simmer for three to four minutes.

Remove from heat and strain

Add the palm jaggery and stir until dissolves

The closing of schools means that children are going to spend a lot of time indoors. Anjali has a fun, productive and healthy way to meet this challenge. “Fruits do wonders to the kids’ immune systems. So rather than serving them fried snacks or processed food, parents can try making fruit-based smoothies or popsicles at home. These will not only wkeep themengaged but also ensure they are eating healthy.”

Anjali also advises replacing tea or coffee with sukku (dry ginger) tea or coffee.

“For ages, sukku tea has been used as a remedy against cold and flu. Ginger is a strong antioxidant that boosts the immune system naturally. It contains vitamins like magnesium, iron, zinc, and calcium that help in countering cold viruses.”

In good shape

With social distancing now essential, one can hardly step out for gym sessions or yoga classes. K Ramesh, Head of the Department at Andhra University’s Yoga Village, says that a 45-minute yoga routine daily will help people stay fit. “Being fit boosts our immune system and even a single workout session will improve our ability to fight germs. So a routine that includes 10 minutes each of meditation and pranayam along with 25 minutes of stretching exercises should be good to keep your mind and body healthy,” he says. For elder people who can no longer head to parks for their morning or evening strolls, breathing exercises like Kapalabhati and Nadi Shodhana are essential. “Elderly people can do simple poses like katichakrasana, badhakonasana or Shavasana. They can also practise basic stretching exercises like neck rolls, chin-to-chest, ear-to-shoulder, wrists rolls and shoulder circles,” he adds.",fitness,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/wke10m/article31117309.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19VZEATING,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/how-to-stay-healthy-in-times-of-social-distancing/article31117314.ece
416,2020/03/20,"During this period of gloom, order in, if you find comfort in good food","Curry for the soul

These are troubling times. And what’s worse is that you can’t cheer yourself up by eating out. Food has always been a great mood enhancer, but in this age of COVID-19, we have been advised not to visit restaurants. To top it off, quite a few eateries have downed their shutters temporarily.

So, I did what I do when the mood is low: ordered in. Since I was in Central Delhi, I thought I’d get food delivered from an outlet somewhere in Connaught Place. That was when I remembered a place called Biryani Badshah. A friend whose office is in the neighbourhood often orders food from there, and had urged me to try it out. So I looked up Swiggy, found that it was listed, and placed my order.

I asked for some Chicken Biryani (full, ₹359), Mutton Dry Roast (₹369), Ginger Chicken Curry (₹399), Lachcha Paratha (₹69) and Double ka Meetha (₹109). Swiggy took the order, but the delivery boy’s two-wheeler had some problems (as I said, these are difficult times), so someone from Biryani Badshah very kindly did the delivery.

The restaurant is in K 14 Connaught Place (Ph: 011-41088220), but has outlets in Kailash Colony, Noida, Shahpur Jat, Mukarji Nagar, Vasant Kunj, and Rajouri Garden. Gurugram has four outlets. I was told by a staffer that they have a base kitchen, but the food is cooked in the restaurants, too.

The menu is comprehensive, and includes the usual tikkas, butter chicken, and other such curries. But what’s interesting is that it has quite a few Andhra dishes, and a few from other parts of the South and elsewhere.

My Chicken Biryani, for instance, had a Hyderabadi touch: It had a boiled egg in it, and the pieces of chicken (quite a few of them) in the rice were nicely spiced and substantially large. The rice was light, and had a tangy taste that I thoroughly enjoyed. The salan that came with it, however, was much too hot for me.

The Ginger Chicken Curry, while tasty, was a bit of a surprise for there was little to suggest that it had been flavoured with ginger. But the chicken was soft, and the gravy deliciously thick.

The Dry Roast Mutton, again, reminded me of the masalas used in the immensely popular southern Indian dish called Chicken 65. I loved the Lachcha Paratha, which was flaky and crisp, not hard or rubbery. I dipped it in the gravy of the non-ginger chicken curry and had quite a nice meal.

I had a look at the menu later and saw that it included several Andhra dishes, including the Andhra Dal Fry (₹299), Andhra Brinjal Masala (₹299), Andhra Chicken Curry (₹399) and even a Chicken 65 Biryani (₹389). It also has Malabar Chicken (₹399), and the seafood section has dishes such as Malabar Prawn Curry (₹459) and Prawn Koliwada (₹409).

Ginger or no ginger, we had a happy meal. As I polished off the last morsel. The world around me looked a little better, prompting me to raise a toast: Here’s to happier days ahead.

417,2020/03/20,A love affair with cashew,"The kidney-shaped kernel has been a longtime culinary favourite in India

The cashew nut — favoured ghee-tempered ingredient of many an Indian sweet like payasam, barfi and ladoo — isn’t a stranger to long-distance travel. And as we consume it by the tonne as a wholesome snack, ‘mylk’ (a vegan alternative to dairy milk), or as the thickening agent in curries, it’s clear that the cashew doesn’t believe in culinary social distancing either.

This becomes evident after a visit to Karthikeya Agro Processing unit along the Edumalai-Tirupattur road in Manachanallur Taluk, where women employees are working on cashews that will eventually be supplied to sweet shops and retailers in Tiruchi, Salem and Madurai.

Most of the stock at this factory has been shipped from African countries like Benin, Ivory Coast and Tanzania to Thoothukudi.

The cashew (Anacardium occidentale) is a Brazilian evergreen that is thought to have been introduced to India by the Portuguese, mainly to prevent soil erosion. The kidney-shaped drupe is the nut/seed that grows below the cashew apple (also called botanically as a pseudocarp or false fruit). While the commercial processing of cashew nut in India started in the early 20th century, of late, our country has become not just leading supplier (after Vietnam), but also a ravenous consumer of the kernel. Nearly 270,000 metric tonnes of cashew are eaten in India every year.

Trying to go green The harmful effects of conventional farming and pest control are the subject of Our Cashew Story, a recent 42-minute documentary directed by Serena Aurora. Centred on the cultivation of cashew in and around Auroville community in Puducherry, Serena’s film tries to show the growing disconnection between agriculture and food consumption.

Every year, the cashew fields surrounding Auroville are sprayed with pesticides from February to April. Health problems such as headaches, nausea, dizziness and runny nose are commonly caused by the spraying. Spray operators also inadvertently inhale the chemicals, because they don’t wear protective gear. The documentary tries to show the different problems related to cashew farming, and focuses on an organic grower within Auroville.

“Our Cashew Story is a case study for the global food industry. Modern agriculture is increasingly dependent on pesticides and their negative impact on health, environment and economy is a universal story. I hope this film can add to the conversation,” says Serena in an email interview.

Public screenings have helped to create dialogue between the growers and consumers, says Serena. “So far, we have screened Our Cashew Story in the local villages around Auroville where up to 200 people attended. We have had lively discussions between farmers who practice organic and inorganic and also with the other villagers, after the screening,” she says.

While people are willing to try out the eco-friendly pest repellents as shown in the film, the future of organically grown cashews is less certain, says Serena. “What is missing is the market to buy the cashews if farmers shift to organic.”

“Our own production cannot fulfill even 10% of the local demand for raw cashew nut (RCN) in India, so most processing units have to rely on imports. Though cashew is grown in Kollam, Panruti, Theni, Orissa, and Mangalore, among other places, farms cannot keep up with the demand from local buyers,” says unit proprietor D Karthikeyan.

YouTube unit

A mechanical engineer by training, Karthikeyan marketed pharmaceuticals for over 20 years before being inspired by a friend in Kerala to establish what is for now, Tiruchi district’s sole cashew processing unit. “I spent a year researching the idea, and selected the equipment by following YouTube videos,” he says.

Karthikeya Agro processes around 2 tonnes of cashew per month. “The best time to start buying stock is from March to June, when the crop is harvested,” says K Villavan, the unit manager, who oversees the daily production with his wife Deivakanni.

The nuts are transported by road from the Thoothukudi docks in gunny sacks weighing 80kg each. “In its raw state, RCN can last up to even a year, but once processed, it must be sold within a month,” says Deivakanni. A sack of raw nuts can yield up to 25 kg of kernels.

At the unit, the RCN is steam-boiled, and then spread out on the floor to dry for at least a day. They are transferred next to a separator machine that will partially crack the shell, without damaging the kernel. “Some 20% of the nuts may get discarded due to improper cutting,” says Villavan. “We cannot put it back in the machine, because it will release oil.”

The kernels are next roasted in a ‘Borma’ dryer. A refrigeration chamber cools down the roasted kernels at the end. “This is essential to loosen the outer testa or husk from the nut,” says Villavan. Once cleaned and graded by a photo-sensitive machine, the nuts are classified as ‘White Wholes’ (sizes 180, 210, 240, 320 and 400); Splits; Large White Pieces; Small White Pieces and Baby Bits. They are also packed for wholesalers in vacuum-sealed 10kg tins.

“Every country’s cashew has its own characteristics based on the soil and growing conditions. Though it actually tastes nicer if there is less colour, buyers prefer white kernels,” says Karthikeyan, who prices his stock between ₹400 and ₹850 per kilo.

With cashew cultivated in 17 states of India on approximately 10.41 lakh hectares, the processing industry is a leading employer of women, as their skills in manually scooping out the whole nut from within the plant casing are highly valued. A skilled worker can earn around ₹400 per day as a kernel processor. All over India, around 10 lakh women are working the cashew industry, with Tamil Nadu alone employing over 2 lakh women. Karthikeya Agro’s 25 female employees, unlike workers of earlier generations, are required to wear safety gear to protect their hands from the abrasive oil secreted by the cashew shells.

Kernel leader

Panruti, in Cuddalore district, is ‘Cashew Central’ as far as Tamil Nadu is concerned. Out of the total 1,42,000 hectares under cashew cultivation in the State, Panruti accounts for about 35,000 hectares. There are around 32 export-oriented cashew production units here besides 250 processing units and more than 500 cottage industries.

Automation has removed many of the unsafe practices in this industry, but more could be done by the government to promote local agriculture and bring down the reliance on imported RCN, says M Ramakrishnan, secretary of Tamil Nadu Cashew Processors and Exporters Association, and managing partner of Pratipa Cashews in Panruti.

“The Indian market alone needs 20 lakh tonnes of cashews, but we produce only around 8 lakh tonnes domestically. So we have been forced to import at least 10-12 lakh tonnes to keep up,” says Ramakrishnan.

The granting of land to set up a model cashew farm will serve as an agricultural showcase, he adds. Cashew trees don’t require much maintenance — hybrids can last up to 10 years, while the older heirloom varieties could live up to 50 years.

Though the Panruti cashew looks small, it has a unique taste that makes it very marketable. “Cyclone Thane hit our cashew farmers badly in 2011, but they have been able to recoup their losses slowly. We are expecting a bumper crop in Panruti this year,” says Ramakrishnan.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/59td47/article31118707.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TYMPCASHEW2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/a-love-affair-with-cashew/article31118710.ece
418,2020/03/20,"If you want to make mealtimes count in terms of quality and quantity, head to Lapis","Gem of a dining experience

Lapis at The Oberoi is an all-day restaurant with a menu that is a departure from the tried and tested. The team of chefs here have put together a selection of dishes from India and around the world.

The menu card is clearly marked with gluten- or egg-free choices. However, what sets the food at Lapis apart is its focus on seasonal fruits and vegetables in their daily buffet and ala carte options.

Everything about the Lapis experience whispers an understated elegance — from its high blue-and-gold ceiling and the stately French windows that open out into the sunshine to the way the buffet is laid out and its unobtrusive, comfortable decor. It is an invitation to linger with friends and family.

To that end, one could start with the Inside Out Karari Roomali roti. Served with interesting dips on the side like mango, mint and beetroot, it is crisp and mildly spiced, big enough to get any conversation going.

The Mediterranean mezze platter with falafel, manakeesh, muhammara and more, is also a great option for a group starter.

There is a brilliant range of salads where spiced feta and buratta vie for your attention with asparagus, avocados, oyster mushrooms and snow peas.

Lapis boasts a wood-fired oven so make sure you have a pizza. We try their signature pizza with forest mushrooms, roquette, goat cheese and truffle oil. It is so good there is no need to add any garnish that accompanies it to the table. Whole wheat options are available on request.

Burgers, wraps, sandwiches, steaks and grills are all here with a whole lot of mix-and-match combinations thrown in.

In keeping with their theme of including regional Indian fare, the menu at Lapis prides itself on dishes from around India. You will find Mangalore ghee roast, Kerala fish curry and tapioca, Lucknowi lamb masala, Goan and Bengali prawn curry and so much more.

And if you’ve been on the move for a while and just yearn for the comfort of home, opt for the Karnataka lasooni panchkuta saag. Time and trusted comfort food — dal, greens and rice — it honestly, doesn’t take much to satisfy an Indian soul.

The desserts are temptingly laid out in attractive portion sizes that make it easy to quell the voice of restraint that rings in your ear. Whether it is a pudding or the in-house icecream, each item in the dessert section is so artistically laid out, it seems rather criminal to break into it.

The Unbelievable Apple looks like it comes straight out of a storybook. Thankfully, there is nothing sinister about this shiny, red apple. A candied covering encases a sweet heart of cinnamon mousse, apple jelly and roasted walnut ice cream. Yum!

The Caramelting has a little bit of everything for those who want to share a portion — hazelnut ganache, praline wafer and milk chocolate. Then, there’s the raspberry and chilli sorbet for anyone who’d like to sip on their dessert!

The drinks section will appeal to those with a scientific bent of mind, with each offering named after elements of the periodic table.

Even those not too classroom-inclined (like yours truly) are bound to rack their brains for clues from Chemistry textbooks while choosing between the cuBanite (gold rum, mint and lime), axiNite (whisky and cognac with a zesty orange twist) or the sPalerite (coconut water, curry leaves and whisky).",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/rr762f/article31118407.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Lapis15jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/if-you-want-to-make-mealtimes-count-in-terms-of-quality-and-quantity-head-to-lapis/article31118410.ece
419,2020/03/20,How writer Indu Lekshmi makes the kitchen a ‘magical’ place for her children,"Her kids are encouraged to join and do whatever they could

Techie-turned-writer Indu Lekshmi says the kitchen has been a happening place in her house as she has always encouraged her children to join in and do whatever they could. “So, right from the time my son, Niranjan, was two or three, I would give him things to do in the kitchen. He used to enjoy washing tomatoes, peeling carrots and so on. Now that he is eight, he helps me in cleaning cut veggies, onions, peeling garlic and washing. My five-year-old daughter, Nandana, is happy peeling pods of garlic and removing the peel of onions. I can keep an eye on them and we keep each other company. It can get messy at times but this is a time all of us enjoy and the holidays are no different,” she says.

“From deadly weapons to fumes whirling up from vessels... it is the one magical room. The only room that locks the secret ingredients to tasty meals (and the deep burnt stains of failed experiments). It becomes so much fun when there are young learners in there. Just that we should keep a book of answers for their never-ending questions,” she posts on her Facebook page. Recalling the power cuts of yore that used to bring families together around a candle or an emergency lamp for storytelling and chatting, she says perhaps the unexpected holidays and work-from-home time could be utilised for bringing families together and away from their mobile phones.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/j1ys5n/article31118326.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21tvmkitchen,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/how-techie-turned-writer-indu-lekhsmi-makes-her-kitchen-the-happening-place-for-her-children/article31118327.ece
420,2020/03/20,Hope from the kitchen in the time of a pandemic,"Recipes shared across continents and time spent cooking with little ones — corona culture is embracing social distancing through food

As the world grapples with a virus that threatens all its fundamentals, it is inevitable that despite the grimness, humanity should attempt to assert itself. Perhaps through snatches of music, twirls of dance... and by creating foods, the basis of sustenance, yet something more, which offers us hope, joy and bonding — even if socially distanced. The emerging “corona culture”, as it is being dubbed, has been most visible on social media.

Nostalgic endeavours

The most endearing way in which I find friends reaching out is through food and drink. Someone in Singapore sends me a picture of Amarone from his collection. He will be drinking it in contemplative solitude but not before we have exchanged thoughts on life. Vino has that effect, whether you drink it, or merely see it!

There are friends in Orvieto, a tiny town perched on a mountain near Rome, who post pictures of six-year-old Maria Luce, their daughter, cooking up a little treat. The last time I had seen her in December, she had sat at a restaurant eating truffled pasta, drawing me a picture. Now, she has progressed to baking, and that’s how we keep track of lives.

Maria Luce baking for her family

In London, my friend Namrata, a professional in the travel trade, has seen all her business crumble. We exchange recipes amidst our respective fears and she sends me pictures of fantastic Tamil meals she is learning to cook, food that she enjoyed at her in laws’ place in Chennai. Now, in bleak London, these are dishes she is cooking for her husband and herself, plating them on banana leaves; a bit of excitement, a bit of nostalgia.

Stories and meals

This is privilege, of course. All of us who can sit at home, cook fantastic spreads, fix ourselves “quarantinis”, and post about these on social media must spare a thought to that restaurant worker whose establishment just shut and who has had to go not just on leave without pay but is now denied even his two meals a day that he ate in the staff kitchen. Or those who do not have the luxury of sitting at home with enough in the bank to tide them through self-imposed isolation. Yet, even amongst those with privilege, there is loss of occupation as the wheels of the global economy slow. Highly-paid influencers, whose travel and food stories generated fantastic views, and thus, endorsement deals, must now keep alive those accounts with the minutiae of their lives. What else is there to do but share recipes on online?

Throwback to the simple life

In isolation, the slower rhythm of the day is reminiscent of how we would spend time when schools shut, social media wasn’t a reality and there were fewer options of staying connected. In those days, old recipe collections would be brought out and, in the quiet of the kitchen, experiments conducted to the delight of the family gathered at the table at night.

This is what strikes me as I see the Instagram account of restaurateur Aditi Dugar, whose path-breaking Masque celebrated its coming of age on the World’s 50 Best “watch list” just about a fortnight ago, but who has since shut operations of her restaurant and highly-successful catering business. Assisted by her son, she made sweet potato dim sum in her home kitchen one afternoon, the process for all of us to see on Instagram. It reminded me of summer afternoons working with chachi, my aunt, making ice creams and cakes, cutting vegetables to be fried with noodles and learning to handle ovens, setting agents and mixers. Inside our bubbles, that is the life we must lead once more — and count ourselves lucky.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/khxm96/article31117704.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Growing-Chef-Studio4,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/hope-from-the-kitchen/article31117706.ece

“Mr. Cardoz (59), currently admitted to a hospital in New York in the U.S., tested positive for COVID-19 on March 18, 2020. As a precautionary measure, we have informed the Health Department in Mumbai about the same. We are also reaching out personally to people who have interacted with him during his visit to India, so they can take necessary medical advice should they indicate any symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) and/ or self-quarantine. Mr. Cardoz flew back to New York from Mumbai via Frankfurt on March 8, 2020,” the company said.

On Wednesday, the hospitality company had issued a statement saying Mr. Cardoz was “being closely monitored for his condition.” Industry sources and food professionals who attended the Bombay Canteen’s fifth anniversary party on March 1 said they have received calls from Mr. Cardoz’s business partners about the test results. A company spokesperson said none of the staff or management have exhibited any symptoms for COVID-19.

On Wednesday, in response to The Hindu’s query about the three city establishments run by Hunger Inc, a company spokesperson had said, “Bombay Canteen, O Pedro, and Bombay Sweet Shop are all closed based on the directive of the State government to control the spread of COVID-19.”

The Bench then directed municipal commissioners “to consider issuing a directive not to demolish, evict and/or hold auctions of attached properties. If corporations for compelling reasons are required to do so, they shall be at liberty to move appropriate courts and obtain orders.”

The court then directed all advocates to deliver the order by hand to civic bodies and adjourned the hearing to March 31.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hc-stays-all-demolitions-evictions-auction-of-properties/article31112583.ece
425,2020/03/20,Woman arrested for assaulting constables guarding Taloja jail,"Accused was irked as they made her wait to meet jailer

The Kharghar police have arrested the sister of a murder accused for assaulting constables at Taloja jail, who made her wait to meet the jailer.

Varinder Kaur Athwal (34), the sister of Mahendra Singh alias Zorawar Singh Bajwa alias Mitthu Balkan Singh, had gone to Taloja jail on Monday to submit a letter to the jailer.

Mr. Singh, a Gurgaon resident, was sent to jail on charges of murdering the former chairperson of Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, Meenakshi Jaiswal, at her Kharghar residence in December 2014. Jaiswal (46), was wife of Malegaon sessions court judge Santosh Jaiswal.

When Ms. Athwal was made to wait outside the jail while the prison staff took the letter to the official, she noticed that a few other people who had taken prior permission were allowed to enter inside, which irked her. Later, she questioned the constables and started abusing them for making her wait. When the constables tried to calm her down, she went on a rampage and attacked women constables guarding the prison.

Constable Rajni Vanve (27), in her complaint registered with the Kharghar police, has said the staff was taking out some of the undertrials to the court and for her safety she was asked to wait outside. Ms. Athwal then pushed the metal gate, causing a head injury to Ms. Vanve. When other constables intervened, Ms. Athwal hit them too, and tore the uniform of one of them.

Ms. Athwal, a resident of Belapur, was arrested under Sections 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant to deter him from discharge of his duty), 353 (assault or use of criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of the Indian Penal Code.

“She was presented before the court and has been remanded in judicial custody. She is currently at Kalyan jail,” an officer from Kharghar police station said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/woman-arrested-for-assaulting-constables-guarding-taloja-jail/article31112568.ece
426,2020/03/20,Employees yet to get work from home option,"State government had made the policy mandatory to contain spread of COVID-19

Many non-manufacturing companies in the city have not yet implemented the work from home policy for their employees despite the State government and the municipal corporation making the option mandatory to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, the municipal commissioner had directed non-essential private offices to work at 50% staff capacity or less. Only essential services such as water and electric supply, transport, ports, energy, and oil are exempted from the rule.

Employees of these companies said they have been forced to come to office and work full-time. “I am scared to come to work because of the virus, but there has been no word from my company on working from home. I am not in the operations department and can work from home, but the management is still making us slog,” said an employee. A woman employee said staff members do not maintain physical distance in her office in violation of guidelines.

Employees of small companies said their managements have rejected the idea of working at 50% capacity. “It is not just sharing an enclosed space with 50 others that concerns us, but commuting with no idea if the vehicles have been sanitised,” said a 30-year-old Mahim resident, who commutes daily to her workplace in south Mumbai.

On Wednesday, a woman informed the Mumbai Police in a tweet that her employers were threatening to sack her if she did not report for work. The police asked her to share the details over Direct Message, but she later deleted her tweet. She also did not respond to The Hindu’s message.

On Thursday, civic officials and the police inspected workplaces and did not find any office that was not complying with the rule. The Chembur offices of Tata Motors and Thomas Cook were working with less than 50% staff. In Goregaon, Blackrock Services, Ericsson India, and Price Waterhouse Coopers adhered to the guideline. Bharat Diamond Bourse in BKC and Ruby Mill in south Mumbai were also found following the rule.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/employees-yet-to-get-work-from-home-option/article31112454.ece
427,2020/03/20,Reply to plea on suspension of Sunday Mass: HC to State,"Petition also urges churches to stop Holy Communion

The Bombay High Court on Thursday directed the State government to reply to a letter seeking suspension of Sunday Mass in churches as a precautionary measure against the novel coronavirus.

The Division Bench of Chief Justice B.P. Dharmadhikari and Justice N.R. Borkar was hearing a plea filed through a letter by an advocate. The letter said Sunday Mass was being held in churches despite the government’s appeal to avoid gatherings. The letter said Catholic churches witness large gatherings for Holy Communion where the faithful are offered bread and wine. It said the ceremony has to be stopped as it poses a risk to the public.

Government counsel P.P. Kakade said the State had issued a government resolution on March 14 on not permitting large gatherings at religious places. Mr. Kakade then sought time to issue instructions. The matter will now be heard on Friday.

428,2020/03/20,"COVID-19: BMC dreading arrival of 26,000 citizens from West Asian nations","Civic body scrambles to make arrangements to quarantine people; seeks police help

With nearly 26,000 Indians preparing to return to the city from West Asia, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is staring at a logistical nightmare.

The corporation will have to screen at least 1,800 people at the airport every day and fit them into the appropriate category. Of the 26,000, even if it has to quarantine 6,000, the BMC does not have as many beds and is scrambling to make arrangements. The civic body will also need to monitor the health of the thousands who will be home quarantined through phone calls or GPS tracking on a daily basis with the police’s help.

On Wednesday, the BMC informed mediapersons that it is expecting around 26,000 people to land in the city between March 19 and 31 from the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman. About 23 flights come from these countries to Mumbai every day. Most of these are blue-collared workers employed in West Asia.

The passengers will be asked to fill two sets of forms on their flights with their contact information and other details. At the airport, they will be screened and put into three categories: ‘A’ for those showing symptoms and requiring immediate hospitalisation, ‘B’ for those with no symptoms but vulnerable due to their age or medical conditions, and ‘C’ for those with no symptoms.

Even though a very small percentage may actually fall in the ‘A’ category, all of them will have to be moved to a designated hospital for immediate testing and treatment. If they test positive, they will have to be isolated.

Mobile tracking

BMC’s logistical nightmare will begin with those in the ‘B’ and ‘C’ categories. The corporation is expecting those in the category ‘C’ to quarantine themselves at their homes.

Those who are from other parts of the State will be allowed to take private transport, while those who have nowhere to go will have to be quarantined along with the rest. “We are worried about the thousands in category ‘B’. So far, we have a quarantine capacity of around 3,000 beds,” said a senior civic officer.

The civic body will need to make immediate arrangements for 3,000 more, and would prefer hotels around the airport as they have the necessary level of cleanliness and systems in place, the officer said. “But the passengers will have to pay for those, something they may not be happy about.”

Of the remaining 80% in category ‘C’, BMC has teamed up with the police to keep track of them. “We have requested the police to use mobile tracking to ensure they are in one place. Besides, their hands will be stamped for easy identification,” said another officer.

The corporation, however, is not equipped to make calls to thousands of people to check if they have developed symptoms, which can even develop after a week or 10 days.

“We will be counselling everyone in home quarantine. With so much awareness being created, we are sure they will report their symptoms,” the officer said.

“Only a very small number will fall in category ‘A’. Even though the total number will increase, it won’t run into thousands,” additional municipal commissioner P. Velrasu said.

In the ‘B’ and ‘C’ categories, 70% are local residents and can go home, he said. “For the remaining 30%, we have requisitioned government guest houses, hostels, empty apartments. But yes, keeping track of their health will be a huge task,” Mr. Velrasu said.

Creating a database

The BMC has already appealed to hotels and private hospitals to charge nominal rates. Passengers will be given the option to go there or stay in municipal facilities.

The civic body is also creating a database using advanced software with the help of a private company to keep track of patients.

Several private laboratories have come forward to set up testing facilities. The corporation will help them procure permissions from the Centre.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/knjxye/article31112355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BMAIRPORTCOVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/covid-19-bmc-dreading-arrival-of-26000-citizens-from-west-asian-nations/article31112356.ece
429,2020/03/20,Coronavirus | Public transport agencies work in earnest to limit passenger flow,"8 lakh drop in ridership on BEST buses; 10 lakh dip on WR, CR

Fewer Mumbaikars were seen out on the streets during the peak hours on Thursday after public transport agencies pulled out all the stops to implement the new measures put in place by the State government to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Late on Wednesday, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray announced a new set of directives after holding a review meeting with stakeholders. The public transport agencies were directed to run services at 50% passenger capacity and ensure that there are no passengers who are not seated in buses.

The Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) Undertaking on Thursday deployed ticket checkers across bus stops and depots to ensure that buses were filled only to 50% capacity. Though ground staff ensured there were no standees in buses, conductors said some passengers climbed in when the bus slowed down at a turning or stopped at a signal.

“It became harder to ensure that buses had only seated passengers,” said a conductor. The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation began drives urging passengers to occupy seats.

As a result of the measures, the Central Railway (CR) and the Western Railway (WR) witnessed an average drop of 10 lakh commuters in daily ridership while the passenger traffic on BEST buses dropped by eight lakh. Both the CR and the WR have also decided to suspend AC local services from March 20 to 31.

Railway officials said suburban services will remain operational as many commuters still depend on it. The CR has cancelled another 30 long-distance passenger trains and the WR has cancelled 10 more trains.

On Thursday, many passengers on local trains were those who were not given the option to work from home. Mohammad Asif, an employee at a shop selling bags in Andheri, said, “We have to travel to make deliveries as long as the shop is open and the owner instructs us to do so.”

Arjun Saraswat, who works at a garment shop in Bandra, said he travels daily from Bhayandar as his shop is still open. He said, “We heard that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation [BMC] is shutting some markets. We don’t know if our employer will pay us if the shop shuts.”

The BMC on Wednesday night directed all wards to keep their markets open only on alternate days to prevent overcrowding.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/70kolm/article31112330.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BMEMPTYBUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/public-transport-agencies-work-in-earnest-to-limit-passenger-flow/article31112331.ece

431,2020/03/20,British national dies in blaze at Bandstand flat,"Another suffers burns in incident at spiritual healing centre

A 20-year-old British national, Evana Morrece, died in a fire that broke out on the premises of the School of Awakening, a spiritual healing centre in Bandra’s Bandstand area, on Thursday morning. Author and healer Sidra Jafri (38) suffered serious burns in the blaze.

Police officials said while the cause of the fire is being ascertained, the presence of a large amount of paint contributed to its spread. Ms. Jafri and Morrece, who were residing at Mon Repos, a building in the neighbourhood, along with their friend Surina Mangat, were believed to have been painting the flat and had decided to stay the night.

Early morning fire

Eyewitnesses said they noticed the fire raging at 7 a.m. on the sixth floor of Sea Springs Apartment, located diagonally opposite actor Shah Rukh Khan’s residence, Mannat. At 7.32 a.m., the incident was reported to the fire brigade.

The two women were rushed to Bhabha Hospital, where Morrece was pronounced dead on arrival and Ms. Jafri was moved to the ICU. Chief Medical Superintendent Dr. Pradeep A. Jhadav said, “Ms. Jafri was brought in unconscious and in an extremely critical condition as her lungs were filled with smoke. She also had serious burns. We then administered IV fluids and antibiotics and attended to the burn injuries.”

Though doctors suggested shifting the patient to National Burns Centre in Airoli, the step was not taken due to the severity of injuries. Ms. Jafri is the author of The Awakening: 9 Principles for finding the courage to change your life.

The School of Awakening was functioning from the 3BHK flat and workshops and online classes were conducted from its premises.

Inflammable material

Senior police officer Vijayalaxmi Hiremath said, “The cause of the fire is not yet known. The forensic team and the fire brigade are both conducting their investigations. However, it can be said that the fire started in the hall and flammable material in the living room led to it spreading.”

With no next of kin present in the country, the Mumbai Police notified the British Embassy about the death of Morrece.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/w01tyb/article31112306.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BMONEDEAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/british-national-dies-in-blaze-at-bandstand-flat/article31112307.ece
432,2020/03/20,Coronavirus | Private hospitals told to cap isolation rates,"They can charge 50% of usual rates or ₹4,000, whichever is less, says civic chief

Private hospitals in the city that are allocating isolation beds for COVID-19 patients will have to limit their charges per bed to ₹4,000. Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi has said that the hospitals should charge 50% less than their usual charges per bed, or ₹4,000, whichever amount is lower.

Nine private hospitals will set aside nearly 100 isolation beds for patients who can afford to pay for the facilities.

Additionally, in a special arrangement, the HN Reliance Hospital and Jaslok Hospital will manage 125 isolation beds at the Seven Hills Hospital in Marol, which has been designated a quarantine facility by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).

Staffing options

The BMC has appointed physician Dr. Gautam Bhansali to take charge of staffing for the isolation beds at Seven Hills Hospital. “Because of the lockdown, elective work in hospitals and nursing homes has reduced a bit. I am trying to mobilise the manpower from various such hospitals and nursing homes who are willing to do the work,” Dr. Bhansali said.

He said he has a list of 40 doctors and 50 nurses so far. “Given that it is a health emergency, many doctors are volunteering to offer their services,” he said.

Within their own premises, Jaslok and Fortis hospitals have already set aside their beds, while others are in the process of doing so. Civic executive health officer Dr. Padmaja Keskar said, “Patients who have the paying capability can go to private hospitals. The hospitals will have to collect the swab samples and send them to the Kasturba Hospital for testing.”

Meanwhile, Bandra’s Lilavati Hospital has expressed willingness to convert a vacant BMC building into an isolation facility with 30 beds. Mr. Pardeshi has directed that the building be handed over to the hospital administration.

Testing at KEM Hospital

Meanwhile, Parel’s KEM Hospital started testing suspected COVID-19 samples on Thursday. It tested 25 samples on the first day and has been equipped to test 150 samples a day.

Besides, six private labs have been asked to procure test kits from approved sources. Mr. Pardeshi has requested them to charge the least possible amount for the tests. The private laboratories have been asked to focus on asymptomatic people who have a travel history that might have resulted in a novel coronavirus infection.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/4obrej/article31112298.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BMMASKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pvt-hospitals-told-to-cap-isolation-rates/article31112299.ece

Health Minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday warned Mumbaikars that if they don’t comply with government advisories to curb the novel coronavirus outbreak, the city could be put into a complete lockdown.

He also said it has been observed that some people are diverting their travel through countries not notified by the Union government for quarantine. He said there is an increasing demand to suspend all international flights arriving at Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur airports for the next 10 days.

Meanwhile, the State government on Thursday issued a circular to cancel all departmental meetings. Officials will meet only in case of an utmost emergency. The circular said that in case meetings were to be held, the seating arrangement should ensure a safe distance between officials.

Mr. Tope said there have been cases of travellers from Spain, which is severely hit by virus, choosing to fly to Mumbai from the Netherlands to escape screening.

435,2020/03/20,Infrastructure is key,"Affordable housing and Bengaluru development receive a boost in the State Budget presented recently. A look by Shrinivas Rao

The Karnataka Budget for 2020-21 held much significance, given the magnitude of the current state of affairs in the country’s economy. Expectations regarding the budget ran high with conjectures galore on how the government planned to provide succour in such testing times.

Presenting the budget in the Assembly on March 5, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa laid emphasis on several sectors, the primary focus understandably on agriculture. The budget also imparted considerable weightage to developing the infrastructure of the region, recognising the fact that it played a key role in attracting investments.

Bengaluru accounted for a better part of the slice sanctioned for infrastructure development. Taking cognisance of the fact that Bengaluru, the key driver of the State’s economy, required substantial support to keep the momentum running, particularly in the face of other cities such as Hyderabad providing stiff competition, the Chief Minister sanctioned ₹8,772 crore for 2020-21 towards the city’s development, keeping on board various departments such as Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike and Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board.

In a bid to improving the infrastructure of the city marred with congestion woes, the budget announced the extension of two new Metro rail corridors totalling 44 km A detailed project report for J.P. Nagar-Magadi Road and Outer Ring Road-West Metro corridors is awaited and both will be developed through a public-private partnership, the first time that such a model has been proposed for a Metro rail project in the city. When completed, the Outer Ring Road Metro project will connect Hebbal and J.P. Nagar, helping ease traffic bottlenecks on the ORR. The budget also announced that the extension of two Metro rail lines of a total length of 12.8 km, one till Kengeri on Mysuru Road and the other till Anjanapura township on Kanakapura Road, would be operational in 2020.

Bengaluru infrastructure development received added impetus with the budget sanctioning ₹500 crore for the long-pending suburban rail in 2020-21. The government also announced its decision to provide loan subsidy to BMTC to purchase more buses. A grant of ₹100 crore has been approved for BMTC to include 500 electric buses, while another 90 electric buses are being bought under the Smart City project, which will act as Metro feeder services.

The Chief Minister expressed hopes that measures such as these would help in improving infrastructure in Bengaluru, and the creation of more transit-based development and essential regulatory measures will lead to an increase in the utilisation of public transport from the current 48% to 73%.

Additionally, the budget announced that the Hassan-Mangaluru Rail Development Corporation will increase the capacity of rail line in the ghat region between Sakleshpur and Subrahmanya stations, which will, in turn, enhance the speed of commute between Bengaluru and Mangaluru.

Impetus to affordable housing

The real estate sector, that had anticipated major measures to be announced in the Union Budget, awaited expectantly the State budget’s announcements, as a host of issues ranging from liquidity crunch in the sector to GST rates, had slackened the sector’s growth in the residential segment in the past few years. In a positive development, the Chief Minister, to promote affordable housing in the region, announced that stamp duty on new flats or apartments costing less than ₹20 lakh would be reduced to 2% from 5%. This would be applicable from April 1, 2020, onwards. Moreover, the Kaveri software of the Stamps and Registration Department will be integrated with the e-Aasthi application of the State Urban Development Department while a Kaveri-2 software application will be developed in the new fiscal for registering immovable property documents.

Interestingly, Karnataka has been lagging significantly on the affordable housing front. It has been reported that out of the 3.55 lakh housing units approved under the PMAY since 2015 when the government started the project, only around 11,306 houses have been completed in 2019 in the State with fewer numbers delivered to the beneficiaries.

There have been appeals to lower the stamp duty for affordable housing in the past, and with the new reduced rates in place, the segment is expected to pick up pace, both on the developer and the buyer front.

The State budget also allocated considerable amounts to a host of other sectors, while continuing to focus on strengthening agriculture and rural economy, affordable housing and infrastructure development. It remains to be seen if the measures announced are implemented judiciously, bringing forth the vision that the government has.

436,2020/03/20,Dip in property values,"Property values in India’s prime residential markets have seen dismal growth in the past five years, indicating that a prolonged demand slowdown has kept value appreciation under check, data available with PropTiger.com show.

At 7% CAGR (compound annual growth rate), Hyderabad saw the highest increase between March 2015 and March 2020. Besides Hyderabad, only Mumbai and Bengaluru saw any noteworthy rise — of 2.8% and 2.1% CAGR, respectively. Gurugram and Noida markets saw a decline.

“An ongoing demand slowdown in India’s real estate market has kept price growth in check, as a result of which housing rates in most markets have shown only negligible growth. If Hyderabad stands as an exception, it has more to do with the fact that the base price in what is referred to as India’s pharmaceutical capital was quite low during 2015. The State bifurcation also pushed prices upwards. On the other hand, moderate correction is seen in key NCR markets, primarily because of major delays in project completion by key developers,” says Dhruv Agarwala, Group CEO, Housing.com, Makaan.com & PropTiger.com

Hyderabad saw the average value of apartments increasing 40% to reach ₹5,318 per square foot (psf). In Mumbai, the average value rose 15% to ₹9,446 psf. At the third spot on the list was India’s technology capital Bengaluru, where the average apartment value rose 11% to ₹5,194 psf.

437,2020/03/20,How to keep indoor spaces healthy,"With the coronavirus crisis upon us, here is how you can ensure your indoors are well-maintained, says Anupama Mohanram

I have often highlighted the importance of natural light, ventilation and eco-friendly building materials in our homes. And there couldn’t be a better time to emphasise the need to maintain healthy indoor spaces. With the coronavirus spreading rapidly, it is imperative we take swift action and ensure our surroundings are clean too.

Closed indoor spaces that are not well ventilated can easily become breeding ground for any infection. Sick building syndrome (SBS), a condition that results in headaches and respiratory problems, is attributed to unhealthy indoor spaces.

The importance of natural light and ventilation for human health was understood over a 100 years ago. Case in point is the 1918 influzena pandemic, wherein it was found that severely ill flu patients, who were nursed outdoors, recovered better than those who were treated indoors. A combination of natural light and fresh air resulted in faster recovery.

In fact, research in the 1960s revealed the existence of an ‘open air factor’ that is found in fresh air which kills airborne bacteria and viruses faster than indoor air. This makes fresh air a natural disinfectant. Thus, this is a clear case of the need for adequate cross ventilation and fresh air distribution within our indoor spaces.

Also, sunlight is important for the synthesis of Vitamin D, which is required for the proper fucntioning of the immune system and could play a role in resistance to infections. A constant visual and physical connection to nature helps keep us calm and free of stress, which, in turn, can enhance our body’s immune system.

Considering the above, a few things to keep in mind while building or buying a home in order to ensure healthy living conditions:

l Ensure 100% of the spaces have access to adequate natural light and cross ventilation. This assumes that the building has been designed sensibly to keep our indoors cool without relying on air-conditioning.

l Give preference to natural building materials.

l Avoid finishes (paints, adhesives, panelling, carpeting, etc.) that have harmful emissions that impact immunity or are susceptible to pathogen growth. Look for green certified finishes and products.

l Maintain air-purifying plants to promote clean indoor air.

l Maintaining kitchen/roof gardens which allow us to grow organic food as well as keep our roofs cool.

l All of these can help bring about a truly healthy lifestyle not only for us but also for our environment.

438,2020/03/20,Every drop counts: why grey water recycling is a must,"Grey water recycling is a must for a water-starved country like India, says Nidhi Adlakha

While we are all washing our hands regularly to stay safe from the coronavirus pandemic, we cannot afford to take water for granted by leaving taps on for the 20-second cleansing routine. And since you are now spending a lot more time indoors, how about looking at setting up a grey water system at home?

Approximately 50-70% of the water used in your house results in grey water generation and not even 5% of this is recycled in urban households. This water is suitable for in-situ recycling using simple, low-cost technologies, and it is rather unfortunate that the concept is not commonplace in a water-starved country like India.

With World Water Day being observed tomorrow, and a harsh summer upon us, it’s time we look at not just using water judiciously, but also recycling what we can. Dr. P.Venkateswaran, Deputy General Manager — Operations & Maintenance, at Sri City in Andhra Pradesh, says that traditional in-built practices like landscaping with grey water and rainwater harvesting have diminished due to rapid urbanisation and the commercialisation of land. “Scientists and technocrats are working hard to find alternative ways to source fresh water, like desalination, cloud precipitation technologies, etc. But these advanced technologies are resulting in making water more expensive, artificial and unaffordable for the common man. So when we have simple, reliable, eco-friendly and cost-effective methods like recycling, why should we opt for costly technologies?”

Rising awareness

The Chennai Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board is championing the use of treated water (grey and black) for supply to industries, thereby reducing the pressure on freshwater demand, says Venkateswaran. Thermal power plants and industries like Chennai Petrochemical Ltd., Madras Fertilizers Ltd. and Madras Petrochemicals Ltd. are already using treated sewage for industrial purposes. “Residential apartments are using reclaimed water for flushing and landscaping applications due to a statutory compulsion, but the availability of open space for disposal is a major constraint,” he says.

To the point In his 2005 book, Self Reliance in Water, Chennai-based environmentalist Indukanth Ragade breaks down the recycling process. He classifies used water into three categories: sewage (black water), kitchen outflow and bath water (grey water).

‘Good building practice requires that these three streams of water be taken out of our homes into three different pipelines,’ he writes, and elaborates on ways to treat wastewater using soil and plants, with installation and maintenance tips, and ways to integrate rainwater harvesting and grey water systems.

The author can be contacted at isragade@yahoo.com

Venkateswaran explains that if grey water is utilised at source, additional costs of treatment, disposal, etc. can be avoided. “India’s urban areas generate 61,948 million litres (MLD) of sewage a day, of which about 35% is collected and treated in sewage treatment plants. In Chennai, 1,200 MLD of water is utilised every day, a minimum of 600 MLD of grey water is generated, which gets microbially contaminated after mixing with black water.”

Going by these numbers, it is evident that there is immense scope and need to recycle grey water. Luckily, there has been a lot of awareness of late, especially in urban areas, says Abhijit Sathe, who founded JalSevak Solutions (jalsevak.in) in 2016. The Navi Mumbai-based start-up was founded with the objective of providing compact, onsite greywater recycling solutions to residential customers. “We perform filtration using dual stage fabric filters and chemical treatment through a controlled dosage of chlorine. The system is low-maintenance; only the periodic cleaning of filters and refilling of chemicals in the chamber is required,” says Sathe, who developed the solution with support from IIT Kanpur’s Startup Incubation and Innovation Centre.

Taking me through his water-saving system, he explains how an average Indian residing in an urban area utilises approximately 180 litres of water every day, of which 45-50 litres (25%) is spent on toilet flushing. “For a family of four, the total amount of grey water generated is approximately 400 litres per day. Using our solutions, this water can be recycled for gardening and toilet flushing, saving 400 litres of fresh water every day,” says Sathe, adding that a small family can potentially conserve 12,000 litres of fresh water every month.

Quoting the example of Kanpur’s Jai Narayan School, he explains that with the new recycling system, the school is saving approximately 3,000 litres of fresh water every day. “They are reusing laundry wastewater to flush toilets in the boys’ hostel. The school is thus saving 3,000 litres of groundwater which would otherwise be used in flushing.”

Cost matters

While awareness has increased, consumers are not open to installing costly solutions. “There is huge demand for cost-effective and compact solutions that require minimum re-plumbing,” says Sathe, who has installed recycling systems in Navi Mumbai, New Delhi, Coimbatore, Hyderabad and Bengaluru. For an individual house under construction, installing the solution will cost anywhere between ₹45,000 and ₹65,000. “The price includes the cost of filters, chemical chambers, storage tanks, pump and supporting controls, and plumbing. For an existing individual home, this cost can go up depending on the level of re-plumbing necessary.”

In the absence of automated solutions, people need to manually recycle grey water by using wastewater from the washing machine to wash toilets. “A few customers have also developed a primitive piping mechanism to send kitchen wastewater to their gardens. However, such systems do not function in the long run and suffer from lack of maintenance,” warns Sathe.

Keep in mind Do

1. Consult a professional to design and install the system

2. Segregate light and dark grey water

3. Install sub-surface or covered drains for irrigating landscape areas

4. Disinfect treated grey water to use for purposes other than for gardening/ landscaping

5. Ensure there is no stagnation of grey water and redirect the surplus to sewerage lines / ground water recharging.

Don’t

1. Store untreated grey water for more than 24 hours

2. Discard concentrated liquids such as used oil and left-over food in grey water pipes.

3. Allow excess treated grey water to mix with any water body.

Highlighting the benefits at a commercial level, Eshwar N, Chief Marketing Officer at Casagrand, says the STPs (set up by Green Earth Systems) at their various projects in Chennai, Bengaluru and Coimbatore have worked to bring down water consumption. “Water from these plants is used to flush toilets and water landscaped areas. The average estimated water conserved [on a daily basis] is 25 litres per head, for flushing, and 1.5 litres per sq. ft for landscaping,” he says, “The approximate cost to set up a grey water treatment system for an apartment complex of 10 units is ₹3 lakh.”

Eshwar adds that while water recycling as a concept is widespread, there is limited knowledge on the collection and use of grey water. “With modern apartments using STPs integrated with grey water, awareness is gradually increasing.”

What you can do

What people need to do is incorporate recycling systems during construction. Venkateswaran of Sri City advises people to install a ‘dual plumbing’ mechanism to use grey water / STP treated water.

Light grey water sources are bathrooms, showers, hand basins, laundry rinses and RO rejects, whereas dark grey water sources are dish washing, the first wash from the washing machine and kitchen sinks. “At an economical level, every citizen can divert the bathroom wastewater to a small sump followed by a root zone treatment and gravity sand filters. This method doesn’t require power, chemical, or maintenance. Post filtration, this water can be pumped and used for flushing toilets. A minimum of 2.5 sq. ft space per person is adequate,” he explains.

A complete grey (light + dark) water reusing system, including kitchen waste, requires an oil/ grease trap and a sedimentation facility in addition to the system. “A four member family can reuse 360 litres of water a day. An area of about 50-75 sq.ft. is required and the investment will range from ₹50,000 to ₹1.5 lakh, and will vary on a case-by-case basis. You can recover this amount in 2-3 years by saving on buying fresh water. Such a treatment facility can also be set up on an open terrace,” concludes Venkateswaran.",homes and gardens,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/f9pzvk/article31117503.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-685479300,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/grey-water-recycling-is-a-must-for-a-water-starved-country-like-india/article31117504.ece

442,2020/03/20,"Defer hospital visit for minor ailments, elective surgery: Jipmer","Hospital issues advisory to patients to avoid risk of infection

Jipmer has issued an advisory discouraging patients with minor ailments or those scheduled for an elective surgery from visiting the institution to avoid the risk of new infections, including the COVID-19.

In the advisory, Jipmer Director Rakesh Aggarwal and A. S. Badhe, Medical Superintendent, pointed out that large hospitals were also part of the crowded places that the Government of India has instructed citizens to avoid in view of the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Jipmer, for instance, is visited by 8,000 to 10,000 patients every day, in addition to their attendants. Also, the crowd in the hospital is more likely to include patients with COVID-19. Thus, there is a risk of those visiting Jipmer contracting the COVID-19 infection. Further, visitors to hospitals are often the elderly, infirm and the more vulnerable, in whom the infection is more likely to be severe or fatal.

In this situation, Jipmer has urged the public to follow a set of recommendations.

Patients with minor ailments seeking medical advice are strongly discouraged from visiting the Jipmer hospital, in view of disproportionately high risk of exposure to infections (including COVID-19 infection) in the crowded hospital setting.

As elderly persons and persons with such diseases are most vulnerable to serious and fatal infection with COVID-19, patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer and heart disease on regular and continuous medications should avoid visiting the hospital simply for receiving drugs.

They can get their regular medications from a nearby government hospital or from Jan Aushadhi Pharmacies at subsidised cost using a previous prescription from Jipmer.

All patients needing an elective (non-urgent) surgical procedure are strongly advised to delay their visit to the hospital till the Government of India lifts restrictions.

Only patients with critical ailment and needing tertiary care facilities should visit Jipmer.

“Each patient needs to understand the risk of exposure in a large hospital such as Jipmer and balance this against the genuine benefit of such a visit,” Jipmer said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/ta2tik/article31112925.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THJIPMERCAMPUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/defer-hospital-visit-for-minor-ailments-elective-surgery-jipmer/article31112927.ece

446,2020/03/20,Tree talk,"The trees in the garden spoke and laughed. Sometimes, they even cried in pain. Vinay heard them all.

Nine-year-old Vinay ran out of his grandmother’s house, into her garden. Mango, papaya, tamarind and guava trees, dotted the garden. Birds chirped on the branches. Squirrels chattered, scurrying around the tree trunks.

Toto, their pug, bounded out of the house, barking excitedly. Staying with his grandparents, Vinay spent a lot of time in the garden.

“Just like we humans react to different stress conditions, trees too react and have emotions,” said his grandfather as he joined him in the garden.

Vinay wanted to check what his grandfather had said, that when a human touched a leaf or a tree, they changed their tones. He wanted to see whether trees had a life and could talk and feel.

Talking trees?

Approaching a tree, Vinay touched a leaf.

Hearing the happy gurgle of a baby, Vinay looked around. Other than him and Toto, the garden was empty. Grandfather had gone for his walk.

A cool breeze rustled the leaves. Moving to the tamarind tree, Vinay caressed its trunk.

“Hmmmmm,” soothing sounds came from the tree. Vinay’s eyes widened. Trees could talk!

He tickled the tree.

“Ha ha,” the tree laughed.

Toto tugged at his shorts, clamouring for attention. Vinay ran around the trees, Toto chased him. Soon, the other trees too began laughing, happy to see the boy and dog play around them. The birds chirped, the squirrels chattered.

His grandmother came out of the house.

“Can you hear someone laughing?” Vinay asked.

“No,” his grandmother replied. “It’s your imagination. It’s going to rain. You better come in.”

As drops of rain fell, Vinay heard sighs of relief from the parched trees.

A few days later, Vinay was again playing with Toto in the garden. Now, he heard groans.

“Eeee,” someone was wailing.

Vinay went around the garden searching for the creature calling out. The garden was empty. He saw workers chopping the branches of the tamarind tree, as it was extending over the wall.

“Who gave you permission to cut our tree?” Vinay asked.

“Your grandfather got a notice from your neighbour. The branches of the tamarind tree are leaning onto the neighbouring house and damaging their windows,” the worker replied. “That’s why we are cutting some branches.”

As Vinay neared the tree, he realised that the sounds of pain were coming from the tamarind tree.

“Tch, tch,” said the branches of the guava tree as it leaned over to the tamarind tree, in an attempt at consoling.

Secret talks

Vinay stared at the two trees. He seemed to be the only one who could hear their conversation. The workers heard nothing.

Suddenly, Vinay heard a whole lot of different sounds. He looked around the garden, the trees, bushes and plants were whispering their secrets to him.

Vinay moved from tree to tree, listening. The mango tree was complaining about the mark on its bark, where someone had carved out their initials.

Vinay ran into the house, returning with an ice-cube, he rubbed it over the bark.

“Ah,” the tree sighed in relief.

The papaya tree complained of thirst.

Checking to see if his grandmother was watching him from the windows, Vinay poured his coconut water at the base of the papaya tree.

The fig tree groaned in pain. Someone had lit crackers underneath it, last night. Vinay comforted it.

Every evening, Vinay would talk to the trees. During his holidays, with his grandfather’s help, he began cleaning and nursing the trees and making compost using vegetable peels, tea leaves and manure.

“Your green friends are looking so healthy and happy,” his grandfather smiled. “Look at the fruits growing on the trees,” he said as he pointed to the abundance of guavas, figs and papayas.

“Dada, is it true that trees are the lungs of a place?” Vinay asked.

“Yes,” his grandfather replied. “Trees produce oxygen and reduce smog, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Trees are natural air-conditioners, their evaporation produces a cooling effect. They provide habitats for various birds, insects and animals. The colour green is soothing, it calms the nerves and the mind, and relieves eye-strain.”

449,2020/03/20,COVID-19 fear spurs people to stock up essentials,"Many thronged the markets to buy vegetables that would last for at least seven days

Amid rumours on possible public restrictions due to spread of COVID-19 virus, residents of Tiruchi on Thursday made a beeline to grocery stores, shopping malls and vegetable markets so as to stock up on essential commodities.

Though the trend was noticed on Wednesday evening, more and more people hit the market to buy groceries and vegetables on Thursday. The Gandhi Market, which houses a number of vegetables, fruits and meat stalls, witnessed a sharp rise in customers than usual. The grocery shops too drew more customers than normal days. Similar was the scene in farmers’ market (uzhavar sandy) in Anna Nagar, K.K. Nagar and others. The shopping malls, which have dedicated wings for groceries too received more customers. They paid more attention on buying vegetables and fruits. Many residents bought vegetables for at least seven days.

“We do not know what will happen tomorrow. We need to stock up the essential commodities as a precautionary step, I have bought vegetables for a week,” said M. Karthika of Cantonment, who shopped at a retail chain store on Reynolds Road. There were customers, who bought biscuits, noodles and ready mix food packets. Toiletries, soaps and hand wash liquid were among those largely bought by them. Most of the customers invariably looked for sanitisers. But, they ended up disappointed as the employees told them that there was no stock. But, a section of customers did not show any sign of panic buying. They bought vegetables only for one or two days.

L. Mallika of Bheema Nagar said that she did not foresee complete lock down. There would not be any problem in getting essential items. Hence, there was no need for buying essentials for a long period, she said.

While agreeing that the customers had been indulging in panic buying to some extent, a manager of a chain store told The Hindu that the sale of essential commodities had gone up considerably. Stocks of many commodities were exhausting fast. There was a shortage of some items as the supply chain was struggling to replace them due to transportation issues.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/sup3j6/article31114885.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY20VEGIESTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/covid-19-fear-spurs-people-to-stock-up-essentials/article31114886.ece

NASA said it has suspended work on building and testing the rocket and capsule for its Artemis manned mission to the Moon due to the rising number of coronavirus cases in the community.

The space agency is shutting down its Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, where the Space Launch System rocket is being built, and the nearby Stennis Space Center, administrator Jim Bridenstine said late Thursday.

“The change at Stennis was made due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the community around the center, the number of self-isolation cases within our workforce there, and one confirmed case among our Stennis team,” he said.

“NASA will temporarily suspend production and testing of Space Launch System and Orion hardware. The NASA and contractors teams will complete an orderly shutdown that puts all hardware in a safe condition until work can resume.”

The Space Launch System is a powerful deep space rocket to transport astronauts to the Moon and beyond while Orion is the crew module.

The virus outbreak could hit US plans to return to the Moon by 2024.

“We realize there will be impacts to NASA missions, but as our teams work to analyze the full picture and reduce risks we understand that our top priority is the health and safety of the NASA workforce,” Bridenstine said.

453,2020/03/20,On the dot,"Bhuri Bai, a tribal woman from Madhya Pradesh, whose paintings are compiled in the book Dotted Lines, tells her story of resilience on World Storytelling Day

Bhuri Bai is not an unfamiliar name in the field of arts. She is the first tribal woman artist who dared to take the traditional Pithora paintings beyond the walls of the huts in her village in Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh. Albeit with a minor improvisation. She transferred the folk art form from the mud walls to huge canvasses and sheets of paper. It fetched her recognition, fame, awards and money.

Yet, a small book that she has co-authored with Debjani Mukherjee, research scholar with IDC School of Design at IIT Bombay, is giving Bhuri Bai the happiness she always yearned for during her years of struggle “Main aage badh paa rahi hoon (I am able to progress),” she says over the phone from Bhopal, where her vibrant art works influenced by the original Pithora paintings and tweaked as contemporary Bhil art, find a permanent place of pride in the Tribal Museum.

One of Katha’s recent publications, the book titled Dotted Lines is not just a compilation of 20 themed paintings that take you through a visual autobiography of Bhuri Bai. “It is a learning about the traditional Pithora art that hides a tale of empowerment, illustrates a unique culture and reveals how art can both be saved and be a saviour,” says Debjani.

The journey of the book started when she went to Bhopal as part of her research on indigenous art forms. During a soft launch of the book in Madurai (which was followed by the official release in Bhopal recently), Debjani narrated the story of Bhuri Bai who broke the gender barrier in her Bhil community (a migratory tribe from Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat) to transform herself from an indigenous local painter to a contemporary folk artist.

The typical dotted paintings in the book tell Bhuri’s story, of her childhood days and family, village life and surroundings, how art and Nature intertwined in their lives, and yet, the culture and customs followed by the Bhil people kept women away from painting their houses. The men believed girls, after attaining puberty, become ‘impure’, and hence the ritual of painting to receive blessings of their deity, Dev Pithora, was only the man’s prerogative.

Bhuri Bai says she would sit in a corner and watch the village priest and the male members in the family, make natural colours with flowers, clay, and seeds and then paint with them on the walls. The painting style would follow elaborate patterns and coiling designs. There was a calculation for dots based on seeds of maize (corn) that was grown in that belt, she adds, and has a striking resemblance to works of the Australian aboriginals.

Through her paintings, Bhuri highlights how art attracted her but she continued to till the land till she moved to Bhopal as a daily wager at the Bharat Bhavan cultural centre. This proved to be a turning point because she met well-known Indian artist Jagdish Swaminathan who suggested she paint the traditional pithora art on a sheet of paper.

Bhuri Bai recalls she was nervous to start as she had never used paint brushes and acrylic colours but she soon conquered her fears and started painting her village life from memory.

The bright colours of her village festivities, the scenes of daily life, village architecture, the forests, flora and fauna, traditional attires and ornaments, the dances.... Soon she began incorporating elements of urban and industrial life and painted everything she saw around her and her contemporary themes converted the traditional and ritualistic Bhil pithora paintings into contemporary Bhil.

Says Debjani, “This is a classic case of art moving towards commercialisation not to kill it, the art but for its evolution.” In the traditional pithora art, one single wall of painting would depict series of scenes from a story, while in Bhil art every scene became an individual piece of work retaining the dotted style, she explains. When Debjani started her research on pedagogy of indigenous art education in 2014, she spent two years interviewing and documenting the work of 70-odd Bhil artists and studying their works displayed at the State Museum, Bharat Bhavan, Tribal Museum and Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sanghralay. That is when she met Bhuri and got to know her story. of breaking free from the community shackles that did not allow women to paint. “I trained under her for another two years learning to make the dotted paintings. My objective was to create awareness about indigenous artists and highlight their purpose, belief and practices that were responsible and holistic,” she says.

Once Bhuri Bai’s contemporary works began to receive global acceptance, she went back to her village to train the girls in the art form and encourage them to paint. “Our art is therapeutic and meditative,” says Bhuri Bai and today she trains about two-dozen women.

Debjani strongly feels indigenous art is shared heritage. “There is a need to support artists like Bhuri Bai who are keeping the art alive by teaching it to a wider section of people and trying to prevent careless copying of their hard-worked images,” she says.

Working with tribal artists through collaborations in order to guard against appropriation of indigenous art, Debjani came up with the idea of Dotted Lines. “It is Bhuri Bai’s first book aimed at defining her role as a teacher and artist within the community and outside as well and to tell the modern world how the art form can be kept safe in future,” says Debjani, who is now making an animated documentary film by the same name.

She also conducts therapy workshops for students using art as an effective tool for self-discovery and social change. “Such efforts help to bridge the gap between the modern industrialised world and the unique lifestyles of adivasis and save ancestral knowledge and wisdom,” she adds. “It helps you grow beyond.”

Breaking the barrier

454,2020/03/20,COVID-19: Resorts and hotels in Kovalam announce packages for those opting to work from there,"They offer rooms at discounted rates along with other facilities

Companies across the world have moved to work-from-home mode to stop the spread of the Coronavirus. But some hotels and resorts in and around Kovalam are tempting clients to work from the comforts of a beachside room. Facilities are being provided at discounted rates, inclusive of food.

Discounted rates

Newton’s Neelakanta Boutique Beach Resort promises to provide an air-conditioned co-working space. “It is for groups of four people each and the rate is ₹900 per person, which covers lunch and bottled water. They can use the room from 8 am to 6 pm. They will have to arrange for Wi-fi because our facility won’t be enough to support a co-working space,” says Ajish Nambiar, who runs the resort.

And it is an additional ₹1,100 per night for two people if they plan on staying in the resort. “The special rates are for this particular period. Our business has been severely hit by the spread of the virus. The inflow of foreign tourists has dried up and we have stopped taking domestic guests as well. So we needed to find an alternative to keep the resort running. That’s how we came up with this idea. We have been getting calls enquiring about the facilities. We are looking at small groups who have to work as a team but can’t go to their office,” he adds.

Uday Samudra Leisure Beach Hotel and Spa has come up with a one-month package for those who want to work from the hotel. “We have set aside 20-25 rooms for this purpose and have already got two clients, both working in Technopark. Instead of our usual rate of ₹ 1.35 lakh a month per head, we are giving the rooms for ₹45,000 per person, which comes to ₹1,500 per day. For two people we are charging ₹59,000 after a discount,” says Rajagopaal Iyer, CEO of the hotel.

He adds that the guests can also opt to work in the open area, especially from spaces such as the coffee shop. There will be no restriction on the timings. The hotel has only basic Wi-fi facilities. However, arrangements will be made to provide better network, he adds.

In addition, there is a 50 percent discount on breakfast, lunch, dinner, spa, Ayurveda and free usage of pool and gym. “We have an in-house doctor who is available round-the-clock to provide any medical care for the guests,” Rajagopaal says.

Both of them emphasise that the staff members of the hotel have been asked to ensure minimum contact with the guests. “We also expect the guests to take necessary precautions,” says Ajish.

OFF THE MENU

For the time being, many gourmets have switched to cook-it-yourself mode. Though restaurateurs feel the pinch over the triple effects of restrictions imposed over containing spread of Coronavirus, a bird flu scare, which was earlier reported in northern parts of the State, and an exodus of migrant staff, many are upbeat about turning a corner soon. Muhammad Shakeer, owner of Thaqwa restaurant in Enchakkal, says that there is a slight spike in takeaways from his diner. “Beef and mutton dishes are having more takers than chicken dishes,” says Shakeer.

Sukil Ram of Poomaram – Ram’s Kitchen near Akkulam off the Kazhakkuttam highway, says focus now is now more on meals, vegetarian dishes and fish, of course,” he explains. With a sizeable number of employees in the industry hailing from Northern parts of the country, some hoteliers face the task of convincing their staff to stay put against “fake news and misinformation” about spread of the virus. However, quite a few have downed shutters after several of their staff decided to return home. Despite the grim outlook, restaurateurs say they prefer to see the glass as half full and hope things will be back on track soon

455,2020/03/20,“The tiger sees me daily”,"Sreenivasan K was recognised by the Government for his knowledge and efforts at tiger monitoring in the Parambikulam Tiger Reserve

“I cannot express my happiness at this recognition. I have worked very hard and it fills me with such joy that my eyes well up,” says Sreenivasan K on being recognised by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate for his knowledge and efforts at tiger monitoring in the Parambikulam Tiger Reserve. He is one of the six Frontline Staff — Forester, Forest Guard, Watcher — from across India who was feted.

Nicknamed Tiger Sreeni, he was born and raised in the forests of Parambikulam, where he lives with his wife and three children. As a child, Sreenivasan would accompany his father who was a mahout and explored the forests thus.

Vysak Sasikumar, Deputy Director, IFS, Parambikulam Tiger Reserve says, “ Sreeni belongs to the Malasar group, one of the four tribal communities in the hills, and has been working with us for the past 20 years. He began as a watcher and assisted forest staff in patrolling.”

Ten years ago the forest department began scientific wildlife management and constituted a tiger monitoring team of 13 members, all of whom belong to the tribes from the area. Sreeni was a part of this as his knowledge of reading landscape was exceptional.

“Tiger monitoring is a long-term study on the population dynamics of the tiger. Earlier the pug mark method was followed but it was unscientific. The Wildlife Institute in Dehradun formulated a methodology that is based on a grid system. The entire forest is divided into grids and the frequency of tiger sightings in the grids is caught on camera. Srinivasan has this expertise,” says Vysak.

Sreeni says that he has sighted tigers nearly 2,000 times. After a Divisional Forest Officer gifted him a camera in 2010, he was able to shoot the tigers and provide evidence. One of his most dramatic photos is of five tigers in a single frame.

His expertise also makes him the most sought-after guide by research scholars who come to the forest for in-depth study. He is also a teacher in the Nature Camps, a residential programme for schools by the Government of Kerala.

Shefiq Basheer Ahammed, Joint RTO and wildlife photographer, has always chosen Sreeni to be his guide in the wild, for the last 15 years. “He knows each every nook and cranny of Parambikulam and has extra knowledge about animal population,” says Shefiq adding that Sreeni knows the sounds of the forest — of an approaching animal, a leopard or a tiger nearby.

Shefiq recalls an incident when he was saved from a tusker only because of a timely warning by Sreeni. “It was a misty morning and visibility was poor. Generally, when a tusker walks, its flapping ears brush against the leaves and there’s some sound. This time it was very quiet but Sreeni sensed the animal and asked me to step away. Had I not paid heed I would not be alive.”

Shefiq vouches that tigers in the forest know Sreeni well. “If it was another the tigers would attack but for him they stay calm and almost pose. That’s how I shoot them.”

Of his relationship with the tiger, the 38-year-old Sreeni says, “In a 15-day field trip I may see the tiger roughly four to five times but the tiger sees me daily; he knows me and knows that I am no threat to him.”",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/j9yvov/article31118570.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpTigerSrinijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/sreenivasan-k-and-his-tiger-monitoring-skills/article31118571.ece
456,2020/03/20,How a Mamallapuram lake is being revived by 23 locals,"How 23 locals are spearheading the restoration of the 11-acre Chozhipoigai at the UNESCO World Heritage Site

When Seethalakshmi, a cashier at the Indian Overseas Bank’s branch in Mamallapuram, was approached by a group of people to open an account last year, she was pleasantly surprised. The group represented the Mallai Water Bodies Protection and Preservation Association, who are working towards reviving the coastal town’s 11-acre fresh water body, Chozhipoigai. “When I went through their documents, I decided to do my bit for the project and donated ₹10,000. I have been drinking water from this land for decades and it was time I gave back. Having worked in Mamallapuram for the last 30 years, I have seen the lake deteriorate. This project is for the betterment of our future generations and it is important we support such causes,” says Seethalakshmi, who has seen positive changes since the restoration started. “It is much cleaner now. We can finally see water in the lake and it looks ‘healthier’.”

Seethalakshmi is among several others (mainly locals) who have come forward to contribute to the project’s initial ₹23 lakh fund. The initiative began when hotelier Krishnaraj T decided to work towards garnering local support for its restoration in late 2018. By early 2019, the Association (comprising 20 members and three office bearers) was formed, and V Kittu, the secretary, was instrumental in getting everyone on board. Krishnaraj tells me that until three decades ago, Chozhipoigai was serving close to 15,000 residents and 60 acres of farmland in the region. “A majority of agricultural practices in Mamallapuram stopped by the mid 90s. My father too belonged to the agricultural community and I have seen the lake shrink. For over 30 years, it wasn’t cleaned and water has not been drawn from it either. It had turned into a marsh — covered with bushes and cacti,” says the owner of Mamalla Beach Resort.

At Siruthuli, Coimbatore Over the last 10 years, founder Vanitha Mohan’s Coimbatore-based organisation has set up close to 750 rainwater harvesting systems across public places in the city. “We are working on setting up several more, especially in panchayat and corporation schools. Coimbatore has grown exponentially and rapid concretisation has reduced spaces for water to percolate into,” says Mohan, who is now gearing up to launch the Planting Partnerships project.

“We aim at tying up with local industries to set up a Miyawaki forest on their premises with rainwater harvesting and garbage disposal systems.” Plans are also afoot to look into greywater recycling. “We have been researching on low-cost solutions to treat sewage and use it for agricultural purposes,” says Mohan.

Timely intervention

The project also came at a time when Chennai was reeling under its worst water crisis in years. “During the monsoons, excess water drains into the Chozhipoigai,” says Krishnaraj. The committee received permission from the collector and then started the tough part: fundraising. “We approached several corporates, but none agreed to fund us. We collected ₹23 lakh — all from Mamallapuram residents — and work started in July 2019,” he says.

The first steps involved clearing the marsh. “We then hired machines and deepened the lake (by eight feet) by desilting it. Between July and November, we have strengthened the banks and planted over 200 local tree varieties: nagapalam (jamun), athimaram (cluster fig), puliyamaram (tamarind), neem trees, etc.”

The long-term vision for the restoration includes constructing inlets/outlets, a toe wall (to prevent the shoreline’s erosion), a paved walkway, bringing in fish and also smaller islands within the lake. “We want to create a natural ecosystem,” says Krishnaraj, adding “We are already seeing changes on ground with many birds returning to their habitat.”

A look at Environmentalist Foundation of India, Chennai Known for restoring water bodies in urban and peri-urban areas across the country, the voluntary organisation founded by Arun Krishnamurthy will kickstart their work in rural districts this month.

Over 20 water bodies have been identified in Tiruvallur, Kanchipuram and Chengalpet districts, and 21 others across Cuddalore, Tiruppur, Coimbatore, Tuticorin and Tirunelveli. “Work on the 45-acre Andipalayam lake in Chidambaram began this week and will be followed by the project at Thattankulam in Ayapakkam today. Work on Ambattur’s Selliamman Pond will begin next week,” says Krishnamurthy, who has completed 108 projects across 14 States.

His most recent restoration projects include Alli Kulam on ECR, Chennai, Karimadom Colony Pond in Thiruvananthapuram, Nehru Nagar Pond in Chennai, and Chinna Cheruvu in Vijayawada. To volunteer, visit indiaenvironment.org

Call for funds

To ensure the project is completed, the Association requires a funding of ₹2.70 crore. “The preliminary job is done and we now need government and public support to complete it and help make this another tourist attraction in Mamallapuram. During the initial funding round, people were unaware that it has potable water, and we were questioned as to why we need to put in money for a lake that is not being used for agriculture. But now people are looking at work on-ground and understanding why such projects are important. There are about eight to nine other water bodies in Mamallapuram and if we launch similar restoration plans for them, we will be water sufficient,” concludes Krishnaraj.

457,2020/03/20,"HMT Forest, a sanctuary for birds","Over decades, 100 acres of forest grew into a rich tangle of trees, shrubs and flowers. The city’s birders unite to protect this valuable space

The sighting of an unusual bird in the forests of HMT Estate recently sent a birding group in the city into a paroxysm of excitement. However, by the time they called for expert knowledge, the bird flew away.

“We spent the whole of the next week looking for it and finally saw it on Pipeline Road, off HMT Estate. It was the rare Egyptian vulture, which had been sighted 10 years ago,” says Mukundan K. HMT Estate is a favourite haunt of birdwatchers of the city.

Hindustan Machine Tools acquired 300 acres of land in Kalamassery in the 1950s. Over the decades, 100 acres remained untouched. Here on a mix of rich undergrowth, tall trees, grass and natural wetland vegetation grew organically, slowly becoming home to a variety of birds, butterflies and wild animals.

From the 1990s, there was a rush of development around this patch of green but fortunately it remained unscathed. This became an oasis not only for the animals and birds but also for birdwatchers.

On March 6, members of three groups — Green Grace, Cochin Natural History Society , Cochin Adventure Foundation — along with school and college students formed a human chain to protest against damage cause

d by anti-social elements to this natural forest in the heart of the city and its rare biodiversity.

Leading from the front was Vishupriyan Kartha, founder of the Cochin Natural History Society and a birder. “We started coming here from the 1990s. In the beginning, we were a small group and the sightings were few. But, as our numbers increased and the monitoring of birds became scientific, we spotted many more species. As of now, we have spotted 199 species.”

Vishupriyan points out that the forest grew on its own over a period of 50-60 years and “is being damaged by vagabonds who use it as thoroughfare. Often they burn parts of it and drive away its natural wild habitat. Parcels of land are also being sold off.”

The birders know the forest well and have named areas based on their sightings. Thus there is Bird Bath Point, with terracotta tubs for the birds; Baza Point, where a Black Baza was spotted; the Night Jar Tree where the nocturnal bird is often seen; Robins Point and the Paradise Flycatcher’s Point by the pond. “These are names to identify the areas in the forest for birders to know each others’ whereabouts and to look for specific birds,” says Kartha.

Sujith MG, a birder and member of Green Grace (a group of film and videomakers), directed Urban Canopy, a documentary on the HMT Forest last November. “We make such documentaries for students and ask why this urban canopy is important. It is required for pure air, water, as well as for calm and quiet,” says Sujith adding that the tropical forest has a wildlife of insects, snakes, mongoose and wild rabbits. It is home also to Kerala’s State butterfly Buddha Mayuri.

Kartha plans to petition the government on two grounds — of forest restoration. India is a signatory to the Bonn Challenge, which is about revamping forests and of conserving biodiversity sites, under the Government’s directive of empowering local self governments to declare local biodiversity sites as protected heritage sites. “It is in their jurisdiction and the ownership of the land does not change,” says Kartha explaining that no systematic enumeration of trees and plants has been done and the richness of the forest remains unexplored.

Bala Murukesan , GM, HMT, says, “This is the only green area of such proportion in Ernakulam, we are all for conserving and protecting it and have taken steps towards it. The police has been informed about miscreants damaging the forest,and of any such activities that come to our notice.”

“We know the forest intimately. There’s a human story to it and that’s why we see no justification in destroying a naturally come up forest,” says Kartha. And off the birders go in search again for the elusive Egyptian Vulture.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/jsbc4w/article31118463.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpCrestedHawkEagleJuvenilejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/hmt-forest-estate-in-kochi-is-a-sanctuary-for-birds/article31118471.ece

459,2020/03/20,Coronavirus | Do anti-hypertensive drugs raise the risk for COVID-19 patients?,"Patients have been told not to discontinue their medication

One of the concerns highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic is whether the use of several common hypertension treatment drugs — coming under the class of Angiotensin-Controlling Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) — raises risks for patients who contract the novel coronavirus.

The issue gained importance in social media and elsewhere, as some reports from severely affected countries such as Italy indicated a poor outcome for COVID-19 patients who have been taking these drugs for an underlying condition.

The top United States immunologist handling the pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interaction with the Journal of the American Medical Association on Wednesday that based on extrapolation of available knowledge, putting a patient on an ACE inhibitor could result in an increase in the expression of the enzyme, which is to say, the person taking the drug for hypertension may be, without knowing it, increasing the reception for the virus itself.

Entry point

That is because Angiotensin Converting Enzyme2 (ACE2) receptors have been shown to be the entry point into human cells for SARS-CoV-2, according to medical literature.

But, Dr. Fauci said, that was an extrapolation, and not based on data.

“It is a possibility that we need to address,” he said, calling for studies in the wake of media reports from Italy that said 99% of people who died had an underlying condition, and in 75% of these cases, that condition was hypertension.

Given the high medical care standards in Italy, he reasoned, if hypertension was an underlying condition, it was bound to have been treated and patients maintained well. Also, if the data appeared skewed towards the condition in spite of this, the cause would have to be investigated, he said.

On the same issue, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), citing initial data from China, issued a position statement on March 13. It said a concern had arisen because it was observed that just as in the case of the coronavirus causing SARS [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome], “the COVID-19 virus binds to a specific enzyme called ACE2 to infect cells, and ACE2 levels are increased following treatment with ACE-i and ARBs.”

The Council of Hypertension of the ESC, however, said it “strongly recommended” that doctors and patients should continue with their usual anti-hypertensive therapy in the absence of “clinical or scientific evidence to suggest that treatment with ACE-i or ARBs should be discontinued because of the COVID-19 infection.”

The issue has snowballed, as medical societies expressed alarm that some patients were voluntarily stopping ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which are commonly prescribed for many cardiovascular diseases and to protect against damage to the kidneys, including among diabetics.

Call for research

The American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and Heart Failure Society of America issued a joint advisory on March 17, urging that patients who were currently taking these drugs should continue to take them.

“These theoretical concerns and findings of cardiovascular involvement with COVID-19 deserve much more detailed research, and quickly,” the statement said.

“Currently there are no experimental or clinical data demonstrating beneficial or adverse outcomes with background use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or other RAAS antagonists [which influence hypertension] among COVID-19 patients with a history of cardiovascular disease treated with such agents,” it added.
