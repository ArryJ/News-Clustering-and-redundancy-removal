1,['1/03/2020'],When power lunches get gourmet,"Military hotels are bit of an urban legend among the food lovers of Bengaluru. They are described as places that are spartan, functional and great for eating non-vegetarian food; mutton in particular. The most famous of which is the Shivaji Military Hotel. The most famous dish is the donne biryani, so called because of the areca nut palm leaf in which it is served. This is similar to the Dindigul biryani of Tamil Nadu , and is made with the same short-grained seeraga samba rice.The reason why I call it an ‘urban legend’ is that they are not easy for an itinerant traveller to reach. Most are located in places such as Jayanagar, Malleswaram and Cottonpet, the more traditional areas of the city which are not that ‘buzzy’ today, especially with the city expanding its borders. I had been meaning to try out one for a while, but the logistics never worked out. They were either too far or shut by the time I would finish work.Some open in the morning and people queue up as early as 8 am to get their fill of biryani and other meaty treats! These are Hindu-run places and hence mutton is the meat of choice. Beef and pork are not served. Seafood has made its presence felt and so has chicken; not that the owners are too happy about the latter. I finally made it to a military hotel when I recently went to the Ranganna Military Hotel, which was established in 1964. The owner is a gentleman named Ranganna, and he still supervises the grinding of the spice mixes every day. His wife supervises the cooking. Ranganna’s son, Sunil, helps run the business.I must say that the experience at Ranganna did not turn out to be what I had expected my first military hotel visit to have been like. Ranganna is large, neat and clean. Nothing like the grimy ambiance that I had prepared myself for. Nor was the clientele male dominated. I had read that military hotels had initially sprung up to feed men from the interiors of Karnataka, who had come to work in the city. Other theories say they were established to feed the Maratha soldiers, or those from the British colonial army. Hence the name ‘military’. The crowd at Ranganna on a Sunday evening (when the traffic was less) consisted of both genders, panned across age groups and social classes. Bengaluru local, Somanna Muthanna, of the Soul Company, recommended Ranganna to me, saying its more welcoming of outsiders, apart from the fact that the locals swear by its food. A sentiment echoed by Divya Prabhakar, who runs the Bengaluru Oota Company along with Vishal Shetty. Divya belongs to the local Gowda community as do the owners of Ranganna. Over a lovely meal featuring Gowda and Mangalorean dishes that I had at their restaurant the next day, Divya said that she often goes to Ranganna to eat.I went to Ranganna with two fellow Bengalis, Diganta Chakraborty and Arghya Sanyal, and we were mesmerised by the excellent quality of mutton served and the home cooking-like feel that the food had. Our order that evening was a nose to tail mutton affair that included tender mutton chops, liver and brain fry, roughly minced mutton gojju (a thick curry), mutton biryani (no donne leaf here) and an egg curry from the poultry side. Despite being a no-frills place, the subtlety in the spicing of each and the distinct flavours that they offered explained why this 56- year-old restaurant remains so popular.It reminded me of places such as the Swadhin Bharat Hotel and the pice hotels of Kolkata and Kshirsagar, Sindhudurg Hotel, Chaitanya and the many Malvani restaurants of Mumbai. These restaurants too had come up originally to feed their home cuisines to migrant workers in these cities. Are there more such examples across India?

2,['1/03/2020'],"Mirror, mirror…","For most of us, the bylanes of Janpath in Delhi (or any other street shop in your city) were the first places where one came in contact with mirror work. The sellers, ostensibly from Gujarat, displayed their wares on the road. It was our first introduction to sheesha embroidery and for most it stays that – a roadside buy, a cheap deal, a steal. But from the streets to high fashion, mirror work seems to be changing its image.Leading the pack is, of course, designer duo Abu Jani & Sandeep Khosla who have extensively used mirror work with contemporary colours and cuts in their repertoire. Khosla says that the duo is passionate about Indian crafts legacy and their aim is not just to incorporate it into their design expression but to reinvent a technique to a brand new standard of excellence and beauty. Jani adds, “All of us in India have grown up seeing mirror work whether it is in cholis or torans or textiles. The use of mirror in architecture was also a huge influence and inspiration for us.”For Jani-Khosla, the rooms at City Palace, Jaipur and the spectacular dome at Amber fort were the inspiration behind using this reflective art in their work. Embroideries from Rajasthan and Gujarat are seen on designer Ashish’s spring-summer 2020 on denim, dresses and cotton jersey tracksuits. Designer Arpita Mehta who has been using the craft for some time now says, “My favourite part about mirror work is that it has a natural sheen and there is something extremely traditional about it but at the same time it’s also bohemian. I personally have always loved a bohemian touch to an Indian outfit. I feel that this is something that sets it apart from the many traditional crafts we have in India.”Her own twist to it is to use it with cut work and go for pastel colours. She uses resham threads, tiny kadana beads as well as kasab which automatically makes the embroidery look extremely rich. “The craft can be used in multiple ways, like in bags, shoes, jackets, lehengas, or shararas,” she adds. Agrees designer Ridhima Bhasin who says that mirror work is way more versatile than it gets credit for. A fundamental part of her designs, she uses it in monochromatic ensembles in subtle hues to underplay the effect. She uses smaller pieces for the mirror work to make it more wearable. The key lies in keeping the mirror work minimal yet impactful.According to designers what harms its image is the availability of cheap options that use plastic instead of real mirrors, cheap threads and machine embroidery. Mehta says, “One should never go for the cheaper work, as once you do get into that kind of mirror work it becomes less classy.” Even weaving a small piece of mirror onto a fabric requires a specific type of stitch and co-ordination. Bhasin adds that the pattern and stitch changes according to the shape of the mirror and how it blends into the over-all design.It is not for the faint-hearted as its impact is audacious. But people are now open to experimenting. To wear it for a day look, opt for pastel kurtas or go for a dupatta. Bhasin suggests wearing your basic tee and jeans combination with mirror work earring studs, or mirror work juttis. Handbags and belts are the simplest way to work it in.l Sheesha or mirror embroidery is traced back to 17th century in Iran and was brought to India by travellers during the Mughal eral Mirrors are affixed with cross-stitch embroidery that provides it a casingl Most common mirror shape is circular, but other geometric shapes are used tool Mirror work was patronised by the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Haryana. Different communities have differentstyles. Like jats of Banni use mirrors of varying sizes and shapes; while garari jats use tiny mirrors on the yokeSource: utsavpedia.com",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74398175,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1548512/74398175.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/buzz/mirror-mirror/articleshow/74398196.cms
3,['1/03/2020'],This will be a 100% saami padam: RJ Balaji,"Following his success as a writer with LKG, RJ Balaji is now giving finishing touches to his directorial debut Mookuthi Amman , which stars Nayanthara in the lead. While there are reports that this film, co-directed by NJ Saravanan, will be a satire on devotional films, just like how LKG was a political satire, the actor-director denies it.“This will be a 100% saami padam,” begins Balaji, and adds, “It’s not a satire on the genre. It will have all the elements that were there in the devotional films that we grew up watching. It will be a nostalgic trip, but there will also be a takeaway that is relevant, especially in this present times.”Nayanthara, he says, plays the Goddess, and will appear for most parts of the film. “It is definitely not an extended cameo,” he assures. Talking about why he picked her for this role, he reveals, “I wanted someone with a larger-than-life presence to play the role of the goddess. I did not write this role particularly for Nayanthara, though I wanted someone of her stature... an actress with that majestic screen presence. I’m very hesitant when it comes to narrating scripts. I do not want it to become a dharmasankatam for me or the person saying no, so I narrate mainly to people who I am close to and those who I think are likely to say yes.”He calls Nayanthara “a good friend” and reveals that it was the actress herself who finally gave him the courage to narrate the story to her. “One day, she randomly called me asking why I haven’t narrated any script for her while I have been discussing my scripts with many others. This was around 5pm. So, by 7pm, I met her for the narration and she gave her OK to this project by 7.30pm, saying she liked her role very much,” he elaborates.The male lead’s role will be played by Balaji himself while Urvashi, Mouli, Smruthi Venkat (of Thadam fame) and Visaaranai actor Ajay Ghosh play crucial roles. “There are also several cameos by popular actors. I don’t want to reveal them all now, though a few of the actors have let the secret out,” he wryly remarks.Girishh Gopalakrishnan of Aval fame is composing the music for this film which has cinematography by Dinesh Krishnan, who has shot films like Soodhu Kavvum and Thaanaa Serndha Koottam. Pariyerum Perumal’s editor RK Selva, stunt choreographer Stunt Silva and lyricist Pa Vijay are also part of the crew. “Natpukkaga Vignesh Shivan has written a song,” adds Balaji.On the title, he says that it was quite a random choice. “I had gone to Nagercoil, and I liked the place, where you stumble into a religious place everywhere you go. I had visited Mookuthi Amman temple there, and I felt I could have that as the backdrop. I then did some research on the temple and the town itself and it fit what was in my script. Plus, when we discussed this with the other titles that I had shortlisted, Mookuthi Amman turned out to be everyone’s favourite,” he says.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74416145,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1616812/74416145.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/this-will-be-a-100-saami-padam-rj-balaji/articleshow/74416145.cms

5,['1/03/2020'],"After 35 years, Bharathirajaa’s Muthal Mariyathai actor returns to Kollywood","Deepan, the actor who played a young goatherd in love in Bharathirajaa ’s Muthal Mariyathai , will now be seen playing one of the lead characters in C/O Kadhal, the Tamil remake of the acclaimed Telugu film C/O Kancharapalem.“I spotted Deepan at the Chennai airport and felt his look suited the character perfectly. I did not know then that he was once an actor. I approached him and asked if he would act in my film, and he told me that he wasn’t interested. But we exchanged numbers, and I pursued him for a month before getting him on board,” recounts Hemambar Jasthi, who is making his directorial debut with this film.Hemambar says that he has changed Deepan’s look a lot for this film. “He was a little stout and I asked him to lose some weight. We also changed his hair style and moustache,” he informs. The director reveals that he conducted a workshop for Deepan for three months to help the actor get familiarised with the character. “All these years, he was running educational institutions, and wasn’t following cinema. So, I had to explain everything to him and get him up to date in terms of technique. He was quite cooperative. In fact, on location, I made him do precisely what we had done in the workshop,” he says.Deepan’s romantic interest is played by Sonia Giri, a politician from Kerala. “I came across her profile on Facebook. She’s a former corporator and a district president of a political party. She, too, was reluctant and asked me to seek someone in the Malayalam film industry. I went to her place, Irinjalakuda, near Thrissur, told her that the character is that of a Malayalee and she looks exactly as how I imagined this character to be, and ultimately convinced her,” he says.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74416163,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1096803/74416163.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/after-35-years-bharathirajaas-muthal-mariyathai-actor-returns-to-kollywood/articleshow/74416163.cms
6,['1/03/2020'],Don’t feed sickness,"When an animal, such as a dog or cat, is sick or unwell, its first natural instinct is to refuse food. Their body automatically cuts down appetite till they recover. They may drink water, but nothing else. This is body’s intelligence taking over to heal and recover.Humans aren’t any different. At least, intuitively. All of us are products of nature and we have been designed the same. When we call in sick, the first thing that happens is that our appetites shut down too. Our taste of mouth changes and our sensitivity to smell and taste is numbed. This is our body’s intelligence and subtle biofeedback trying to tell us that it’s time we give our body some rest.This is fasting in a way and has been practised since the longest time – across all religions. Fasting is inbuilt in us and is considered medicinal if you actually go back and read its history. It is our body’s uncomplicated way of cleaning and healing. Unfortunately, we have moved too far from nature and our natural instincts. We are constantly eating and munching even when sick, thereby compromising our own immunity and masking the inbuilt mechanism to heal.When we take a break from eating, we put our digestive system to rest first. Our digestive system utilises 80% of our body’s energy, leaving only 20% for repair, recycling, eliminating. Now when we slow down our eating, we redirect that huge chunk of energy to healing, repair, immunity boost, which our digestive system would consume otherwise. That’s our immunity working for us. The healing or prevention of a disease revolves around immunity. The stronger the immunity, the faster the recovery process; and fasting helps activate our immunity. Major events that happen when we fast, especially, a dry fasting (abstaining from food and water for certain time):- Stem cell activation and regeneration begins.- Body gets rid of its own toxins.- Body tries to sacrifice its sickest cells through the process of autophagy – a natural process and also one that occurs in cases of fasting. Autophagy also helps prevent/manage cancer and plays a vital role in degrading cells infected by bacteria and viruses.- It’s good to go through symptoms of lack of appetite or aversion to foods when sick because it indicates our body doing the right things at the right time. Unfortunately, we have become so addicted to comfort and constant eating, that it has become a tough job to actually gauge our true physical hunger.Through our practise, we see so many cases where people have fasted their way through sickness – from a common cold, fever to obesity, joint pains, hair fall, skin problems, inflammation, bloating, digestive issues. These people eat only when their bodies ask for nutrition. Of course, in certain cases, fasting has to be monitored by a health expert.by Luke CoutinhoHolistic Lifestyle Coach-Integrative Medicine",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74381721,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-79587/74381721.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/diet/dont-feed-sickness/articleshow/74381735.cms
7,['1/03/2020'],It’s destination UP now for Kannada filmmakers,"The Kannada film industry seems to have found a new go-to spot as far as shooting locations go. And, no, they are not going globe-trotting. A growing tribe of filmmakers are exploring Uttar Pradesh now. After Roberrt, Banaras, Daali and Madagaja have also set part of their narratives in the state. The ease of securing subsidies and permissions and the prospect of fresh locations are reasons cited by them for heading to north India. Tharun Sudhir , whose Darshan-starrer Roberrt has had a significant part of the film set in Lucknow, explains, “The Uttar Pradesh government promotes film shoots and procuring permissions is easy. They do not have a local film industry, so the people there are always opening up their homes for us. What has helped is that in the past two years, quite a few Bollywood films have had UP backdrops, which has set precedence for us.”Yogesh, who is backing Daali, agrees and adds “Permissions to shoot in Uttar Pradesh can be procured provided one plans the schedules well. A good line producer or agent who has understood the system is what one needs, as getting permission to shoot at heritage sites can be time consuming.”Director Jayathirtha , who shot his film Banaras there, says, “The locations have a lot of heritage and history, which is very inspiring.” Filmmaker Prabhu Srinivas , who shot Daali in Lucknow. “The audience has also got tired of seeing the same old locations in India. Cities like Lucknow and Varanasi offer a change for us and the audience,” he says.Filmmakers who shoot and promote places in Uttar Pradesh get a subsidy of 25%, if over 50% of the film is set there, provided it is approved by the Uttar Pradesh Film Bandhu. Earlier, Kannada filmmakers headed Mumbai for films with a North India connect, as it made logistical sense, considering that it is home to a film industry and has studios.

8,['1/03/2020'],"Poops, I did it again!","The crate should be of right size to accommodate your pet comfortably. Your pet should be able sit, stand and move freely. If the crate size is too big then there is a possibility that the pet would use just one corner to relieve her or himself and sleep at the other.Generally, your pup would let you know s/he has an urge to relieve her/himself by whining, or scratching the floor. It’s important to take your pet out as soon as he calls, else it may lead to mishaps, and eventually, your pup would feel this behaviour is acceptable.Dogs, are by nature, clean animals. They like to keep their living space clean and never soil the place they sleep in.Choose a fixed spot in the house that’s acceptable for the puppy to use; put a paper or puppy pad. This might be useful when the pup is too young and has to pee or poop too often. Or, when you have a busy schedule and can’t take the puppy out often. Important thing to note is to remove the soiled paper/potty pad and clean the area thoroughly so that the pup doesn’t feel it’s his only permanent spot to relieve. You can gradually train your pup to move out of the house as he grows up.Once you establish your pet’s potty schedule, just make a note to take him out for quick walks. Let your pet out as soon as the pup whines and lets you know. Do not wait too long else your pet might be in trouble. Some ground rules to follow while potty training your pup:It requires a lot of patience and time from us to get the pet habitual to all daily routines and get the desired behaviour. The most important aspect is to get your puppy on the right schedule. This could be:l First thing in the morningl After every meal/drinking waterl After naps or play timel Before sleep at nightReward your pet by praising him or give him a treat whenever s/he has done the right thing. This would motivate him and reinforce right behaviour. Never scold your pup if there are any accidents. Keep your calm and clean the spot thoroughly to remove all stains. There are several enzymatic cleaners and sprays available that eliminate the stains and odour. This would prevent your pet from using the same spot next time around.The tummy of the pups (4-6 weeks old) is still immature and cannot handle too much food. It is important to not feed them too much. Also, increase his feeding schedule by 3-5 times a day. Choose a high quality and easily-digestible diet for your pet – one that would be easy on his tummy.— Dr Arun, VeterinarianAre you a proud pet parent? Have a cute cat story to share?

Our order that evening was a nose to tail mutton affair that included tender mutton chops, liver and brain fry, roughly minced mutton gojju (a thick curry), mutton biryani (no donne leaf here) and an egg curry from the poultry side. Despite being a no-frills place, the subtlety in the spicing of each and the distinct flavours that they offered explained why this 56- year-old restaurant remains so popular.It reminded me of places such as the Swadhin Bharat Hotel and the pice hotels of Kolkata and Kshirsagar, Sindhudurg Hotel, Chaitanya and the many Malvani restaurants of Mumbai. These restaurants too had come up originally to feed their home cuisines to migrant workers in these cities. Are there more such examples across India?

12,['1/03/2020'],Romance of the jharokha,"There’s something romantic about jharokhas. For the uninitiated, it’s the overhanging windows with an enclosed balcony that hails from Rajasthan. The beautifully carved structures are used to deck up windows in the royal palaces – a reason why they evoke images of Rajput women looking out from its carefully constructed structure. Royal, elegant, sophisticated, the appeal of jharokha is its timeless elegance. There’s history, style and aesthetics that can perk up your space.Now, the jharokhas are moving beyond the windows. For instance, small ones are being used as a photo frame, while some are being used in temples or to hold mirrors. Art historian and architectural restorer Sunita Kohli says that there’s an increased fascination for jharokhas from those interested in Indian culture.Kohli adds, “Jharokhas were always viewed favourably and now there’s a growing confidence for not rejecting our own culture. This is the one element that can add depth to your living space.” While designing a five-star property in Bhubaneshwar, she used different types of jharokhas in the dining area.This season, window design is changing how our homes look. In contemporary architecture, windows are featured prominently. Modern homes make extensive use of large and unique window designs to let in plenty of natural light. And a jharokha fits right in with its strong traditional aesthetic.The jharokha is more formal and ornamental than English or French “oriel” and is one of the most distinctive element in medieval Indian architecture until the 19th century. Interior designer Anuradha Aggarwal says, “The jharokhas have seen a transformation in the last few years. The interpretation of a jharokha is beyond décor. Decorating windows has a positive psychology, as they are the eyes of your home, bring in energy and how you view the outside world. Interesting jharokhas pep up the room.” She also adds that now jharokhas are used as decorative pieces and come in different shapes and sizes. Tip: If you have a bright painted wall, then use a wooden jharokha to give a charming look. It’s a trend worth looking out for.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74414907,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-713837/74414907.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/home-garden/romance-of-the-jharokha/articleshow/74414907.cms

14,['1/03/2020'],Manage your 40s,"While you harp on metabolism all your life, there is also catabolism that we need to worry about (especially women once they touch 40s). As we age, the lean muscle and bone density in the body starts decreasing – this process is called catabolism. Because of the decreased muscle mass, metabolism goes down too. In your 40s, you cannot get away with eating and working out the same way as you did in your 20s and 30s. The main goal in this decade is to reverse the catabolic process and make it anabolic, wherein you start building bone density and muscle mass instead of losing it.How? Eat right. The biggest misconception people have is that they need to starve or give up sugar to look good in their 40s. Quality is the keyword here. Instead of a commercial chocolate bar, look for high quality sweets like homemade halva, laddoos or kheer. They’re made with whole grains and contain nourishers like ghee and dry fruits that make them a much healthier option than anything store-bought. Don’t be fearful of food, at the same time, exercise portion control and don’t go overboard. Eat till satisfied, but avoid bingeing.- Crash diet plans: While they may make you look slimmer in the short term, they will make you lose muscle mass and bone density, which just increases the problem. - Packaged snacks: They come with hidden sugars, salt and chemical compounds that your body finds difficult to break down. Instead of buying a jar of ghee or a pack of milk from the store, look for a sustainable farm that gives you high-quality products.- Breakfast cereals: We have a culture of eating hot breakfast, which is very satisfying. When we eat Western breakfast of cold cereal and milk, we don’t get satisfaction, because of which we end up looking for a cigarette, coffee, or a muffin when we reach work.- Overeating: I always advise people to eat five spoons less than what they would have. Eat till you are satisfied, not stuffed and full.- Exercise: A combination of strength training and yoga is good as it will help to increase lean muscle mass and also accelerate fat loss.- Stop dividing food into groups like fat, protein, carbs. Eat wholesome, home-cooked meals instead.- To reverse the process of catabolism, you need calcium as it is important for bone density, along with iron, protein and vitamin D.- Ghee, seasonal greens, whole grains like millets and single polished rice, sesame seeds, fresh vegetables and farm fresh dairy are all important.— Munmun Ganeriwal, nutritionist and lifestyle consultant",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74413507,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-122747/74413507.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/diet/manage-your-40s/articleshow/74413497.cms

17,['1/03/2020'],Elsa‘ing’is the new ‘ghosting,"Dating is hard. One only has to ask the singles. And now that online dating has made it as simple as a swipe, it’s getting more twisted; a reason why modern-day love lexicographers are working overtime to update the dating dictionary. The terms are spinning out so fast that ‘ghosting’ that came two years ago, feels almost ancient. It turned to ‘dial-toning’ last year, and for 2020, ‘Elsa’ing’ is the new ‘ghosting’.Here’s how it goes. So, last year, you were ‘slow fading’, but this year you are probably ‘flatlining’. In 2018, people were ‘orbiting’ – cutting you out but looking at your social media updates, and now they are ‘causeplaying’ – basically, when a casual relationship fizzles out, but the other person keeps popping back into your life to ask for favours. Even as the edits proclaim these as the “cool” new terms, Mumbai-based dating coach Pratik Jain believes otherwise. After all, all the terms describe what is purportedly bad dating behaviour. “To call ‘ghosting’ cool would be wrong. It is common and we have a term for it. But when it happens to someone, it is not cool,” he days.Jain, who has been coaching people to land dates, calls it the new lingo to define certain behaviours. His analysis is simple: the dating world starts young these days – say with 17-18 year olds, where the youngsters are consuming a lot of the pop culture through OTT platforms. “Dating is what defines their culture and these new terms help put a name to what is going on in their lives,” he notes. Matchmaking app Happn revealed a new dating vocabulary for 2020. In a report Didier Rappaport, CEO and founder of Happn, said: “If you’ve encountered dating disappointments or disasters, the way you describe the experience can sometimes help to make light of the situation. Cultural references and puns feature heavily in the terms we predict will break through in 2020 to describe some of the dramas of finding love.” Dating coach Kshitij Sehrawat likes to take his subjects to live locations for dating demos and coaching. He says that trying out for dates in the real world, in real time, with realtalk, gives you more benefits and dividends than swiping online. “The gratification is instant, the markers real and you get a chance to know where you stand,” he adds. Sehrawat’s favourite dating term is his own creation: ‘flirt and roast ratio’ – a ploy to build interest and sexual tension. “It’s a mix of playful (not hurtful) banter that gets the person hooked to your word,” he explains.Australian dating and relationships expert Debbie Rivers had said in an article on new terminology: “New words come about when something becomes so common that we need a way to describe it. However, the problem is these new terms are normalising poor dating behaviour.” So much so, ‘ghosting’ has become a defining millennial act. Making up dating terms started as a way to help us define the confusing, maddening experiences we had while online dating. But in her Mashable article writer AnnaIovine tch-tches the trend and feels it has gone too far. Sehrawat would blame the online dating culture for bolstering these bad behaviours and fostering new ones. He explains why. “On a dating app, you are competing with so many people and are at the mercy of other people. It’s not as fulfilling as taking control, going up to a girl and getting that number.” Online dating makes it easier for people to ‘ghost’ or ‘dialtone’ someone.Editor and single guy Hari Govind Nair calls these dating terminologies “the millennial lingo” but welcomes it. “Earlier, when you were meeting someone, you were probably dating within a circle. Now, you meet absolute strangers. When someone shows a certain trait, and you put a name to that behaviour, it helps you understand them better. That really helps if you are looking for something serious,” he adds. It may have something to do with our natural human tendency to assign names to things. In an article in brit.co, lexicographer Jane Solomon says that cutesy modern dating vocabulary has evolved for a very specific reason: “Dating can be harsh, but these terms give us a relatively lighthearted way to discuss very real disappointment and trauma.”Desi dating terms to look out forFrom Karan Johar, the eternal Bollywood love guru. Basically, an enthusiastic Indian uncle who’s always matchmaking because he loves ‘love’The colony boyfriend who is the stand-in date till an NRI rishta comes alongA clueless friend who gets thrown under the bus because his friend messed upThe forever coming-of-age boy who has Sufi tendencies and a hippie soulThe moment a relationship sours you get dragged in a very public washing of dirty linenTwo people are having a rip-roaring affair but their families are cluelessWhen you get together with someone new and the match surprises people.When someone seems nice when they first approach you but once they have been rejected, even if politely, they turn nasty.Thanks to Ross Geller of Friends and his infamous ‘we are on a break’ episode. This basically refers to the confusion that ensues when you have defined the relationship (DTR).A date with this kind of a person would feel like an ‘interrogation’. These people ask you personal questions on first date.The new ghosting. When someone suddenly freezes you out without explanation. It comes from Elsa’s character in Frozen.When you lure people in with cute snaps of you and your pet, and they’re really only hanging out to spend time with your dog.When you are neglecting the person you are seeing and don’t give them the attention for the relationship to grow.Remember Clippy, the irritating assistant that popped up on Microsoft Word? He’s back as the commitment-phobe guy with a smart phone. Basically, the one who pops up when you least expect him to remind that he exists, despite not wanting to date you.An advanced state of dating limbo, where you hang out all the time, almost live at each other’s places, meet each other’s friends and family. You are very couple-y! But you haven’t ever defined the relationship.This happens when your date is only interested in talking about him/herself.When someone chooses who to date based solely on personality types.When you immediately adopt all of your significant others’ hobbies and interests.Similar to ghosting but involves ignoring the other person before the relationship ever even begins.Getting all dolled up, only to be cancelled at the last minute.When a casual relationship fizzles out, but the other person keeps popping back into your life to ask for favours.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74388334,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-136190/74388334.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/relationships/elsaingis-the-new-ghosting/articleshow/74388198.cms

PAARL (South Africa): A maiden international century by Heinrich Klaasen set up a 74-run win for South Africa in the first one-day international against Australia at Boland Park on Saturday.Klaasen hit 123 not out in a South African total of 291 for seven. Australia were on target midway through their reply but lost their last seven wickets for 43 runs to be bowled out for 217.Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne put on 84 for Australia's third wicket after the early loss of opening batsman Aaron Finch and David Warner, both dismissed by Lungi Ngidi, who finished with three for 30.Smith (76) and Labuschagne (41) hit only three boundaries between them as scoring proved difficult on a slow pitch and a big outfield.When they tried to accelerate Labuschagne was caught at long-on off left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj.Mitchell Marsh helped Smith add 41 for the fourth wicket but Marsh was bowled by Ngidi and three balls later Smith was trapped leg before wicket by Anrich Nortje.It was always going to be difficult for new batsmen to get established and the innings subsided.By contrast Klaasen and David Miller (64) put on 149 for South Africa's fifth wicket and were not parted until Miller was out in the 49th over.""That was the difference between the teams,"" said Australian captain Finch. ""Klaasen and Miller batted really well. When you have a couple of batters going deep - they scored something like 81 runs in the last ten overs."" It was actually 82 but it proved crucial.Klaasen said he felt ""pure emotion"" when he reached his century after a difficult recent period when he lost his place in the team and had to fight his way back. He gave credit to Miller and new cap Kyle Verreynne, who made 48 and helped Klaasen add 78 for the fourth wicket after South Africa had been 48 for three after winning the toss.Verreynne, 22, made an impressive debut which included three catches in the outfield by a player who keeps wicket in domestic cricket . Two of Verreynne's catches were spectacular, one to dismiss Warner when he dived forward from point and late in the innings when he ran in from long-on and dived to take a steepling catch from Pat Cummins.South African captain Quinton de Kock was phlegmatic after a topsy-turvy few weeks when South Africa have had good wins interspersed by heavy defeats.

LONDON: The top civil servant in the UK Home Office at the centre of a row over a strained relationship with Indian-origin Home Secretary Priti Patel resigned from his post on Saturday and said he plans to sue the government over his ""constructive and unfair"" exit.

Philip Rutnam, Permanent Secretary in the department led by 47-year-old Patel, said there had been a “vicious and orchestrated campaign” against him over the last 10 days and pointed the finger of blame at the minister .

“The Home Secretary (Patel) categorically denied any involvement in this campaign to the Cabinet Office. I regret I do not believe her,” he said in a statement.

“Even despite this campaign, I was willing to effect a reconciliation with the Home Secretary, as requested by the Cabinet Secretary on behalf of the Prime Minister. But despite my efforts to engage with her, Priti Patel has made no effort to engage with me to discuss this,” the statement said.

Rutnam said his experience formed part of a wider pattern in government and that he plans to take legal action on the grounds of constructive dismissal.

“I believe that these events give me very strong grounds to claim constructive, unfair dismissal, and I will be pursuing that claim in the courts. My experience has been extreme, but I consider there is evidence that it was part of a wider pattern of behaviour,” his statement adds.

The resignation comes just days after he and Patel had issued a joint statement in an effort to quell media reports of discord within the Home Office.

“The Home Secretary and Permanent Secretary are deeply concerned about the number of false allegations appearing in the media,” a UK Home Office spokesperson said on Monday, when the government took the rare step to issue a formal statement to quash rumours circulating around the frosty relationship between the minister and her top civil servant.

Patel has been at the centre of a controversy over an alleged bullying atmosphere within her department, an allegation that has been denied and also led to Downing Street confirming that the minister has the “full confidence” of Prime Minister Boris Johnson .

These allegations will be revived again as Rutnam makes reference to it in his detailed resignation statement published in a blog for ‘ The Spectator ' magazine.

He said: “One of my duties as Permanent Secretary was to protect the health, safety and well-being of our 35,000 people. This created tension with the Home Secretary, and I have encouraged her to change her behaviours.

“I have received allegations that her conduct has included shouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands, behaviour that created fear and needed some bravery to call out.”

The bureaucrat with a 33-year career in the UK civil service said he expects his resignation could have very serious personal implications but he had chosen to turn down an offered financial settlement from the Cabinet Office to take a stand.

The UK Home Office is yet to comment on the news of Rutnam's resignation.

BERLIN: American cycling star Chloe Dygert won the women's pursuit title at the track world championships in a new world record time on Saturday.

The 23-year-old cross-discipline champion trimmed more than three seconds off the old 3km time set in 2018, winning the world title in 3min 16.937sec.

The American pulverised German rival Lisa Brennauer, who came in over six seconds adrift.

The women's 3km pursuit is not on the Olympic roster but Dygert aims to race the team pursuit in Tokyo as well as the road race individual time-trial.

Dygert, 23, who is coached by three-time Olympic gold medallist Kristin Armstrong, stunned the road race circuit by beating Dutch duo Anna van der Breggen and Annemiek van Vleuten to take gold in the world time-trial in Yorkshire last September.

Earlier Saturday Germany's Lea Sophie Friedrich was given a standing ovation on her victory lap at the Berlin Velodrome after she won the women's 500m time trial.

It was the 20-year-old's second gold of the championships after she also helped Germany win the women's team event on the opening day.

""I tried so, so hard and in the end it was a very fast time,"" said Friedrich.

The Netherlands won a fifth gold of the championships in the women's 30km relay event, the Madison, a race which featured a spectacular crash where Poland's Daria Pikulik was accidentally run over by a Chinese racer after a fall.

Dutch pair veteran Kirsten Wild and Amy Pieters clinched the marathon event, named after the Madison Square Garden venue in New York, where the convoluted touch-and-go tag-relay, further complicated by points being allocated every ten laps, debuted.

Frenchman Benjamin Thomas emerged as the winner of the men's multi-discipline Omnium event beating Dutch star Jan Willem van Schip and Britain's Matthew Walls.

LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his girlfriend Carrie Symonds are expecting their first child together and are engaged to be married, the couple announced on Saturday.

""The prime minister and Miss Symonds are very pleased to announce their engagement and that they are expecting a baby in the early summer,"" the couple said in a statement.

The 55-year-old Johnson took office in July and led his Conservative Party to a decisive election victory in December.

The announcement means he will become the first British prime minister to marry in office for 250 years.

The Sun newspaper quoted a Downing Street source as saying "" Boris and Carrie are both delighted at this news. They have both known for a while but have kept it under wraps until the pregnancy progressed.""

""It partly explains why he has been lying low recently - although he works flat out and that won’t change. Carrie is thrilled and she will also continue to work on her environmental projects,"" the paper quoted the source as saying.

Johnson was previously married to Marina Wheeler.

""I wouldn't normally post this kind of thing on here but I wanted my friends to find out from me,"" Symonds, 31, said on Instagram , according to British media.

""Many of you already know but for my friends that still don't, we got engaged at the end of last year... and we've got a baby hatching early summer,"" adding: ""Feel incredibly blessed"".

28,['1/03/2020'],"Delhi communal violence will only push more people into ghettos, says political scientist Laurent Gayer","Delhi is one of the most religiously segregated cities in your rankings. What has led to this situation? Are these ghettoes or enclaves?

What is the relationship between spatial segregation and communal violence?

The context for this violence was Muslims defending their right to protest, to claim public space. These very sit-ins and the traffic delays were held as provocation. Is this a new threshold in their marginalisation?

Is there a gap between Islamophobic propaganda and lived experience in mingled neighbourhoods?

Northeast Delhi is where working-class Muslims and Hindus live in mixed neighbourhoods. But fear and anger are driving a wedge between the communities. Laurent Gayer, a political scientist who has worked on urban spaces and social integration in both India and Pakistan , and co-author of the book Muslims in Indian Cities, speaks to Amulya Gopalakrishnan about violence and coexistence. Urban sociology classically established a distinction between enclaves, whose residents are supposed to congregate by choice with their kith and kin, and ghettos, where stigmatised populations are thought to be confined against their will. The growing sense of insecurity among Indian Muslims has collapsed these two categories into a single experience of marginalisation. In Delhi, as in other highly segregated Indian cities, middle-class Muslims currently live side by side with working-class Muslims in dilapidated localities. They have traded the comforts of middle-class urban living for security. Obviously, the recent pogrom will lead to new displacements and new attempts to search for safety in numbers.There is no mechanical relationship between segregation and communal violence. Among Indian Muslims, feelings of insecurity are key to processes of enclosing and are deeply subjective. Delhi is a case in point: while, historically, this has not been a communally sensitive city, with ‘only’ 50 deaths in incidents of Hindu-Muslim violence between 1950 and 1995, its population has been increasingly segregated on religious lines since the 1990s. The city’s Muslim population has been responding to incidents of communal violence elsewhere in India and anticipated that such incidents could someday spread to the capital. Sadly, the events of the past few days have vindicated these predictions, and will certainly reinforce existing patterns of segregation.The anti-CAA protests are part of a global wave of urban uprisings, for which the city is not merely a background setting but a major stakeholder in the conflict between insurgents and incumbents. These are all struggles for the city, for its territories and flows, for the control of place and pace. The global enthusiasm of protesters for occupations and blockades is not merely a matter of protest tactics, though. It also carries a desire for new forms of collective life, brandished against the forces of parochialism, the disruptive power of capital and the violence of state repression. Anti-CAA activists in Shaheen Bagh and Jaffrabad did not only craft a new style of protests: night after night, they reclaimed the city as a place for pluralistic living and political solidarities across denominational divides. This sort of constituent imagination is a matter of concern for the authoritarian neo-liberal states that are becoming the norm worldwide. In India, this concern overlaps with what many Muslims and secular non-Muslims see as a systematic process of disenfranchisement of the Muslim population. In this perspective, reclaiming the streets is not only about restoring law and order or resetting the pace of circulatory flows essential to the economy: it is part of a political program aiming to replace the old citizenship by right with a citizenship by permit, which will be granted at the discretion of the rulers. The idea of the street as an arena for universalistic public claims, firmly rooted into the language of rights, is anathema to this new conception of citizenship. The ‘new India’ should brace itself for some street-fighting years.The events of the past few days have shown that many Indians were not ready to fall for the sirens of communalism. In Seelampur, for instance, Muslims and Dalits stood together against the storm threatening to be unleashed in their localities. There is no such thing as traditions of peaceful coexistence: coexistence is always hard labour. Sometimes, this everyday labour of coexistence pays. Communal forces are well aware of this, which is why they need to spread rumours and bring assailants from outside to disrupt long established patterns of conviviality. Without downplaying the recent destructions and dislocations, we should give their due to those Hindus who put their life at stake to save their Muslim neighbours and friends, or those Muslims who defended Hindu temples in the midst of chaos. This reminded me of a verse common to the Quran and the Talmud: “whoever saves one life, it is as if he had saved mankind entirely”.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74419966,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-322854,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/delhi-communal-violence-will-only-push-more-people-into-ghettos-says-political-scientist-laurent-gayer/articleshow/74419952.cms

Giving it back to the sexists

A career-long feud with Serena Williams

A sartorial star on the court

Sharapova mostly wore her personalised tennis shoes. Along with her initials/name/signature, the shoes also featured 5 Xs, which represented her five Grand Slam titles

While defending her title at Wimbledon in 2005, the sports star was seen wearing gold-speckled shoes that estimated over US $500

On February 26, Maria Sharapova , former No 1, five-time Grand Slam winner and a global sports star, announced that she was saying goodbye to tennis. The ‘ice queen’ retired after a 28-year-long career that included many titles, losses and even a ban from the sport for drug abuse. Not just an ace tennis player, Sharapova was the highest-paid female athlete till 2016 and was also a model and a businesswoman. Sharapova, who put the racket down at the age of 32 when she was ranked No 373, started playing tennis when she was only four. It was in 2004 when she beat Serena Williams and won Wimbledon at the age of 17 and shot to global fame. But her downfall began in 2016 when she was suspended for using a performance-enhancing, banned drug. The suspension ended in 15 months but Sharapova could not bring back her original form to the court. Citing recurring problems with her right shoulder, the tennis star in her retirement letter said that her body had “become a distraction”. Since returning to the WTA Tour in the spring of 2017, Sharapova played a total of 73 matches. She had 45 wins. One title and one major quarterfinal. However, her form wasn’t the only talking point in her glorious career.Sharapova was famously one of the loudest grunters in the game. While some didn’t see a problem with it, others, including her rivals, claimed that it was just a tactic to throw the opponent off their game. One of her rivals even said that Sharapova was “just too loud and annoying”. Over the course of her career, her shrieks have reached up to 101 decibels. A news website said she “crescendos an A6 note as a 27-year-old, which is an octave above a soprano singer”. However, criticism from her rivals hardly ever mattered to Sharapova.“I’ve been the same over the course of my career. No one important enough has told me to change or do something different,” she hit back after being called out for her grunts.Throughout her career – whether it was while talking to the press or calling out authorities – Sharapova didn’t turn a blind eye to the rampant sexism in the tennis world. In January this year, she slammed Brisbane International chiefs after the women players, including Sharapova, were forced off the main court to make room for the men’s inaugural ATP Cup. Sharapova said the women’s Brisbane International tournament felt “second hand”. “There’s a lot of girls that are deserving of that centre-court spot. You definitely recognise it and notice it. It feels like a little bit of a second-hand event,” she said. In 2012, when France’s Gilles Simon said that women in tennis didn’t deserve to be paid as much as men because the men’s game is more “attractive”, Sharapova hit back with a simple, “I’m sure there are a few more people that watch my matches than his, so...” And this time, even Serena was on her side.The claws (from both ends) have been out since Sharapova defeated Williams in 2004. Both ladies, on several occasions, have taken digs at each other’s personal and professional lives. In her autobiography, Sharapova wrote that it all started in 2004 when a distraught Williams, after her Wimbledon loss, told a friend (who then told Sharapova) that she would “never lose to that little b**** again”. She even wrote about how Serena hated her for “being the skinny kid who beat her, against all odds, at Wimbledon. I think she hated me for taking something that she believed belonged to her.” As for their off the court rivalry, in 2013, when a reporter assumed that Williams was talking about Sharapova when she called someone boring while referring to their personal life during an interview, Maria told the press, “If she wants to talk about something personal, maybe she should talk about her relationship and her boyfriend that was married and is getting a divorce and has kids.” She was referring to Patrick Mouratoglou, who was at the time coaching Serena. However, the rivalry wasn’t just with Serena. Sharapova was known for isolating herself from the rest of the tennis world. In an interview in 2013, she had said, “I’m not really close to many players. I think just because you’re in the same sport it doesn’t mean that you have to be friends with everyone.”",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74415477,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-230105,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/off-the-field/victories-rivalries-and-grunts-the-28-year-legacy-of-maria-sharapova/articleshow/74415446.cms

Instead of staying at a five-star hotel in Udaipur (where parts of the movie were shot), Irrfan chose to stay at a comfortable homestay. For him, shooting for this film and interacting with the locals was like going back to his roots. He would spend his free time resting on a charpai and enjoying the company of the people around him. The film captures the heart-warming relationship between a single father, Irrfan, and his daughter, Radhika.Post the shoot, director Homi Adajania and co-actors Deepak Dobriyal and Radhika, too, would often end up spending more time with Irrfan at his homestay, rather than at their own hotel.

In 2012, when France’s Gilles Simon said that women in tennis didn’t deserve to be paid as much as men because the men’s game is more “attractive”, Sharapova hit back with a simple, “I’m sure there are a few more people that watch my matches than his, so...” And this time, even Serena was on her side.The claws (from both ends) have been out since Sharapova defeated Williams in 2004. Both ladies, on several occasions, have taken digs at each other’s personal and professional lives. In her autobiography, Sharapova wrote that it all started in 2004 when a distraught Williams, after her Wimbledon loss, told a friend (who then told Sharapova) that she would “never lose to that little b**** again”. She even wrote about how Serena hated her for “being the skinny kid who beat her, against all odds, at Wimbledon. I think she hated me for taking something that she believed belonged to her.” As for their off the court rivalry, in 2013, when a reporter assumed that Williams was talking about Sharapova when she called someone boring while referring to their personal life during an interview, Maria told the press, “If she wants to talk about something personal, maybe she should talk about her relationship and her boyfriend that was married and is getting a divorce and has kids.” She was referring to Patrick Mouratoglou, who was at the time coaching Serena. However, the rivalry wasn’t just with Serena. Sharapova was known for isolating herself from the rest of the tennis world. In an interview in 2013, she had said, “I’m not really close to many players. I think just because you’re in the same sport it doesn’t mean that you have to be friends with everyone.”",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74415477,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-230105,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/off-the-field/victories-rivalries-and-grunts-the-28-year-legacy-of-maria-sharapova/articleshow/74415616.cms

37,['1/03/2020'],"Mahathir Mohamad battles hard, but Malaysia picks Muhyiddin Yassin","Malaysia's Interim Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. ( Picture credits: Reuters)

KUALA LUMPUR : Malaysia’s Mahathir Mohamad on Saturday lost the battle to return as prime minister once again as the king invited Muhyiddin Yassin to be the country’s eighth PM after exhausting political manouevrings witnessed by Malaysians for the past week since the popular Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition government was toppled.

Muhyiddin, a former home minister in Najib Razak’s government and most recently in Mahathir Mohamad’s, a soft-spoken man widely perceived as a moderate face of Malay politics, was invited by the king to be PM after it was clear the current interim PM, Mahathir, propped up by the PH coalition, did not have the numbers for a majority.

The announcement from the palace ( Istana Negara ) said Muhyiddin has been chosen as he is “the MP who likely commands the confidence of the majority MPs in the Dewan Rakyat”. Over the past couple of days, the king has reportedly met all the 222 MPs and sought their written declaration of support.

Muhyiddin is president of the Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM); the party, which is in the eye of this political storm, was formed and led by Mahathir in 2016. The latter, however, relinquished his post as chairman after some PPBM MPs colluded to bring down the PH government in late-night intrigue last Sunday.

Interestingly, the all-Malay force headed by Muhyiddin that is set to take power in a swearing-in ceremony on Sunday has at its core the Barisan Nasional, which still considers Najib as a key leader. Currently, it sits in opposition with UMNO and PAS, two pro-Malay parties, as its mainstay. It was convincingly overthrown by the electorate in 2018 against the backdrop of a billion-dollar corruption scandal involving 1MDB.

Questioning Najib on the embezzlement and joining ranks with his once-staunchest adversary Anwar Ibrahim , Mahathir rode to power in May 2018 and raised hopes of a new, clean Malaysia, with his PPBM party joining Anwar’s PKR party, even promising to pass on the baton to Anwar.

But the reluctance of keeping that promise, together with ambitions of Anwar’s own deputy Azmin Ali , brought out the ugly cracks into the open.

Anwar, backed by the PH coalition, continues to support Mahathir as the PM candidate. In a meeting on Saturday, PH leaders disputed the figures quoted by the Muhyiddin-led coalition and claimed the majority of PPBM members are still rooting for Mahathir as PM.

Muhyiddin is expected to head a new coalition comprising the breakaway faction of PPBM, UMNO, PAS, and other small parties.

Meanwhile, sources in political circles here who keep a close watch on India-Malaysia relations called Muhyiddin an inclusive leader, respectful of all religions and races, and widely supported by the royalty of Malaysia. In fact, his name surfaced after the Council of Rulers, including the current Sultan of Johor, met the king on Friday to bring about a credible resolution of a situation that has angered Malaysians across the race divide.

Experts warn this may still not be the end and on March 9, when parliament meets for a vote of confidence, the saga could unfold another surprise.

38,['1/03/2020'],liverpool: Liverpool's 44-match unbeaten run in Premier League ends in a thrashing at Watford,"Reuters Photo

LONDON: Liverpool 's unbeaten run of success in this season's Premier League was ended in unfathomable fashion on Saturday as struggling Watford hammered the European champions 3-0 at their ecstatic Vicarage Road stadium.

Ismaila Sarr inspired the extraordinary upset, stunning Liverpool with two goals in six second-half minutes before he set up captain Troy Deeney with a third for the team who had started the day one from bottom, 55 points behind the runaway leaders.

Liverpool's first league defeat of the season meant the end of their hopes of going the whole league campaign as unbeaten as the new 'Invincibles' after 44 league matches without a defeat.

It also came on the evening when they were expected to surpass champions Manchester City by creating a new English top-flight record of 19 successive league victories.

The setback will doubtless not stop Juergen Klopp's men going on to lift their first English title for 30 years as they still remain 22 points ahead of their nearest pursuers, yet their season's aura of domestic invincibility has now been demolished.

Liverpool had previously dropped only two points in the league this season -- their draw at Manchester United in October -- but from the start, Watford attacked them with unexpected vigour.

Watford had looked the more likely to break the deadlock in the first half with Gerard Deulofeu proving Liverpool's main tormentor before he was taken off by stretcher with a knee injury.

Yet it was only when Sarr struck twice just before the hour mark and then turned provider for Deeney to shoot home a third that the 'mission impossible' became a reality.

PANAJI: Dempo Sports Club are keen to make a comeback in the I-League but not with the big budgets that they had in the past.

Dempo won a record five national league titles before opting out of the top-tier. They were protesting the roadmap from All India Football Federation (AIFF) that proposed to make Indian Super League (ISL) the top league and reduced I-League to second tier. Salgaocar FC and Sporting Clube de Goa also withdrew in 2016.

Now, Dempo could take another shot at the top-tier – through I-League – with help from their academy graduates.

“Our eventual pathway is we want to become a factory of players. We want every single ISL and I-League club to come and tell us that they want our players. The same set of team, they have to be capable enough to go through the competitive league system and at least through the I-League, we can see whether we can come and play,” club chairman Shrinivas Dempo told TOI on Saturday, while felicitating their junior squads, all of whom have topped in Goa and made it to the national leagues.

When at its peak, Dempo had the highest budget with a reported Rs 15 crore being spent in 2012, the year they won their last I-League title.

“Today, low budget teams have done well. You no longer have to spend Rs 15 crore which Dempo spent 10 years ago. Things are changing. There’s hope for us,” said Dempo.

Since opting out, Dempo has chosen to invest in the academy at Ella in Old Goa, a decision that is now starting to bear fruits. Since October 2019, Dempo have won 44 of the 46 matches, kept 33 clean sheets and averaged four goals a game.

“Our journey has just begun. I would have been disappointed if success wasn’t there. What’s the point of having a team for three years, detailed planning if you cannot get results (at the state level). The challenge is now to do well in AIFF leagues,” said Dempo.

NEW DELHI: As US signalled an end to the war in Afghanistan with a peace deal with Taliban, a cautious India underlined its support to the agreement, which has been backed by all in the war-ravaged country, but not without mentioning the necessity for some of the parties involved to shun international terrorism.

India also indicated that it will not constrain its footprint in Afghanistan with foreign secretary Harsh Shringla meeting with Afghan leaders in Kabul and reiterating India's commitment to an enhanced political, economic and development partnership. The meetings — even as the peace deal was being signed in Doha — indicate a resolve to remain engaged in Afghanistan, counter to expectations in some quarters in Pakistan that Indian presence could be whittled down.

Soon after the agreement was signed in Doha, the government said its consistent policy was to support all opportunities that can ``bring peace, security and stability in Afghanistan; end violence; cut ties with international terrorism; and lead to a lasting political settlement through an Afghan led, Afghan owned and Afghan controlled process’’.

Significantly, describing Afghanistan as a contiguous neighbour (given India’s claim over PoK), the government said India will continue to extend all support to Afghan government and people in realising their aspirations for a peaceful, democratic and prosperous future where interests of all sections of Afghan society are protected.

``We note that the entire political spectrum in Afghanistan, including the government, the democratic polity and civil society, has welcomed the opportunity and hope for peace and stability generated by these agreements,’’ said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar.

Indian officials privately welcomed US secretary of state Mike Pompeo ’s remark that US will calibrate the pace of its troop withdrawal with Taliban’s action and compliance. Indian had warned US in the run-up to the deal that a hasty drawdown could worsen the security situation in the country and far beyond.

However, apprehensive as India is about Pakistan’s role in the US-Taliban deal, Shringla also underscored that sustainable peace in Afghanistan required an end to externally sponsored terrorism.

The government said in a statement on Shringla’s visit that the leadership of Afghanistan deeply appreciated India’s support for its peace, development and prosperity, including the efforts for regional connectivity such as the operationalisation of Chahbahar Port and establishment of air freight corridors between various cities of India and Afghanistan.

Agreements for road projects in Bamyan and Mazar-e-Sharif provinces of Afghanistan with Indian development assistance were also signed during Shringla’s visit. ``It was agreed to work together for implementation of the New Development Partnership and further expand cooperation in accordance with the Strategic Partnership Agreement,’’ said the government.

In his meetings. Shringla reiterated India’s consistent support for an independent, sovereign, democratic, pluralistic and inclusive Afghanistan ``in which interests of all sections of Afghan society are preserved’’. He also conveyed India’s support for enduring and inclusive peace and reconciliation which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled.

PRAYAGRAJ: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said a government is obligated to ensure justice and equal benefits for all sections of society.

Citing the “ mangal mantra” from the Vedas , the PM said: “Sarkar kaa yeh dayitava hai ki har vyakti ka bhalaa ho, har vyakti ko nayay mile. Yahi soch toh sabka saath, sabka vikas aur sabka vishwas ka aadhaar hai (it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that every person is included, gets the benefit of development and gets justice).”

Speaking at a function here organised to distribute aid to the differently abled , Modi said the “mangal mantra” which is often invoked at religious ceremonies, has also been the fount of “sabka sath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas” credo of his government.

Modi’s remarks acquire significance in the backdrop of the communal violence in Delhi as well as unrest among Muslims over the new citizenship law. He, however, made no reference to the riots that rocked the north-eastern parts of the capital.

“Our government is working for the development of each person of society and to make their life better,” he said at the event where aid and assistance were handed over to over 27,000 differently abled persons.

Modi came back to the theme of the need for a government not to discriminate among citizens by again referring to the ‘mangal mantra’ at the end of his speech. “In the beginning of my talk, I had discussed about the responsibility of the government. The last line of the same manta is: Lokah Samastah Sukhino Bhavantu. It says that ‘in this world, every section of society, every citizen and everyone should prosper and be happy,” the PM signed off.

Three Guinness records were created at the event, including longest parade of hand operated tri-cycles (300 manual tricycles covering a distance of 1.8 km), the most-hand operated cycles distributed in one hour (626 free tricycles were given in one hour) and the longest moving queues of tricycles (400 tricycles, in three queues, paraded simultaneously for 13 minutes).

Different items, worth over Rs 19.3 crore, for the aid of differently abled persons and senior citizens were distributed at the events.

Hitting out at governments in the past, the PM said ‘they’ were insensitive to the needs of differently abled persons for the past 70 years, but his dispensation was thinking about their problems and finding ways to reduce their issues.

Calling the city as ‘Prayagraj nayay ki nagri hai’, Modi said he regrets that the good work his government is doing is not talked about much. He also said in the past five years, his government has held around 9,000 camps in various parts of the country.

Praising the commitment and determination of differently abled persons, Modi said, “I am of the view that these equipment will only assist your ‘buland hausla’ (strong confidence) as you are those who have challenged the challenge. Your real strength is your patience, saamarthya (capacity) and mind.”

He also said that be it industry, service sector or sports, skills of the ‘divyang jan’ are being continuously encouraged and it is a matter of pride that India has done so well in several of the competitions held for people with disability. “One sports centre in Gwalior is being established to tap the talent,” he added.

During his over 30-minute address, the PM gave an account of government schemes for the differently abled and senior citizens.

Talking about the new endeavour, Ushasi said, “Till now whatever roles I have played, I have strongly related to the character.

This time it will be a period drama. I was excited to learn that I will be portraying the role of Kadambini Debi , who is definitely an epitome of woman empowerment.

48,['1/03/2020'],Portrait of a riot-hit neighbourhood,"With cheap places to stay and many small garment units offering employment, northeast Delhi became home to many Muslim migrants. But today, it’s barricaded alleys have shut out many dreams

When Roopala Saxena , a Teach for India fellow, walked into a classroom in northeast Delhi’s Brahampuri back in 2018, she couldn’t help but notice the blatant segregation. On one end of the 4th grade classroom, the Hindu children sat huddled together, while their Muslim classmates were on the other side.“At lunch, the Hindu kids were not eating with Muslim children even when they brought vegetarian food, because they thought it could contain meat,” says the 21-year-old, who has been going to this northeast Delhi area for two years. Having discussions about religious pluralism with her young students has changed things — they play, eat together and hug each other when they enter the classroom.The localities of Jaffrabad, Maujpur, Mustafabad and Brahampuri in northeast Delhi may not have been on our collective radars, but the violent riots over the course of the last week has changed that. Segregation has been a way of life in these so-called resettlement colonies which soaked up migrants looking for cheap accommodation and jobs.Praveen Khangta co-authored a paper about the ghettoization of the Muslim community in Seelampur (the limits of the region were defined somewhat loosely, with Jaffrabad and the relatively better-off locality of Yamuna Vihar being included in its purview) after living in the area for two years during his stint as an educator. He found that many pockets are either homogenously Hindu or Muslim, and even in mixed communities, the narrow alleys have a slant towards one community or the other. Gali no 5 in Chand Bagh, for example, has only Muslim houses and only two Hindu families lived in the area. The houses in the alley were torched on Tuesday. Since the riots broke out in colonies along the the Maujpur-Jaffrabad main road and the Brahampuri main road which runs parallel to it, landmarks — usually a road or a temple/mosque — have turned into physical borders, with every alleyway marked by barricades.Many in the area, mostly Muslims, work in small garment units that churn out jeans and jackets. Others are daily wage labourers, and some run small businesses at the local market where shops were gutted by mobs. There is a sizeable migrant population from Western UP, Bihar and Uttarakhand , and regional affiliation also plays a role in living patterns, but doesn’t ultimately trump religion. Some young people have had experiences of stigma because of where they live. In a paper about segregation in Muslim locales in Delhi, academic Ghazala Jamil described conversations with young men who said shopkeepers would become uncomfortable when they heard their names or addresses, and another noted the difficulty in securing loans. Another instance was of a young man going for his first year exam at Delhi University and the invigilator saying, “I didn’t know if people from Seelampur also study”.Despite the jibes, it really isn’t about choice. “If you are Muslim, there are very few localities where you can get housing. When I spoke to property brokers, they said they wouldn’t show a house in the well-off neighbourhood of Yamuna Vihar to a Muslim, irrespective of whether they could afford it,” says Khangta.Saxena, who teaches in Brahampuri, says the neighbourhood is dominated by Hindus, with about 70-80% of the residents belonging to the faith. Most of the Muslim students at the low-income private school live on the other side of the road, known primarily by the name of the mosque near it, Khadde wali Masjid.For many of the residents of these colonies, what comes next is unclear. Many have left their homes, and don’t intend to return to the area. And for those that may choose to, or be compelled to, rebuilding trust could take a long time. As 22-year-old Mohammad Salim stated, “My house was burnt by the people I have played cricket with. They poured kerosene on my father. We barely managed to escape”.Others hold on to hope, saying the young kids they teach give them faith in the future. Rushil Saini has worked in a Brahampuri school for two years now, and had instituted a rule disallowing religious symbols in her classroom. One day, when the classroom was empty, she found something on the wall. A picture of Ganesha had been pasted onto the peeling paint on the wall, and right next to it, the word Allah written in Urdu. She left it up, and it still remains.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74420118,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-332194,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/portrait-of-a-riot-hit-neighbourhood/articleshow/74420126.cms

Striker Beth England scored a stoppage-time winner as Chelsea beat Arsenal 2-1 in a thrilling Continental Cup final to claim the trophy for the first time in their history at the City Ground in Nottingham on Saturday.

England put FA Women's Super League leaders Chelsea ahead in the eighth minute after Norway's Maren Mjelde headed the ball back across goal, and the 25-year-old forward continued her recent fine run of form by firing home at the second attempt.

Chelsea goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger kept her side in it with some superb saves, but she was finally beaten in the 84th minute when Leah Williamson brought Arsenal level with a left-foot shot that flew through a thicket of defenders and into the net.

The game looked to be heading for extra time until Sam Kerr worked an opening down the right late in stoppage time, and when the ball broke to Mjelde she was able to find England for a simple close-range finish to win it for the Blues.

50,['1/03/2020'],Govt may use Assam delimitation to counter CAA stir,"Finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said if a seat is reserved without altering the boundary, then the demogr... Read More

GUWAHATI: Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday said the sole purpose of redrawing the boundaries of assembly and Lok Sabha constituencies in the state should be to protect the political rights of native Assamese by creating more seats in which a majority of voters would be from indigenous groups.

The state government’s stand on the nature of delimitation is likely to play a significant role in allaying the fears of indigenous Assamese that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act might turn them into a minority in their own homeland. The CAA offers citizenship to non-Muslims from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan on grounds of religious persecution.

“Of the 126 assembly constituencies, at least 110 should be kept for the indigenous people. We do not want any increase in the number of constituencies… that won’t help us,” Sarma said.

Muslim voters in Assam account for about 37% of the state’s electorate. In the 2016 elections, 28 Muslim candidates had won. Of them, 14 are from Congress, 13 from AIUDF and one from BJP. Muslims voters also influence election results in six of the 14 Lok Sabha constituencies and BJP wants a complete overhaul of the demography in these constituencies as well. These six constituencies are Barpeta, Dhubri, Nagaon, Kaliabor, Karimganj and Silchar.

“Many people think if seats are reserved, then it would provide the desired safeguards to natives. But if a seat is reserved without altering the boundary, then the demography of the voters will remain unchanged. If the voters in a reserved seat happen to be supporters of Badruddin Ajmal (AIUDF chief) then the elected MLA will have to follow Ajmal’s orders and we are back to square one,” the minister added.

In the past, Sarma and other BJP leaders would often caution people that Ajmal would “very soon” become the chief minister of Assam if the influx of Muslims from Bangladesh continued unabated.

Sarma further said, “If a constituency is turned into an indigenous-majority one by redrawing the boundaries, then we will have indigenous voters as well as an indigenous MLA. This is the only way to secure the existence of the indigenous communities of Assam.”

Sarma’s statement comes a day after President Ram Nath Kovind cleared the decks for resumption of the delimitation exercise in Assam. The exercise was put on hold in 2008 as the situation in the state was reported to be unsuitable owing to a threat to peace and public order.

Before the exercise was suspended, the delimitation commission had already prepared the draft proposal of the new boundaries for the assembly and Lok Sabha constituencies on the basis of the 2001 Census. The current delimitation will be done according to the 2011 Census.

According to the old draft, the number of assembly seats reserved for STs has been increased from 16 to 19 and those for SCs from eight to nine. Several Muslim-majority constituencies have ceased to exist with the boundaries being redrawn and the new seats getting new names.

Among the Lok Sabha constituencies, Mangaldai has been done away with and a new constituency, Udalguri, with Bodo tribal majority voters, has been proposed in its place.

Leader of the opposition Debabrata Saikia said, “The resumption of the delimitation exercise is a wrong decision taken by the BJP government. You cannot start the process without first deciding on the fate of 19 lakh people excluded from NRC .”

51,['1/03/2020'],"Violence in Delhi a blot on our face, says Ram Vilas Paswan","Union minister of consumer affairs, food and public distribution Ram Vilas Paswan. ( Picture Credits: ANI)

NEW DELHI: Union minister and BJP ally, Ram Vilas Paswan, termed the recent communal violence in north-east Delhi as a “national blot” on Saturday as he sought quick trial of the cases by fast-track courts to ensure they don’t meet the same fate as the 1984 anti-Sikh riots cases which dragged on for years.

He added that the government should make any new law or amend any existing one for faster trials and sentencing in such cases.

Speaking to reporters at his residence after sending a “chaadar” to be offered at Ajmer Sharif dargah, Paswan said, “Can anyone call the riot anything less than a blot on our face when so many people have been killed brutally and residential and commercial blocks were put on fire? All this happened when US President was here. When locals – both Hindus and Muslims - came to rescue of each other, some disruptive elements created the havoc. They have no religion, caste or creed.”

On being asked whether he also demanded action against all those who made hate speeches, Paswan told TOI, “I will not go into the past. There is an investigation going on and I can assure that the investigation will be neutral. Anyone who is responsible for the riots whether it was hate speech or anything else that contributed to the riots will be identified and strictest action must be taken against them. I am confident that all these cases will be tried in fast-track court. There should be no repeat of ‘justice delayed is justice denied’ as it has been in the case of anti-Sikh riots in which people are still waiting for justice.”

The minister claimed that the government is serious and that’s why national security adviser Ajit Doval visited the riot hit areas and assured people of action.

Earlier, Paswan’s son and Lok Janshakti Party president Chirag had demanded action against the perpetrators of the violence and also against BJP leaders - Anurag Thakur and Kapil Mishra - for making provocative speeches.

WATFORD: Liverpool centre-back Virgil van Dijk lamented an ""unacceptable"" display after the team's run of 44 games without defeat in the Premier League ended with a shock 3-0 loss away to strugglers Watford on Saturday.

""First of all credit to Watford, they deserve it... It's a tough one to take but that's football ,"" van Dijk told Sky Sports after the stunning reverse at Vicarage Road. ""We have to improve and we will.""

Reigning European champions Liverpool, bidding for their first title of the Premier League era, were undone by Ismaila Sarr's second-half double and a 72nd-minute goal from Troy Deeney.

Defeat ended Liverpool's hopes of winning their first English championship crown in 30 years with an unbeaten season as they lost in the league for the first time since January 2019.

""We have to improve we have to do better,"" said van Dijk, with Liverpool still a mammoth 22 points clear of second-placed Manchester City, the current English title-holders, despite this defeat.

""It's not acceptable we lose 3-0 here.""

Saturday's remarkable loss put paid to Liverpool's hopes of equalling Arsenal's celebrated 'Invincibles', who enjoyed an unbeaten campaign while winning the 2003/04 Premier League title as part of a sequence of 49 top-flight matches without defeat.

But Dutch international van Dijk said: ""Losing hurts, the records are only for the media. We want to win our next game (against Chelsea in the FA Cup on Tuesday), we want to strike back straight away.""

Victory saw Watford climb out of the relegation zone, albeit on goal difference alone, and elated goalkeeper Ben Foster said: ""It's easy if you do it like that -- we had a game plan and stuck to it really well.""

56,['1/03/2020'],liverpool: 'It is not over': Klopp warns Liverpool after unbeaten run ends,"From left, Andrew Robertson, Jurgen Klopp and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (AFP Photo)

WATFORD: Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp insisted the title is not won yet after his side were beaten for the first time in 45 games in the Premier League as Watford thrashed the European champions 3-0 on Saturday.

Klopp's men still enjoy a 22-point lead at the top of the table and need a maximum of four wins from their remaining 10 games to secure a first league title for 30 years.

However, defeat at Vicarage Road continues a downturn in form as they sneaked past relegation-threatened Norwich and West Ham in their two previous league games and lost the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie to Atletico Madrid.

""What the boys did so far is exceptional but it is not over,"" said Klopp.

""We did not expect the number of games we won. It was never easy and it will never be easy, so now let's carry on.""

Klopp has long been an advocate of a winter break amid the gruelling English campaign to give his players a chance to rest and recuperate.

But a two-week break earlier this month appears to have disrupted the Reds' rhythm.

""Shape, form is not something we can take for granted. We fought against each every feeling in the body. We fought against everything and that's why we have that amount of points,"" added Klopp.

""The biggest surprise for me is that Watford is fighting to stay in the league. Now is the moment when everybody is fighting like crazy.

""We don't think it is the biggest catastrophe in world football . We feel the defeat really and now we have the chance to show the reaction again.""

Ismaila Sarr was the star for Watford as the Senegalese struck twice in six minutes at the start of the second half and then teed up Troy Deeney to add a third.

The comprehensive scoreline had the added bonus of edging Watford out of the relegation zone by one goal ahead of Bournemouth.

However, after slipping back into the bottom three following a fine start to his reign, Hornets' boss Nigel Pearson is all too aware of the importance of backing up a famous win for the remainder of the season.

""It's such an important win for us. But it is one win,"" said Pearson.

""They are such an outstanding side, we had to get our performance right and I thought we thoroughly deserved the win. We threatened with the ball and defended with discipline, energy and commitment. That's been the message from day one.

""It's in our own hands, and we have to deliver that performance week in, week out.""

A detailed analysis of potential replacement markets has been undertaken and shared with other ministries and foreign missions, sources told TOI.In case of antibiotics, for instance, Switzerland and Italy were identified as potential sources given that they are among the top exporting countries along with China.While there has been a positive response from some of the countries, finding alternative sources for the supply of electronics and mobile phones and their inputs is proving to be a tough task given the complete dominance that China has in the sector.Besides, other countries would also be chasing the same sources to bridge the gap due to a breakdown in the supply chain.Commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal is scheduled to hold detailed consultations in the coming week to move forward with the strategy and also seek measures to boost local production wherever possible.A key theme of the minister’s discussions with government agencies and industry representatives will be to implement a plan to push the export of 500-550 items where India has the potential to fill the gap created by China.A preliminary analysis following detailed discussions by the commerce department has shown that the situation is particularly grim in the case of pharma and chemicals, smartphones, electronics and white goods and plastics, where India depends on China for a bulk of its imports.Besides, there are sectors such as textiles yarn, certain organic chemicals and gems and jewellery, which are seeing an adverse impact on exports given that China and Hong Kong are major buyers. But trade bodies have told the commerce department that coronavirus, which threatens to be a pandemic now, is resulting in an increased interest in the demand for leather products, ceramics and agri-products.Sources said the pharma industry expects supply disruption of 16 molecules, which includes antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, vitamins A, B, C & E, and hormones such as progesterone. It may not just impact domestic production of medicines but also exports. But the estimate was that areas beyond 500km of Wuhan may start production sometime in March, although Wuhan itself could see normalcy return in April. The industry lobby groups have sought incentives for pharma SMEs as a short-term measure, apart from suggesting that the government restart plants that have been shut down.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74421826,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-174480,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-starts-hunt-for-alternatives-to-china-to-source-over-1k-items/articleshow/74421762.cms

Djokovic is now on an 18-0 winning run this season, and 21-0 overall since late 2019, as he ended an eight-match win streak for his Greek opponent, champion last weekend in Marseille.

Djokovic claimed his third trophy of 2020 after helping Serbia to the ATP Cup and winning an eighth Australian Open.

It is the seventh time that the 32-year-old Djokovic has won more than 20 matches on the trot.

His record is 43 set in 2010 and 2011 with a run of 28 his next best, achieved on two occasions in 2013-14 and 2015.

""This has been one of the best starts of all seasons I've had. I feel great on the court,"" said Djokovic.

""I'm just grateful that I'm playing well, feeling well. I've won many matches now in a row. I'll try to keep that run going.""

Next up for Djokovic will be the season's first Masters events, back-to-back hard court assignments at Indian Wells and Miami.

After that will be European clay and an eventual assault on a second French Open title and 18th major.

""Motivation is never lacking. Of course, I get inspired by the goals that I set. That's why I compete.

""The season has started in a most perfect way possible. I am aware of the fact that most of the matches that I'm going to play, the players will not have much to lose.

""They will go out and try stop the streak.""

Saturday's victory, achieved in less than 90 minutes, also saw the Serbian awarded a ""golden visa"" by the UAE government.

The honour bestows a decade of residency in the tax-free emirate.

""Dubai has been a very important city in my career not just because of the tournament but because I've been actually coming as a tourist here and using this as a base for pre-season training,"" he said.

Tsitsipas lost his second straight final in Dubai after going down to Roger Federer a year ago.

""It was close in both sets,"" added Djokovic. ""A few points decided it. I'm most proud of my consistency this week, especially on shots from the baseline.""

The top seed produced a straightforward win after a close-call semi-final where he saved three match points against Gael Monfils.

""I was just a point from going out, I might not have been here,"" the winner said. ""But it shows how quickly things can turn.""

Djokovic broke for 5-3 in the opening set and served it out moments later.

The second set was slightly tighter, with the Serbian losing a break as Tsitsipas levelled at 3-all.

But Djokovic came through again with a break for 5-4 as his opponent hit the net.

A game later, Djokovic was lifting another trophy as he found the corner with a winner.

Djokovic will stay number one in the ATP rankings on Monday to start a 280th week atop the table.

He was playing the final in Dubai for a sixth time in 11 appearances. It was, however, his first final at the tournament since 2015 when he lost to Federer.

Coming into the championship match, the 21-year-old Tsitsipas had lost just one set this week.

""It (defeat) happened again (in a final here),"" said Tsitsipas, the winner of the ATP Finals in November. ""But it's all a learning experience.

""It's been a tiring week, that's all I can say. I don't really feel much honestly. I felt happier last year when I made the finals. But I'm proud of myself because I showed good discipline.""

59,['1/03/2020'],Must maintain civility in language too: RSS,"Senior RSS member Dattatreya Hosabale (BCCL file photo)

NEW DELHI: In an apparent reference to controversial comments by BJP functionaries like Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur and Pravesh Verma in the wake of the anti-CAA campaign, RSS has expressed strong reservations against the language and expressions used and reminding them of the virtues of modesty and restraint.

Senior Sangh functionary Dattatreya Hosabale on Friday said Lord Ram is remembered as “Maryada Purushottam”, only because he maintained modesty even in the language he used. Though he did not take names, the RSS joint general secretary called for decorum in language in social and political life. Speaking on the second day of “Ayodhya Parv” here, Hosabale said it is ironic that the whole world bows to Lord Ram but devotees in His own country had to wait for long for a government order to initiate construction of the temple.

The comments came in the context of the Supreme Court deciding the long pending litigation last year. “We must maintain modesty in social and political life... this was the message of Lord Ram too,” he said, sending across a message that the actions of a section of BJP members, accused of making inflammatory speeches, have not gone down well with the Sangh.

“Lord Ram was “Maryada Purushottam”and he maintained maryada (civility) in language too. His message in today’s context is that one should not speak whatever comes to mind ... rather one should be careful in the language,” he said at the meet organised by Ayodhya MP Lallu Singh. “One should maintain civility in social and political life. This is the message of Lord Ram,” Hosabale said.

Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had on Thursday made it clear that the top BJP leadership does not approve of statements made by Mishra, Thakur and Verma, who have been cornered for their speeches.

61,['1/03/2020'],‘CAA derailed Congress plan to hit at govt on growth’,"Members of All Assam Students Union take out a rally against CAA in Dibrugarh on Saturday (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: As the debate on NPR-NRC-CAA continues to roil the political waters, there is regret in Congress that the emotive and divisive issue has put in the shade the party leadership’s considered strategy to focus on economic crisis to put the Modi government in the dock.

Senior Congress functionary and former chief minister Harish Rawat put the lament on record by saying that the citizenship debate has forced the party to play on BJP’s home pitch.

“The massive Bharat Bachao Rally in Delhi succeeded in bringing focus on economic issues, inflation and unemployment which have acquired critical proportions under the BJP rule. Unfortunately, subsequent developments (CAA etc) happened so fast that they created an atmosphere. And it put a stop on what we started with the Delhi rally,” Rawat told TOI in an interview.

Referring to “divisive” issues as BJP’s turf, Rawat drew on cricketing analogy to say that Congress has always felt comfortable batting on “our pitch of peace, harmony and development”.

Extending the analogy, he said, “Bharat Bachao rally was a big demonstration of Congress vision. Unfortunately, CAA happened. Then they bowled the NPR ball, then the NRC delivery. It put our issues in the background.”

“But this rough phase will subside… We will go back on our pitch and force them (BJP) to play on our pitch. As they or we start playing on our pitch, you will see that Congress will score better,” he added.

The senior AICC general secretary said Congress will soon go to states with the agenda of economy and jobs to galvanise the “restlessness” against BJP. “As things improve, there will be more ‘Bharat Bachao’ rallies in states,” he said.

It was not that Congress was blindsided by the Citizenship debate but it had to take a stand on what Rawat called Assam, with majority of Hindus, seeing as a threat to its identity and what others saw as a threat to the “Ambedkar effect” on the Constitution — equality on the basis of religion, caste, birth.

“Congress was not distracted. We understand this game … BJP brought these emotive issues purposely so that people were swept in emotion and it created division,” he argued.

“The intelligentsia opposed it. All, including Muslims, accepted the verdict for Ram Temple in Ayodhya . The government was thus seen as unnecessarily provoking the people … the situation unfolded so swiftly, it was not in our control. It was a must for Congress to lead this sentiment,” Rawat said.

Though lamenting the loss of spotlight on economy and jobs, Rawat said there was hope in the big vindication of Congress stance – BJP-ruled Bihar’s veto of NPR, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s retracing of steps on NRC and BJP’s massive defeat in recent Delhi elections.

“They are still stubborn on CAA but we are confident that the Supreme Court will revalidate the constitutional position… We have time to refocus on our issues and retrain the politics towards them,” he said.

Kylian Mbappe capped a brilliant individual performance by scoring twice and creating another for Mauro Icardi as leaders Paris St Germain cruised to a comfortable 4-0 victory over Dijon in their Ligue 1 clash at the Parc des Princes on Saturday.

With Neymar and Marco Veratti suspended and Thiago Silva missing with injury, PSG got off to the perfect start when midfielder Pablo Sarabia steered a mis-hit shot from Marquinhos past Runar Runarsson in the third minute to give them the lead.

Mbappe added a second in the 74th minute, timing his run perfectly to collect Julian Draxler's through ball before rounding Runarsson and slotting the ball through the arms of the diving goalkeeper.

He then set up Icardi for PSG's third three minutes later, sliding a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the Argentinian striker for him to fire the ball home.

The 21-year-old completed his attacking masterclass with a second goal in stoppage time at the end of the game, rifling the ball past the helpless Runarsson to complete the 4-0 rout.

The win took PSG to 68 points from 27 games and restored their lead at the top of the table to 13 following second-placed Olympique de Marseille's 3-2 win over Nimes on Friday night. Dijon remain just above the relegation places with 27 points.

In the late kickoffs, Teji Savanier scored twice for Montpellier as they thumped Strasbourg 3-0 and Angers put some daylight between themselves and the relegation zone with a 1-0 win away to Brest.

Bottom side Toulouse slumped to a 2-0 defeat at home against Rennes while Amiens, who are second from bottom, lost 1-0 at home to Metz, with Farid Boulaya getting on the scoresheet for the visitors.

On the south coast, Monaco were held to a 1-1 draw with Reims when Wissam Ben Yedder's first-half penalty for the home side was cancelled out by a 58th-minute equaliser from Hassane Kamara.

ROME: Juventus lost their grip on first place in Serie A to Lazio on Saturday and the eight-time defending champions will have to wait more than a week, possibly even longer, to try and get it back. That's because five Italian league games scheduled for this weekend, including Juventus' highly awaited match against third-place Inter Milan, were postponed in an attempt to contain the spread of coronavirus outbreak.The fixtures were originally due to be played without fans but the decision to call them off was taken on Saturday by the league as part of ""urgent measures for the containment and management"" of the COVID-19 disease.However, with the coronavirus outbreak worst in northern Italy , Lazio were permitted to play their match against Bologna in Rome and won 2-0 with their fans in attendance.Lazio moved two points ahead of idle Juventus and eight ahead of Inter, which also had a game postponed last weekend.Juventus' next game is at Bologna on March 8, and there are concerns that this match and other games next weekend could be postponed, too, if the government decides to extend emergency anti-virus measures for another week.At the Stadio Olimpico, many fans wore masks over their faces as Lazio extended their unbeaten run to 21 games.Luis Alberto scored one goal and set up another while playing through an apparent injury that left him limping.Bologna had two goals disallowed following VAR checks.With European champion Liverpool having lost on Saturday to end their 44-game unbeaten streak in the Premier League, Lazio now have the longest unbeaten run in Europe's top five leagues.""I would never have imagined to be first after 26 rounds,"" Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi said.

Surat: SpiceJet is planning to introduce another freighter aircraft to meet the ever increasing cargo demand from Diamond City. Its dedicated freighter service connecting Surat with Chennai and Vishakhapatnam has received good response.

A seminar was organized by Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI). Senior vice-president of SpiceJet cargo sales MM Gahuri and senior general manager Sanjeev Sharma were among the experts invited to speak on ‘future of Surat air cargo terminal’ on Saturday.

Sanjeev Sharma told TOI, “From day one of the launch of freighter aircraft, we have been handling about 20 tonnes of cargo every alternative day, especially shrimp seeds. Looking at the ever increasing demand, we may increase the frequency and also start another freighter aircraft to cater to the demand from shrimp farmers of south Gujarat.”

Sharma added, “Apart from shrimp seeds, we see a huge potential from Surat in cargo items including chemicals, valuable cargo, perishables, e-commerce, textiles etc. Also, we have been providing charter cargo services to our valued customers for transporting their products to domestic as well as international destination.”

Shrimp farming is booming business in the Diamond City, Valsad, Bharuch and Navsari. From just 300 metric tonnes per annum in 2009, shrimp production has crossed over 45,000 metric tonnes per annum in 2019. Annual turnover of shrimp farming in south Gujarat is pegged at Rs2,000 crore.

The annual demand of shrimp seeds in south Gujarat is about 500 crores. About 70% of shrimp seed demand comes from Surat and nearby areas like Olpad, Sayan, Mandroi, Ichhapore and Dumas.

According to Airports Authority of India (AAI) figures, cargo movement from Surat to different parts of the country between April and January 2020 was 1,050 metric tonnes. In January alone, about 180 metric tonnes of cargo was moved out of the city.

SGCCI president Ketan Desai said, “We have been pushing for an international cargo terminal at the airport, especially for shrimps, gold jewellery and diamonds. About 95% of shrimps worth over Rs2,000 crore cultivated in south Gujarat are exported to international destinations.”

69,['1/03/2020'],Sindhodh tense after leopard kills calf,"Surat: Villagers in Sindhodh village , located about 6km off Bharuch town , are spending sleepless nights after a leopard killed a calf late on Friday night.

Official sources said that the calf was tied outside the house of Chatur Patel at Navi Nagri in Sindhodh village. Late in the night, Patel heard the calf and the cow screaming and upon checking, Patel found the calf to be missing from the post. The next morning, half eaten carcass of the calf was recovered a few hundred meters away from Patel’s house.

Ashish Sharma, wild life warden of Bharuch forest range told TOI, “Sindhodh village lies in the outskirts of Bharuch and so, there is enough reason to believe that leopards have started infringing city areas. This could, however, be a dangerous sign when it comes to the safety of people and livestock.”

Sharma said that the forest department has placed two cages at Sindhodh village to capture the wild cat. He further said that in the last two months about eight leopards have been caught from Bharuch district including Ankleshwar, Kosamba, Valia and Jhagadia.

“The leopards are moving towards the city areas as they do not have enough space left in the jungle to hide. There is no food left in the jungle and hence are targeting livestock in the villages,” Sharma added.

A five-year-old boy identified as Kishan Valvi was killed in the leopard attack at Bharan village in Ankleshwar. The deceased was playing near the sugarcane filed in Bharan village when the leopard attacked him. He succumbed to the serious injuries in the Ankleshwar’s civil hospital.

The accused took photos of the minor girl on their mobile phones while raping her and later threatened to share them on social media and also throw acid on her if she complained to anyone about it.

Police booked Jay Khokhariya and two others for allegedly kidnapping and raping the minor girl. They kidnapped the minor girl from a locality near Ved Road around six months ago in a car and took her to an agricultural farm where they raped her.

""The minor girl did not complain initially due to threats, but she approached police after the accused attacked her father a few days ago. A fight started between the accused and the minor girl’s family as the accused continued to harass her,"" said a police officer at Katargam police station.

She claimed in her complaint that after raping her, the accused and his friends used to tease her often. She alleged that recently friends of the accused tried to kidnap her on a motorcycle, but she managed to escape.

Police are trying to find out the location where the minor girl was raped six months ago by the accused and his friends as she doesn’t remember the exact place. Meanwhile, police have formed teams to locate the main accused Khokhariya, a resident of Katargam, who is on the run. A police team has left for Saurashtra to trace him in his hometown.

PATNA: The process of online test for learner’s driving licence began in all 38 districts of the state on Saturday, a day after the scheme was formally launched by transport minister Santosh Kumar Nirala . Officials claimed that around 60% of the applicants cleared the test on Day 1.

Transport department principal secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, who visited the district transport office in Patna , asked the officials concerned to get signage and closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras installed there. He also gave away learner’s licence to the successful candidates on the spot.

According to sources, altogether 32 applicants took the online test in Patna on Saturday, of which 22 cleared it. The remaining will get an opportunity to reappear for the test after a week.

As part of the new online test, the applicants are asked 10 random questions from a set of 300 questions related to driving, traffic norms and road safety. A person has to give six correct answers to clear the test. In fact, a model question paper set, comprising all the 300 questions, has been uploaded to the website of the transport department. Questions in the test are asked from the same set.

The online test for learner’s licence is being held in two shifts — 10.30am to 1pm and 2pm to 4.30pm. As of now, the test at the Patna district transport office is being conducted with the help of seven computers, but three more computers will soon be installed to allow more applicants to appear for the test.

Applicants can apply for the online test on the website of the transport department from home. They will be given a time slot and will have to visit the district transport office for the test. They can also choose whether they want to write the test in English or Hindi.

“The idea behind conducting the test for driving licence is not to fail applicants, but ensure that they are aware of the road safety and traffic norms. Awareness is necessary for everyone’s safety,” Agarwal told TOI.

PATNA: The use of cellphones inside examination halls by students is already banned in most universities and colleges, but now even invigilators will not be allowed to do so. This is one of the new guidelines approved by governor-cum-chancellor Phagu Chauhan for fixation of exam centres.

In a directive issued to all the universities, the chancellor has asked the vice-chancellors (VC) to conduct university examinations as per the guidelines drafted by a three-member committee, comprising Munger University VC Ranjit Kumar Verma and his Patliputra University and Magadh University counterparts Gulab Chand Ram Jayaswal and Rajendra Prasad.

The guidelines provide that CCTV cameras and jammers should be installed at all the examination halls and entrance gates. Use of electronic gadgets inside the hall will be banned and centres will have to arrange for frisking of all the examinees before writing their exams.

The guidelines further state that only those constituent or affiliated colleges will be made examination centres which fulfil necessary conditions of physical facilities and security. Centres should be fixed in the nearest colleges as far as possible, but there must not be home centre. If need be, even colleges located outside the district may be made centres of examinations.

There must be proper sitting arrangement, lighting, drinking water, electric fans, and separate toilets for men and women in sufficient number at all the centres. Regular supply of electricity should be ensured and facilities for medical aid must be made available. Disabled people should be provided wheelchairs and writers (for blind people) at the centres.

The chancellor has directed that necessary action under the provisions of the Bihar Conduct of Examination Act, 1981 will be initiated against those who do not follow these guidelines during the examinations.

PATNA: A joint team of the Special Task Force (STF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) arrested a hardcore Maoist , Mukesh Sahni, from Muzaffarpur on Saturday.

Acting on a tip off, the personnel of the STF of the state police headquarters and the SSB conducted raids at Karanpura village under the Bochaha police station area on Saturday morning and took Sahni into custody.

Muzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant said, “Sahni had been evading arrest in at least 12 cases of Maoist violence in Muzaffarpur and adjoining areas. He had escaped from the state after the security forces mounted their pressure and carried out intensive raids on his hideouts in the district.”

According to sources, Sahni had returned to his native village under the Bochaha police station area a fortnight ago. “The security agencies swung into action and arrested the elusive Maoist,” a senior officer of the SSB posted at the frontier headquarters in Patna said.

The arrest of Sahni came close on the heels of a three-day meeting of different intelligence agencies in Muzaffarpur, which concluded on Saturday. They decided to intensify the operation against Maoists and drug traffickers in the state from March. Altogether 10 teams, which were imparted special training in anti-Maoist operations, have been assigned the task.

The speaker said that he had received a report from the legislature secretary who had probed if the report, some of the contents of which were quoted by Congress MLA P T Thomas before it was tabled in the assembly, was leaked.

“It is a serious matter that the contents of the report came out before it was tabled. It is a breach of privilege which is why I demanded a probed. But, it has not gone out of the assembly before it was tabled,” Sreeramakrishnan said.

He said that the 19th session of the 14th legislative assembly will begin on March 2, in which the assembly will convene for 27 days at a stretch.

On day one, the business would be discussion on supplementary demands for grants for FY 2019-20, while from March 3, discussions will be held on the demands for grants for 2020-21.

Also, 13 days have been reserved for the demands for grants and voting. The session will continue till April 8.

The speaker said that the goal to become a totally-paperless legislative assembly is fast progressing and the members have already embraced the new system of receiving all documents on the electronic screens provided to them. It will be further expanded in the upcoming session.

He also said that the launch of Sabha television will be held during the upcoming session and the online telecast has already been launched.

Shyama Madhavam

deserves Award

Later, referring to the work Shyama Madhavam, penned by poet Prabha Varma, the speaker said that it rightly deserved the Poonthanam Jnanappana award instituted by Guruvayur Devaswom.

On Thursday, the high court had stayed the presentation of the award to Varma, who is also the media adviser of the chief minister.

“In my opinion, if there is an award in the name of Jnanappana, the first consideration should be for Shyama Madhavam. The work is the first-of-its-kind in Malayalam that rightly assessed the good and evil parts of Krishna,” Sreeramakrishnan said.

Though the committee of Guruvayur Devaswom had announced the award for Prabha Varma, a group of believers had approached the high court and the court had stayed the decision, citing that it may hurt the feelings of devotees.

Shayama Madhavam portrays Krishna as a man who sometimes questions his own moral values.

The petitioners had alleged that the idea behind the book as well as the decision to give the award, is to belittle Krishna.

JAIPUR: As the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) did not pay heed to the demands of Ninder farmers in last 52 days, the protesting farmers, on Saturday, once again started ‘ zameen samadhi ’ on Saturday.

The farmers were staging a dharna on land while the talks with JDA were on, but were not sitting in the pits. After the talks turned futile and their three demands, including compensation as per Land Acquisition Act, 2013 were not met, the move was taken to catch the government’s attention.

Samiti coordinator Nagendra Singh said, “ We are forced to intensify our protest in peaceful manner as government did not take concrete steps to resolve our issues . The protest would continue till the time decision on the scheme is not taken,”

77,['1/03/2020'],Surat: In-charge CP accused of calling anti-CAA protesters ‘Pakistanis’,"A file photo of an anti-CAA protest in Limbayat locality

SURAT: Raking up a major controversy , in-charge city commissioner of police (CP) D N Patel has allegedly labelled a group of Muslim representatives as being “Pakistanis, Bangladeshis”.

According to the allegations, the representatives went to Patel’s office on Friday seeking approval to hold a dharna against CAA and NRC in Rander area. Patel allegedly insulted them saying: “You are from Pakistan and Bangladesh.”

Jamiat E Ulema E Hind (JUH) Gujarat has taken severe offence against Patel’s comment, and submitted a memorandum to the senior state police and home department officials demanding stringent actions against Patel for his insulting language.

Aziz Malam, one of the member of group that went to submit the application, said that Patel started asking all Muslims in the group where they hail from — UP, Bangladesh? “He asked our names and where we were born. Later he started talking with two members from scheduled caste community who had accompanied us for support and started calling us Pakistani and Bangladeshi,"" Malam said.

""He also told us that every bit of India is ours and do you know what is being done in your Pakistan with Hindu girls?"" Malam added.

However, Patel has denied all allegations. “I was explaining to the group that this act is not for Indian citizens but only for those who need citizenship in India. Those from Pakistan and Bangladesh who are illegally living in India should worry, not others,” he claimed.

Abdul Quiyum Haq, general secretary of JUH, said: ""The in-charge police commissioner told the group members whether they are from Pakistan or Bangladesh when they went to seek permission to hold dharna. Jamiat has written a letter to state DGP and home secretary to take actions against the officer for using insulting language.”

For the past 22 days, women from Muslim community have been sitting on anti-CAA protests in Rander similar to Shaheen Bagh of New Delhi. They sit on dharna from afternoon till evening on a daily basis. Meanwhile, police have asked them to discontinue the protest and also denied permission when locals sought necessary police permission to hold a dharna.

The group of representatives went to meet CP R B Brahmbhatt, but as the latter was on leave, they submitted the application in office for submission of applications. Later, as they were leaving the office, a cop from Patel's office approached the group in the parking area on the campus and told them that Patel wanted to meet them.

The group of around seven persons went to meet Patel, whose regular posting in city is of joint commissioner of police sector II.

Parikshit Rathod, state general secretary of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) who was among the group, said: “Patel started asking us why scheduled caste people were getting involved in it (anti-CAA protest). He indirectly told the representatives that they are Pakistani and Bangladeshi and refused to give us permission to continue dharna. He also denied to give the refusal in writing,"" Rathod alleged.

The group members claimed that they left their mobile phones outside Patel's office as they were instructed by staff to do so.

79,['1/03/2020'],Airfares skyrocket as Holi approaches,"PATNA: With Holi around the corner, the one-way fare of flights from Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai to Patna has witnessed a steep surge.

If the data available on online travel websites are anything to go by, a trip from Delhi to Patna between March 1 and 9 can cost at least Rs 7,000 per person. The average airfare on the Delhi-Patna route is usually Rs 2,500-Rs 4,500, but the price of a ticket for a flight on March 8, two days before Holi, has gone up to Rs 11,216. Similarly, the airfare on the Mumbai-Patna route, which is priced around Rs 4,022 on normal days, has increased to Rs 15,704.

Aviation analysts attributed the rise in demand for tickets of Patna-bound flights as the main reason for the surge in fares. An executive of GoAir in Patna told this newspaper, “The Delhi-Patna and Mumbai-Patna routes witness the maximum rush of passengers. Hence, the fares go up during the festive season.”

An IndiGo executive claimed that there had been a significant surge in last-minute bookings for Patna-bound flights.

“Hundreds of people return to Patna from cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Kolkata before Holi. However, most of them book their tickets a week or a fortnight before the festival,” he said.

The price of a return ticket from Patna to Delhi two days after Holi is in the range of Rs 5,500 to Rs 10,000. The price of the same ticket has dropped to Rs 3,890 on March 16.

According to travel agents in the city, getting a confirmed railway ticket is almost impossible during festivals like Holi. As a result, people prefer flights, whose tickets are expensive.

“Most people living outside the state come home to celebrate festivals with their families. Since trains witness heavy passenger rush, a number of them choose flights,” said Mritunjay Kumar, the employee of a city-based travel agency.

Prakash Singh, the owner of another agency, claimed that people booking tickets almost three months before Holi had to pay a high amount. “Usually, those, who book tickets one or two months prior to the date of their travel, pay lower fares than those, who do last-minute bookings. However, during festivals like Holi, most passengers have to pay a high amount,” he said.

Meanwhile, flyers are of the view that the exorbitant airfares charged by different airlines create a lot of pressure on their budgets.

“I do not think I will be able to celebrate Holi at home this time. The flight ticket is overpriced and I cannot afford it right now. Besides, there are no confirmed tickets in trains,” Shristy Sonal, the student of a private college, told this reporter over phone from Noida.

Surat: Sugar factory workers , who were on strike since Friday to demand higher wages from their employers in south Gujarat, called off their agitation after local administration revoked the permission of a rally in front of Bardoli sugar factory.

“We planned to hold a meeting and a rally in front of Bardoli sugar factory on Saturday. We were granted permission by the executive sub magistrate of Bardoli on 27 February. However, the local administration revoked the permission under pressure from owners of sugar factories. Thus, we decided to call off our agitation in protest,” a sugarcane worker said.

“The sugarcane workers want a hike in wages from Rs250 per tonne to Rs400 per tonne to cut sugarcane. It takes 14 hours for two labourers to cut one tonne of sugarcane. It is a hard job,” the sugarcane worker added. About 30 per cent of workers, mostly tribals, did not go to factories on Friday. There are about 13 sugar factories in south Gujarat, which produces 85 lakh tonnes of sugarcane per annum.

“Block administration cancelled its permission for a public meeting due to enormous pressure brought on them by managements of sugar factories. There is a fear among them that the stir could spread throughout the state,” said Jayesh Gamit, secretary of Majur Adhikar Manch.

Union leaders claimed that they were also threatened of dire consequences by some anti-social elements and asked to leave the area. “Given the prevailing atmosphere of terror, the manch has decided to withdraw its call for strike to ensure safety of workers,” a MAM press statement said. The MAM on Saturday submitted a memorandum to chief minister on the demand of workers through local administration. The memorandum has said that the workers were being exploited by sugar factories and that the working conditions continue to remain poor for them.

It is estimated that almost two lakh tribal workers migrate from tribal-dominated districts of Gujarat and Maharashtra to harvest sugarcane crop in the region during the season. Dang accounts for almost 40% of total workforce in sugar factories.

Titled #turbinebagh, this “samosa packet movement” will happen in London.

The Instagram story of the ‘Basic Instinct’ star has an image of a samosa packet shared by London-based architect and artist Sofia Karim that has a poem titled ‘The Price of Gratitude’ penned by her uncle, the Bangladeshi photojournalist Shahidul Alam. The movement, which “speaks out on the rise of fascism, racism and far-right nationalism across the globe”, will host an exhibition in March, which will include a samosa packet made out of a photograph taken at an anti-CAA/NRC/NPR rally in Kolkata.

In 2019, Alam shared the poem as a reaction to the death of a student who had criticized Bangladesh’s agreement to allow India to draw water from the Feni. Along with this poem, a photograph by Alam was printed on the back of a throwaway paper, which was then used to make a samosa packet. Stone posted one of the five images of this packet that was shared on Instagram five days ago.

A screenshot of Stone’s post was shared on the Instagram handle of this movement along with a post that asked people to share artwork that stands in solidarity with the resistance in India. “Email us something to print on a samosa packet. Even a screenshot of old work will do... People are dying in India as far-right mobs descend on the streets and raise their flags. What we see in Delhi is fascism unchecked,” the post read, adding that the packets will be displayed at the “peaceful protest” at the Turbine Hall in London’s Tate Modern on March 28. Some packets will also be sent to protest sites, including Shaheen Bagh.

One of the contributors to this movement is Kolkata’s photographer-turned-director Ronny Sen. A samosa packet has already been made of Sen’s photograph of rapper Kat Jr from the rally on College Street last December. On his chest is written, “Jaat na bhat de (Don’t give me religion, give me food)”.

Speaking about the movement, Sen said, “On Thursday, Roger Waters read lines of my very dear friend and poet Aamir Aziz. On Friday, John Cusack shared a photograph of Narendra Modi where his hands are soaked in blood along with the words ‘Gujarat 2002, Delhi 2020’. And on Saturday, Sharon Stone has shared about Turbine Bagh. It is wonderful that those outside the country are taking note of the people’s movements across India and South Asia at large.”

86,['1/03/2020'],Crowdfunding plea for Delhi riot relief material,"Kolkata: A group of good Samaritans in the city — comprising doctors, teachers, students and human rights activists — are leaving for the riot-affected zones in north east Delhi next week with relief material, money and necessary medicines. This is the first such initiative from Kolkata since violence erupted between pro-CAA and anti-CAA groups in the Capital last week, killing 39 people so far and damaging several neighbourhoods.

The group has started a crowdfunding campaign from Thursday to raise the money and are planning to leave for Delhi sometime between Tuesday and Wednesday. In Delhi, the group is supposed to work with a team of doctors and students to distribute the relief material in the riot-affected areas.

“This is the least we can do. Seeing the situation in Delhi, we can’t sit back in the comfort of our homes and do nothing. We have started pulling funds from our own accounts and have also appealed to our friends and well-wishers over social media and text messages, asking them to contribute whatever they can to our effort,” said Raya Debnath, one of the main organizers of the activity.

Debnath, a regular face at the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protest site at Park Circus, said she and the other members in the group were moved by the shocking videos and news from their friends in Delhi about the situation in the violence hit-areas and saw how hundreds of people have been rendered homeless.

“We are willing to accept whatever people are willing to donate and while the fund-raising exercise is limited to online transactions, our volunteers will be on the roads on the last two days to accumulate as much as possible. We are also working in close co-ordination with citizens’ groups and NGOs in Delhi to ensure that the relief material is aptly distributed,” said Satabdi Das, a school teacher.

The group is working closely with members of Shramajibi Swasthya Udyog — an organization of doctors and health workers — who will accompany them on the visit and are part of the crowdfunding programme.

“A team of doctors from our organization will be part of the group that will visit the riot-affected areas in Delhi next week. This is our form of protest against the forces that try to create division among our own citizens on the basis of religion and also against the role of the police and the central government in failing to tackle the situation,” said Punyabrata Gun, secretary of Shramajibi Swasthya Udyog.

87,['1/03/2020'],Malegaon: Pvt firm to handle power supply,"Nashik: From the midnight of March 1, the Calcutta Electric Corporation (CESC) has taken over as the distribution franchisee of the power supplied by the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) in the Malegaon town.

“Malegaon’s 1.40 lakh power consumers will have all their supply-related issues serviced by the CESC from March 1,” said B K Janvir, the chief engineer of MSEDCL’s Nashik zone.

Janvir was camping at Malegaon at the time of MSEDCL’s handover to the CSEC on Saturday night. “We have everything in place. All the power supply meters across 16 of 33 KV power sub-stations and three extra-high voltage sub-stations will be read for the units consumed at the transition time.”

“Thereafter, the MSEDCL will be duty-bound to supply power until these sub-stations. All the power going to the consumers, thereafter, will be managed and serviced by the CESC that, in turn, will provide the revenue as per the terms and conditions,” the officer added. He said there will be no change in the rate of power supply and users will continue to be MSEDCL consumers.

Taking over the power distribution, CESC general manager Anirban Raha said that the priority of his company would be to ensure quality and uninterrupted power.

“We are here to serve the people what they deserve. We will first start with a centre for registration of complaints and attend to them at the earliest,” Raha said.

“A round-the-clock call centre, complaint redressal and night patrolling of the power supply establishments are priorities. We fully understand that the network is weak, but our priority would be to connect with people,” he said.

Raha said that the company would pump in money for the transformation of the entire network with quality equipment to increase the reliability of the power supply in the second phase.

Initially, MSEDCL personnel will be posted along with CESC personnel in a parallel arrangement. These employees and the officers will be slowly withdrawn from the system.

Malegaon town consumes about 100 million units of power every month and the MSEDCL could generate a demand of Rs 23 crore from the consumers for that duration. The recovery is just above 50%, another senior officer from the state-run power utility said.

88,['1/03/2020'],West Bengal plans drive to dispel rumours about chickens spreading coronavirus,"KOLKATA/ARAMBAGH: Novel coronavirus cannot spread through consumption of chicken and eggs, said doctors, microbiologists and experts in veterinary sciences on Saturday, attempting to clear the air on the possibility of nCoV infecting poultry and then spreading to humans consuming it. Pradip Majumdar, the agricultural advisor to the chief minister, said the state government will launch an awareness drive o from Monday to assure consumers that there is no link between the virus and chicken.The West Bengal Poultry Federation (WBPF), which is reeling under the impact of rumours about nCoV in poultry products, involved experts on Saturday to counter the fake social media messages on contamination that had spread like wildfire, triggering a 50% slump in chicken and egg consumption and causing losses amounting to Rs 300 crore to the industry over the fortnight. In Kolkata, price of dressed chicken has come down by 20% following the crisis triggered by the rumours.Pointing out that the virus host was mammals, not birds, the experts ruled out the possibility of birds being infected. The nCoV is believed to have spread from bats in an animal market in Wuhan. Thereafter, the contagion had spread among humans, doctors said.“There are 60 variants of coronavirus. Of them, three — MERS-CoV, SARS CoV and nCoV — lead to fatalities. All three have their origin in bats. Though it is now getting transmitted from humans to humans, there is no possibility of it infecting poultry and then spreading to humans through consumption of chicken or eggs,” said RG Kar Medical College professor Jyotirmoy Pal.Barun Roy, a professor in the department of animal nutrition at the West Bengal University of Animal & Fishery Science, felt that the rumour has not only affected the poultry industry, but had an impact on the common man as well since chicken and eggs are a source of good and affordable protein essential to develop immunity to fight against virus.The crisis in the industry has the potential to affect the lives of 15 lakh workers who are directly or indirectly associated with the poultry industry in the state. “The situation is grave. We need to stamp out the rumour,” said WBPF general secretary Madan Mohon Maity.Poultry farm owners in the districts are reeling under severe losses since the beginning of February. In districts like Bankura and Hooghly, price of whole chicken has plunged to Rs 65 a kg to spur demand. But it hasn’t helped yet.Even a major hatchery like Arambagh Hatcheries is witnessing a slide in business. Its city manager Gopal Ray said, “Our farm in Arambagh was closed for a few days in November after hens showed signs of a viral disease. We found they were shivering too much. We closed the farm for a few days and followed all necessary procedures, like removing the ailing birds, before reopening the farm the same month. Since then, chicken was regularly supplied from the Arambagh farm. But in February, when we had healthy livestock, we noticed that demand was declining. It is only recently that we realised that this slump has been sparked by rumours on social media that chicken in the state has been affected by the coronavirus.”",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74425293,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-206052,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-plans-drive-to-dispel-rumours-about-chickens-spreading-ncov/articleshow/74420897.cms
89,['1/03/2020'],"Nagpur: Youth killed, 6 injured in road accident after enjoying party","NAGPUR: Attending birthday party of a friend turned tragic for a youth after he was killed while six others, including two women, sustained injuries in an accident in the wee hours of Saturday near Gavsi Manapur village on Nagpur-Wardha Highway.

According to police, the group of friends was returning to the city after partaking in a liquor party at Mississippi dhaba near Parsodi. Sources said most of the dhabas on Wardha road allow liquor consumption.

The deceased have been identified as Yash Rahate, a 23-year-old BCCA graduate. Yash’s father Rajendra is an executive engineer in Nagpur Municipal Corporation .

The injured have been identified as Avinash Iyer, Anand Gaidhane, Ankit Tupkar, Harshal Thavre, Mohini Mahurkar and Shivani Giripunje.

Police said around 12 friends attended the party. At around 10pm, five of them left the dhaba while others stayed back. Later, all seven sat in a four-wheeler owned by Tupkar. Thavre was driving the vehicle.

Sources said that most of the people in the vehicle, including Thavre, were drunk. After leaving the dhaba, they took a U-turn on the outer ring road at a nearby toll booth and travelled towards Wardha road.

The accident occured after Thavre lost control of the speeding vehicle at a turning. Many of the passengers were thrown out of the vehicle having a removable top.

In November 2018, a man was killed while two others were injured in an accident after they were coming to the city drunk after a birthday party at one such dhaba.

Yash and Shivani sustained major injuries. One of the injured informed police control room. Hingna police, led by senior PI Sarin Durge, sent the injured to a private hospital where Yash died during treatment.

Hingna police have registered a case of rash driving and death due to negligence against Thavre.

“On Saturday morning, Shivani’s family shifted her to another hospital,” said PI Durge.

90,['1/03/2020'],Districts asked not to use PVC flex board in government offices,"PATNA: State environment , forests and climate change department has sent an advisory to all district magistrates asking them to stop use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) flex board in government institutions, banners and posters to prevent environmental degradation.

Principal secretary of the department Dipak Kumar Singh said an advisory in this regard was issued by the Union ministry of environment and forests a few days ago.

“The state governments were asked not to use flex in government establishments as well as in posters and banners to prevent environmental degradation. We have, therefore, asked the district magistrates to ensure compliance of the advisory,” Dipak told TOI.

The Centre’s advisory was in pursuance of PM Narendra Modi’s vision to implement blanket ban on use of single-use plastic by 2022.

Experts said use of flex was highly hazardous to environment and its ban in government establishments is a welcome step. “Flex is almost like plastic and it takes hundreds of years to degrade. Thus, restriction on its use by the government is a welcome step. There are several other environment-friendly alternatives which can be used instead of PVC flex,” Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh said.

The state government had banned use, manufacture, sale and storage of plastic bags of all sizes in the urban areas of Bihar in December 2018 and in rural areas in February last year.

The BSPCB and Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) conducted raids at several shops and factories and seized the plastic bags. The ban was implemented effectively in the beginning as the district authorities formed multiple task forces for penalizing the offenders, following which most shopkeepers started using paper bags or cloth bags.

However, the plastic ban gradually became less effective. “It is true that ban on single-use plastic has become less effective and one of the primary reasons for the same is poor recycling facility in the state. However, the use of plastic bags has almost stopped in big retail outlets and malls,” Ghosh said.

He added, “Raids are still conducted regularly to curb use of plastic. We will launch a fresh awareness drive to induce behavioural change among people in this regard.”

The event, which aims at promoting tourism and creating awareness about the ancient Vikramshila Mahavihara, was jointly inaugurated by Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Sadanand Singh, JD (U) MP Ajay Kumar Mandal, zila parishad chairman Anant Kumar alias Tuntun Sah, Bhagalpur SSP Ashish Bharti, DDC Sunil Kumar and former BJP MLA Aman Paswan, among others.

Speaking on the occasion, the CLP leader said, “Efforts are needed to link the excavation site of the ancient Vikramshila Mahavihara at Antichak village in Kahalgaon sub-division of Bhagalpur district with the Buddhist circuit.”

He added, “Development of the site and provision of proper infrastructure in and around the area are required to promote tourism because of the large number of foreign tourists visiting the place in recent years.”

According to historical texts, the Vikramshila Mahavihara was one of the important centres of Buddhist learning in India during the Pala period (8th to 12th century AD). It was established by King Dharmapala (783 to 820 AD) and is located at 50km east of Bhagalpur, at present.

JD (U) MP Mandal claimed that all-round development was taking place in the state under the leadership of chief minister Nitish Kumar. “We hope that a central university will come up near the excavation site soon,” he said.

Varanasi: In the wake of the expanding reach of Coronavirus (COVID-19) which has claimed several patients in Asian countries, two South Korean nationals staying in Sonbhadra for a professional project have been asked to work from home as a precautionary measure.

No Coronavirus cases have been reported in Sonbhadra so far. The foreign nationals are among the 50 Korean citizens living in Sonbhadra and are employed by the South Korean conglomerate Doosan Group, which is constructing two power generation units of 660 MW each at Obra in the district.

Talking to TOI on Saturday, manager (human resources) of Doosan Group’s India office Lal Babu Jha said, “Three South Korean employees working in the district are on leave. Of them, Don Kim and Denam Kim returned to Obra after a vacation in South Korea on February 25 and 26 respectively.

97,['1/03/2020'],"Silchar prof’s arrest creates uproar; family, friends call it an attack on free speech","Kolkata: The arrest of Souradeep Sengupta , guest lecturer at a Silchar College, apparently for his Facebook post on Delhi violence have raised a hue and cry on social media, with his family, friends, professors and students’ union at his alma mater, Presidency University, castigating the act and demanding his immediate release.

Booked under at least two non-bailable charges, Sengupta has been remanded in judicial custody till Monday, something about which his cousin, Ananya Duttaroy, is worried about and fear it would take a toll on his mental and physical health. “Souradeep’s parents are panic-stricken about what is going to happen to him. They themselves were humiliated by RSS, ABVP members. Souradeep was also told to kneel down and apologize on Facebook Live,” she said. “We fear about the family’s safety and also worried this arrest might adversely affect his career.”

Sengupta did his graduation in physics from Presidency University in 2012-15 and was the assistant general secretary of Presidency University Students’ Union as an Independent candidate in 2014-15. His batchmate, Aritra Ghosh, is shocked at the arrest. “Souradeep was one of the brightest and the best among us. Unlike many of us, he took a conscious decision not to go abroad for his PhD. While preparing to apply for PhD programmes, he decided to return to his hometown, Silchar, and teach at a local college to give back to his community. It pains me to think Souradeep is in jail.” said Ghosh, who studies at Yale. He added that this incident strongly reflected how the concept of free speech had eroded in India.

Sumallya Mukhopadhyay, who was the Presidency union president during Sengupta’s stint, said, “Unlike some leaders of recognized political parties, Souradeep isn’t someone who wants to instigate riots. While no action is being taken against those leaders’ hate speech, scholars and students are being targeted.” The research scholar at IIT Delhi said if the reason for the arrest was the online post, Sengupta had deleted it and even publicly apologized in another post. “It only projects the intolerance of the party in power and its students’ wing. They do not want people to protest or disagree,” he said. Echoing him, a Silchar University professor said the current scene was extremely depressing. “Freedom of speech is being curtailed and there is no space for dissent,” he said.

Condemning the arrest, Presidency dean of students Pradip Basu said, “The Delhi violence is a result of RSS-BJP’s divisive politics. As a political science professor, I feel our Constitution gives us the freedom to voice our views. This type of incident is an attack on democracy and is creating an atmosphere of fear.”

103,['1/03/2020'],DVAC seizes Rs 78 lakh cash from spl deputy collector’s premises,"Vellore: Directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption ( DVAC ) officials in Vellore on Saturday caught a special deputy collector (stamps department) and his driver red-handed while they were receiving Rs 50,000 bribe from a complainant. The official had allegedly demanded the bribe for approving stamp duty valuation for land registered at the Kannamangalam sub-registrar office in Tiruvannamalai district.

Subsequently, the sleuths conducted a search in special deputy collector S Dhinakaran’s office cabin in the Vellore collector office complex and his rented house at Brammapuram, Katpadi, and seized Rs 78.59 lakh cash .

S Vijay, DVAC inspector and one of the officers involved in the search operation, said S Ranjith Kumar, 25, of Irumbuli near Polur in Tiruvannamalai district had recently registered 1.47 acres of land in his name at the Kannamangalam sub-registrar office. However, the staff at the sub-registrar office had said that incorrect stamp duty was paid for the registration and that it should be cleared by S Dhinakaran, special deputy collector (stamps department), Tiruvannamalai and Vellore districts. Following this, when Ranjith Kumar approached Dhinakaran, the latter had allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs 50,000 to clear the stamp duty matter.

Based on a complaint by Ranjith Kumar, a team of DVAC sleuths headed by DSP N Devanathan caught Dhinakaran red-handed when he received the bribe amount from the complainant.

M Rajini Kanth, another inspector of the Vellore DVAC, said that Dhinakaran, to avoid risk, had asked Ranjith Kumar to wait with the money near an ATM kiosk near the collector’s office. Around 9.30 pm on Friday, Dhinakaran and his driver B Ramesh Kumar, 45, who picked up Ranjith in his personal car, collected the bribe in the car and later asked him to alight. “Based on the alert by Ranjith, we chased the car and intercepted it near Sathuvachari Aavin,” said Rajini Kanth.

Dhinakaran was then taken to his office on the first floor of A-block in the collector’s office complex and searches were conducted in his cabin and house at Brammapuram.

Speaking to TOI, Devanathan said, “In the search at his rented house and office cabin, Rs 78,59,270, apart from the Rs 50,000 confiscated from his car, was seized.” As Dhinakaran confessed that the cash was his and he had amassed it collecting bribes while working in various departments, he along with his driver were booked under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act and remanded in Vellore central prison. Since a search was on at Dhinakaran’s hometown, the exact amount seized could be ascertained only after it’s completed, Devanathan said.

A police team led by Tiruvannamalai DVAC inspector Arul Prasad were conducting a search at the deputy collector’s house in Polur.

Over 35 young girls have allegedly gone missing from the district in two months, and parents of two approached the HC.

Father of one of the missing girls, Kiran Thakre, contended that the police were not taking his missing complaint seriously and prayed for expediting the probe to find his daughter.

Alleging that a boy and his mother had lured her away, the petitioners submitted data of 35 girls in the age group of 15-25 years who went untraceable between August 15 to October 14, 2019. Taking cognisance of the petitioners’ data, the court summoned the Akola SP for explanation in last hearing.

“This information speaks volumes about police machinery’s efficiency and their control over law and order situation in Akola. In spite of such an alarming situation and pathetic failure on their part, it appears to us that the files entrusted to police to undertake investigation into such serious offences and bring the offenders to book, haven’t been opened. This state of affair would impel us to summon a higher officer to the court,” a division bench led by justice Sunil Shukre had tersely said.

After being summoned, the investigating officer informed that additional clues were received by them and a team had been dispatched to search for the missing girls. He also assured to place progress record in the case.

The judges then granted additional time to the police for investigations. “We hope that investigating officer does his best and leaves no stone unturned in detecting missing girls as soon as possible. He should act upon whatever information or clues are given to him by the petitioners, including their suspicion that the mother of a boy allegedly took away their daughters without their consent,” the bench said, before adjourning the hearing till March 12.

Members of the association said that they had met commissioner of police Vishwas Nangre-Patil and assistant commissioner of the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) Dushyant Bhamre demanding action against the wholesalers.

“We met the FDA and presented names of the wholesalers who sell drugs to the doctors illegally. We have asked the FDA to take action. Since our demand has failed to evoke any action, we met the commissioner of police and also presented our memorandum to the district collector,” said office-bearers of the association.

The doctors buy the medicines from the wholesalers and give it to the patients. “If doctors start selling medicines, what are the pharmacists for? What is the future of these medicos, who after completing their formal education, are now eating into the business of pharmacists,” asked one of the office-bearers.

The association claimed that the correspondence with the FDA had failed to move authorities to action. “If the administration fails to take action, we will be forced to go on a chain hunger strike from March 4,” the association stated in its presentation to the collector.

The wholesaler druggists and chemists denied such allegations. “The wholesaler can sell the drugs to a registered medical practitioner (RMP) as there is no such ban. Schedule K of the FDA clearly states that the RMP can buy the drugs. The problem could be with the quantum of medicine stored at the RMP’s place. This can be disputed but the FDA has no objection to this,” said Sudesh Aager, an office-bearer from the wholesalers association.

109,['1/03/2020'],Over 20k state RTE admissions under threat as schools go ahead with boycott,"Nagpur: Over 20,000 school students may lose out on RTE admissions as schools who have not been reimbursed by the state government have decided to boycott the admission process.

Office bearers of Independent English Schools Association (IESA) were in Nagpur on Saturday to meet school owners and rally them for putting up a united stand in their inevitable fight against the education department.

Rajendra Dayma, president of IESA, said, “Over Rs400 crores is still pending as part of RTE payments to schools. There are thousands of schools that have not received more than 50% of their bills. For last couple of years, we have been patient but it seems the government is just not interested in education sector and that’s why it is not responding to our queries.”

IESA refutes charges of using pressure tactics. “We are determined to follow through with our resolution and we do not care whether they cancel our school’s recognition. If they (education department) want to close us down then let them do so, but we will not budge till our demands are fulfilled,” said Dayma.

Gangadhar Nakade, president of IESA-Nagpur, said, “There are no options available for school owners now because we have been pushed to financial brink by the government. There is no logical reason for denying us the payments because the admissions were given the education department itself.”

Abha Meghe, senior member of IESA and director of a well-known group of schools, said, “We are in fact saying that the government should not give us money and rather spend it on making their schools better. This will benefit the masses and ensure quality education for all without dependence on private schools.”

Dayma insisted that IESA does not hold a grudge against RTE Act. “We believe that RTE is wonderful and a much needed thing. But the government has to do the right thing and follow up on their promise of reimbursing schools. Had the state government done its part, then we would have not found ourselves in such a situation,” said Dayma.

110,['1/03/2020'],"Using seat belt on back seat saves woman’s life, leaves her injured","Nagpur: Safety measures like seat belts can substantially reduce the risk of serious injuries in case of accidents. However, these features can also lead to injury, especially in a high-speed accident. A 55-year-old woman was involved in one such incident recently.

The organs from this woman’s belly moved into her chest cavity near the lungs due to seat belt pressure when her car met with an accident two weeks ago. She was treated laparoscopically at Orange City Hospital and Research Institute (OCHRI) and was discharged on Saturday.

Dr Mukund Thakur, who performed minimal invasive surgery on this woman, said that she was sitting in the back seat with belts fixed when her car hit a stationary truck on Tiosa-Talegaon road on February 12.

“No doubt the woman was saved from fatal injury due to seat belt, but it is rare to see such herniation of abdominal contents inside chest cavity due to seat belt compression,” he said.

Road safety expert Vinay Kunte said that air bags in the back seat may have saved her from injury. “In this incident, other occupants sitting in the front were saved due to air bags. But, a very few cars do have airbags for back seats in India. We must note that the woman was saved from life threatening injuries as she was wearing seat belt,” he said.

The patient’s husband, who hails from Gadarwada in Madhya Pradesh, said that she was brought to Nagpur in a cardiac ambulance on ventilator support. “I was with my wife in the same car. Her injuries were not visible externally, but she was facing problem in breathing. We were lucky to reach OCHRI where all her injuries were treated laparoscopically without opening the abdomen,” he said.

OCHRI director Dr Anup Marar said that seat belt is the simplest way to protect yourself from permanent disabling or fatal injuries. “Such seat belt injuries occur very rarely. But, they are pale in comparison with possible consequences of not buckling up,” he said.

Commending the state government’s decision to announce a holiday on “harela festival” on July 16, the higher education minister said that school and college students across the state, along with their teachers, will plant a sapling on the occasion.

“We aim to make a record of planting trees this year. Therefore, every kid and teacher of primary, secondary and degree colleges will participate in the planting drive (on July 16),” Rawat announced.

The minister also announced that shortlisted candidates for the super 30 scheme will receive free coaching for civil service exams, apart from medical and engineering entrance exams.

At the event, vice chancellor Uttaranchal University NK Joshi presented a report regarding the progress and achievements of the university. He said that a total of 2,688 degrees were to be distributed, including 16 doctorate degrees and 59 gold medals.

“The faculty members of the university have published 571 high-quality research papers and out of 26 registered patents, 19 have already been published.

The samiti, led by Aziz Pathan, met resident deputy district collector Bhagwat Doifode and presented him a memorandum addressed to the President of India which stated that some political parties and individuals were dividing people on communal lines.

“The riots in Delhi are being attributed to the protests against the CAA, NPR and NRC. But that is not the case. There is peace across the country where agitations are being carried out,” said members of the samiti.

“People are peacefully demonstrating against the government in a democratic manner. We are sure that none of us are taking law in our hand. This seems to be the handiwork of some anti-social elements, who are trying to defame the peaceful agitation of the people,” said the samiti members.

The samiti has appealed to the President of India to ask Central and state governments to ensure zero tolerance against people inciting communal hatred and treat them as anti-nationals.

“We appeal to the President of India to take action against people who are inciting communal hatred between sections of society. These people should be treated as anti-nationals and tried accordingly. When few such people are booked, none of the others would dare to follow them,” said the samiti.

NASHIK: In a theft that lasted just five minutes, unidentified burglars were able to uproot an entire automatic teller machine ( ATM ) unit that contained Rs 14 lakh early on Thursday in the Shirud village of Dhule district .

Authorities said by the time the police responded to an automated alert that was sent to the control room in Dhule — and relayed to the Dhule taluka police station — the burglars had escaped with both the machine and the cash.

Officials said the CCTV footage from the scene showed that at least four people were involved in the theft.

“The incident took place between 2.20 am and 2.25 am,” said inspector Dilip Gangurde of the Dhule taluka police station.

“The criminals arrived in a pick-up van and parked it opposite the kiosk. They then used a cable to uproot the machine. The cable was used to tie the ATM to the van. Within five minutes, they were able to remove the ATM, drag the machine till the veranda in front of the kiosk, load it into the van and flee the scene.”

Gangurde said the entire operation was caught on CCTV installed inside the ATM kiosk. Police said an automatic alert system, indicating something was wrong with the ATM in Shirud village, was sent to the control room. The message was then relayed to the Dhule taluka police station.

Senior police officials then rushed to the spot, but the unidentified suspects had already fled.

Gangurde said three police teams have been formed to track down the van seen in the CCTV footpath. The teams have fanned out in different directions and will focus on toll nakas and other important junctions.

The ATM kiosk is located inside a small shopping complex in Shirud village, 25 km from the Dhule taluka police station. The bank the ATM belongs to is also located nearby.

The police team that had responded to the automated alert was able to reach the spot at around 2.40 am.

115,['1/03/2020'],Rs 300 crore expressway to be built to decongest traffic in Puducherry: CM V Narayanasamy,"Chief Minister of Puducherry V. Narayanasamy

PUDUCHERRY: The Union road transport and highways ministry has acceded to the Puducherry government’s request to construct an expressway stretching 9 km at a cost of Rs 300 crore to decongest traffic in the town, said chief minister V Narayanasamy .

Speaking to media representatives on Saturday, Narayanasamy said the Puducherry government had earlier submitted four highway-related proposals to the ministry and road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari , who visited Puducherry on Friday, reviewed the projects and assured that they would be executed. He said the projects include the construction of an expressway connecting Sivaji statue on East Coast Road with Murungapakkam at a cost of Rs 300 crore. The ministry will construct flyovers wherever required and widen the existing road in the 9km stretch. He expressed optimism that the project will decongest traffic in the town. He said the ministry has also come forward to widen the existing road connecting Villupuram with Nagapattinam into a four-lane road at a cost of Rs 926 crore. He said the previous Congress-led UPA government gave in-principle approval for the project. Presently, the ministry has commenced the process of acquiring land in Puducherry, Karaikal and Tamil Nadu for the project, he said.

He said the ministry has approved a proposal to upgrade and widen the road connecting Mahabalipuram with Puducherry into a four-lane project at a cost of Rs 800 crore. He said the project will be implemented without disturbing the thickly populated town areas and the proposed four-lane road will join the Villupuram NH via Ousteri, Villianur and Ariyapalayam.

Similarly, the existing road between Madagadipet and Puducherry will be made four-lane at a cost of Rs 130 crore. The project includes the construction of a bridge over the Sangarapani river. Narayanasamy said he submitted a memorandum to Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu, also the chancellor of Pondicherry University, to provide 25% reservation for students from Puducherry in all courses offered by the university. Presently, the university extends 25% reservation for Puducherry students only for a few courses, while denying quota for the majority of the most sought-after courses, including job-oriented courses.

116,['1/03/2020'],"T-108 makes fields near R’bore its hub, raises security concern","Jaipur: The forest administration at Ranthambore has once again rung an alarm bell after tigers are venturing out from inhabiting area of the reserve and becoming a threat not just for humans but for themselves as well.

Ranthambore forest officials on Thursday wrote to the state chief wildlife warden (CWLW) Arindam Tomar to take action regarding tiger T-108 which has made its base in the fields close to the reserve. The tiger, which had previously killed a boy, has been out of the reserve for around four months and is creating major problem for the farmers in Sawai Madhopur, who are unable to go to their fields. T-108 has found a conducive environment as it has also found a mate in T-114 because of which it is not returning to the reserve, claimed officials.

Manoj Parashar, field director, Ranthambore Tiger Project told TOI, “T-108, sub-adult tiger named Jai (T-108), which killed the 10-year-old boy has ventured out of the reserve few months back and has made its base on the on the boundary in some fields. This has become a very serious issue for the villagers who are unable to go to the fields due to fear of the tiger. The worst part is that there is a tigress also along with T-108. So essentially, it is getting food, a mate and its own territory because of which the tiger does not want to come back to the reserve. Some action has to be taken to resolve this issue because of which I have written to the chief wildlife warden to look into the matter.”

According to sources, the tiger is also at the risk of being killed by the villagers. The officials further stressed on the fact that the department should consider relocation of few of the tigers from Ranthambore to other reserves. The Ranthambore reserve has a core area of 392 square kilometre, with a buffer zone of 1,342 square kilometre. Of the total area of little over 1,700 square kilometre in RTR, only 600 square kilometre can be used by tigers. According to the data available there are 51 adult tigers in the reserve out of which 25 are female and 26 males. Apart from this there are 13-14 young ones though the exact number is not available.

The number of tigers in Ranthambore is the highest in the state which also means that the tigers keep venturing out of the reserve to look for territory. “The letter to the Warden is essentially centered on the issue of T-108, there is also a suggestion that in it regarding possible relocation of the tigers as they are venturing out of the reserve too often,” added Parashar. The number of tigers in Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR) has increased to the point that the reserve can no longer sustain the big cats that are currently inhabiting the area.

117,['1/03/2020'],HC slams police over pending probe,"Allahabad: Observing that even in cases of serious crime, senior police officials have failed to intervene in long-pending investigations, Allahabad High Court on Saturday directed the state’s director general of police and superintendent of police, Kannauj to appear before the court on March 5.

The court directed them to file a chart showing pendency in probe in cases registered across the state over one year. Further, “they will explain whether they have taken appropriate action against lax investigating officers, and if not, cite reasons”, the court added. Hearing a petition filed by one Dharmpal Singh of Kannauj, a division bench comprising Justice Sudhir Agarwal and Justice Rajeev Mishra directed that both DGP and SP, Kannauj, will file their personal affidavits by the next hearing. In the present case, the petitioner said, police investigation was not being done fairly and the accused had not been arrested so far, though the case was registered on July 22, 2018 under section 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and other sections of IPC at Vishnugarh police station in Kannauj district.

After reading the supplementary counter affidavit (reply) filed on behalf of the state government, the court came down heavily on the police administration, observing, “A perusal shows that, in fact, nothing has been done in the matter though FIR was registered on July 22, 2018. It is surprising that in such a serious matter involving offence under section 302 (murder) of IPC, investigation has not proceeded at all and senior officers have also not taken care to ensure proper investigation. In our view, all officers, including superintendent of police, Kannauj as also director general of police, UP, Lucknow are responsible for inaction since they are supposed to supervise and ensure that subordinate officers are working properly.”

120,['1/03/2020'],NU denies info on reval refund again,"Nagpur: Denial of information regarding decision to refund of revaluation fee in case of change in result has laid bare Nagpur University (NU) claim of allegedly running the scheme for the last five years. This is also second instance ahead of March 6 Senate meeting when a member’s request for tabling information on NU’s financial affairs in the house has been rejected.

Soon after taking charge, vice chancellor SP Kane had announced the scheme of revaluation refund to students in case their marks changed after the process. The ambitions plan gave hope to several bright students who are often at the receiving end of lethargic assessment by NU examiners and forced to pay the additional cost.

The revaluation refund, a dream project of vice-chancellor SP Kane, hasn’t seen light of the day even as little over a month remains for his tenure to end.

In view of the upcoming senate meeting, member Manmohan Bajpai submitted questions related to revaluation among others to be put up before the house. On February 20, the NU officials wrote back to Bajpai stating that the information can't be provided as per common statute issued by the state higher and technical education department last year.

On the same day, the NU had written to another senate member Sarita Nimbarte refusing to give information regarding expenses incurred on registrar post advertisements, revaluation claims, etc.

“This makes it amply clear the university never took a decision to refund the revaluation fee,” Bajpai said. He added there was nothing confidential, under consideration, or a requiring a laborious task for officials to compile the information.

On Nov 15, 2019, TOI had highlighted how NU owes around an estimated Rs52.83lakh to students of a single semester of six different courses who had failed during the Summer 2019 examination but cleared the paper after applying for revaluation.

Though Kane had announced the refund in 2015, NU exam section has not refunded a single Rupee to hundreds of students passing in revaluation in over 1,000 exams. The exam section is already under scanner for charging hefty fine from students as exam late fee without issuing receipts.

Kane didn’t answer TOI’s calls. Earlier, he had said that every eligible student will get refund if they apply and that the account number column will be added in the revaluation form.

In his queries, Bajpai asked did NU take any decision regarding refund of revaluation fee; when was the decision taken; how many students who cleared in reassessment were refunded; how many qualified students applied for refund of revaluation fee; Till date, how many students were refunded the amount.

Among her questions, Nimbarte had asked how many revaluation fee refund claims were received in last five years.

Talking to mediapersons, Devananda’s mother Dhanya said it was within a few minutes since she last saw Devananda that she went missing from the house. Her father Pradeepkumar said he was waiting for the detailed autopsy report.

Thiruvananthapuram Medical College Hospital’s initial report made available said the death was caused by drowning.

However, local people and Devananda’s grandparents strongly rejected this theory.

Devananda’s grandfather Mohanan Pillai said the girl had never gone to the riverside either with the parents or alone. He also pointed out that there was no chance for the girl to reach the spot where the body was found.

“The child wouldn’t even visit the neighbouring houses alone. She would invite children to our house to play with them,” he said.

It was at 10.30am on Thursday that Devananda went missing. As the house is on the banks of Ithikkara river’s tributary, search operations were held throughout the day in the river on the apprehension that the girl could have been drowned.

At the same time, police had launched statewide vehicle checking suspecting that the girl could be abducted.

However, on Friday morning, the girl’s body was fished out from the river, about 400m away from her house.

Following the postmortem, the body was brought to Pradeep’s house and buried at the house premises at Kudavattoor on Friday evening.

SIT to probe case

A special investigation team led by Chathannur ACP George Koshy is probing the case. City police commissioner T Narayanan had stated that they would probe all aspects related to the case.

However, the fact that the police sniffer dog had run-up to a deserted house in the neighbourhood is raising suspicion. The dog also had reached the spot where the girl’s body was found.

The inquest report and the initial postmortem report, which was released on Friday, had not mentioned any bruises on the body or any signs of a struggle.

These three widespread and hugely numerous species, which feed on the carcasses of treated cattle, are now listed as Critically Endangered by IUCN.”The CMS-COP has recommended that to address the impact of diclofenac, the surveillance in the high-risk areas must be increased and the government should raise awareness on alternative to diclofenac.The paper, which was discussed during the CMS-COP, states that poisoned baits are used as means to harvest water birds for consumption. A study in Kenya found use of carbofuran (Furadan) baits resulting in poisoning of over 8,000 birds.“Rodenticides used in agricultural, industrial and domestic rodent control campaigns, result in improper use or disposal of rodent carcasses, causing unintentional mortality to wildlife,” mentioned the study.According to the paper, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) remain a concern in some areas.

Speaker C P Joshi was also present during the seminar at the assembly building.

“In my view, under the given circumstances, there could be no better forum than the speaker. The change required is disposal of such petitions under a stipulated time period,” Singh said.

Meanwhile, Mishra said, ""The biggest question today is that speakers who are themselves members of a party, should they decide on the disqualification of MLAs and MPs?The alternative could be that they must rise above the political ideologies and give impartial judgment in such cases. The deadline for deciding on petitions with regard to defections by must be set so that the termination of membership could be done soon and the erring member remainsdeprived of the membership of the legislature for a longer period of time."" tnn

The council’s decision came after talks between the university administration and council representatives on Saturday failed to resolve the issues raised by the students.

“Unfortunately, despite the assurances given amidst all the turmoil of police action and detention (on Wednesday), the administration miserably failed to address any of our concerns. The very short meeting today (February 28), which did not witness the presence of all committee members, saw a display of utter arrogance from the administration. They were rigidly sticking to their previous proposals and baseless justifications. Since the meeting concluded on an unlawful note, the students’ council has decided to intensify the strike,” council president Parichay Yadav said.

The council said from the midnight, five students, including two council members, will begin an indefinite hunger strike at the administration block to fight the ‘sheer indifference of the administration’.

The university said the hike in fees for most of the courses was between 25% and 50%, while the students’ council furnished old and revised fees structures and pointed out that the hike in fees for the most sought-after courses were more than 100%.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Former PWD minister and IUML MLA V K Ebrahim Kunju was interrogated by the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau ( VACB ) sleuths on Saturday.

The interrogation was in connection with the corruption in the construction of Palarivattom flyover. The questioning began at 11am and went on for almost three hours. The vigilance has quized Kunju three times in connection with the case, but the agency has not received any evidence strong enough to arraign Kunju in the list of accused.

Sources in the vigilance said that till now he has cooperated with the vigilance in the probe and will continue to do so. He is learnt to have remained in his earlier stand that except sanctioning the recommendation to release mobilization advance to the company that constructed the flyover, based on the recommendation by the section assistant to the department secretary, there was no mala-fide action from his part.

The government had earlier sought clearance from the governor for prosecuting Kunju in connection with granting advance funds for the RDS projects, the contractor company for constructing the flyover.

Vigilance also had confiscated the file in which he had given his clearance for releasing the funds. The files regarding the clearance of funds had shown that Kunju had given clearance for releasing Rs 8.5 crore to the company for the project.

Kunju had taken a position that as the minister of the department, there was nothing unusual on his part in giving clearance as all those who are involved in handling the concerned file from the secretariat assistant to the department secretary had not objected to the request for releasing the funds.

Former PWD secretary T O Sooraj had given a statement against Kunju with regards to the release of funds. He had said that the funds were released upon the clearance from the minister. However, vigilance sources said that the agency is still in the process of examining the matter in detail and collecting evidence against the former minister.

Meanwhile, assembly speaker P Sreeramakkrishnan said that he has not received any communication from the vigilance regarding action against Kunju.

“Our world changed dramatically in October, 2013, when the bullet-ridden body of Ayush was brought home. But, Aquil’s criminal background and political connection could not deter my father. After performing the last rites, he walked into Thakurganj police station and lodged an FIR against Aquil,” said Suneet.

“Then too, a crowd led by a MLA gathered at the police station to oppose the FIR, but my father was unfazed. When cops delayed filing the chargesheet, he collected evidence and handed them over to investigation officer. Finally, trial began after three years, but the accused changed lawyers and sought more time. Imagine, it took 10 hearings over a year to record the statement of one eye-witness,” Suneet recalled.

Kanpur: In yet another setback to Kanpur’s leather industry, all tanneries of Jajmau area were once again closed for an indefinite period on Friday.

This time, however, the tanneries were not at fault and the closure was ordered following a damage to common header of the line which carries treated water from common effluent treatment plant (CETP) and sewage treatment plant (STP) to irrigation channel.

Common header of the line is the point from where treated water from tanneries and STP is forwarded for irrigation purposes.

The agency concerned has started repair work and district administration has been informed about it.

District magistrate Brahmadev Ram Tiwari ordered closure of all tanneries with immediate effect which was implemented by Regional Pollution Control Board (RPCB).

The tanneries will reopen as soon as the damaged line is repaired. According to Jal Nigam sources, work on deep sewer line project was on at Pyondi village in Jajmau area for last two weeks.

On Friday, a common header line was damaged when an earth-mover was carrying out work. Jal Nigam officials closed the channel carrying water from treatment plant and started repair work.

As part of alternate arrangement, water coming from treatment plant has been diverted towards Airforce nullah from when it is getting into the Ganga.

Subsequently, it was decided to close the tanneries till further order and repair work on the damaged line was carried out.

Talking to TOI, RPCB officer Dr SB Franklin said he came to know about the incident around Friday noon when he received a photograph on his mobile phone. Later, the district magistrate informed him about the incident. “Tanneries have been closed as a precautionary measure so that effluent does not find its way into the river,” he said.

Executive engineer (zone -2) of municipal corporation SK Singh said, “The channel was damaged during digging work by Jal Nigam. The flow of channel has been diverted and repair work has commenced.”

The State Pollution Control Board had, on February 19, ordered opening of all 256 tanneries after the closure of over three months.

After working for 10 days, the tanneries had to be closed again. Tannery owners have assured the district administration and Regional Pollution Control Board that they would not go in for wet tanning till repair work of channel is complete.

The woman, who was injured after allegedly being assaulted by her husband, then turned to senior cops supervising the conversation and told them that cops are helping her husband. The IO was sent to lines and a probe was ordered against him.

Case 2: Sub-inspector Pramod Kumar was speechless when Humara Khatoon (45) asked him why he has not taken any action against the biker who hit and killed her husband Shoaib Khan (47) in September last year. Khan had gone to buy birthday cake for hisdaughter when the incident happened. The cop was sent to lines and a probe was ordered for laxity.

Lucknow: In a role reversal, cops at police lines were on Saturday interrogated by complainants whose cases they have been probing for quite some time.

The occasion was ‘ Jan Sunwai : Amne-Samne’ (Public hearing: Face to Face) – a platform where investigating officers were made to sit before complainants and reply to their queries under the watchful eyes of senior officers.

An open space at Reserve Police Lines was converted into “interrogation room” where 48 victims, who had lodged complaints of police inaction at Integrated Grievances Redressal System, were called for the exercise meant to make cops accountable to people. Most cases were pending for last 4-5 months.

A 22-year-old woman from Banthra alleged she was sexually molested by local strongmen inside her house, but cops did not lodge an FIR under the pressure of goons. Senior officials pulled up the investigating officer and directed him to immediately lodge an FIR.

The tone was set from the very beginning of the programme when some of the cops, who were busy with their mobile phones instead of paying attention to proceedings, were pulled up. “Three DCPs sitting in the front row must stop using their phones. If they are not paying attention now, how would they focus on resolving issues later,” asked joint commissioner of police (law and order), Naveen Arora over the microphone.

Commissioner of police Sujeet Pandey said, “We found laxity on the part of cops in three cases. We have sent them to lines and have ordered a probe. The hearing will be held every Saturday. We plan to take up 400 cases every month.”

150,['1/03/2020'],"Army factory shut, 3k workers sent on leave after leopard spotted on campus","Bareilly: The ordnance clothing factory (OCF) in Shahjahanpur Cantonment temporarily shut operations on Saturday after a leopard was spotted in the premises. The big cat was initially spotted by security guards late on Friday night and later, its presence was confirmed by CCTV cameras installed on the factory campus. The OCF makes uniforms for the Indian Army.

Forest department was informed and officials placed a cage with a bait on the sprawling campus spread across 100 acres to capture the leopard. Foresters have also sought help of the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) and installed eight camera traps to monitor the leopard’s movement. Besides, permission has been sought from higher authorities to tranquillize the big cat, if needed.

Nearly 3,000 employees at OCF Shahjahanpur unit were sent on leave after the leopard was spotted near the blanket manufacturing unit. An employee on the night shift captured a few pictures. Anurag Yadav, public relationship officer, OCF, said, “The leopard was spotted on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday. After the night shift ended, work was called off on Saturday to ensure the safety of the employees. Forest department has deployed its personnel to capture the animal.”

It is not clear how the leopard strayed into the cantt area as the nearest forest, Khuthar range, is about 50 km from there. At the same time, the area’s green cover and presence of prey like stray cattle, dogs and nilgai provide the big cat an ideal habitat.

Last year in September, a leopard was spotted near Kendriya Vidyalaya school on several occasions. The forest department attempts to capture it failed and the animal disappeared after some time.

Now, MN Singh, sub divisional officer, believes that the factory leopard is the same as the one sighted near the school. “It seems it accidentally entered the factory premises. We have found its pugmarks and CCTV cameras also confirmed its presence. We are combing in the area and taking necessary action to ensure that it doesn’t harm anyone.”

Daksh Gangwar from WTI told TOI, “We have placed a cage on the campus and installed motion sensor camera traps to monitor the movement of the leopard. This animal is quite clever and had stayed away from the cage when we tried to capture it last year.”

Later, some of them shared their heart-wrenching experiences and how the centre has brought a positive change in their lives. Meera Chavan, ward officer of Zone 6, along with other civic staff, was present for the celebration.

The waste pickers, who were earlier working in unsafe and unhygienic conditions, have experienced a transformation in working environment at the centre. They make a living by selling the waste segregated by them and are provided stock of monthly groceries by the centre.

A day care established at the centre provides care for the children of women working at the centre.

153,['1/03/2020'],"Revenue staff, cops take over Theerthapada Mandapam land","Revenue officials seal Theerthapada Mandapam after taking over 65 cents on Saturday

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Armed with a late-evening order issued by revenue principal secretary , a team of revenue officials and police took over the 65 cents on which Theerthapada Mandapam is situated at East Fort on Saturday night. The move triggered late night protest by BJP and RSS workers , led by O Rajagopal MLA and former district president S Suresh .

The move of the government has political overtones as Sri Vidhyadhiraja Trust, which possesses the 65 cents that had been a big pond (Pathrakulam) in the past, has plans to construct a Chattambi Swami memorial at the site. The foundation stone it was scheduled to be laid on March 10. The trust has invited CM Pinarayi Vijayan to lay the foundation stone for the memorial which will comprise a convention centre, temple and meditation hall.

The order issued by revenue principal secretary V Venu also cancelled the earlier order issued in 1976 which assigned 65 cents to Sri Vidyadhiraja Sabha. However, the government acknowledged the existence of a Chattambi Swami temple on the land and said the government will consider assignment of land where temple of Chattambi Swamy is located if the trust files a fresh application for that parcel of land.

The order directed that the land being resumed shall be used for waterlogging mitigation measures for Thampanoor and East Fort after a technical study. The revival of Pathrakulam was one of the suggestions mooted by experts who had tried to find solution for flash floods happening in Thampanoor and East Fort regions.

Noting that there is an ongoing litigation regarding the ownership of the land between Travancore royal family and the state government, the order said if Supreme Court issued an order in contravention to government order, the government would reconsider it.

The government had in 2019 issued an order which directed district collector to resume the land and use it for public purposes cites relevant sections under land assignment rules and vigilance report against former chief secretary and founder and patron of the trust R Ramachandran Nair.

The trust moved high court against the order and the court directed the state government to conduct hearing of parties. The new order was issued after conducting hearing and verifying the documents submitted. The revenue department found that Vidyadhiraja Trust only paid 50% of the land value fixed during the assignment and the process of transfer of registry of the property got delayed following the non-payment of the remaining amount. The non-payment amounted to violation of original contract and hence the government could resume the land, the order stated.

Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game had presented the draft budget to the panel on Tuesday with an outlay of Rs 2,161.79 crore.

Members of the standing committee discussed the details of the draft and after incorporating some new projects, the panel gave its approval to the budget on Saturday. The draft budget will be tabled before the general body soon for its approval.

Standing committee chairman Uddhav Nimse said that the panel had decided to include projects like the new boat club, textile market among other works.

“Both the new boat club and the textile market will be developed under a public private partnership model in the city,” said Nimse.

The proposed boat club will be operational in the stretch from Ahilyabai Holkar bridge to Anandvalli.

“The hyacinth and silt in the Godavari river will be removed before the boat club starts functioning. It will help boost tourism in the city,” he said.

The standing committee has also proposed to establish a textile market on the premises of the truck terminal at Adgaon over 45 acres.

“The market will be developed on a 20-acre plot lying vacant on the premises of the truck terminus. Many people from Nashik and the adjoining districts travel to the textile markets in Surat to buy sarees and garments, especially for occasions like weddings. Once the textile market comes up in the city, people will no longer need to travel all the way to Surat,” said the chairman.

The panel has also proposed two new units to make fertilisers from wet garbage on a pilot basis. While one unit has been proposed in the Panchavati area, the second one would be set up on any other location where land is available.

The standing committee has proposed to develop a new ground at Nilgiri Bag in the Panchavati division of the city. The ground is to be developed over 36 acres, in line with the Pragati ground. All sports and other activities will be conducted here.

The committee has also decided to develop five civic schools into smart schools and make them at par with international English-medium private schools.

The panel has also proposed setting up of more public toilets for women, especially in the market areas and bus terminals.

The standing committee has directed the civic administration to use Rs 250 crore remaining from the budget of the previous fiscal for various development works. This amount was earmarked for land acquisition. However, the state urban development department has put a hold on the civic administration from acquiring any land. “The civic administration can utilise the amount left unused in the previous fiscal for various development works in different wards,” said Nimse.

Kanpur: The work of Kanpur Metro project is going on at a fast pace ever since it started in November 15 last year. The Metro engineers would erect a first pier (pillar) cap on Monday. This pier cap would form the base for placing girders in near future.

This pier cap would be erected on pillar number 19 to be constructed between IIT-Kanpur and the National Sugar Institute. Once the pier cap is erected, it would look like a T-shaped structure over which the girder would be placed.

Till Friday, 10 pier caps had been cast. Also, 42 piers (pillars) were constructed and 24 U-girders had also been cast. After the pier cap is erected, the work of Kanpur Metro would enter into the next phase, said a Metro official.

Lucknow: The cracks in Lal Baradari on Lucknow University campus have widened following rains in January further endangering the iconic building.

“The building is crumbling as wild vegetation is damaging the plaster and bricks. The Lakhauri bricks are dropping like dry leaves,” said a faculty of ancient Indian history and archaeology department.

After seeing the photographs of the crumbling structure, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) superintendent Manoj Saxena said the wall cracks needs to be stitched (a restoration technique of weaving in stones) immediately. “The rise in moisture in walls after spells of rain and sunshine create pressure which can lead to their collapse. If LU requests ASI director-general for restoration, we can take a call after inspection,” he added.

In January, LU had appealed state government to help save the heritage. “We want to renovate the building and have also appealed to alumni for aid,” said LU spokesperson Durgesh Srivastava.

The foundation of Lal Baradari, the only red stone building on campus, was laid by Nawab Ghaziuddin Haider Shah in 1814, Lucknow chronicler Yogesh Praveen told TOI.

The building which housed a bank, cafetaria was evacuated in 2015 after vaulted roof of a hall collapsed.

157,['1/03/2020'],AMC’s temporary pipeline fixes waste water,"Aurangabad: Residents and activists have demanded a permanent fix to the malfunctioning pipeline joint at Avishkar Chowk in Cidco N-5 . Many alleged that frequent malfunctions in the pipeline impact water supply to the area.

On Monday, after the pipeline joint at Avishkar Chowk broke, water supply to Cidco N-5, N-6 and N-8 was completely disrupted. Residents received water supply after a delay of 16 to 18 hours.

This disruption in supply due to pipeline damage is not new. The pipeline had broken at the exact same spot two months ago. The disruption led to a water supply crisis for residents of Gulmohar Colony, Avishkar Colony, Mathura Nagar and the Ganesh Nagar wards of Cidco N-5, N-6 and N-8.

Civic activist Ashok Virkar said the pipeline disruption has been a problem for many years now. “Every time there is a malfunction of the pipeline, the AMC digs up the spot (which is along a busy market road) and thousands of litres of water get wasted. The AMC should put in place a permanent solution to the problem,” Virkar said.

The AMC has also failed to ensure barricades and warning signs are in place before works start. Three days after repairs started this week, the dig site was left unguarded — putting lives of motorists and pedestrians in jeopardy.

According AMC junior engineer at Cidco N-5 ESR, there is a heavy load on the joint as the water supplied to Cidco N-5, N-6 and N-8 passes through it. “We have fixed the line for now. The pit made for the repair will be filled and road will be restored. The water tank at Cidco N-8 is filled through this line that is why it has a pressure on it,” he said.

The AMC has carried out the repairs through maintenance funds that have been reserved for water supply. The water works department engineer said the civic body will need at least Rs 3 crore to implement a permanent solution along the entire line.

158,['1/03/2020'],Tests find presence of formalin in seafood sold in Karimedu market,"Madurai: A spot test conducted at the Karimedu market in the city has revealed the usage of formalin to preserve seafood brought from states like Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. Around two tonne of seafood was destroyed as it was found unsafe for consumption.

A team of 15 officials from the food safety department led by designated officer Dr M Somasundaram conducted the test at the fish market with the help of lab analysts. The check, which began late on Friday night, lasted till the early hours of Saturday. The tests confirmed the presence of formalin in fish, prawns and crab.

Somasundaram said that ice supplied by factories nearby and the salt used in the process also tested positive for formalin. Samples drawn from seafood, ice and salt were sent for detailed analysis.

Food safety officials said they have been planning the check for at least two weeks. A screening was done in the market by a team of officials last week. Kits required for on the spot test were provided by an NABL accredited private laboratory based in Kalavasal.

Officials said that they checked all varieties of seafood and fresh water fish.

Karimedu is the biggest fish market in the city, from where seafood is distributed to various parts of Madurai and neighbouring districts.

Formalin, derived from formaldehyde, is commonly used by mortuaries to preserve bodies to prevent them from decaying. Fish traders sometimes illegally use it as a preservative, especially while transporting it to other states.

Food safety officials said that formalin can cause nausea, coughing and burning sensation in the eyes, nose and throat.

While they are short term issues, it can even cause cancer if consumed over a long period of time. In order to keep the fish fresh, it has to be maintained at less than 5 degrees Celsius. Formalin is mixed to increase shelf life.

159,['1/03/2020'],Colva beach works await central funds,"Panaji: Though the Union ministry of tourism selected Colva beach under its ‘Iconic Tourist Sites Development Project’, the development of this popular coastal stretch in South Goa may be delayed as the ministry is yet to release funds.

Colva was the only beach among 11 other tourists destinations across the country selected under the scheme in August 2018.

Tourism secretary J Ashok Kumar said development works planned for Colva under the Centre’s Swadesh Darshan scheme are executed, but works planned under the Iconic Tourist Sites Development project are yet to commence.

Employment generation, development of local culture and occupations, beautification, infrastructure, provision of facilities and public amenities are some of the key objectives of the initiative. The development plan for Colva has been finalised after consulting locals and stakeholders.

The project raised the hopes of tourism stakeholders as it meant that the beach, which hardly has any facilities for tourists, will see some development.

In recent years, the flow of domestic tourists to Colva has increased, but there are barely any facilities for the visitors. Colva Creek continues to be polluted with increased footfall and commercial activities along the beach. “People treat it as a dustbin and release all kind of waste. Hotels release their sewage into it while panchayat has hardly any control over it,” said a stakeholder.

He said the beach is relatively clean because of beach cleaning by the tourism department, but the panchayat has to ensure that people don’t throw waste along the periphery of the beach, which remains uncollected and sometimes stuck in vegetations.

In 2015, a watchtower planned for the beach as part of the Colva coastal circuit development had to be dropped, after it was challenged in NGT for being within 200m CRZ.

160,['1/03/2020'],Activists caution on perils of fishing nets,"Hyderabad: Animal activists in the city reached out to the forest department and asked them to take measures about the dangers of ghost nets and other fishing gear in city lakes.

An appeal has been made after a team of activists recently fished out huge quantities of fishing gear from Osman Sagar lake recently. “We have been conducting regular clean-up drives in the lakes and despite that the birds, which depend on these water bodies, are being threatened and killed,” said Pradeep Nair, founder of Animal Warriors India (AWI).

AWI has recently formed a search party to find a bird, a spoonbill, which was spotted with a plastic rope from a fishing net tangled around its beak at Osman Sagar.

“Our team tried to capture the bird and remove the plastic rope from its beak but we were not able to capture it as some parts of the lake are not accessible. We have appealed to the forest department asking them to write to the concerned authorities to take measures about the unattended fishing gear,” said Nair.

Apart from appealing to the foresters, the activists are also conducting awareness drives with the fishing community and organising regular clean-up drives to clean up the city’s lakes. One such drive has been planned at Osman Sagar on Sunday. Forest department official A Shankaran said, “We will write to concerned authority to take measures and educate the fishing community.”

161,['1/03/2020'],"Man molests girl in Bassi, arrested","Jaipur: A 52-year-old man was arrested in Bassi police station area for attempting to rape a minor girl on Saturday. The accused called the girl to his house and molested her but ran away when he thought he was going to get caught. He was arrested after the girl told her parents about the incident. The girl is six-year-old.

Shiv Kumar Bhardwaj, SHO, Bassi police station told TOI, “The child’s parents work as labourers and when they were out for work , the accused who stayed in the same neighbourhood, called the girl to his house and molested her. When he thought someone was coming inside the house, he left the girl and fled from there.”

According to officials, if the accused had not heard a sound which made him scared of getting caught, there are chances that he would have assaulted the girl further

After this, the girl went back to her house and when the parents returned, she did not inform them immediately about the assault and the official said, “The child was hesitant in telling her parents but finally told them about the attempt to rape after which they registered a complaint with us.”

The cops immediately started an investigation and launched a search for the accused. “We took swift action and our teams started looking for the accused. We arrested him soon after the case was registered. We are questioning him and he is currently in police remand. Targeting such a young child is very serious matter and we caught him before he could get out of the area,” said the official.

A case under POCSO act was registered against the accused.

VADODARA: At least 10 persons have been rounded up on Saturday for interrogation with regard to spreading rumours on the replacement of CCTV cameras in the city.

An offence was registered against unidentified persons at Cyber Crime police station in city on Friday for spreading rumours and causing panic among citizens.

Police had to later clarify that the cameras installed by a cable television distribution company had become defunct, which were being replaced by new cameras under the Smart City project.

Police officials said that the new cameras are of advanced technology as these will have features like night vision, high-definition, motion capture among others. Installation work of 350 cameras began on Saturday. Later 750 more cameras of similar technology will be installed.

“We have picked up eight to 10 people for questioning and three teams have also been formed for surveillance of social media and tracking down the original source of message that had spread the rumour,” said deputy commissioner of police Jaydeepsinh Jadeja.

Police sources said that the unprecedented violence in the national capital as well as in Khambhat has already spread panic among the citizens.

That is why law keepers are making efforts to contain all sort of rumours which can lead to any untoward incident in the city.

Besides keeping a tab on social media, foot patrolling was also held in different areas of the city on Saturday evening.

On Friday, panic was triggered by the rumour mills spreading false messages on social media that the cameras were being ‘removed’ ahead of a “Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) support rally” in the city.

An FIR has been filed against the woman by officials of Child Welfare Committee (CWC) of Krishna district, who have asked the police to investigate the matter and file a case under the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986.

Child Welfare Committee chairman BVS Kumar said the two siblings, aged 12 years and 11 years, were studying at a child care institute in a village under Nuzvid mandal of Krishna district. “Their mother took them to their village during the Sankranti holidays, but the girls did not return even after the vacation ended. The child care centre authorities tried to contact the mother. After failing to reach her, they lodged a missing complaint with the Nuzvid rural police,” Kumar said.

The police traced the missing girls to Hyderabad and sent them back to the child care centre, who then informed the welfare committee.

During their interaction with CWC officials, the girls said they were employed for domestic work at the woman’s house. Based on the siblings’ statement, CWC directed Nuzvid rural cops to probe the matter and book the woman under the Child Labour Act.

164,['1/03/2020'],"Lucknow: For them, being born on Feb 29 means extra special birthdays","<p>Aishwarya Thapar<br></p>

LUCKNOW: Akshata Kukreja celebrated her seventh birthday on Saturday, 28 years after she was born. Puzzled? Well, you’re not the only one. The Lucknow-based businesswoman became used to the flummoxed looks she got whenever she told people about this strange fact. Her reason: she was born on February 29 and gets to celebrate her birthday every four years.

There are many like Kukreja in the city on February 29 and for them birthdays aren’t an annual ritual, but a quadrennial one. “This year I’ll be blowing out seven candles, instead of 28. I attend my friends’ birthday parties every year, but get to throw one of my own once in every four years,” she added.

“I usually celebrate my birthday on February 28 and that is when most people send in their wishes. My five-year-old son says I am still a child who is celebrating her birthday. At the same time, my birthdays are extra special because they come once in four years,” added Akshata.

For 24-year-old Parth Mishra being born on a leap day means exciting birthday gifts. “On my last birthday, my parents gifted me a laptop and a PlayStation on the one before that. This year’s gift is still a surprise,” he said.

According to Mishra, one of the perks of being born on such a unique day is that nobody forgets his birthday.

Then there are many ‘leap day babies’ or ‘leapsters’ who consider the unique date as a way to stay forever young. “I tell people I have just entered my teens and have years to act like a mature woman,” said LDA Colony resident Evon Francis, who celebrated her 60th birthday on Saturday.

“A leap year birthday gives you a license to take your time while growing up,” she added.

Another Lucknow resident Aishwarya Thapar , who turned 28 on Saturday, said that having a unique birthday has its share of problems.

“When I was applying for a driver’s license at 18, officials wrote my birth date as February 28. I insisted on having my real date of birth registered in records, but they changed it,” said the marketing consultant.

165,['1/03/2020'],Will contest on all 115 seats in AMC polls alone: VBA,"Aurangabad: The Vanchit Bahujan Aghadhi (VBA) that was associated with the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) in the Lok Sabha elections for winning the Aurangabad seat has made it clear that it will contest the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) polls without any alliance.

While the MIM had left the door open for a possible alliance, the VBA, during a press conference held on Saturday, said that it will contest on all 115 seats of the civic body all by itself.

Office-bearers of the VBA, including state general secretary Kishan Chavan, Nomadic Tribes (NT) organiser from Jamkhed Arun Jadhav and Aurangabad and Jalna districts’ observer Nitin Sonwane attended the press conference.

The VBA office-bearers were asked about the party’s plans and strategy in the wake of the forthcoming civic body polls. Responding to this, Sonawane said that VBA will not form an alliance with any party for the AMC elections and will contest on 115 seats on its strength. He also said that the party has already begun preparations for the same.

“A three-member planning committee has been appointed by VBA chief Babasaheb Ambedkar. The committee will soon announce dates and conduct interviews for the candidates who aspire to contest elections with VBA ticket,” Sonawane said. He said that so far 300 to 350 people have expressed interest to contest the elections with VBA ticket. He said that Ambedkar has given strict directives that there will be no alliance with any party either in AMC polls or in Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) polls.

Notably, the VBA-MIM alliance in 2019 Lok Sabha elections resulted in its only win in Aurangabad. Subsequently, differences had cropped up between the two parties and they separately contested the 2019 state assembly elections. However, VBA could not manage to bag any seat in the assembly polls.

166,['1/03/2020'],"Army factory shut, 3k workers sent on leave after leopard spotted on campus","Bareilly: The ordnance clothing factory (OCF) in Shahjahanpur Cantonment temporarily shut operations on Saturday after a leopard was spotted in the premises. The big cat was initially spotted by security guards late on Friday night and later, its presence was confirmed by CCTV cameras installed on the factory campus. The OCF makes uniforms for the Indian Army.

Forest department was informed and officials placed a cage with a bait on the sprawling campus spread across 100 acres to capture the leopard. Foresters have also sought help of the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) and installed eight camera traps to monitor the leopard’s movement. Besides, permission has been sought from higher authorities to tranquillize the big cat, if needed.

Nearly 3,000 employees at OCF Shahjahanpur unit were sent on leave after the leopard was spotted near the blanket manufacturing unit. An employee on the night shift captured a few pictures. Anurag Yadav, public relationship officer, OCF, said, “The leopard was spotted on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday. After the night shift ended, work was called off on Saturday to ensure the safety of the employees. Forest department has deployed its personnel to capture the animal.”

It is not clear how the leopard strayed into the cantt area as the nearest forest, Khuthar range, is about 50 km from there. At the same time, the area’s green cover and presence of prey like stray cattle, dogs and nilgai provide the big cat an ideal habitat.

Last year in September, a leopard was spotted near Kendriya Vidyalaya school on several occasions. The forest department attempts to capture it failed and the animal disappeared after some time.

Now, MN Singh, sub divisional officer, believes that the factory leopard is the same as the one sighted near the school. “It seems it accidentally entered the factory premises. We have found its pugmarks and CCTV cameras also confirmed its presence. We are combing in the area and taking necessary action to ensure that it doesn’t harm anyone.”

Daksh Gangwar from WTI told TOI, “We have placed a cage on the campus and installed motion sensor camera traps to monitor the movement of the leopard. This animal is quite clever and had stayed away from the cage when we tried to capture it last year.”

171,['1/03/2020'],Waste collection agency dumps debris instead of garbage,"Aurangabad: Three corporators of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), along with the residents of the Padegaon area, caught the garbage collection agency red-handed while it was dumping construction debris instead of garbage at the Padegaon waste facility on Saturday.

The agency is paid on the basis of per tonne of waste collected and transported. In December, TOI had highlighted the unusual increase in the quantity of waste collected by the agency.

On Saturday morning, corporators Raosaheb Amle (Mitmita), Asha Nikalje (Bhimnagar North) and Subhash Shejwal (Padegaon), along with some residents, found two trucks consisting of construction debris and moorum (soil) brought in by the waste collection agency to be dumped at Padegaon dumping site.

According to Amle, they had raised the issue of malpractices by waste collection agency with the municipal commissioner in the past; however, no action was taken due to lack of evidence. “Now, since we have caught the agency staff dumping construction debris and moorum, we request the municipal commissioner to register an offence against the agency,” Amle said.

Amle said that the AMC should check the maximum amount of waste the vehicles can contain and, based on that, they should tally it with the weight of waste recorded by the agency. “This practice is not new as one can see the Padegaon waste filled with moorum, stones and bricks. We appeal to the municipal commissioner to make payment to the agency only after deducting the debris from the waste,” Amle said.

The waste-carrying trucks were then taken to the AMC office where they were emptied in the compound in the presence of mayor Nandkumar Ghodele and municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey.

Responding to the allegations made by the corporators, Pandey said that a committee has been formed to probe the matter. “Action will be taken based on the panel’s report. The previous records will be checked,” he said.

Biomedical waste rules violated

In an alarming revelation, the waste collection agency appointed by the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) was also found to be dumping tonnes of biomedical waste (BMW) or hospital waste containing syringes, bandages, dressings, used gloves and medicines at the Padegaon waste dumping facility. According to the Biomedical Waste Management Rules 2016, the BMW waste must not be mixed with solid waste and should be treated separately. The civic body has appointed a different agency for the purpose.

Later in the afternoon, it was found that the biomedical waste sent to be dumped at the Padegaon facility was collected from the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). Subsequently, GMCH dean Kanan Yelikar and other officials were called by the AMC and directions were issued to them to comply with the BMW rules 2016.

173,['1/03/2020'],Thiruvananthapuram: Businessman held for forging documents to inherit shopping complex,"Baiju Vasanth

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Fort police have arrested a prominent businessman in the city on charges of committing fraud to snatch ancestral property from his siblings. The police identified the accused as Baiju Vasanth , a resident of Artech City Meenakshi apartment complex at Vazhuthacaud . He is the owner of Ponnambalam Steel , a leading steel distributing company. The police have also arrested two document writers (vendors) who aided him in the fraud. They are Chandrakumar of Padasseri near Attukal and Sreekumar of Anayara. Their arrests were recorded at Fort police station here on Saturday.

The police said Baiju and his accomplices were arrested after an investigation into a complaint filed by his own sister, Binu Vasanth. Her complaint was that Baiju allegedly transferred a piece of ancestral property to his daughter’s name through forgery. Baiju is the eldest of three siblings. He has two sisters Binu Vasanth and Bindu Vasanth.

The property in question is a three-storey building opposite to Pazhavangadi Ganapathy Temple at East Fort. The building belonged to their grandmother and she had bequeathed the building to the three grandchildren. The building, which has been rented out to multiple business establishments, is worth at least Rs 5 crore.

Binu, in her complaint, alleged that the documents of the property were under the custody of her father until his death in 2014. Following his death, Baiju secured the custody of the documents, being the elder son. Since Bindu was settled abroad for years, she never cared to enquire about the status of the properties here. Recently, Binu learned that the ownership of the building has been transferred to the name of Baiju daughter following which she filed a complaint before the police.

The police found out in the investigation that Baiju snatched the property by executing an elaborate plan. He first hid the original deed of the property and placed an advertisement on newspapers that it has been lost. Then, he converted all ownership documents at village office and city corporation to his name by providing forged will, showing that he was the original heir of the property. The registration of the property to his daughter was done at Chala sub-registrar office on August 10, 2018.

According to a police officer who was part of the probe, Baiju had employed a meticulous design with the help of two document writers. The property was purchased by Baiju’s grandmother in 1982 from one Velayudhan Nair. When he forged the new document, he posed as the legal heir of Velayudhan Nair as the name of Nair’s son was also Baiju. The documents registered by Baiju’s grandmother in 1982 and later in 1984 to bequeath it to legal heirs were suppressed by Baiju to facilitate his plan.

175,['1/03/2020'],Brand Attingal College to hit food market,"Government College, Attingal, will set up a counter on the campus to sell packaged organic rice powder

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Government College , Attingal , is set to sell packaged organic rice powder by setting up a counter on the college campus. This is a result of an effort spanning several months that turned a piece of barren land on the college campus to a rich paddy field . The harvest festival titled ‘ Kalalaya Kathirolsavam ’ held on Friday was a huge hit.

The NSS unit, students, teachers, other staff members and former students of the college harvested paddy they grew in the land near the college premises. The farming was started in November after teachers and NSS volunteer chipped in for the expenses.

Around 96 cents of barren land near the college was made ready for farming under the leadership of principal V Manikatan Nair and NSS programme officers Sarun S G and K Gopakumar. The students dug up a pond near the field to source water for agriculture. Activities such as planting of saplings were held with the support of Krishi Bhavan at Attingal. In adding to paddy, farming of banana and tapioca too has been started at the campus.

“The result of farming was exciting. Of the total 96 cents of farm land, we got 80kg of rice from just 14 cents. Harvest will be held in other areas in the coming weeks. We are planning to powder the rice and sell it under the brand name of Government College Attingal. We hope organically produced rice will have good demand. We also have vegetables ready for sale. The money will be used to invest in farming,” said principal V Manikantan, who is set to retire by March end.

The principal said he hope that the students will spread farming to more areas. “With the initiative, we are able to make students familiar with our culture of farming. Students themselves water the farm in the morning and evening. By diverting their energy to such productive activities, the college has a peaceful and productive environment,” the principal said. The college has a solar plant, a mini forest, medicinal garden, among others. “The solar plant installed using the fund of Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan has helped the college in reducing power bill from around Rs 4,000 to Rs 400,” the principal said.

Over the weekend, many IT professionals will be seen on stage in plays that boast of an all-techie cast. Promoted by cultural department, the plays will be staged at Ravindra Bharathi and presented by Manch Theatre .

“We are building a bridge between techies and theatre. Over the last four years, we have been roping in IT professionals to showcase their passion on stage,” said Hari Krishna, director, department of culture.

On Saturday, a play ‘Khud Ki Khushi’ was performed in Hindi. The play is about a woman’s struggle at different stages of life and her battle with domestic violence and mental health.

Director Vamsi Ramachandruni, who works with an IT firm, said, “We are great at multi-tasking and what better way to challenge yourself than on stage where there are no retakes, and everything is live.” He says theatre has always been his passion. Miti Shah, one of the actors, says that it is the need to express herself that made her foray into theatre.

On Sunday, Telugu play ‘Bheem’ will be staged. Director Harsha Chakilam, also a techie, said he has been pursuing theatre for six years. The play is based on the life of tribal leader Komaram Bheem. Actor Saikrishna said, “The play will focus on the plight of tribals during their liberation struggle.”

179,['1/03/2020'],Saharanpur shows how to end bitter Sikh-Muslim feud,"MEERUT: Six years after Saharanpur witnessed the worst-ever riots between Muslims and Sikhs over a land dispute, the communally sensitive district has set an example on how to iron out differences and arrive at a solution with representatives of both communities sitting on a table and amicably resolving the matter.

The matter erupted in 2014 when the Sri Guru Singh Sabha Gurdwara committee started constructing an extension to the gurdwara on a plot it had bought. Members of the minority community objected to the move, claiming that a mosque once had once stood at the spot. It triggered one of worst communal clashes on Ambala Road, resulting in three deaths while an entire market was gutted because of arson. More than 200 people were booked.

Both parties went to court after that. However, Wednesday witnessed something unprecedented. While Sikh representatives agreed to buy a plot of land in a minority-dominated area and construct a mosque there, Muslim representatives reciprocated by agreeing to perform kar seva in the expansion plan of the gurdwara committee.

“I lost everything in that riot and suffered a loss of nothing less than a crore. It took years for me to rebuild my life but there was always a fear that the unresolved dispute might flare up again sometime in the future. With this settlement , that fear and uncertainty has been put to rest,” said DS Chawla, owner of an electronic items showroom.

Mohammad Danish Kamal, who lost all his stock to arson and suffered a loss close to Rs 8 lakh at that time, is relieved by the development but with a pinch of salt. “It’s good that the solution has forever killed any possibility of a flare-up in future but I personally feel there should not have been the money angle in this settlement. We have no dearth of mosques in our region. It would have been better if Sikhs were allowed to extend their premises on the land without any resistance,” added Kamal.

Gurpreet Bagga, state unit president, Akali Dal, who initiated the peace process, said, “This bitterness had to end and the only solution that came to my mind was to sit down on the negotiation table and it worked. We approached district and police administration who happily mediated, and after six sittings, Gurdwara Singh Committee proposed to buy a separate land measuring 200 square yards for Muslims in a minority-dominated area and build a mosque in lieu of an agreement on withdrawing of cases from both sides, apart from Muslims abandoning the claim on the land adjacent to the gurdwara.”

Dinesh Kumar P, SSP, Saharanpur, along with former DM Alok Pandey played a constructive role in the settlement, said, “It is indeed a historical development that took place with the constructive role of the district administration, the gurdwara committee and Muslim organizations to bring about peace. Now, we will ensure that both sides keep their word and work in the direction.”

Muharram Ali, representative from Muslim side, said, “This is indeed a positive development and we have agreed to help by offering kar seva to build the extension of the gurdwara for our Sikh brothers.”

Rinku Khalsa, 43, who received a bullet in the stomach during the riots, is quite upbeat. “God has been kind that I lived to see this day and development.”

The trio, who were brought from Sitapur jail, appeared before a local court on Saturday under heavy police security. Khan, who surrendered in a Rampur court on Wednesday and was jailed in a case of forgery, was swiftly shifted to Sitapur prison along with his legislator wife and son on Thursday.

The three had filed an application for surrender in 47 cases registered against them throughout the district.

Outside the court, Azam alleged that he was being mistreated in the jail.

“Though I am a member of the Lok Sabha, I am not receiving any facilities in the prison as per the jail manual. Jail authorities have kept me in a British-era cell where the death penalty prisoners were kept. I don't know why they are treating me like a terrorist,” he said.

Azam claimed that he was served food prepared in jail’s bhandara (kitchen). Asked how he passed his day in jail, Khan said, “I read autobiographies of great freedom fighters. I am currently reading books written on socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia.”

His wife and Rampur MLA Tazeen Fatma was brought in a wheelchair. In the courtroom, she moved towards the judge’s podium and informed him that she was unable to travel long because a recent spinal surgery and produced her medical certificates. Judge Dhirendra Kumar Kamboj nodded and took note of it.

The trio has been jailed for forging two birth certificates of Abdullah Azam, who allegedly also gave a wrong date of birth while filing his nomination for the assembly elections in 2017. Abdullah was elected MLA from Rampur. However, his election was set aside by Allahabad high court in December last year. He has challenged the decision in Supreme Court where trial is pending. On Thursday, the UP Legislative Assembly also disqualified him as a member and declared his seat Suar in Rampur as vacant.

Khan is facing several police cases, including those related to grabbing of land. Authorities claimed certain portions of his Mohammad Ali Jauhar University, established by Khan in 2006, is built on government land. The encroachments were demolished recently.

On July 29 last year, Azam Khan was declared a “land mafia” by the Rampur administrative authorities following a series of cases of land grab against him. The Enforcement Directorate also initiated an inquiry into the alleged money laundering charges related to donations received by Khan’s university from abroad.

Aurangabad: State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil on Saturday raked up the pending demand for renaming Aurangabad as Sambhaji Nagar.

Patil, who was a day-long tour of the city ahead of the civic elections, said technical issues must be addressed by the government to pave way for the renaming. The tomb of Aurangzeb, the last of the strong Mughal emperors, is located in Khuldabad near Aurangabad. The city gets its name from the ruler.

The old demand of renaming Aurangabad has been repeatedly raised by BJP, especially after its former ally Shiv Sena joined hands with Congress-NCP to retain power in Maharashtra. The BJP has also raised the issue during different meetings of the Aurangabad municipal corporation. It has blamed Shiv Sena for not doing enough to rename the city while in power.

Speaking with the media on the sideline of meetings with local BJP workers ahead of upcoming election, Patil said BJP has bright chances in the polls. “If we lead vigorous and organised poll campaign, our party can create wonders in AMC polls. I am personally holding discussions with different party workers to evolve a strategy,” he said.

Criticising the state government, Patil said the law and order in the state has gone for a toss. “Crime against women is on the rise. The farming community is still in distress, despite the much-hyped loan-waiver scheme,” he said.

Scaling up attack on the loan waiver scheme, BJP chief said the state government has withheld the list of beneficiary farmers citing the code of conduct for polls of certain gram panchayats. “Going by the similar logic, the state government must roll back new legislations it has introduced, especially related to election of village-head and Agricultural Produce Market Committees. We have already raised the issue with Maharashtra Governor,” Patil said.

NASHIK: Malhari Batule , a 32-year-old farmer from the Pathardi taluka of Ahmednagar district , allegedly ended his life by consuming poison on Thursday night.

Ironically, the same morning, Batule’s son — a Class III student at a government school — had recited a short poem on the topic of farmers’ suicide on the occasion of Marathi Bhasa Day.

The young boy had highlighted the need for farmers to desist from taking such a harsh step, as it serves no purpose.

The Pathardi police sources said Batule was rushed to a hospital in Ahmednagar city for treatment, but he later succumbed. At present, the police have registered a case of accidental death.

“We think the farmer may have ended his life as he had a substantial amount of loan to repay,” the police sources said.

Police insiders added that the farmer had taken a loan of more than Rs 20 lakh and had bought a truck. Moreover, it was also his responsibility to repay a loan of Rs 8 lakh that his father had taken to buy a tractor.

“As per the initial information that we have, the farmer was facing a financial crisis. He was finding it difficult to repay two loan installments,” police sources said.

As per the rules, the police and the local revenue department would carry out separate probes to ascertain whether the farmer ended his life purely due to agrarian crisis. The reports would be submitted to the district administration panel to asses whether the bereaved family is eligible for monetary compensation from the government.

A pall of gloom had descended on the Bharajwadi village after the villagers came to know of the incident. The deceased farmer is survived by his wife, three children and parents.

187,['1/03/2020'],City feels pinch of packaged water makers’ stir,"Madurai: The indefinite strike by packaged drinking water manufacturers has started affecting Madurai residents with regular suppliers restricting the number of 20 litre cans they can deliver to one at a time.

While only the 72 old wards of the corporation have protected drinking water supply through taps, the remaining 28 wards depend solely on private players to supply potable water.

With summer setting in, the groundwater levels have gone down and salinity of the water has also increased. Since the total dissolved solids (TDS) count in water in many parts of the city is high, many people depend on packaged water for their drinking needs.

There are about 60 registered packaged water manufacturers in Madurai who supply water to about 60,000 houses every day, apart from private firms, offices and even hospitals. ``I didn’t know that the strike was on in Madurai and was shocked when the supplier told me about a short supply and that he could give me only one 20 litre can on Saturday,’’ said S Meenakshi of Anna Nagar. As she uses the water for all her needs including cooking, she bought a 10 litre water can of a specific brand for Rs 50 as a precautionary measure.

Many of the shops which sold packaged drinking water downed shutters on Saturday to avoid people coming in.

“I have a small stock but that is for my regular customers, and that too I am giving only a can per day,’’ said Pandiarajan, who supplies water in Anna Nagar. Suresh, another supplier, said they would have to switch off their phones on Sunday due to the big demand, which they would not be able to meet because of dwindling stocks. A private firm in Chokkikulam asked its employees to bring their own drinking water from home on Saturday due to the cut in number of cans by its supplier on Saturday. “This is a big problem as most of us also depend on the same water for our drinking water needs at home,’’ said K Venkateswari, an office-goer. The high court in a recent order had asked all packaged drinking water units to get NOCs from the PWD, directorate of food safety and administration and directorate of town planning and then apply for clearance from the Tamil Nadu pollution control board to continue operations. This has affected all manufacturers.

R Rajasekharan of Tamil Nadu Packaged Drinking Water Manufacturers Association said there are 1,689 registered manufacturing units in the state out of which only 561 had ground water clearance. “Each district in the state has supplies of about 20 lakh litres of water on an average a day. This has come to a standstill,’’ he said. They could start manufacturing as usual if the government gives them an assurance, he added.

“QR codes have been created and displayed at all railway stations. The new initiative facilitates the passengers to book tickets through UTS on mobile App within the station premises and also from the areas within the vicinity of 1 km radius from the station by scanning the QR code of a particular station,” he said.

SCR general manager Gajanan Mallya has appealed to all the passengers to avail the user friendly UTS on mobile App and QR code for purchasing the tickets which he said will help them to avoid standing in long queues at stations. Mallya said that the move is time saving.

SCR authorities said the UTS on mobile App has been progressively getting extensive patronage from rail users across all divisions in the zone. UTS on mobile app is one of the major digital avenues implemented by the SCR in taking forward the digitization of railway services for the convenience of passengers.

The SCR has also introduced a new feature — Automatic Ticket Vending Machines (ATVMs) — to improve speed and minimize the transaction time while purchasing unreserved general tickets, platform tickets and season tickets.

“All ATVMs are enabled with fast booking features. With new value addition, tickets can be purchased in any ATVM with just two clicks instead of seven clicks required earlier,” SCR authorities said.

As per the new feature, a passenger can select fast booking field with the first click. Then top 30 frequently used destinations will appear on the screen. The passenger has to select the required destination with the second click and then the required ticket will be generated.

“Fast booking of tickets in two clicks is a major value addition in ATVM application which will reduce the transaction time in selection of particulars,” SCR authorities said.

He also asked her to talk to her father to meet Rabari in the jail for settlement. According to the complaint, Gadhvi also mentioned of facing dire consequences if Rs1 crore was not sent. On February 20, Parul and her brother Devanshu met Patel in the jail to talk about Gadhvi’s extortion bid. Patel had then submitted an application in this regard to police. “The accused mentioned that they had dealing with the previous owner of the land and held power of attorney, but it is suspected that the documents could be fake,” said a police official.

190,['1/03/2020'],Residents dumping garbage into channel to get notice,"Madurai: The Madurai Corporation will issue caution notice to residents, who dump garbage into the Kiruthumal channel , in order to curb pollution caused in the channel.

Commissioner S Visakan instructed his officials to start sending notices to houses of residents, who dump the garbage after they inspected the channel at various points on Saturday. Officials said they walked along the channel and covered at least 9km.

An official said the civic body is planning to seek funds from state and central governments to revive the channel. Already, it has proposed to treat sewage water carried by the channel at Chinthamani. The treated water would be let into a small tank there. At present, the civic body is in the process of preparing a detailed project report to revive the channel.

The centuries-old channel, which irrigated large tracts of land, is now reduced to mere sewage carrier. The channel, which was fed water from the streams of Nagamalai, starts at Achampattu before it drains into Gundaru on the city outskirts. It gets polluted all along its 13km stretch as people litter garbage and let sewage into it. Corporation too lets untreated sewage from its pumping stations, the official said.

“Already, a survey was conducted to identify residents letting sewage directly into the channel and all the outlets have been closed,” another official said.

He added that some of the pumping stations let untreated sewage water into water bodies and channels including Kiruthumal channel. It is due to the increased load faced by them. The commissioner has ordered engineering officials to increase capacity of pumping stations by constructing extra wells. Soon, the issue will be addressed.

191,['1/03/2020'],Two cops among three arrested on charges of ‘kidnapping informer’,"Bareilly: Two constables, Akshay Uppal and Nikhil Pawar, were among three persons arrested for allegedly kidnapping a 22-year-old man in UP’s Moradabad and “demanding ransom money from his family to let him free”. Pawar’s cousin Ashish was also arrested. The two constables have been suspended, police said on Saturday.

Moradabad man Salman, said to be a police informer, was asked to reach near a canal from where he was allegedly kidnapped by the cops who later informed his family that special operations group (SOG) team had taken him into custody to probe a matter. They later demanded Rs 2 lakh in lieu of releasing him. According to police sources, Salman used to provide information to the two constables.

Notably, Thakurdwara circle officer Vishal Yadav said that Salman was a resident of Ganinagar under Mudhapandey police station and was part of a baggage lifting gang. “During investigation, Salman confessed that he had been involved in stealing bags of train passengers and committed several thefts near Gorakhpur. The government railway police and railway protection force have been informed and we asked them to trace his criminal record. But, we have no concrete proof against him yet,” Yadav, the deputy superintendent of police (DSP), said.

According to police, Uppal had come in contact with Salman about six months ago after he raided a gambling site. Though, he didn’t get any success, he found a mobile phone from the crime scene which eventually led him to Salman. Over the period, Uppal developed a good rapport with him as the latter became his informer. Salman used to give him important leads and based on his tip off, Uppal managed to crack several cases. Salman had reportedly informed him about his nexus in the Gorakhpur railway station area.

“On Thursday, Uppal learnt that Salman had just returned from Gorakhpur after committing a theft and had money. He shared the information with his colleague Pawar and hatched a plan to recover money from Salman by threatening him in the name of SOG. Their plan, however, didn’t work,” the DSP said.

Uppal is a native of Muzaffarnagar while Pawar and his cousin belong to Baghpat district. After “kidnapping” Salman, the trio took him around in a moving car for two hours and let him go only when they learnt that they were on the radar of other cops. Before leaving home, Salman had told his family that he was going to meet Uppal.

Police arrested the trio from Bhojpur area and lodged an FIR under sections 364A (kidnapping for ransom) and 392 (punishment for robbery) of IPC. “Both the policemen have been suspended and a report against them has been sent to police headquarters,” the DSP added.

PATNA: CPI functionary and former JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Kanhaiya Kumar has questioned the timing of the prosecution order against him passed by the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government in connection with a four-year-old sedition case, saying it was done deliberately ahead of Bihar assembly election.

“The idea is to divert the attention of people from important issues like falling gross domestic product (GDP). Instead of dip in GDP, the focus is on my prosecution,” Kanhaiya told TOI over phone from Ranchi.

He said though the case dates back to 2016, the chargesheet against him was filed two years later. “According to rules, the chargesheet should have been filed within 90 days. However, it was done two years later in 2018 when I was preparing for parliamentary election. Now the prosecution order has come just before the Bihar election,” Kanhaiya said.

“I want a speedy trial in a fast-track court. The country should know the truth. Conclusion of this case is important because people will come to know how some people are playing patriotism card for their political benefits,” Kanhaiya said.

195,['1/03/2020'],Vizhinjam fishermen protest over compensation package,"Representative image

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The works of construction of breakwater for Vizhinjam International Seaport Limited was disrupted here on Saturday after the local fishermen, led by the Vizhinjam parish council members, laid siege to the worksite. The agitation was a protest measure against the state government for failing to keep the promise of a compensation package announced for the local fishermen, whose livelihood would be affected once the port commences its operations.

Around 10am on Saturday a group of fishermen led by 26 members of the Vizhinjam parish council reached the worksite and stopped all ongoing construction works. They demanded the labourers to vacate the worksite and then laid siege to the site by blocking the road leading to the port by placing their boats across the road. The agitation continued till 2pm until the representatives of Adani Group who are carrying out the works and the officials of revenue department despatched by the district collector came to the spot and held talks with the fishermen. The fishermen decided to call off the agitation after they were promised a meeting with the district collector on March 11, when their grievances will be heard.

Speaking to TOI, parish council vice-president S Muthappan, who himself is a fisherman, said that the government was yet to fulfil the promise of providing a compensation package to the fishermen, especially those who went for fishing in motorized boats fitted with outboard engines.

“When the works of the port commenced, the government promised each boat four litres of kerosene per day considering the extra kilometres we have to travel for fishing once the port starts functioning. But, this promise was never kept. Initially each boat was given 80 litres per month, which is around 2.5 litres per day. But, this too stopped one year ago,” Muthappan said adding that this was only a token protest and a massive agitation would be launched if the meeting on March 11 failed.

The fishermen had launched a similar agitation in October 2017, during the initial stages of port construction, for the delay in distribution of compensation package.

196,['1/03/2020'],"MP: Three arrested for 10-yr-old’s murder, prime accused admits sodomising boy","The three accused at the Shahjehanabad police station

BHOPAL: A day after the decomposed body of a 10-year-old boy was found near the railway tracks in Sanjeev Nagar , Shahjehanabad police on Saturday arrested three accused on charges of abduction and murder of the minor.

The trio had allegedly lured the boy on the pretext of a picnic and then taken him to a forest area near Sanjeev Nagar where they drank together and took bath in a pond. While returning, the prime accused in the case sodomised the boy. When he protested, the accused allegedly strangled him to death as he feared that the boy would reveal the incident to his family.

The other two accused had returned home on their bike prior to the murder, but they did not reveal about the picnic to the police.

SP (North) Shailendra Singh Chouhan said that the accused have been identified as Arun Yadav , 26, a resident of Nariyalkhera in Gautam Nagar, his cousin brother Gopal Yadav alias Lalu, 19, a resident of Shahjehanabad, and Amardeep alias Mattu Yadav, 21, a resident of Shahjehanabad. All the three accused work as daily wage workers in the BMC.

SP Chouhan said that during the investigation, the boy’s family members told police that the deceased was acquainted with Lalu and used to visit his father’s dairy at Ahir Mohalla near the house to watch and play with cattle. He was last seen at the dairy till 2 pm on February 22. Acting on this information, police detained Lalu and interrogated him. SP Chouhan said that Lalu told police that he along with Arun and Mattu had taken the boy to a pond near Sanjeev Nagar on their bike. Before reaching the spot, they purchased a bottle of liquor. As the road to the pond was bumpy in the forest area, two of them reached the pond by their bike while Arun and the minor boy reached on foot. The three accused consumed alcohol at the pond and then took bath.

SP Chouhan said that while returning, Lalu and Mattu went on the bike and Arun along with the minor boy followed them on foot. Arun revealed that he sodomised the boy near the railway tracks. But when he started shouting in pain, Arun strangulated him. At that time, Lalu and Mattu, who were waiting for them on the bike across the railway tracks on road, called him repeatedly. Arun tried to mislead them by saying that the boy had returned with them.

SP Chouhan said that Arun went absconding since then. He is a drunkard and has not gone to his home for the past three years so police were not able to find him initially. He was not even reporting to work. Lalu and Mattu too concealed the information that they had gone to the pond with the minor boy. When police detained Lalu and Mattu, cops found that Arun had given his ATM card to a friend and was enquiring with him about the salary credited in his account. When police found Arun’s friend, he too was detained.

Arun has confessed of sodomising the boy and murdering him.

The hospital, which is the biggest in a district with a population of around 5 lakh, has 19 posts of nurses, of which four are currently not filled. Of the 15 nurses that are currently working, six are on leave. Chief medical superintendent of the hospital HS Kharayat said, “Six nurses have been on leave for the last couple of days. As for the remaining staff, they often have to work on Sundays and take the compensatory offs towards the end of the month. It is because of this sudden shortage in nursing staff that the paying ward has been closed for the weekend. We expect it will function smoothly again from Monday.”

Moreover, contracts of an ENT doctor and an orthopedic ended on Saturday and were not extended. The hospital did not have an ENT doctor or an orthopedic, so it hired two specialists on contract. The contract of Dr Ramesh Punera, ENT, was valid from March 1 2019 to February 29 this year. Similarly, the contract of Dr HS Mehata, orthopedic, has also expired and not been extended.

“A proposal has been sent to the government to extend the contracts of these two doctors but no information has been received. We hope the extension is approved soon,” added Kharayat.

The district hospital has 120 beds, of which 15 are chargeable and make up the paying ward. Patients can take these if they want to avail extra facilities. The beds in the paying ward cost Rs 146 per day. The paying ward is mostly full.

JAIPUR: The court of the commissioner for specially abled persons has summoned the Iinspector general of police (recruitment) on March 23 and directed the department to clarify its position for not providing reservation to persons with disabilities (PwDs) in police constable recruitment .

The IGP (recruitment) has also been asked to submit relevant documents depending on which it seeks immunity.

In another order, the court has sought a report from the managing director of Rajasthan Skill and Livelihoods Development Corporation (RSLDC) on the action taken on skill development of PwDs and providing 5% reservation to them in recruitment in private commercial units.

Meanwhile, the IGP has been asked to be present in the court at 4.30pm on March 23. Earlier, IGP (recruitment) had claimed that one must be in a good mental and physical health and free from any mental or physical defect to be recruited as a constable in Rajasthan Police. He said this in a written reply to the commissioner for specially abled persons over reservation to persons with disabilities in police constable recruitment.

In its reply to the commissioner, IGP (recruitment) had stated, “A candidate for direct recruitment of the service, must be in good mental and bodily health and free from any mental or physical defect which is likely to interfere with the efficient performance of his duties as a member of the service and if selected, must produce a certificate to that effect from a medical authority notified by the government for the purpose.”

Earlier, disability commissioner Akhil Arora had directed the IGP (recruitment) to depose before the panel in order to give an explanation as to why they were not able to give reservation to persons with disabilities in police constable recruitment. IGP (recruitment), instead of deposing before the commission’s panel as directed, sent a reply to the commission.

Hemant Bhai Goyal, national vice-president, Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh, informed the commissioner that in Delhi, reservation is given to persons with disabilities in recruitment of police constables. “Their job is civil in nature and they don’t wear Delhi Police uniform,” he said.

IGP (recruitment), in its first letter to the commission, had stated there was no provision for giving reservation to specially abled persons in police constable recruitment, as per the Police Subordinate Service Rules, 1989.

Speaking at a public meeting organized to commemorate the 72nd birth anniversary of the late chief minister J Jayalalithaa, near Watrap in Virudhunagar district, he said AIADMK had the full support of the people because of the extraordinary schemes implemented by the late chief minister during her rule. The DMK was trying to instigate violence and unrest in the state, but Tamil Nadu was AIADMK’s fortress and it would never allow this to happen in the state, Bhalaji said.

He said that at least one person from every family in the state would have benefitted from the numerous welfare schemes implemented by Jayalalithaa. Now, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami was following the footsteps of Jayalalithaa and performing outstandingly, he said. Because of the scheme to distribute Rs 1,000 as the pongal gift, the ration card holders would ensure that the AIADMK would sweep any election that will come in future, he added.

The members of the AIADMK always sought votes from the people only after bringing many schemes and nobody voted for money.

206,['1/03/2020'],Citizen feedback ranks Bhopal fifth in ease of living survey,"Murial Arts at Smart Road

BHOPAL: A citizen perception survey has found that Bhopal is among the top five cities in India to live.

Union ministry of urban development’s ease of living index assessment, an exercise to directly capture perception of citizens with respect to quality of life in their cities, concluded on Saturday.

According to Bhopal Smart City Development Corporation Limited (BSCDCL) as many as 1,11,234 responses were received from the Madhya Pradesh ’s capital as part of the survey.

The assessment was open to public from January 16 and ended on Saturday.

Bhopal got 28,474 less votes than Salem (Tamil Nadu), which bagged the first rank.

“It an important assessment exercise as it will help in directly capturing perception of citizens with respect to quality of life. We expect Bhopal to do much better when the other aspects of direct evaluation take place in the coming weeks,” said BSCDCL CEO, Deepak Singh.

In the next phase, a direct assessment by third party on the lines of the Swachh Survey will be undertaken.

It will identify living standards, which cities are identified under the smart cities’ mission, capital cities and a few more cities with a population of over a million.

In the first ease of living index released in 2018, Indore and Bhopal were ranked among the top 10 liveable cities in India.

Bhopal was placed at the 10th place, among 111 cities surveyed.

The index aims to assess the ease of living of citizens residing in the cities across three pillars -- quality of life, economic ability and sustainability. Furthermore, there are 14 categories (Education, Health , Housing and Shelter, WASH and SWM, Mobility, Safety and Security, Recreation, Economic Development, Economic Opportunities, Environment, Green spaces and building, Energy Consumption and City Resilience) and 50 other indicators.

An important aspect of this assessment is emphasis on collecting quality and reliable urban data through rigorous document check and physical audit. This would imbibe a culture of data-driven governance in cities to effectively plan, implement and monitor city services in the future, he added.

The urn with his ashes was brought to Shiv Chowk, the main crossing in city, before it was taken to Haridwar for immersion in the Ganga.

Condemning the killing of innocent people in the riots, city MLA from Muzaffarnagar Kapil Dev Agarwal, who is a state minister (independent charge), termed Ankit’s murder a “result of a conspiracy”.

Accusing Aam Aadmi Party leader Tahir Hussain for the killing, Agarwal told reporters, “Petrol bombs, stones and illegal weapons were recovered from Hussain’s house, which is proof of a conspiracy to foment violence in Delhi.”

Ankit’s relatives and friends from Delhi, Union minister Sanjeev Balyan, the DM and the SSP of Muzaffarnagar were among the hundreds of people who bid him a final adieu.

Earlier on Friday, Ankkit’s father, Ravinder Sharma, had appealed to the AAP-led Delhi government to provide a government job to a member of his family and accord a “martyr” status to his son.

There has been a decline in the use of natural flowers with consumers buying more plastic-based variants, said S Jafar Naqvi, president, Indian Flowers and Ornamental Plants Association (iFlora). The theme of the expo was ‘Go for Fresh, Ban Artificial and Plastic Flowers’.

“Large amounts of artificial flowers are being imported which has led to a huge decline in the demand for fresh flowers by bulk consumers in India,” said Naqvi.

Naturalist Asiya Khan said, “Landscapers and architects are primary influencers. They must learn to market native species over exotic ones,” she said.S P Anchuri, conservation architect, said, “While designing buildings, it is necessary to create adequate green zones.”

NVS Reddy, MD, HMRL, said, “Plantation on roadsides where the Metro rail project has come up is a priority.”

210,['1/03/2020'],Kota serial rapist and killer given capital punishment,"Representative image

JAIPUR: A trial court in Kota awarded capital punishment to a 50-year-old man on Friday for the murder of a 40-year-old woman in Vigyan Nagar police station area of Kota.

The court also slapped a penalty of Rs 5,000 on the convict. The case was taken up by the Kota police under the “case officer scheme” and the police officials not only used DNA tests but other scientific evidence to get conviction in the case in nine months after filing the chargesheet.

“The case was taken up in ‘case officer scheme’ and the witnesses were taken to the court on regular basis for statements,” Munindra Singh, SHO of Vigyan Nagar, Kota, said.

The “case officer scheme” is an innovation of the Rajasthan police where popular or notorious cases are earmarked for an integrated effort of the police, the prosecution agency, and the judiciary to ensure a speedy trial.

The case was registered in 2019 after a mutilated and decomposed body of a 40-year-old woman was found in the backyard of a school.

“The woman went missing on May 22, 2019, and two days after she went missing, her body was recovered, but it was not possible to identify it. The assailant had slashed open her abdomen and stuffed all her clothes in it. We found that the cloths belonged to a woman who is from the Bhat community. We called in members of the Bhat community and took DNA samples from a 22-year-old girl whose mother had gone missing. The samples of the victim and the girl matched, and we could identify the victim,” Amrita Duhan, ASP of Kota city, told TOI over phone.

Police then recovered CCTV footages of area and nearby areas where the body was found. “We arrested the accused, one Mohan Lal, 50, almost 20 days after the murder. We found that he fled from Sanganer jail four years ago. He was convicted in a similar case of rape and murder of a woman and was serving life term at Sanganer open jail. Lal confessed that he killed the woman when she resisted his attempt to rape her,” Amrita said.

On Friday, the presiding officer Kailash Chandra Mishra of POCSO court, Kota, awarded capital punishment to the convict.

POCSO courts, established under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, also try cases related to heinous crimes against adults, when the pressure of their regular cases is low.

“We argued that this is a heinous crime and brought to the notice of the court that the arrested accused is a serial rapist and killer . We demanded capital punishment for him,” Suresh Verma, public prosecutor in the case, said.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

213,['1/03/2020'],"Triple drug therapy campaign aims to eliminate filariasis, says Tope","Nagpur: The government of Maharashtra formally launched the Mass Drug Administration (MDA) campaign in six districts of the state from Nagpur on March 2. The campaign aims to eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis from the state. Apart from Nagpur, it will cover Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Bhandara, Gondia and Nanded districts.

Maharashtra minister for public health and family welfare Rajesh Tope formally launched this campaign through video conferencing.

During the launch ceremony, the health minister highlighted that Maharashtra is a high-burden state with 18 districts being endemic to Lymphatic Filariasis.

“Government has deep concern for elimination of this Filariasis. Health department officials should take this campaign as a war against this deadly disease which causes the affected families to live their lives in misery,” he said.

Tope also urged principals of private schools to contribute in making this campaign successful as this disease gets transmitted early in childhood that usually goes unnoticed. He highlighted that most people do not take these drugs due to lack of knowledge about the benefits.

“If some people consume the drugs while others don’t, then the whole community is at risk of filaria. All members of the community need to ensure that they take these drugs under the supervision of health workers and motivate others to do the same. It is the responsibility of each one of us to make MDA a success,” he said.

During the MDA rounds, drug administrators will provide free-of-cost drugs to all eligible beneficiaries of the endemic districts through door-to-door campaign and through booth approach followed by mop-up rounds to cover left out areas. The consumption will be directly observed (DOT) by the drug administrators like it is done under the TB program with exception of children below 2 years, pregnant women and people suffering from serious diseases.

Benefits of anti-filaria drugs administered during Mass Drug Administration rounds

The consumption of MDA drugs during MDA round will curtail transmission of micro-filaria parasites circulating in the community. There are also other benefits like treating parasitic infections caused by intestinal worms. This improves nutrition uptake and helps physical and cognitive development of the children. Additional benefits of consuming anti-filaria drugs include curing other infection like scabies and lice.

Status of Filaria in Maharashtra

As of 2019, Maharashtra has recorded 18 districts as endemic. These include Akola, Amravati, Bhandara, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Gondia, Jalgaanv, Latur, Nagpur, Nanded, Nandurbar, Osmanabad, Sindhudurg, Solapur, Thane — Palghar, Vardha and Yavatmal.

Now, the family is demanding for a CBI investigation in the case and this has created a new problem for the government.

On Saturday, Barmer MLA Mevaram Jain, on behalf of the government, spoke to the youth’s family members but talks failed as the family members were adamant for CBI investigation and a compensation of Rs 1 crore. The kin of the deceased youth were still outside the mortuary and did not allow the body to be taken for the postmortem.

Former MLA of Barmer Jalam on Friday late night met the family members and supported their demands. On Saturday, Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal’s son Ravi Meghwal also met the family members and told them that he will get the matter raised in Lok Sabha through his father. BJP is preparing to raise the issue in the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha to corner the Gehlot government on the matter.

Ravi Meghwal, accusing the Gehlot government, said that lately, Dalits are not safe in Rajasthan and in this case, total carelessness of the police has come to light, but no police personnel has been arrested so far. Despite three days passing, there has been no response from the government and he would send a factual report to the PM, party president and Union minister Meghwal.

RLP leaders also expressed grief over the matter and supported their demands. RLP vice president Udaram Meghwal said that the government accepted in the assembly that if the person was kept at the police station for so many hours, then the police would have certainly beaten him up. BJP leaders and the members of the community have said that till the accused policemen are not arrested, the persons sitting on dharna won’t budge from their place and have asked to write to Centre demanding a CBI probe . After Ravi Meghwal met the family members along with the people of the community, the family decided to call for a CBI probe.

Additional DGP Ravi Prakash Meharda has been continuously persuading the family, but they are adamant and have added a new demand for a CBI probe in the matter.

“When the parents kept a watch, one night they noticed their 12-year-old boy sneaking into the room and stealing cash from the cupboard. When questioned, the boy said he needed the cash which he had lost in PUBG mobile gaming he used to play with his friends,” said an official from Adesar police station.

The worried parents, who own a grocery store in Adesar, approached the police. The police found that a group of teenage boys of their son’s age group had got him addicted to mobile gaming.

They said Tamil has been pushed to the backseat in all the walks of life today.

Santhalinga Marudachala Adigalar, of Perur Adheenam, said they have floated a movement to safeguard Tamil. “Tamil medium education has to be implemented in elementary schools, higher secondary schools and colleges. The state should implement the Tamil Nadu Official Language Act strictly in all the departments,” he said.

One of their demands was to use Tamil for consecration ceremonies in all the temple in the state that were under the control of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments department.

They said commercial establishments should be made to use Tamil in their name boards predominantly. “The state should also have 80% reservation in government jobs for the people who have studied in Tamil medium schools. Like the Karnataka government, the state should also set up a ‘state official language commission’ to promote Tamil. Also, steps should be taken to teach Tamil in schools that don’t teach the subject today,” they said.

They also called on all the parents in the state to name their children only in Tamil.

230,['1/03/2020'],Trains to hit 110km/hour on Jaipur-Delhi route,"Representative image

JAIPUR: After the completion of double track on Jaipur-Delhi rail route , the average speed of trains is going to increase from existing 90km/hour to 110km/hour.

Once the electrification work would be over, the trains can attain a speed above 110 kms/hour on the route and will bring down the travel time from existing 4 hours 30 minutes to 4 hours 15 minutes.

As the doubling between Bandikui-Dhigawara was over recently, the authorities of NWR are geared up to facilitate various trains on the Jaipur-Delhi rail route with the benefits of doubling.

“This will also bring punctuality as trains like Pooja Express, Aashram Express, Bhuj-Bareilly, Jaipur-Delhi double decker which used to face crossings between Bandikui-Dhigawara will get through with the double line. This will of course cut down the travel time of the passengers,” said a senior officer involved in the traffic of the NWR on Saturday.

Senior officials added that trains like Shatabadi Express and Rajdhani Express between Jaipur-Delhi were already touching 100km/hour but the doubling followed by electrification will benefit the passengers.

“This will also increase the goods train movement and frequency of the trains. Also, the trains which used to get crossings would be benefited. The electrification is on its final stages and hopefully from July onwards many trains will attain speed up to 120km/hour,” said an officer.

When contacted, Abhay Sharma, chief public relations officer, said, “Trains would be through and this will help us to maintain a good speed between Jaipur-Delhi and Delhi-Jaipur.”

Presently trains on the route are maintaining a speed of 80 kms/hour to 90 kms/hour on the Jaipur-Delhi and Delhi-Jaipur sections. “This will also help in bringing more goods trains and also there might be introduction of new trains on this route,” said an officer.

JODHPUR: The police in Jodhpur continue to crack whip on the illegal and country-made weapons. In yet another breakthrough, police arrested two persons and seized five weapons from them. One of those has been identified as supplier of the weapons to city youths and had arrived here for this purpose.

It may be noted that in past 20 days, 25 persons have been arrested and 44 weapons have been seized from them which is an indication of Jodhpur emerging as a hub for both weapon suppliers and buyers.

DCP (East) Dharmendra Singh Yadav said that the police have been keeping an eye on the suppliers and buyers of these weapons in Jodhpur and constantly gathering inputs from those arrested so far and from the informers.

“On Saturday morning, we got information that one weapon supplier Ramesh Jangu was in city to sell the weapons. Our team swung into action and arrested him in Saran Nagar area with four pistols. On the information given by him, another person identified as Mukesh was arrested with one pistol from other location,” said Yadav.

These weapons have increasingly been finding charm with those engaged in drug smuggling, sand mining and recovery gangs. Many such incidents have taken the city under panic where the criminals have fearlessly engaged into gang-wars using weapons fearlessly.

“But shockingly, these weapons have also found charm with the youth just for the shake of showing off. They have no criminal records but out fear was that with the weapons in their hands, it would not be surprising if they are tempted into using them and committing crime,” said an officer.

The biggest seizure had been reported in Jodhpur February 14 when the police had seized 18 pistols with ammunition and arrested eight persons including a juvenile.

The probe so far has revealed that these weapons have been making their way to Jodhpur from MP and groups on social media have been acting as bridge between the suppliers and buyers.

Two personas arrested so far as suppliers of these weapons have been found to be belonging to MP and said to have been supplying the illegal and country-made weapons in Jodhpur for past many months.

Last month, the police headquarter informed MPHRC that all the superintendents of police (SP) in the state have been asked to initiate action against those using names similar to that of the rights commission.

Misuse of the name and emblem is a punishable act under Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950, the MPHRC had informed the state government.

In one such case, an organisation Rashtriya Manav Adhikar Sangathan was floated in Delhi. The Sangathan also appointed office-bearers in Madhya Pradesh, the commission told the government. Such organisations were registered in Delhi but have nothing to do with national or state human rights commission, the MPHRC stated in its complaints. MPHRC chairman Justice Narendra Kumar Jain said, “There were number of complaints related to such namesakes. We wanted the government to take action against such people who used names similar to that of the MPHRC.”

He said that such names were even used for “blackmailing”.

Incidentally, a similar complaint was also filed in 2010 by National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to the then chief secretary Avni Vaish.

In October 2017, the MP Human Rights Commission filed a complaint with the then chief secretary. When no action was taken, it again sent a reminder to the Congress government last year.

In one instance, it was found that in 2015, permission was taken from the RTO by an organisation ‘Manav Adhikar Association’ to use hooter on a four-wheeler.

Without any investigation, the permission was also granted, the state human rights commission told the state government citing media clippings.

In January this year, the new government issued orders to all the superintendents of police. Referring to the two complaints, the one filed by the NHRC in 2010 and another by the state commission in 2017, a deputy superintendent of police (complaints) said that SPs across state have been instructed to act against those misusing the MPHRC’s name under Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act.

In a meeting held at JMC on Friday, the government has given powers of digital signatures to the hospital authorities and now birth certificates will be issued by them. Representative of around 95 private and government hospitals were present at the meeting on Friday in which government hospitals have been bestowed with this power.

At present, the name of the parents and child is mentioned in the certificate in the hospitals but the signature of JMC authorities is necessary to make it valid. Parents have to run pillar to post if any minute spelling mistake is committed in the certificate by the hospitals. So, to done away with this inconvenience, birth certificates will be granted by the hospitals.

Deputy registrar at JMC Pradeep Pareek said that this will give comfort to the parents who have face difficulties if any mistake is committed. “From now onwards, JMC will not have play any role in issuing birth certificates. There were lot of confusion earlier as hospitals used to write wrong names and parents have to run to hospitals if a minute mistake is committed. However, on a later stage of life if a person wants to make any amendments in his/her name or date of birth that will be done in JMC office,” said Pareek.

With the power lies at the hospitals, any mistake made in the certificates will be corrected on the spot by the hospital authorities. At present this facility is available only at Kanwatia Hospital, Jaipur where it has been fairly successful. However, most of the children are born in other hospitals in the city. The hospital authorities have been directed to install internet facility in their premises to put digital signatures on the certificates.

MJK passed 17 resolutions in a conference conducted at Codissia Ground at Peelamedu on Saturday.

National general secretary of Communist Party of India D Raja, who addressed MJK cadres, said that citizenship should not be linked with any religion. “India belongs to all and not for only one religion. The Constitution of India should be saved. During the riots of 2002 in Gujarat, BJP and RSS planned a mass massacre in New Delhi. India, its democracy and the Constitution should be saved from fascism,” he said.

CAA is not only against Muslims, but against all poor people, Raja said. “BJP threatened to register cases of sedition against Communist leaders. During the British rule, we sacrificed our lives for freedom. We faced many cases. Now, we are ready to face more cases and ready to face BJP.”

MJK leader Thamimun Ansari said there are no employment opportunities in the country. “Industrial sectors have been crippled and the entire economy is affected. The Union government implemented CAA to divert people’s attention,” he said.

One of the resolutions passed by MJK condemned the Union government for implementing CAA. The Act will segregate people based on religion and is against the Constitution, the resolution said. The government should not implement the National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), another resolution said.

Another resolution condemned the miscreants, who opened fire at the people, who protested against CAA. “Students were also attacked by right-wing people in New Delhi. Members of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) were involved in violence in Delhi with the support of police. Union home minister Amit Shah, who failed to control the atrocities and violence against Muslims, should resign,” the resolution said.

The state government should take stringent action against the people, who posted controversial messages on social media to spur violence in Tamil Nadu, a resolution said. The conference also condemned AIADMK for supporting CAA in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.

VADODARA: Senior officials of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation ( VMC ) will be travelling to Japan to study state-of-the-art technology to treat waste water in the city. The civic body is looking to upgrade its 8.5 million litres per day (MLD) capacity sewage treatment plant (STP) located at Kamatibaug that uses Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) gel beads.

The VMC now wants to upgrade it to 16MLD capacity, work for which has been taken up as a Smart City project.

The Japanese company that has manufactured the beads has offered an all-expenses paid trip for the VMC officials to visit its plant as well as a STP in Japan. A proposal to send municipal commissioner Nalin Upadhyay as well additional city engineer Dhiren Talpada to Japan in April was cleared by the VMC standing committee recently.

What has raised eyebrows is that the visit has been cleared at a time when Japan is exercising extreme precaution in wake of the spread of coronavirus outbreak in China. It has even shut down schools as a precautionary measure.

241,['1/03/2020'],Starting out early: Hyd’s band of student entrepreneurs,"Hyderabad: The novel Coronovirus (COVID-19) outbreak that crippled China earlier this year, didn’t spare Hyderabad-boy Anurag Reddy either. Miles away in his hostel room at Lovely Professional University, Punjab, he felt the ripples of the crisis as orders on his e-commerce portal started to pile up. Revenues dropped, and customers became jittery.

Fortunately for the student-cum-entrepreneur, the phase lasted only a few weeks. Now, his start-up – Penguinkart – is up again and racing towards hitting the $2,00,000 revenue mark. “I used to dabble in bitcoins during my second year of engineering, when this idea of floating an online shopping portal, struck me. It’s different from others as we promote innovative products for daily use – most of it sourced from Shenzhen, China,” said the 22-year-old now in his final year.

Anurag strongly believes in starting out early, as it allows for more time to take risks. “These are the defining years of our life. So, if we want to start something of our own, this is the right time,” he said.

Driven by the same ideology are many others from the city, collectively fuelling student entrepreneurship. All aged between 20 and 25 years and still pursuing professional courses, this band of young men and women, have registered companies on their names, offering a range of services – training job aspirants, using robotics in construction, providing retail customers, among others.

“It is often very difficult for students from lesser known colleges to land jobs. That’s also because they are not industry-ready. Our firm bridges this gap,” said Saksham Garg, one of the two founders of Work Minar Pvt Ltd that conducts talks by industry experts/trainers and skilling workshops for these students. So far, they have conducted over 10 seminars across Hyderabad and Vijayawada. The group is currently looking for funding to scale up their reach.

Academics encourage this trend. “It is an extremely rich experience and must be supported by colleges and parents. Start-ups must be viewed as part of education. If this shift in perspective happens and we become less obsessed with jobs, our country will have more successful entrepreneurs,” said Ramesh Loganathan, professor, Co-Innovation at IIIT-Hyderabad.

Gokaraju Rangaraju Institute of Engineering and Technology (GRIET) is among those making the effort. Supported by the college, a team of five 21-year-olds have set up an enterprise – Standard Programmed Instruments – that uses automation to offer solutions. “To begin with, we have developed a kiosk that allows for self-issuing and self-depositing of books at a library. We are setting up one in our college and are in talks with another in Pune,” said Bhanu Prakash Kandula. The plan is to use the same technology to offer medical services in remote villages, going forward.

Sai Kiran Gaddam’s long-term plan is equally exciting: promoting sustainable fashion while simultaneously telling stories about risk-takers. “The Jobless Street (online portal) is a platform that applauds free-thinking and combines it with fashion that complements it. Every piece of garment must have a story behind it. Right now, I am promoting Ikat,” said the ASCI student, scouting for funds.

Claiming that dedication is the only must-have for this job, Rohit Chelta, founder of Warranty Me said: “Even while being a full-time student, I worked tirelessly on my product. I often woke up in the middle of the night to write down some random strategic idea. I single-handedly built the business plan, pricing, managed sales, followed up with technical partners and raised funding.” His is a mobile app that allows customers to keep track of their purchases (electronic products) and avail of warranty services. With nine small retail outlets under his belt, the Guru Nanak Institute of Technology is gunning for the big brands now. He recently received a funding of Rs 4 lakh from the state government.

242,['1/03/2020'],Cos ride a new wave to make ops water positive,"Jaipur: Running large factories in water-starved geographies like Rajasthan brings its own risks. But for some companies, the advantages that the state offers outweigh the challenges water throws up. Rather they have converted the difficulties to opportunities, building on their sustainability initiatives.

Ambuja Cement runs a 2.60 million-tonne plant in Pali district and construction is currently underway for another plant in Nagaur. Pearl Tiwari, CSR head of Ambuja Cement, said if you want to bring prosperity to parched regions, water needs to be taken care of.

“In Rajasthan, Ambuja is 17 times water positive . We are working not only to reduce consumption of water, but improving its harvest. Ambuja started with 2 villages in Pali district in 2004. Now our initiatives have spread to 125 villages, benefitting 1.8 lakh people and as many cattle,” said Tiwari.

She said in these years, Ambuja has built roof rainwater harvesting facilities in 5,500 households, revived 400 ponds, created 43 check dams and made 40 bunds with the help of the local communities. “Now, we are present in 4 blocks but would be soon adding Ajmer and Bhilwara soon for the water conservation and harvesting initiative,” added Tiwari.

Ambuja is not alone. Kaushlesh Maheshwari, president (marketing) of Mangalam Cement, said they have ensured that their products consume less water. “Our campaign, Jal Kam Jalan Kam, reflects our thrust on saving water,” added Maheshwari.

Recently, at a corporate event at its research and development centre in Jaipur, Hero MotoCorp chairman and managing director Pawan Munjal said they have started a programme to make their operations in the country water positive by 2024.

Hero MotoCorp has a manufacturing facility in Neemrana which the company calls its ‘Garden Factory.’ Vijay Sethi, head of CSR of the two-wheeler major said, “Our facilities in Neemrana have jointly gone through water footprint assurance-cum-verification and achieved ‘Water Positivity Index - 21.14 which effectively means we are giving back water to mother nature by 21 times more than our actual consumption.”

He said the major water conservation measures the company undertakes include large-scale rainwater harvesting projects that ensure water recovery and recycling and recharge of ground water.

Similarly, Udaipur-based Hindustan Zinc has stopped using ground water and using 90% of recycled water at its Rajpura Dariba Complex mine operations. A senior official of the company said that there are dams the company has constructed to meet its demand. “While we have not applied for any water positive certification, our operations are water-positive given the diverse range of activities we have undertaken,” said the official.

249,['1/03/2020'],Debris keeps piling on Rajaji hospital campus,"Madurai: All sorts of debris continue to pile up on and around the campus of Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) amid the authorities’ apathy. Debris accumulated from demolition work, construction work and repair works are not cleared on time.

“The Public Works Department (PWD) is responsible for maintenance work. However, they do not remove the debris regularly. Only after a sizeable amount gathers do they take it away but even that is delayed sometimes,” said a source from the hospital. Nearby ward 51of the GRH, which houses the X-Ray and Scan departments, a huge pile of broken down bricks, stones and wood has been lying unattended for days. It is likely to attract rats and insects as attenders of some patients throw away food waste on top of it. “It causes foul smell and also so much dust is released from the brick pile,” said an attender of a patient.

In many spots around the GRH, the leftovers from many kinds of repair work-broken toilets, sinks, wooden furniture and boards- are left in piles. Near the department of respiratory medicine, a dilapidated jeep with sand, left over from construction work, has been left lying unattended for a long time. “At times even we forget when the debris was left behind as it is not a pressing issue for us,” said a hospital staff. Hospital authorities remained defensive and said that delays in clearing the debris were inevitable and as long as it does not get in the way of functioning of the hospital or cause disturbance to patients and doctors, it would not be an issue. “The PWD does periodical checks and makes a note of everything. It is understandable for delays to occur and you cannot expect them to come every other day to remove the debris,” said a source.

CPI seeks a fair and through inquiry into the violence, Raja told reporters. “More than half the people who died have died due to bullet wounds. Who instigated this mob violence and gun culture? The Delhi police, which is under the control of Amit Shah, did not take steps to control the violence or maintain peace in the capital. Why was the BJP leaders, who had made hate speeches, not arrested?”

The Centre should be open-minded on the issue and repeal the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), against which people across the country have been protesting, Raja said. “Leaders of 20 political parties, including the Congress and CPI, have written to the President to speak to the Centre and repeal CAA. CPI had opposed it when the bill was tabled in the Parliament.”

Speaking about the nod by the Aam Aadmi Party government in New Delhi to prosecute former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Association (JNUSU) and CPI representative Kanhaiya Kumar and nine others in a sedition case for allegedly raising anti-India slogans during an event in the university campus in 2016, Raja said CPI would face the case politically and legally. “Who put pressure on the AAP government to allow the prosecution? Arvind Kejriwal himself had earlier said the videos against Kanhaiya Kumar and others were doctored. The case was false and made up.”

Speaking about US president Donald Trump’s recent visit to India, the CPI leader said the visit helped US and not India. “Trump has succeeded in boosting the US economy by acquiring huge markets in India. Subsequently, India has entered a comprehensive global strategic partnership. So far, India’s foreign policy was independent. Now, by entering the partnership, India has given up this independence and has bowed down willingly to US’s strategic interests,” he said.

The Centre has abdicated its responsibility from the country’s economy and is keen on privatising the public sector undertakings, Raja said. “Unemployment is high. People’s buying capacity and Rupee value are low,” he said.

256,['1/03/2020'],Bareilly’s pilgrims stopped fromboarding flight to Saudi Arabia,"Bareilly: Several Umrah pilgrims from UP’s Bareilly who were about to take flight to Saudi Arabia from Delhi on Thursday were turned back after Saudi Arabia imposed a temporary ban on entry of foreign pilgrims to the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina as a precautionary measure against the spread of novel coronavirus in the Kingdom.

Several pilgrims returned home dejected from the airport. Most of them were completely unaware and learnt about the Saudi decision only a few minutes before boarding. Notably, the Kingdom had made the announcement on Thursday.

Mohd Shah, a mason at Faridpur village of Bareilly, was one of them. “After saving money for years, I planned my Umrah pilgrimage and paid Rs 60,000 to travel agent. We learnt about the Saudi government’s decision just 10 minutes before boarding. I wept at the airport as it was my first Umrah pilgrimage. I have been dreaming about it for years. I don’t know if travel agent will return my food and lodging money.”

Elderly couple Chhote Abdul Gani and his wife Sadikan who were eagerly waiting for years for Umrah were “heartbroken”. Their son Mohd Raees, a zari artisan and resident of Juajawaharpur village of Bareilly, said, “My parents don’t know whether they would be able to go on a pilgrimage again.”

Convenor of Bareilly Haj Sewa Samiti, Pammi Warsi, said, “An Umrah visa is usually valid for 15 days and if the suspension order is not lifted, the pilgrims who were made to leave from airport will have to reapply. From Bareilly, more than 50 pilgrims go for Umrah daily.”

Managing director of a Bareilly based tours and travel company, Md Asim Hussain Qadri, said, “Tour operators will suffer huge losses as they will have to return money to the people. We have already done advance bookings for hotels.”

257,['1/03/2020'],65% work under MGNREGA for water conservation done,"Jaipur: With focus on water conservation in the desert state, around 65 per cent of work under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act ( MGNREGA ) is done to ensure conservation of water and plantation through natural resource management (NRM). At least 2,000-3,000 model ponds have already been built out of around 9,894 sanctioned under the scheme since last year.

Rajasthan accounts for 5% of the total geographical area in the country, but has just 1% of the total surface water in the country. Also, Rajasthan accounts for 18 per cent of the country's population of cows and buffaloes.

“The concept of model talaabs or ponds was introduced for water conservation. It is ensured that the edge of ponds doesn’t breach when there is an overflow of water. It is done by building concrete embankments and a passage for the flow of water. While this helps in protecting the model ponds from destroying by the animals roaming around, the ponds are also meant for ensuring drinking water for the animals. Plantation activities are also undertaken around the ponds,” said an official.

“Under the scheme, at least one model pond/talab was sanctioned in every gram panchayat,” the official added.

Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had written a personal letter to gram pradhans (sarpanch) requesting them to conserve rainwater for monsoon. Special gram sabhas were conducted in all gram panchayats (9,892) of Rajasthan to sensitise them (sarpanch) about water conservation on June 21 and June 22.

258,['1/03/2020'],Large-scale hunting of spiny-tailed lizard suspected in Banni,"Over 250 burrows found dug in the grasslands to hunt for the reptile

Rajkot: The Kutch forest department has ordered a probe into allegation of large-scale hunting of spiny-tailed lizard, a species found in the semi-arid plains of Banni region of the district.

The spiny-tailed lizard are listed under schedule II of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Popularly known as ‘Sandha/Sandho’ the reptile is known to occur in arid zones of northwestern India including Rajasthan, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh.

The probe was ordered after a local researcher, associated with a voluntary organisation lodged a complaint with the forest department claiming that he had found over 250 burrows dug in Banni grassland region, allegedly for the purpose of hunting the lizards.

“We have received the complaint and we have begun investigation. We have got the video of empty burrows, but are yet to get proof of hunting,” said Pravinsinh Vihol, deputy conservator of forest, Kutch (east) forest division.

Sources suspect, a bigger poaching racket operating in the region.

The complainant in the case Ritesh Pokar of NGO Sahajeevan said that the spiny-tailed lizards were forced to come out from their burrow and hunted in Navlakha area of Banni in Bhuj taluka.

“This is the area where grassland ends and desert begins. The lizards are found in large numbers here,” said Pokar. “I came her for my research and found these borrows suggesting large-scale hunting of lizards. So I informed the forest department.”

According to forest officials, a major threat to these lizard species is illegal trade and killing to substitute protein through meat and oil extracted from its skin and tail. Locals also consider it to be an aphrodisiac and having other medicinal properties.

260,['1/03/2020'],Spreading menstrual hygiene with home-made pads,"Madurai: From raising her voice against food adulteration, Madurai’s ‘Paruthi Pen’ T Kannamma is now making home-made cotton sanitary napkins that are safer than commonly sold non-biodegradable pads that may have side effects.

“My husband runs a home-made food product business while I was involved with voluntary services during my free time. When I became interested in learning about herbs and natural elements to lead a healthier life, I was inspired to try making nature-based sanitary napkins as it is as important to a woman as food and water. I did some research and came up with this final product,” said Kannamma, a home-maker from Iyer Bungalow.

The 42-year-old homemaker’s ‘Paruthi Pen Mooligai Napkin’ is a fully cotton-based disposable sanitary napkin that lasts for 4-6 hours with surgical cotton used as the main absorbent.

A typical napkin has a top outer layer made of pure cotton cloth, a second additional layer of fine pure cotton cloth, a third surgical cotton absorbent layer with anti-biotic agents, a cloth canvas as the fourth layer and a final under layer made of paper canvas sheet to give stiffness, all stitched together.

“Everyone’s period is unique, so the main focus for me was to reach the customer directly with more of a service motive. I always give them a trial period to find out their needs. When I interacted with them, many had doubts and this initiated a dialogue. Especially, those with menstrual problems were looking for alternative and safer products,” said Kannamma. The homemaker is helped by her sister S Radha and Sumathi R to manufacture and package the napkins.

What makes these napkins more preferred is the inclusion of neem, aloe vera and thiruphala powder as antibiotic agents. Their presence alleviates the foul odour of menstrual blood. The powder is inside of the surgical cotton absorbent layer and does not leak.

“I soon started creating awareness about menstrual hygiene in schools because that is where change can happen. There, I learnt how children were struggling. Even now, many are unable to use regular pads because they are not able to handle the discomfort. Some children even used unhealthy practices of using cloths or took leave from school, completely not using napkins,” added Kannamma.

Now, with feedback from students, she is trying her best to make the napkins even more comfortable. The napkins are safely disposable by burning. The napkins with wings come in XL, XXL, and XXXL sizes, priced at Rs 150, Rs 160 and Rs 180 for six napkins respectively. The orders can be placed via calls or WhatsApp. Kannamma also delivers her products to customers’ homes via courier and has now found customers contacting her from even Bangalore and Mangalore.

“I felt cheated by a lot of so-called natural sanitary napkins. But I found these napkins safe and comfortable. I also know the entire process of making and there is no room for using chemicals or harmful products,” said Janani B, a customer. With help from her son, Kannamma also released a tutorial on YouTube on how to make these napkins, which has garnered around 4,500 views.

“My motive is not business. Many approached me about how to make these napkins at home. I have given training for a few but one should be careful to always use the best quality of materials,” added Kannamma.

MANGALURU: Minister for major and medium industries Jagadish Shettar dropped hints that the soon-to-be-out state budget would be industry-friendly. A slew of policy initiatives, aimed at addressing issues that are hampering growth of industries, are likely to be announced in the budget. Such issues, having figured in pre-budget discussion with chief minister B S Yediyurappa, are significant during the three-day Global Investors’ Meet scheduled from November 3.

Interacting with industry representatives from Dakshina Kannada at an event held under aegis of department of industry here on Saturday, Shettar said a common thread of complaints have been highlighted while he interacted with the industry captains of the state. “There a few hurdles that urban development department have created with their rigidity on policy matters. They are hurting industries, and efforts are on to solve them, he said.

“We have mooted a middle-level taxation policy where layouts are neither considered commercial nor residential, a move that will give industries sufficient relief,” he said, adding that his department is ready to walk the talk in encouraging industries in Karnataka.

Plans are there to set up Industrial Township Authorities in 8-10 places in the state. They will be self-sustaining development models without taxation interference from ULBs or panchayat raj bodies. “We have mooted a revenue-sharing model where ULBs/ panchayati raj bodies get 30% of property tax and solid waste management revenue, and the rest goes to the authorities concerned that can use it internally to develop their areas,” Shettar said.

Other major concession mooted is to provide exemption under Section 109 of Karnataka Land Reforms Act for entrepreneurs who want to purchase agriculture land to set up their units, he said, adding permission for the same will be given within 30 days. “Likewise, investment permission and proposals of which are cleared by a high-powered committee chaired by the chief minister is not given within 30 days, then the same is deemed to have been given,” Shettar said.

With minimum wages in Karnataka being one of the highest figures, Shettar said his department is striving to strike a balance in ensuring that neither the interest of industries nor that of workers is hurt in implementing the same. The industries department has also taken note of the recent hike in tariffs for industrial use of natural water and will be pared to ensure that industries remain competitive. “We are committed to ease of doing business,” he noted.

Even since the water level in the dam touched 100ft mark on August 13, last year, it hasn’t dipped and on Saturday evening the water level was recorded at 105ft. Meanwhile, the inflow has come down to 120 cubic feet per second (cusecs) from 400cusecs.

A senior Public Works Department (PWD) official said the water level had touched the full capacity of 120ft at least five times during the period. “The dam had reached its full capacity of 120ft on September 7, 2019. After that, it touched the full capacity four more times in the same year.”

While last year the dam was not opened on June 12 for kuruvai cultivation as the water level was not sufficient for the same, this time farmers are hopeful that the water would be released on the customary date itself.

M Kalianna Goundar, a member of Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam, said, “We hope that the state would this year release the Cauvery water for irrigation on June 12 itself.”

The dam is usually opened for irrigation on June 12 and closed on January 28. “Water will be released for around 230 days in a year. Nearly 330 thousand million cubic feet (tmc) water is required for samba and kuruvai crops,” the PWD officer said. It is to be noted that the quantum of water release would vary depending on the needs of delta districts.

However, last year, the dam was opened for irrigation needs only on August 13, when the water level touched 100ft mark. The water discharge to delta districts was stopped on January 28 as usual. At that time, the dam had 107ft water.

The reservoir is the main lifeline for Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Salem, Erode, Namakkal, Karur (partial), Trichy, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Cuddalore and Pudukkottai districts. Nearly 16.05 lakh acres benefit from the dam.

At present, 750cusecs water is being released from the dam daily for drinking purposes in Salem region.

267,['1/03/2020'],Karnataka minister directs MSCL to shift abattoir,"File photo of slaughter house at Kudroli in Mangaluru

MANGALURU: Urban development minister Byrathi Basavaraj directed the Mangaluru Smart City Limited (MSCL) to put on hold its proposal of redeveloping the abattoir in Kudroli in the city.

A proposal to redevelop the abattoir, which currently slaughters cattle for meat to be supplied in the city, was included in the Smart City project list by earlier urban development minister UT Khader. Accordingly, Rs 15 crore was reserved by MSCL to redevelop it. However, based on demands by Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal, the minister on Saturday decided to put the proposal on hold.

At an official review meeting, he directed MSCL MD Mohammed Nazeer to hold the project till a suitable location was identified. The Sangh Parivar has been raising objections to the project, stating that the area has many temples and it’s close to the river. They also have been alleging illegal transportation of cows to the slaughter house.

In a memorandum to the minister, VHP and Bajrang Dal appealed that the abattoir under MSCL should not be built in the city. “Cows are being transported illegally to the abattoir and several cases have been registered in this connection. We have been worshipping cows as revered ‘Gaumata’ and slaughtering it is banned as per rules. While police fail to prevent illegal transportation, it also triggers conflicts if organisations try to stop it. The location identified by the MSCL is not suitable as it has no space for effluent treatment plant, pre-mortem, post-mortem facility, greenery and there are restrictions against setting up slaughter houses on river banks,” they said.

The minister, without mentioning VHP and Bajrang Dal, said, “A decision to hold the project was taken based on the public complaints. People have been complaining that the abattoir is close to the river and the place is not convenient. Hence, I directed MSCL officials to search an alternative location.”

Minister takes officials to task

Basavaraj took officials to task for not expediting development works at a review meeting on development works taken up by Mangaluru City Corporation and Mangaluru Smart City Limited here on Saturday.

While MCC is lagging behind in revenue collection, MSCL could complete only four of 47 projects taken up. It was brought to his notice that 40 development projects taken up in 2017-18 have not been completed. These include construction of a market complex in Surathkal. The minister fixed a deadline of March 31 for all projects to be completed. He also directed deputy commissioner Sindhu B Rupesh to expedite all projects taken up by MSCL.

“Apart from works on roads, footpaths and drainages, there is a need to focus on other development works too under Smart City Mission,” Basavaraj said.

MSCL MD Nazeer said a detailed project report for waterfront development works has been prepared. The 2.1-km long waterfront project from Nethravathi bridge includes a cycle track, walking track, pedestrian path, kiosk and garden. The MSCL has earmarked Rs 150 crore, he said, adding that the DPR will be placed before the board for approval on March 2.

On sliding of waste from Pachanady dump yard which damaged 27 houses, arecanut and coconut farms due to heavy rain in August, 2019, the minister said the government has already sanctioned Rs 8 crore to construct a wall to prevent it from happening again.

Meanwhile, a proposal has been prepared to compensate residents who lost their property, crops and other valuables. It may require Rs 20 crore to compensate residents near Pachanady, he said, adding that the government will sanction the amount soon.

268,['1/03/2020'],Governor Lalji Tandon to supervise Madhya Pradesh universities online,"Madhya Pradesh governor Lalji Tandon.

BHOPAL: Governor Lalji Tandon will now make a report card of all 21 government universities of Madhya Pradesh and rank them on performance. It’s said to be the first such system in the country where the Governor monitors universities at the click of a mouse.

Universities have been asked to upload every detail of administrative and academic activities — from exam calendar and student facilities to faculty strength, financial status, vacancies, sports achievements and researches — on a ‘monitoring system’ developed for the Governor to get information on his fingertips.

The software, developed by NIC, is undergoing trial runs. On Friday, vice-chancellors were called to Raj Bhavan and briefed on the details they have to send every month. “We were shown the mirror and asked to improve performance,” said a V-C who attended the meet.

Data of the past three years will have to be uploaded so that comparisons can be drawn, say sources. V-Cs have been given log-in IDs and asked to upload data in the given format under various heads.

On ‘strength’, for instance, universities have to submit data on number of professors, assistant professors, vacant posts, when appointments were last held, and number of students on the rolls. ‘Infrastructure’ includes creation or setting up of new departments or centres. Under ‘publication’, V-Cs need to mention innovations, articles and manuscripts.

Achievements cover patients, consultancies, start-ups, commercialization, technology transferred, awards receive state, national or international, sports achievements, conference, symposium, contribution towards nation building, smart campus initiatives, budget, university academic calendar and so on.

Raj Bhavan said that Governor Tandon wants universities to strictly follow the calendar, which is why he got a software developed that will help him access information and monitored at the click of a mouse. “Since universities have to fill all information in digital format, it will make them more accountable and help improve overall education standards and reduce grievances of students,” an official said.

Dr Jayant Sonwalkar , V-C of MP Bhoj (Open) University, called it a “welcome move”. “It will help prepare comparative charts of which university is doing better and which is lagging behind. Accountability of authorities will be fixed. I am happy that such system is being introduced in MP,” he said.

269,['1/03/2020'],Inquiry ordered into postmortem by mortuary staff,"Dharmapuri: A video of two mortuary assistants performing postmortem at the Dharmapuri government medical college has been doing the rounds on social media since Thursday evening, raising many eyebrows.

While hospital dean Dr K Srinivasaraj has ordered a detailed internal probe, he plans to approach the cybercrime police to ascertain the authenticity of the video.

“I have deputed the medical superintendent and the resident medical officer to probe the issue,” he told TOI.

The government hospital has four forensic doctors, who work in shifts. “There is a technician and two other assistants to help them. It is the duty of the assistants to take the body to the postmortem table from freezer boxes,” a senior doctor in the hospital said.

He said the assistants would cut the bodies in the presence of doctor and take samples of vital organs for viscera test and other purposes as requested by police. “This is the standard procedure in all the mortuaries across the state.”

However, in the video that has gone viral the staff members are seen chopping the body and taking samples of vital organs in the absence of forensic doctors.

The hospital dean said he was yet to ascertain when the video was shot. “I want to know the date and time so that the probe team could inquire with the shift doctor to know what has transpired.”

Srinivasaraj said he was planning to approach the cybercrime police to verify the authenticity of the video. “I will write to the cybercrime police, seeking help.”

Kalshetti was speaking at one of the corner meetings held at several places along the route of bicycle rally organised on Saturday. Reduce the pollution caused by plastic materials, especially carry bags and packaging materials, was the theme of the rally.

Mayor of KMC Nilofer Ajrekar inaugurated the rally at the starting point — Janata Bazaar Chowk at Rajarampuri. Hundreds of citizens, students, civic staff, and corporators participated in the bicycle rally. The rally passed through several major locations in the city and total distance covered was around 35 km.

Kalshetti said, “The KMC has initiated several campaigns to reduce the water pollution and air pollution. We are addressing the water pollution by treating the waste water. The air pollution is being reduced by initiating the no-vehicle day on the last day of every month and use of eco-friendly ways such as cycling to reach to the offices and use of the public buses.”

Further he said, “Since last two months we have taken the task to reduce the pollution caused by the plastic. Now I some trading areas such as Lakshmipuri and Mirajkar Tickti, the traders have stopped dispensing the plastic carry bags. They are using the eco-friendly bags made of cloth or paper. The strict measures are also being adopted, however if the citizens start to use the eco-friendly bags while stepping out of houses for shopping is the only sustainable way to make city plastic-free.”

The KMC has set March 31 deadline to make city plastic-free. If it happens, the city will be first to do so in the state. During the rally, the local leaders participated and assured that they will take the steps to make their locality plastic-free.

CHENNAI: Bubble tops – a common sight in many households in the city – were either not available or were being sold at double the cost as supply dwindled. On Thursday, more than 1,700 drinking water packaging units across the state had begun a strike demanding clearer guidelines from the Centre and state government.

The strike was a repercussion of action based on the Madras high court order to the state to close borewells the units were extracting groundwater from without obtaining the mandatory no-objection certificate (NOC).

“More than 100 units in and around Chennai have closed down in protest. People in need are buying cans by bigger brands that cost nearly double, but we are running out of those cans too quickly,” said Manikumar, who supplies water cans in Vyasarpadi. Residents in Choolaimedu, who were paying Rs 35 a can had to pay Rs 70 on Saturday.

Velachery residents weren’t that lucky. “We were told there is no stock. Our supplier said he can get us a can only when the stock arrives,” said A Priya of VGP Selvanagar in Velachery. Fresh stock is expected only when the strike ends and manufacturers resume production.

It costs Rs 7 for manufacturers to pack a 20-litre can of water. The distributors, who bring the cans into cities, supply it to the retail stores for about Rs 20-30, who in turn sell the cans to customers for Rs 35 to Rs 40. Both distributors and retailers have now increased the price.

Manufacturers’ associations are vehement that they will not end the strike until the government holds talks with them. “We want government officials and ministers to give us a solution,” said A Shakespeare, founder of the Greater Tamil Nadu Packaged Drinking Water Manufacturers Association . “We will not open our shops until government relaxes rules and regularises us,” he said.

Although more than 1,710 units were set up with permission from the Bureau of India Standards and Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, only 600 have the NOC from the state. In 2014, the Central Ground Water Authority revised guidelines to regulate groundwater extraction in India. As Subsequently, the state was divided into four zones based on groundwater extraction– safe, semi-critical, critical and over-exploited zones.

“NOCs have been given to around 600 units that fall in the safe and semi-critical areas. Others don’t have the permission. Many of them were established before 2014 and we will not be able to move them to another zone. We have been asking the government to fix the upper limit for extraction in all zones and let us continue our trade,” Shakespeare said.

SALEM: The cybercrime police have booked a woman staffer of Salem district combined court for posting derogatory messages against prime minister Narendra Modi on her Facebook page.

They registered a case against 39-year-old P Parimala, of Kannankurichi, based on a complaint lodged by BJP district president R P Gopinath.

In his complaint to city police commissioner T Senthil Kumar, Gopinath said the woman had in her Facebook post expressed her willingness to become a suicide bomber if anyone wanted to kill Modi. “She also said Modi would take the country back by 50 years if he were to remain PM for the next five years.”

The city police commissioner forwarded the complaint to the cybercrime police, who launched a probe into the issue.

Meanwhile, Parimala deleted the Facebook post after she came to know about the complaint against her. “I have faith in Indian sovereignty and PM Modi. I will not post such derogatory messages in future,” she said.

The cyber-crime cell police have booked her under Section 66 (a) (sending offensive messages through a computer or communication devices) of the Information Technology Act. Inspector Saroja said they would take any action on the woman only after detailed inquiry.

This will also apply to those vehicles, said the office, which are purchased before March-end, if their papers are not processed.

In a letter issued to vehicle dealers, senior assistant regional transport officer (administration) RP Singh said, “In compliance with a Supreme Court order pronounced on October 24, 2018, no BS-IV vehicle would be sold after March 31.” The Bharat Stage VI emission norm would come into force from April 1 across the country.

Notably, the Bharat Stage emission standards are instituted by the Government of India to regulate the output of air pollutants from motor vehicles.

Meanwhile, local motor dealers are offering lucrative discounts to clear the stock as soon as possible.

Nimit Agrawal, a motorcycle dealer, told TOI, “We have around 150 two-wheelers of BS-IV norm left with us. The company has announced discounts ranging from Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 on some of the bikes and scooty. We are expecting that the company could increase the discount by Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 in the coming days.”

Another two-wheeler dealer, who wished not to be named, said his company was offering discounts up to Rs 5,000 on the vehicles which were in less demand, and there was no discount on the vehicles which were in high demand.

According to websites dealing in four-wheelers, heavy discounts ranging from Rs 75,000 to Rs 5 lakh are being offered on BS-IV cars.

On February 14, the SC rejected a plea filed by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA), seeking an extension of the April 1 deadline by over a month to clear the stock of BS-IV vehicles.

Notably, in 2017, the Centre had announced that India would skip BS V norm and adopt BS-VI norm by 2020.

Nagpur: The imbalance in the environment is primarily because of lack of concrete steps to tackle the problem head on.

To spread awareness to save the globe, a special lecture was organized by the Rotary Club of Nagpur Centre (RCNC) and Rotary Club of Nagpur Green city (RCNG) at the Institute of Engineers India (IEI) recently.

Expert Makarand Pandhripande spoke at length about how plastic waste , e-waste and solid waste are degrading the earth.

“Everyone should say no to plastic. Plastic that is not banned and allowed to use should be properly disposed of and given for recycling. Using alternatives to plastic like steel bottles, paper or cloth bags can bring about a change. Not using disposal items but biodegradable cutlery can be a huge helping hand as well,” said Makarand.

On growing e-waste, he said that it can be saved if everyone begins disposing it at the right location instead of the general dump yard. India is turning into a country with the maximum e-waste. ‘Service centres’ have been developed where only electronic material gets recycled without posing any harm to the environment. Scientific disposal of waste can improve the situation, said Makarand.

Prior to Makarand’s presentation, a welcome address was given by Rotarian Shyam Pandharipande. “This project of managing the increasing waste is highly vast and needs support from all the organizations, citizens and rotary clubs. To curb the increasing waste that is becoming a threat to the environment, it is every individual’s duty to take small steps to reach the desired destination.”

Anchor Ketki Salankar said, “Anything that cannot be reused, recycled or refurbished should be restricted from being redesigned.”

Speaking on the issues of plastic and solid waste, Makarand said, “Segregation of wet and dry waste should be finely taken care of. If every citizen starts this activity then over a period of times, a very big change can be seen.”

President of Vidarbha Plastic Industries’ Association, Rakesh Surana, stated the role of NGOs and varied organizations. “Awareness is the key and educating individuals is a must. Not littering roads, properly disposing garbage in bins and segregating waste can help bring about a change.”

The lecture was highly appreciated by the audience and all the dignitaries present on and off the dais.

275,['1/03/2020'],Tapping rainwater is need of hour,"Times News Network

Jaipur: The decade-old Jaipur Development Authority (JDA)’s landmark provision for rainwater harvesting in houses awaits compliance. The civic body’s aim to tap rainwater in the state capital continues to be a distant dream with residents refusing to follow norms.

A senior town planner at JDA said it was mandatory to construct rainwater harvesting facilities in houses built on plot sizes of 300-sq m or above. Majority of residents have, however, still not constructed water harvesting structures at homes and rainwater is going down the drains without recharging the city’s groundwater.

The JDA was authorised to penalise house owners who fail to comply, but officials are turning a blind eye. The JDA enforcement wing had announced to impose a penalty of Rs 25,000 in 2011. In nine years, not a single inspection was carried out nor any notices issued to defaulters.

There was also a provision of seven days’ imprisonment. The punitive provisions, however, have remained on paper. “No notice has been issued to anybody for failing to set up a rainwater harvesting system during my tenure,” admitted a senior enforcement officer.

The town planning department approves layout plans for group housing societies and multi-storey buildings, after ensuring that these would have rainwater harvesting systems. However, no inspections have been made to ensure that the structure actually comply their undertaking.

The excess use of water in posh colonies, despite rules and regulations, and no serious measures being taken to recharge groundwater may pose a serious threat to the city in future. Areas such as Raja Park, Jawahar Nagar, Jhotwara, Adarsh Nagar and Janata Colony are already in the dark zone for overexploitation of groundwater.

Sources said, “Due to this, semi-critical blocks have turned into critical blocks. In Jaipur, out of 13 blocks, 12 fall under over-exploited category, while one comes under critical category.”

Residents claim that the high cost of construction of a rainwater harvesting system is one of the major reasons for the non-compliance. Shakti Singh, a resident of Jawahar Nagar said, “Spending Rs 35,000 on construction of such structures is a lot for the middle-income families. The government should give subsidiaries for these structures.”

Police seized several fake B.Ed and other certificates of different universities, around 500 duplicate rubber stamps and computer sets from the accused.

The accused were identified as Gouri Shankar Jena, 42, who was working as an assistant teacher in Sunapallu UP School, Prakash Chandra Polai, 45, a teacher in UP School, Kaniar, Ranjit Kumar Palata, 48, from whose possession the rubber stamps were seized, K.Dhirendra Kumar Dora, 44, of Kodala, a computer shop owner, who allegedly made those fake certificates and Durga Prasad Mishra, 54, of Polsara, who acted as a middleman to sell the duplicate certificates for Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000.

The racket was unearthed after the arrest of Jena, who sacked from his job recently after the district education office came to know that he got the job by producing a fake B.Ed certificate of Berhampur University, said Abhilash G., the probationary IPS officer at Aska police station.

Block education officer (BEO) Krutibash Barik lodged a complaint against him at Aska police station, said IIC of Aska police station P K Sahoo. During interrogation, he confessed to have produced the fake certificate and disclosed the place from where he obtained it.

Sahu said the hard disc seized from Dora’s computer kiosk at Polasara would be sent to the forensic laboratory for retrieval of data of fake certificates.

During certificate verification, the district administration found that 20 teachers have secured jobs by producing fake certificates. Criminal cases have also been registered against these teachers.

NEW DELHI: Delhi government on Saturday decided to keep the schools in the riot-hit northeast Delhi closed till March 7 . While the annual school examination has also been postponed in these areas, CBSE’s classes X and XII board exams will be held in all centres from March 2.

The government has written to Delhi police for deployment of adequate force in and around the CBSE centres “to ensure safety of students and teachers so that the board exams may be conducted smoothly without any further tension”.

In a letter to the station house officers of the police stations in northeast Delhi, the deputy director of education asked for adequate force as “the directorate of education (DoE) and Central Board of Secondary Education have decided to hold the board examinations from March 2 as per schedule”. A list of centres has been forwarded to police.

In another circular on Saturday, DoE postponed the annual school exam in northeast Delhi till March 7. These schools will also remain closed during this period, but the principals and the staff will come, it added.

“Realising the mental state of the students, and in order to help them come out of this traumatic situation, the competent authority has decided that all government, government-aided and private-recognised schools of Northeast district will remain closed for the students up to March 7,” the circular stated.

CHENNAI: You’ve seen the food trucks. Now get set for the food tuk-tuks as autorickshaws get retro-fitted into roving restaurants. On Saturday, city-based M-auto launched Gilli Chai , electric retrofit autorickshaws that will serve as mobile tea shops.

The chai autos will be completely managed and operated by women at various parts. “We are rolling out 50 autos this year and moving to other cities as well,” says managing director Mohamed Rahmathullah. “The idea is to have a zero emission chai outlet. The women will mainly drive to busy areas like bus stands, railway stations, parks, IT Parks and tourist spots and serve piping hot chai,” he says. Rahmathullah adds that they are also launching three conventional brick-and-mortar Gilli Chai outlets, which will double up as tea refill stations for the chai autos. The first chai auto is being driven by 33-year-old Mohanna Sundari, who says she has been an autorickshaw driver for a few years now. “I’m looking forward to hitting the roads because this feels like more fun than just ferrying passengers. I feel like I’m running a business,” says Sundari.

“Running a food tuk-tuk is cheaper than a food truck. Also, it is more convenient as it does not need to be stationed anywhere. It has no gears, so driving is easier. We’re hoping more women come on board to run the autos,” says Rahmathullah.

Other cities also have the autorickshaw restaurant concept, which seems to be popular among women as a viable business opportunity. As part of its Amma Ruchi Project for instance, the Kalamassery municipality in Kerala has set women up with e-auto mobile restaurants that serve up simple traditional food served on banana leaves. From her tuk-tuk stationed outside the Kalamassery metro station between 7pm and 2am, Priya Babu serves up tapioca and fish curry as well as dosas, parottas, and fish fry. “We are given bank loans to buy the autorickshaws and so it is a good business investment,” says Priya, who also heads the Amma Ruchi project. She adds that it costs around Rs 3.5 lakh to buy and retrofit the autos, way less than it would to run a brick-and-mortar restaurant.

The last survey of hawkers was conducted in 2012. Drafting a list of the eligible hawkers is the first step towards marking ‘hawking’ and ‘no-hawking’ zones.

A senior official from the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) said, “The new list has been drafted based on the state government’s notification about the rules to be followed to implement the Street Vendors Act. We have given 30 days to the hawkers to register their objections, request for changes, add or delete their names or make changes in the type of business they do. After clearing the doubts, the final list will be prepared.”

Once the final list is prepared, the civic body is going to constitute a committee, which will have representatives from the hawkers associations. The hawkers whose names feature in the final list will elect the representatives. The town vending committee will then take up the task to mark the ‘hawking’ and ‘no-hawking’ zones.

“Once the list is finalised, it will not change for the next five years. Hawkers approaching us later will be termed ‘illegal’ and not be considered for rehabilitation. We are studying the approaches of other civic bodies for rehabilitation and marking ‘hawking’ and ‘no-hawking’ zones. We expect the zones to be marked by the end of this year,” said the official.

KMC is going to issue biometric cards to the hawkers. The cards issued in 2014 will be invalid. Currently, the same card is used by relatives of the hawkers who make photocopies of the document.

“Hawkers will have to keep the original identity card with them to avoid the eviction during anti-encroachment drives,” said the official.

NEW DELHI: While no fresh incident of communal violence has been reported in northeast Delhi in the past four days, Delhi Police has apprehended 885 people and filed 167 FIRs till Saturday in connection with the riots.

Police commissioner S N Shrivastava, who took charge on Saturday, has asked the officers to focus on “confidence-building and peacekeeping measures” without going soft on deployment. “The force is maintaining a sharp vigil on the movement and activities of local people. Any attempt to disturb communal harmony will be dealt with strictly,” a police officer said.

Police have begun cracking down on social media propaganda and registered 13 FIRs against accounts operating from various platforms such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook on charges of posting and sharing provocative content.

“Several accounts and web links circulating unlawful, offensive content have been suspended. Multiple advisories have been issued to sensitise people about responsible usage of online platforms. People have also been advised to maintain restraint while using these platforms,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Mandeep Randhawa . No PCR call was received about any violence on Saturday, he added.

The cyber cell is assisting the special investigation team set up to handle the probe. Police have collected and made an inventory of all videos shot by its personnel, mediapersons and the public, and are using the facial recognition technology to identify the rioters.

The cyber cell will also use a video enhancement software to improve the quality of images and utilise the information from social media. The videos will be verified through forensic tests.

The Special Cell and the Crime Branch have started pursuing the members of northeast Delhi’s gangs, most of whom are absconding. Late on Saturday, police reportedly got a location for Shahrukh , the gun-wielding man who was caught on camera threatening a policeman. Raids are being conducted across Delhi and in places like Amroha and Muzaffarnagar in UP, a source said.

The national human rights commissioner has asked its director general (investigation) to depute a fact-finding team for spot inquiries on of human rights violations.

PANCHKULA: As many as 90 CCTV (closed-circuit television) cameras of Panchkula Police are lying non-functional after a private contractor working with Haryana Urban Development Authority (Huda) negligently cut the main wire going to the control room outside the Sector 14 police station while fixing a sewerage line on February 9.

Sarvjeet Singh, an engineer with Doorsanchar System Company , Industrial Area, Phase I, which technically helps the police at the control room on the first floor of the Sector 14 police station, had lodged a complaint against the contractor following which a case was registered against him for damaging public property. The contractor is, however, yet to carry out the repair work despite multiple requests.

Sarvjeet said the municipal corporation (MC) had installed the CCTV cameras to curb crime rate and help in issuing e-challans for traffic violations. On February 9, around 1.30 pm, Sandeep, the contractor, damaged the main wires of the CCTV control room while digging earth with a JCB to lay a drain pipe outside the Sector 14 police station. The damage stopped the working of 90 CCTV cameras installed throughout the district.

Sarvjeet said he called up the contractor, asking him to fix the problem as soon as possible. The contractor agreed to carry out the repair work but later started making excuses and stopped receiving calls, Sarvjeet said. “Due to the contractor’s negligence, 90 CCTV cameras are lying non-functional since February 9. Strict action should be taken against the contractor,” Sarvjeet said. He then moved a written complaint.

Police registered a case under Section 279 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 3 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act at the Sector 14 police station and started investigation. Inspector Naveen Saharan, station house officer, Sector 14 police station, said, “We have booked the contractor. The investigation is under progress.”

286,['1/03/2020'],"If you see ‘illegal’ tree fellers, call NMC","Nagpur: Following TOI’s report on rampant chopping of trees by unauthorized tree fellers , the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to join hands with city police to take action.

On Friday, TOI reported how these tree fellers are roaming freely in the city, especially the greener areas of West Nagpur. Not having the mandatory permission from NMC’s garden department, they offer services for trimming and cutting jobs from gullible citizens.

Now, civic officials have decided to initiate strict action against such gangs. NMC garden superintendent Amol Chorpagar informed that NMC would seek support from police officials to nab them. “People can call us on the helpline numbers to give information about such gangs. We will arrest and book them under relevant sections of Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act,” he said.

NMC plans to initiate the action from Monday. “We will be circulating messages on social media to create mass awareness. We appeal to the citizens to contact us if they come across tree fellers,” added Chorpagar.

Earlier, the issue was raised by NGO Green Vigil Foudnation with the then municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar. “If such gangs are controlled, the cases of illegal tree felling in the city will reduce by 50%. The fellers make the job of illegal tree felling very easy,” said founder of the NGO Kaustav Chatterjee, adding that NMC should translate this decision into action.

As reported earlier, the cases of illegal tree felling, especially in residential areas, have been on a rise in the city. According to the study done by the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) Regional Remote Sensing Centre (RRSC), Nagpur has lost 4,000 hectare of tree cover in 19 years. Between 1999-2018, the city’s green cover decreased by almost 30%.

287,['1/03/2020'],Delhi Violence: Man in viral clip who was asked to sing national anthem is dead,"The spot in Maujpur where the five men were thrashed

NEW DELHI: A video that went viral during the violence in northeast Delhi showed five men being thrashed and forced to sing the national anthem by seven policemen in riot gear. TOI has identified three of the five victims. One died in hospital, while two are recovering from injuries.

Faizan, who ran a chicken shop, died while being treated in hospital. His younger brother, Naeem, identified Faizan as the man in the video lying unconscious. The family alleged that police kept him in custody for two days. “When we were finally summoned to take him home, Faizan couldn’t walk or speak and through signs indicated that he was in great pain,” said Naeem. “We took him to the hospital where he died. It has been four days since but the hospital authorities haven’t handed his body to us.”

At Faizan’s house in Kardampuri, a crowd awaited the return of the family with his body so the last rites could be conducted. Naeem told TOI, “On Monday (February 24), my brother reached home around 4pm but went out gain to check on our mother, who was at the protest site. My mother returned home, but my brother apparently stayed back to protect the women protesters when police resorted to firing teargas shells.”

The family accused police of picking Faizan from the protest site and thrashing him. “He was taken to hospital later and then brought back to Jyoti Nagar police station,” said Naeem. “Police did not permit us to meet him there. On February 26, they informed us to come and take him home. By then he was unable to speak. Faizan told me the cops had beaten him badly. We took him for medical aid, but he succumbed to his injuries.” Faizan was taken to GTB Hospital and discharged the same day. His family was informed. Two days later he returned to the hospital, where he died, said a police officer.

The second man in the video, painter Kaushar Ali, 45, lives two lanes from Faizan’s house. He was at work in Gandhi Nagar when police took him in and battered him. His son, Tahir, alleged, “My father was returning from work on Monday when the cops thrashed him and made him sing Jana Gana Mana. He fractured his hand and leg and has injuries on his head and abdomen.”

Tahir said his father was the one in the video with the head of another man on his chest. That other man is Rafiq, who lives in the same locality as Ali. Outside Rafiq’s residence, his brother, Aamir, stood with folded hands pleading with journalists to leave them alone. “We do not want anything, and I am glad my brother is alive. Yes, it is him in the video being made to sing the national anthem by the police officers,” said Aamir.

Aamir stated that his brother, a tailor, was picked up near his house and taken to the other side of the road where he was beaten with a stick. “We have been living here after coming to Delhi from Lucknow,” he said. He claimed not to be aware why Rafiq was picked up and assaulted by the cops. He said the family did not know the other men seen in the video.

Two videos of this incident went viral on social media. One was recorded at close range, and the other filmed by an area resident from his roof. In the close-up video, the police officers can be seen asking the five people to sing the national anthem properly. They also ask one of them what kind of drugs he took. An officer can be heard brusquely saying, “Sing the national anthem and Vande Matram. You have stayed in Hindustan but want azadi. You throw stones at the security forces.” The officers can also be heard constantly abusing the five men.

The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has will be repairing the leakages in the pipelines of the Shingnapur water supply scheme.

A major leakage was reported in the pipeline at Khandsari, for which the repairs will be carried out on Monday. Last week, the leakage to the same pipeline was repaired. The leakages cause huge water loss leading to inadequate supply and at low pressure.

The officials said that there are more leakages in the pipes of Shinganapur and they are trying to repair the leakages before March 31.

The citizens face severe water cuts every year between April and May, mainly due to less water in the river. In such situations, reducing the losses is important for ensuring adequate water supply at least once a day.

A senior official of KMC, requesting anonymity said, “The pipeline will be repaired on Monday and the supply will resume normally from Tuesday. We are going to deploy water tankers to provide water to the affected areas. The leakages to the main pipelines will be repaired in March and we will ensure that the water cuts are planned so that the citizens face the least inconvenience.” The areas which will face water cuts are from wards A and B includes Salokhenagar, Kalamba, Aptenagar, Devkar Panand, Prathibanagar, Ware Vasahat. From E ward, the area are Rajarampuri, Kawala Naka, Kadamwadi, Lonar Vasahat, Shivaji Park and Udyamnagar.

Meanwhile, the residents of Rajendranagar and Jaragnagar approached civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti demanding regular water supply. Kalshetti has asked the water supply department staff to pay attention to the concerns of the residents. Accordingly, the officials visited the localities on Saturday and ensured that the areas that are not getting water for more than two days will immediately start receiving water.

Hyderabad: In its bid to improve last-mile connectivity and reduce traffic congestion in the city, the Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR) will soon introduce shuttle services from 12 new routes. Each route is expected to employ three buses for picking up and dropping passengers across all three metro corridors. The buses are likely to come into operation in the next two months. The buses will be run by L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad Limited (L&TMRHL) in collaboration with Svida Mobility, an organisation that operates shuttle services.

“If people get a convenience of getting to the metro, then they will start riding the metro and that is exactly what we want to enable by introducing new services wherever required. Currently we have between 115 to 120 buses and we are doing 45 different routes in Hyderabad. All three lines put together, we are present on 24 stations plus at an average, we add about two routes a week,” founder and CEO of Svida, Siddharth Ravi told STOI.

For instance, on the Blue Line from Nagole to Raidurg, shuttle buses will run from Stadium metro station to Srinivasa Heights via Chilkanagar main road; Raidurg metro station to Platina near Kondapur, Raidurg station to Western Pearl; Raidurg station to Western Aqua and from Begumpet Metro Station to Panjagutta. Similarly, on the Red Line from Miyapur to LB Nagar, shuttle buses will be introduced from L B Nagar station to Meerpet, JNTU station to Bachupally, Balanagar to Chintal and from Irrum Manzil metro station to Raj Bhavan Road.

With the inauguration of green line last month from JBS Parade Ground to Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station, authorities have activated three new routes for shuttle services from JBS Parade ground to Alwal, Parade ground to ECIL Radhika and Parade ground to Anandbagh. “We try to introduce more buses on routes which have a high density of people. Currently, we are offering shuttle bus services to around 8,000 people per day,” said Svida CEO Ravi.

Speaking to the media on the sidelines of the LPG conclave in the city, Singh allayed fears of the price hike expected during the launch of the less polluting fuel. While he did not specify the quantum of the hike, he said the hike would be marginal. “There will be an increase in retail prices of fuel from April 1. The price is expected it to increase by 1% to 1.5%,” he said.

Indian Oil officials said with the new infrastructure in place, the fuel being supplied in Tamil Nadu is already close to B6 standards itself. “However, we plan to officially declare it on April 1,” said an official.

Speaking about the benefits BS6 fuels, the chairman said it would have a Sulphur content of only 10 ppm (parts per million) compared to the existing fuels which contain 50 ppm of Sulphur. “The lower Sulphur content in the fuel will allow using advanced after-treatment devices to reduce harmful exhaust emissions like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, NOX and other carcinogenic emissions among others,” he said. State-run oil marketing companies have invested around Rs 35,000 crore to upgrade their refineries to produce this ultra clean fuel, off which IOCL alone has spent Rs 17,000 crore.

Meanwhile, Sanjiv Singh presented gifts to prison inmates and supervisors working at the ‘Freedom Fuel Station’ on Dr Nanjappa Road. Singh said the station was one of the retail outlets operated by Indian Oil Corporation without a business objective. Deputy inspector general, Coimbatore, Shanmuga Sundaram said the freedom station is serving as a rehabilitation platform for prison inmates.

294,['1/03/2020'],"Making the final journey, full of life","Death, is an uncomfortable realisation for everyone. It’s tougher for terminal-ill patients and their families. “In most cases, doctors don’t tell such patients there is no cure. They tell their families and that puts them in an uncomfortable position. How should we take care of someone who is bound to die soon is a question that troubles many,” says Dr Anjaneyulu Konda, chief medical officer at Sparsh Hospice .

The palliative care unit, founded in 2011, looks after patients suffering from terminal illnesses, free of cost. It was the brainchild of several doctors and philanthropists who wanted to give back to society in a way that was not common. “Orphanages, old age homes, donation centres are everywhere. We wanted to venture into a path not many would think of,” says B Mallikarjun, a trustee.

It is not just end-stage treatment and pain alleviation that the centre provides. It is a touch of humanity, a realisation that the final journey does not have to be uncomfortable. “Here, we counsel residents and their families. We put their inhibitions to rest,” says Sarada Lingaraju, head counsellor at Sparsh.

The centre provides entertainment, conducts cultural activities, trips and even gets jobs for its residents. “A 23-year-old resident got a job at a major multinational. But before he received his offer letter, he was diagnosed with last stage liver cancer. He told us that it was his wish to buy his parents something nice with his first salary. So, we made it happen. He bought his parents clothes with the first cheque,” Lingaraju said. Sadly, the 23-year-old passed away soon after.

The residents at Sparsh say the centre has made them free of their fear of death. “I was angry when I came in because one by one my family stopped visiting me. The staff and residents here have become my family. I don’t know what god has in store but I feel no anger. Naffrat nahi sirf mohabbat hai,” says Mohammad Iqbal, a resident with oral cancer.

Retired printing supervisor at the state assembly, Munnaiah from Dilsukhnagar says: “My wife’s cancer spread to her brain and I was not in a position to take care of her. The doctors told me about Sparsh. Ever since she has been here, it has been easier for her, me and my family.”

295,['1/03/2020'],Basic amenities sought for visitors to prison,"Coimbatore: A petition was submitted to the chief minister’s special cell on Saturday seeking basic amenities for people visiting prisoners at the Coimbatore Central Prison.

The petitioner, Palani Kumar, of Tirupur, said people, including pregnant women, new mothers, elderly people and disabled are coming to the Central jail from 6am. However, they wait for hours, sometimes ranging between three to six hours to clear the security checks and submit their petition for visiting their relative or friend. “After all this, it becomes 2pm to 3.30pm, before they can actually visit the prisoner and come out,” said the petitioner.

The petitioner said that during these seven to eight hours of waiting, visitors are not provided seatings. “Many old, disabled people and pregnant women have no option but to sit on drainage tanks and covers,” he said. “There is also no dedicated space for women to breastfeed their children, and since women feel uncomfortable to breastfeed in public, many babies are deprived of milk for hours,” he added.

With visitors being forced to surrender their mobile phones during security checks, the petitioner said visitors don’t even have a public or pay phone facility to inform people outside that they were being delayed. The petition was forwarded to jail superintendent Krishnaraj and deputy inspector general of prisons Shanmuga Sundaram. DIG Sundaram said he was yet to receive the forwarded petition. However, he said it usually takes half an hour to 45 minutes for visitors to meet the inmates.

296,['1/03/2020'],A store powered by Goodwill,"Hyderabad: When Manjula Pallipoyena saw Sasikala (name changed) leave empty-handed for the fifth time, the 42-year-old was curious. She asked the mother of two what she wanted. “A pressure cooker,” came the reply from Sasikala who worked as a domestic help. It would cut down cooking time and give her a few extra hours with her family, she shared.

“That day, I put up a post on Facebook and arranged for a pressure cooker… I can’t articulate the joy it brought the woman,” says Manjula, beaming at the recollection. Her Goodwill store in Mehdipatnam is a one-stop destination for the poor looking for essential commodities — clothes, utensils, blankets, shoes — all for free. The garage-turned-store bustles with activity on Thursdays and Saturdays -- the two days its doors are thrown open to all — with over 70 people turning up every week.

Everything in the store is donated. Though most of items are brought by people who have heard of Manjula’s initiative through word of mouth, she also has a Facebook page that has caught the attention of good Samaritans who have reached out to contribute.

“We get everything that we need here, not just in kind, but also in way of support,” says Balamma from Mahbubnagar. The 50-year-old who works as a security guard had come to take clothes for some migrant labourers when TOI caught up with her.

The journey began about five years ago, when, on hearing about a Class 8 girl being married off at a slum near Mehdipatnam, she rushed to her house. Though she convinced the girl's parents to call off the wedding, the abject poverty of slum dwellers shook her. “I decided I had to bridge the gap between the haves and have-nots of society. The store came up in October 2015,” says Manjula, who runs it with a little help from volunteers K Srilatha and Ravinder M.

Often, it doubles up as a health camp. “They provide free consultations and medicines for the poor,” she says, hoping that her small venture inspires more people. “Imagine how many lives that would change for better,” Manjula adds.

300,['1/03/2020'],Delhi clashes: How cops lost the plot at the outset,"Security personnel conduct flag march in north east Delhi (File photo)

NEW DELHI: It appears that erroneous judgements, inadequate deployment and absence of swift decisions on the part of police led to northeast Delhi spinning out of control and 42 people being killed in a span of 36 hours. TOI spoke to several police officers whose accounts seemed to suggest this was what happened when riots broke out last Sunday.

It was around 10pm on February 22 that the first seeds of the upheaval were sowed. Around 600 women were seen proceeding through the congested lanes of Jafrabad towards the Delhi Metro station there. However, police did not intervene immediately. Sources said the local police assumed the crowd was heading to an existing protest site only to realise they had squatted in protest at the metro station itself, 500 metres from the presumed spot.

There were very few women cops to handle the predominantly female crowd, and police could not use force to disperse them. They received no orders for their dispersal from the brass, which was apparently wary of how the courts would perceive such action.

The women were joined by around 400 male protesters. A senior police officer claimed that the core group comprised non-locals. By Sunday morning, the strength of the protesters had swelled to 3,000. “While we could not remove them physically, we did not permit the erection of a dais, tents or PA system at the site,” the officer said.

By noon, the police were in a catch 22 situation. Hindu groups announced they would block the entire road, arguing that if the other community was being allowed to sit on protest there, they too should be allowed to congregate. “We tried to reason with them but they didn’t listen,” the police officer added. Soon enough, the two groups began pelting stones at each other, and police managed to bring the situation under control only late in the evening.

There are allegations that the cops did not take the developments seriously as warranted, believing it would be peaceful like in Shaheen Bagh. A senior cop countered this. “We made adequate arrangements for February 24, when the US president arrived, though the eastern range officers had been exempted. It took time to mobilise the force, but we had sufficient officers on the ground,” he claimed.

By 9am that day, rioting had broken out. What began with stone pelting degenerated into arson and vandalism. Not much later, both groups resorted to shooting with country-made and semi-automatic pistols. “The antagonistic groups were not only attacking each other, but also police. In some places, cops were caught in the middle, and in others it was a three-sided combat. However, there was limited use of firearms,” attested a source.

DCP (Shahdara) Amit Sharma and his team accompanied by three companies were attacked around 11am near a mosque at Chand Bagh. While Sharma and ACP Anuj Kumar were beaten by rioters, head constable Ratan Lal was shot dead. “The challenge now was to send reinforcements to Chand Bagh,” another officer recalled. A joint commissioner was asked to rush there with more personnel. Rumours had sent large numbers on to the streets in 20 localities, so he wasn’t able to reach. A DCP was stuck near Maujpur, so another DCP from Crime Branch and a joint commissioner were summoned. Using the Usmanpur-Pushta route, they reached Chand Bagh, and by 4pm, we had reclaimed Wazirabad and the 66-Feet Road.”

However, it was only when national security advisor Ajit Doval and special commissioner S N Shrivastava stepped in that the situation was fully managed.

When asked why the force did not go all out against the rioters at the outset, an officer asserted, “With 80,000 people to every square kilometre, northeast Delhi is among the densest areas in the country. The groups very easily mobilised 25,000 people from Jafrabad and Kardampuri in a few minutes. On December 22 last year, over 40,000 had gathered on the Jafrabad road, though things passed off peacefully then.”

The officer added, “Every step had to be calculated. Not one officer retreated. We didn’t allow any lynching on the main road. If police had been reckless, the toll would have been much higher.”

NEW DELHI: “Blood was oozing from the mouth of deputy commissioner of police(Shahdara) Amit Sharma, and he was not responding. Police were outnumbered by the mob 1:50 and the divider behind us acted as a wall. With the help of two others, we picked up Sharma and crossed three fences to take him to the hospital,” recounted Anuj Kumar , ACP (Gokulpuri) on Saturday. Kumar also sustained injuries in the violence.

Sitting on the bed at his residence, Kumar with a collar on his neck and a bandage on his forehead told TOI that stones rained on them and his helmet broke leading to an injury at the back of his head.

On Monday, Kumar, Sharma, head constable Ratan Lal and two company force personnel were deployed near a religious place at Chand Bagh on the Wazirabad road.

“It all happened between 11.30am and 12.30pm. We were instructed to ensure that the road was not blocked as it was one of the main connecting roads. However, men and women started gathering on the service road, and they gradually spilled over to the main road. Some construction work was being carried out on the service road and a lot of construction material was available there. At least 30,000 people were there till the Brijpuri T-point,” recalled Kumar.

Kumar stated that the force tried to push the crowd back. “ But people started firing and pelting stones. We were heavily outnumbered and the situation worsened in no time. Stones were flying from all over. I saw Sharma lying near the divider with blood oozing from his mouth. For a moment a sense of hopelessness went through my mind when seeing an officer in such a state, but then we had to make a way to reach him to the hospital,” said Kumar.

Injured Ratan Lal was, meanwhile, taken to the hospital from the other side of the road which heads towards Yamuna Vihar.

“I thought of firing to disperse the crowd, but then there were women. With the help of two other officers, we picked Sharma up. We climbed over three fences with Sharma in my arms and people pelting stones from all sides. A stone hit my head and my helmet broke, but we continued to move,” said Kumar, adding that they stopped a random car later to take the DCP to the hospital.

NEW DELHI: Amid the violence in northeast Delhi , Delhi Police was tasked to find a 13-year-old girl who went missing from her house in Sonia Vihar on Monday afternoon. Police swung into action fearing she could have been picked up by some rioter. Apprehending an untoward incident in a tense situation, a team of officers from Kahjoori Khas police station was immediately formed. However, they later found the girl staying at a friend’s place without informing her parents.

A police officer said that the girl went “missing” while she was on her way back from school. After she did not return home on Monday, her parents thought that she must have taken shelter at a relative/friend’s house due to the prevailing situation. When she did not reach home till Tuesday morning, the parents filed a complaint. A case of kidnapping was subsequently registered and a team under the leadership of SHO Khajoori Khas, Pawan Kumar began searching for the girl.

Investigating officials said they too initially thought she could have gone missing during the riots. But while scanning her notebooks they came across a mobile number. Police called up the number but the girl from the other side revealed her name as someone else’s. When the parents heard the recording, they identified it as their daughter’s voice. Further probe revealed that the girl had an affair.

The girl, however, later told the cops that she went to her friend’s house as she was scared of the prevailing situation.

304,['1/03/2020'],"Newly-laid hockey turf faulty, to be replaced","Panaji: The state government has ended up with an egg on its face after the hockey turf laid at the Peddem sports complex in Mapusa was found to be faulty and dangerous.

An agency approved by FIH, world’s governing body for hockey, inspected the turf in Mapusa last week and refused to provide the mandatory certification that was needed to host competitions, which includes the National Games later this year.

Left with no other option, the state government has now told the contractor and supplier to ensure that a new turf is in place.

“The turf is being replaced. There were wrinkles and creases on the turf. We tried to make things work but it’s not happening. We have jointly discovered that there was some error in the fixing of the turf. The company has now ordered for a new turf,” V M Prabhu Desai, executive director of the Sports Authority of Goa (SAG), told TOI.

Creases were discovered immediately after the artificial turf was laid at Peddem. Sources said high-ranking officials from SAG were told that the “creases are normal” and would disappear once it has been put to use.

Even before its inauguration, the SAG allowed locals to use the artificial turf ground, hoping the creases would go away. But despite several days of using the turf, the creases didn’t even out.

In fact, many of the players found the turf dangerous to use as there was increased risk of injuries.

“It will take another two months for the new turf to be laid. This will not have any impact on the National Games and will have zero financial implication (to the government). We are laying a new turf essentially for the National Games, so we will ensure that everything is in place when India’s top athletes come here,” said Prabhu Desai. The SAG executive director said there were “technical issues” that led to a faulty turf being laid.

“The contractor and supplier have both accepted the blame. It’s a technical issue,” he said.

Sources said the creases could have developed because the contractor left the rolled-turf outside for too long before getting the go ahead to lay it. There was a delay in payments by the state government that had brought work to a standstill. The turf was transported to Peddem but without the necessary payments being made, sources said, work could not progress.

Work on the construction of the hockey ground has been entrusted to M/s. Syncotts International for Rs 8.6 crore.

For 20 years now, the state government has been promising Goa’s hockey players and coach – now retired, Alexandre Remedious – that a synthetic turf would be laid in the state. For 20 years, that has remained an empty promise with the team that will now take part in the National Games left with no choice but train on outdated grass turfs.

Despite the lack of infrastructure, Goan hockey has punched above its weight. A Goa-India team lost to Portugal 3-5 in Lisbon in 2009. Fr Agnel HS, Pilar, won the Consolation Trophy at the Nehru Cup in 1995 and two teams made it as far as the quarterfinals of the National School Games.

At the Senior National Hockey Championship in Tamil Nadu, Goa scored five goals in five games; all from build-up play, took the lead in two matches, and even scored from a penalty corner. Goa’s opponents were mighty teams like All India Police, Madhya Bharat, Sports Authority of India, Hockey Coorg and Steel Plant. More recently, Goan women defeated Uttarakhand 1-0 to qualify for the pre-quarters for the first time.

The businessman had borrowed money in February, 2018. He had also returned the amount, with interest, to the lender. However, the gang is suspected to have harassed him for not paying the principal amount. The police have now launched an investigation.

Authorities said the victim had approached three of the suspects in February 2018 after he suffered losses in business. The businessman was given a loan of Rs 30 lakh — an amount he was able to clear along with interest. But the gang continued to harass him, claiming that he had only cleared the interest amount, and not the principal.

The 10 suspects, including the three from whom the businessman had borrowed the money, had barged into his home and threatened him with violence if he failed to clear the loan. The victim was also warned against going to the police. Two other individuals — a mediator and his wife — were also threatened. Police said the gang later forced the businessman to hand over his chequebook, with his signature on blank cheques.

“After the incident, the mediator’s wife lodged a police complaint against the suspects. We have booked them under relevant sections of the IPC, including sections 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman), 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 143 (punishment), 147 (punishment for rioting) and 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object) and sections 33, 39 and 45 of the Maharashtra Moneylending Act,” a police officer said.

The police officer added: “We are gathering information about how much money the businessman had paid so far and the rate of interest the suspects charged. We will make arrests soon.”

It is an additional mode of transportation to ease the traffic congestion in the two cities,” said ECoR chief spokesperson J P Mishra.

This train will not only accommodate commuters from Bhubaneswar and Cuttack but also be helpful for passengers within 25 km radius of Cuttack. The Bhubaneswar-Cuttack Jan Sadharan special train (08460) will originate from Bhubaneswar at 1.30 pm and arrive in Cuttack in 2.30 pm via Barang and Gopalpur Balikuda.

In the return direction, the train (08459) will leave Cuttack at 2.40 pm and arrive in Bhubaneswar at 5.20pm via Nergundi, Gurudijhatia, Radhakishorepur and Naraj Marthapur.

This special train will stop at Vani Vihar, Mancheswar, Patia, Bhubaneswar New, Barang, Gopalpur Balikuda and Kathajodi passenger halt. In the return direction, it will have stoppages at Kendrapara Road, Manguli Choudwar, Nergundi, Salagaon, Charbatia, Badapadagaon, Gurudijhatia, Machhapur, Radhakishorepur, Ghantikhal Nidhipur, Sarpeshwar, Naraj Marthapur, Barang, Bhubaneswar New, Patia, Mancheswar and Vani Vihar.

Besides people from the two cities, passengers from Choudwar, Athgarh, Badamba, Narasinghpur and some parts of Dhenkanal can board the train. It will run till March 31 on a trial basis.

ECoR official sources said it will be a mainline electric multiple unit (MEMU) train that the railways run in suburban and rural areas. Unlike conventional mainline trains, MEMU trains take comparatively less time to halt and leave the station because of their technology. These trains have a potential for average speed increment up to 20 km/hour compared to conventional ones.

Though Mo Bus service caters to the need of commuters in the two cities, it is not available for people staying within the 25 km radius of Cuttack. The suburban train will help people connect with cities. In 2018, chief minister Naveen Patnaik urged the Centre for metro railway but there has been no discussion on this issue so far.

Pradhane was arrested under various charges, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder, after a Class X student of a private school in the Shirti village of Shirol taluka, died due to poisoning at a hospital on Tuesday.

Police have recovered the CCTV footage from the shop that Pradhane had purchased the pesticide from. Pradhane is in police custody and is being interrogated.

An official of the educational institute, which runs the school in the Shirti village, told reporters that the institute has taken action against Pradhane and has suspended him following his arrest. The institute will take necessary actions against him as per the rules set by the government.

Meanwhile, the police officials investigating the case have stated that they took Pradhane to the shop from where he had bought the pesticide and also the place where he handed the poisonous substance to the deceased student.

“The accused has said that he had divided the pesticide into two bottles. While he gave one bottle to the victim, he threw the other bottle somewhere. We are looking for that bottle as it may help us to find the content of the pesticide,” said a police officer investigating the case.

A delegation of villagers met officials at Shirol Tehsil and demanded that the police should speed up the investigation and the guilty should be punished immediately. They also demanded that the government make provision to try the case in a fast-track court.

NEW DELHI: Former top cop Ajay Raj Sharma has accused Delhi Police of allowing the situation in northeast Delhi to snowball and turn into a riot. According to Sharma, the riot could have been prevented had the police force acted in time.

In an interview with journalist Karan Thapar for The Wire, Sharma said the first mistake made by Delhi Police was to allow the gathering at Shaheen Bagh to take place. “The gathering was clearly a violation of the law. It occurred on public property and no one had a right to block roads and create inconvenience. If cops had acted on the very first day the Shaheen Bagh gathering began, a lot that followed thereafter could have been prevented,” he said.

Apprehending that the force may have become communal, Sharma said that he would have arrested BJP leaders like Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and Kapil Mishra had he been the commissioner of the force.

Terming communal riots as the second most important challenge for a country after an enemy attack, the ex-top cop, who was in charge of the capital’s police force from 1999 to 2002, said police commissioner Amulya Patnaik was thrown a challenge, which he failed.

The former cop said that the force’s failure in controlling the violence suggested they were under political influence.

312,['1/03/2020'],Pune: One more SUV worth Rs 86 lakh of jailed developer DSK seized from ex-minister’s former PA,"The seized SUV is among the two missing vehicles that the police were trying to locate for quite some time.

PUNE: The economic offences wing of the city police on Friday seized a high-end SUV, worth Rs 86 lakh, belonging to the arrested builder DS Kulkarni alias DSK from an authorized vehicle service station at Mazgaon in Mumbai.

The vehicle, a Toyota Land Cruiser, was found in the possession of Manik Nimbalkar . He was working as a personal assistance of a former state minister, police said.

A team headed by assistant commissioner of police (crime) Shivaji Pawar and assistant inspector Sunil Gavali seized the vehicle from Mumbai, following which it was brought to the city.

Pawar said, “Once the seized SUV reached a Mazgaon service centre, its authorities immediately informed us about it, following which we seized the vehicle. We also took the statement of the person, Nimbalkar, who had sent it for servicing. Nimbalkar was working as PA to a former minister,” Pawar said.

Vijay Shivtare, former MLA from the Purandar assembly constituency and former minister of state for water resources and water conservation, confirmed that Nimbalkar used to work for him. “Yes, Nimbalkar used to work for me, though he is not associated with me right now. I don’t know much about the vehicle,” he told TOI.

The economic offences wing (EOW) has already seized 13 vehicles, including a Porsche, two BMW cars and an MV Agusta Motorcycle, from DSK in 2018 during the course of investigation in the alleged Rs 2,091-crore economic fraud by the developer and his firm. The vehicles were worth Rs 5 crore. Police have auctioned six cars of DSK so far.

Assistant commissioner of police (crime) Pawar said as the police had invoked provisions of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act against the developer and others in the case, police wanted to seize all the vehicles and properties belonging to DSK.

“During the course of investigation, we realized that two of the vehicles belonging to the developer were missing, following which a search was initiated to trace them. We found a high-end SUV (sport utility vehicle) in Mumbai, while the search for another is going on,” he said.

A senior police officer told TOI, “Since it was an SUV, we believed it would not be serviced at a roadside garage. Thus, we sent letters to different service stations across Maharashtra and requested them to inform us if any of the two vehicles was with them for servicing.”

PUNE: Senior lawyer Ujjwala Pawar , who led the state in the Elgar Parishad case proceedings before the Pune court, on Saturday relinquished charge as the district government pleader and public prosecutor.

The move comes little over a month after the Union home ministry transferred the Elgar case probe to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and a subsequent order of the Pune court on February 14, directing all the case records and seized properties to be sent to the special NIA court in Mumbai.

When contacted, Pawar told TOI, “I have relinquished my responsibility by handing over the charge to the government. I have conveyed my decision in an email to the principal secretary for law and judiciary, stating that since the term of my appointment (on a post-retirement extension) was until further orders, I am handing over the charge to the government.”

The government is now expected to appoint an officiating district government pleader and public prosecutor till the time a full-time replacement is in place.

Pawar, who specialises in criminal matters, holds the record of being the longest serving woman district government pleader in the state after she was appointed to the post here in 2011. “I am content with whatever service I have been able to render to the state in an honest manner. I shall now look forward to opportunities for conducting criminal trials as a special public prosecutor,” she said.

It was Pawar’s no-nonsense and studious approach that ensured none of the nine activists arrested so far in the Elgar case for their alleged links with the banned CPI (Maoist) organisation could get any relief — bail or otherwise. Her work stood validated in the form of various orders in relation to the case passed at different points in time by the Bombay high court and the Supreme Court.

Apart from the Elgar case, she has to her credit convictions that resulted in death penalties in many sensational cases. Those include the January 2012 rampage by state transport bus driver Santosh Mane that left nine persons dead and 27 others injured; death penalties to BT Kawade Road resident Vishwajeet Masalkar for killing his mother, wife and two-and-a-half-year-old daughter over his extra marital affair, and the mother-daughter duo of Leena and Dipti Deosthali , who were convicted for kidnapping and murdering a Pune doctor.

Mane later got reprieve from the Supreme Court, which commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment. The high court acquitted the Deosthalis of the murder charge but sentenced them to life in jail for kidnapping. The high court upheld the death sentence to Masalkar.

I have relinquished my responsibility by handing over the charge to the government. I have conveyed my decision in an email to the principal secretary for law and judiciary, stating that since the term of my appointment (on a post-retirement extension) was until further orders, I am handing over the charge to the government.

314,['1/03/2020'],"Delhi Riots: They kept rioters out, preserved amity","Social life in Babarpur has been marked by communal amity

NEW DELHI: While communal tension gripped Maujpur, less than a kilometre away, Babarpur village kept hostility at bay, with the Hindu and Muslim residents living as neighbours deciding not to be provoked into senseless violence.

“On Monday, when news of stone pelting emanated from Maujpur, senior citizens immediately called a meeting and asked the residents here not to allow outsiders entry into the village,” disclosed area resident Ajay Sharma. “We also decided to nab any suspicious people and hand them over to the residents’ welfare association or the local police.”

Sharma’s neighbour and childhood friend Waseem Khan joined the conversation to add, “Some people claimed that Muslim houses were being targeted elsewhere in northeast Delhi and that we should join the protests. But we didn’t give heed to such talk, opting instead to say at home.”

While the cops began patrolling the area, the residents took it upon themselves to take the rounds of the village in batches, especially at night. “Our only objective was to keep goons or anti-socials away from our area. We were worried that the harmony shared by the people here would be affected by the presence of such people,” said Desh Raj.

Social life in Babarpur has been marked by communal amity. Mohammad Imran shared how all Muslims keenly wait to partake of the bhandara organised every year at the local temple and how dishes prepared during the Eid celebration are distributed to all Hindu houses. Mangu Singh affirmed that his Muslim landlord was very protective about his family. “I saw a few tenants in my neighbourhood collecting stones to deal with any unforeseen incident, but I convinced them that no violence would take place here,” said Singh.

In Mustafabad, amid the hatred, chaos and violence, this spirit of amity was in evidence at the Mankameshwar Mandir. Muslims sacrificed sleep the whole night to protect the Shiva temple from attacks by rioters. They also assisted Hindus employees of a sweet shop to leave the area when rioting broke out.

The mandir is surrounded by Muslim residences. As soon as reports of vandalism at a mosque in Ashok Vihar started being circulated, the residents became angry, “But we didn’t let anyone attack the temple,” claimed carpenter Mohammad Khalid. “Most of those indulging in violence were people from outside our localities. It was our responsibility to make sure our Hindu brothers and sisters did not face hostility.”

Harikant Sharma, the son of temple priest Indradev Shastri, commended the act of the local Muslims. “It was the Muslims who ensured our safety and protected the temple,” he corroborated. “Policemen were nowhere to be seen during all this, and if not for the locals we don’t know what could have happened.”

Mukesh Kumar, who runs a sweet shop in Mustafabad, expressed gratefulness at how the local Muslims alerted him to the violence in the nearby areas on Monday and helped him reach his home in Nand Nagri. “I have never seen anything like this before. I can’t even imagine how it all began,” said Mukesh, who returned to Mustafabad on Saturday to open his shop and meet with the locals.

315,['1/03/2020'],Savitribai Phule Pune University to launch solar panel walled building,"'Experience Centre' will be inaugurated by Sharad Pawar on Sunday.

PUNE: The Savitribai Phule Pune University is set to inaugurate what it claims to be the first solar panel walled building in the country, with its glass facade mounted with panels made of cadmium telluride photovoltaic cells instead of the silicon-based cells.

The facility, being pegged as “Experience Centre” by the university’s energy studies department, will be inaugurated by Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar at 9am on Sunday.

The panels would be mounted on the glass facade of the building covering an area of 200 sqft, the department officials said.

“Unlike the silicon solar panels, the Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) photovoltaic cells are transparent and bring in natural light. Because the walls are made of glass, the building would also give the people inside the structure a feeling of being in an open space,” director of School of Energy Studies at SPPU Sandesh Jadkar said.

He said the walls would generate 19 units of electricity per day. “We consume this much energy to run a four-tonne air conditioner, TV, projector, induction stove light and computers, among others,” Jadkar said. The building is a prototype model funded by SolarScape Enterprises .

“The building would be used to research on improving the efficiency of CdTe. In Pune, we have many structures with a glass façade. Hopefully, this model would give them an idea of how to use these CdTe imprinted glasses. If done right, dependability on clean energy could be improved,” Jadkar said.

He, however, said the cost factor and comparatively less efficiency of CdTe could hamper the popularity of such structures.

“We have taken the crime and atrocities against the Dalits seriously and would act in these matters. If there was any shortcomings in the administration and the home department, they would be addressed. After all, it is a matter of reputation of the state,” said Pilot.

Pilot had arrived here to attend the wedding of party leader Karan Singh Uchiyarda straight from Delhi after submitting a report to party chief Sonia Gandhi.

He said all the aspects of the incidents have been mentioned in the report and the government was doing its duty.

“I have given the report to the party president and the government has also been doing is duty. But apart from transfer or other action, we needed to give a political message that in our government, we would exercise zero-tolerance towards such incidents against Dalits,” said Pilot.

“It was our duty to control these crimes and instill confidence among them that it would not happen again,” Pilot said while sharing the concern of the party for atrocities against Dalits.

Emphasising repeatedly on fixing of responsibilities, Pilot said until responsibilities for such incidents are not fixed, the fear of recurrence of such incidents would always be looming.

“For this, we would have to further strengthen the home department”, he said.

Referring to corruption in the system specially in the context of bajri mining, Pilot said harsh action, irrespective of the status, stature and influence of the corrupt, would have to be taken to root out corruption.

Talking about the violence in Delhi, he said investigation will find out the reason of riots and who were responsible.

“There was lacunae on the part of both central and Delhi government. Whosoever is responsible will have to be punished,” he said.

It hosts the famous Balumama temple. Adamapur has the Samadhi (tomb) of the famous 19th century saint Sadguru Balumama which makes it one of the frequently visited destinations by devotees from across the state borders.

How to reach

Located in Bhudargad tehsil of the district, one has to cover a distance of 45 km to reach Adamapur from the city. Travellers can take the Kolhapur-Gargoti route until they reach the Mudhal Titta village. From there, one has to take a left deviation and head further for another 2 km to reach Adamapur.

Legend has it

The Balumama temple at Adamapur is built using white marble and has intricate and beautifully carved walls. Ashok Patil, manager of the Balumama Devasthan Trust, said, “Shri Balumama was a shepherd from the Dhangar community. While sheep-herding, he performed several miracles and helped a lot of poor and downtrodden people and solved their problems. Thus, he attained sainthood. He was believed to be an incarnation of Lord Shiva. Balumama was born in a village called Akkol in Chikkodi tehsil of Belgavi district. He spent most of his time in Adamapur in Kolhapur district which is also the place where he took his last breath. Today, the temple trust runs a multi-speciality hospital, Bhakt Niwas and Annachhatra on a charity basis. Also, a museum is set to be opened soon where devotees could witness the clothes, things and utensils used by the saint during his days. There is a Peepal tree in front of the temple with three major sub-branches to it which is a rare thing. Devotees offer coins near the tree while offering prayers.”

Surroundings

Visiting this place on a weekend can prove to be an amazing experience, especially for nature lovers. This place has the perfect combination of nature and spirituality. Yashwant Patil, a resident of Adamapur, said, “Along with pleasant and cool atmosphere, one can find farmlands on either side of road leading to the village where sugarcane, paddy, marigold, cashew and tamarind is produced on a large scale”.

322,['1/03/2020'],Pune: Slum Rehabilitation Authority schemes may go vertical to build more on less space,"TimesView SRA officials have decided to opt for ‘vertical development’ model by enhancing the Floor Space Index limit to attract more developers. High-rises put enormous pressure on the existing infrastructure, including water supply. There is a need to assess the possible impact of such buildings on the existing infrastructure. A plan should be readied and executed to augment the service lines and avoid traffic congestion before the skyscrapers are allowed to come up.

Maintenance A Task In Tall Buildings

PUNE: Sky scrappers are expected to come up as Slum Rehabilitation Authority ( SRA ) projects after the state government removes height restrictions and frees up Floor Space Index. The move aims at accommodating more slum dwellers in these schemes using limited available space.The urban development and housing ministry recently decided that the construction of SRA schemes in Pune will be done on the lines of Mumbai.Developers are not coming forward as building ‘free sale houses’ under the SRA is not economically viabl, and many said steps are needed to make such projects feasible.“The construction of SRA schemes has become tough, and lack of land is our biggest hurdle in rehabilitation. Vertical development is the only option available as of now,” chief executive officer of SRA Rajendra Nimbalkar told TOI.A TOI report on SRA schemes in Mumbai in November 2019 said they were solely driven by offering high floor space index (FSI) to builders as a sop. But, over the years, housing activists have complained that while slum families are put up in narrow buildings with little light and ventilation in a small portion of the plot, the larger area is used to build spacious apartments in towers, and sold at a high profit.Nimbalkar said development control rules will be adhered to while granting such permissions in Pune. The Pune Municipal Corporation ’s data indicate that the rates of TDR per sq ft have gone down from Rs 3,000 to Rs 800 due lack of demand.“The lull in demand for Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) in the market is adding to the problems. Developers don’t want to build SRA schemes against TDR. They want some free sale properties in the scheme so that the funds for the SRA scheme can be generated through such sales,” Nimbalkar said.“If a private builder builds a high-rise for buyers, the same type of load is generated on the infrastructure like roads and water. When solutions for big societies are found, then they can be found for the SRAs too. We will find answers for rehabilitation projects too. The idea is to move to a slum free city which can be achieved only through vertical development of buildings,” he added.Activists are concerned about the stress on infrastructure and the maintenance of the slum rehabilitation buildings if sky scrapers are allowed as slum rehabilitation authority (SRA) projects. Current SRA projects are already facing problems due to improper management, they added.Maintaining cleanliness, garbage disposal and upkeep of elevators have become headaches in these buildings. Residents not familiar with elevators do not know how to operate them leading to frequent break downs. Once the elevators become non operational, nobody takes the initiative to repair them and residents have to take the stairs.Sadanand Shetty, a developer of SRA schemes, said residents find it difficult to look after the buildings once they are handed over. Occupants will have to make the effort to maintain their houses and amenities, he added.“Sensitisation of residents has to be taken up on priority before they shift to SRA schemes as there is a change in lifestyle while living in high-rises. Otherwise, SRA projects won’t prove successful,” he said.Shetty said sanitation and solid waste management are not easy in such societies. Lack of funds for maintenance creates hurdles in regular upkeep.Open spaces are often treated as garbage dumps.

On Saturday, the minimum temperature in Shivajinagar and Lohegaon was 15.9°C and 18.7°C, respectively, about 3-4 degrees notches above normal in both the locations.

The Met department officials stated that the next few days would record a further rise in the minimum temperature. The mercury would climb to 16-17°C in Shivajinagar. In Lohegaon, the minimum temperature is likely to rise to 19°C during the next few days.

The minimum temperatures have shot up across Madhya Maharashtra, with 1-6°C positive departures. This has translated into significantly above-normal temperatures, a Met department official said.

The minimum temperatures on Saturday were above normal at many places across Madhya Maharashtra. Sangli recorded the highest minimum temperature, with the mercury rising to 22.3°C — almost 6 degrees above normal.

Ahmednagar was the only district in Madhya Maharashtra where the observatory recorded a below-normal minimum temperature of 11.9°C. This was also the lowest minimum temperature in India over the plains on Saturday, according to the Met department.

324,['1/03/2020'],No toll at Khed-Shivapur for Pune and PCMC vehicles until issues resolved,"PUNE: Commuters from Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad driving to and from Satara via Khed-Shivapur will not have to pay toll until the issues inconveniencing them were resolved, stated the district administration and the authority managing the toll booth.

An official from Reliance Infrastructure , which is managing the toll booth, said MP Supriya Sule and Union minister for transport Nitin Gadkari’s meeting was scheduled this week, to discuss the issues pertaining to the stretch. Until they were resolved, the toll for vehicles plying from Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad would be free. They will just have to show their ID cards, the official added.

The toll removal action committee was demanding the Khed-Shivapur toll plaza to be relocated outside the limits of the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA). However, the decision would be taken by the higher authorities, the Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram said.

In January, the collector had directed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to build additional toll booths and lanes at the Khed-Shivapur toll plaza to ease traffic flow. “Under first phase of the work, there are five lanes at the Khed-Shivapur toll plaza, work for which has commenced. Of them, two lanes are dedicated to local commuters,” he said.

MP Supriya Sule on Saturday told TOI that she would hold discussions with Gadkari to resolve the issues.

A state government official said the Khed-Shivapur toll plaza was under the NHAI and to shift it to another location would not be easy as the distance between two toll plazas should be at least 60km.

Another official from Reliance Infrastructure said at present, additional booths of five lanes were ready towards Pune. “The trial was conducted on Friday. These lanes will be operated depending on the traffic flow on Sunday. They will be fully equipped in about 10 days. The booths are ready for operation in temporary-mode and rest of the plans would be completed as per the proposed timeline,” Amit Bhatia, the regional head of the west region of Reliance Infrastructure, said.

326,['1/03/2020'],Officials ignoring court matters to be pulled up for neglect,"Panaji: Officials of departments, corporations or autonomous bodies not taking court matters seriously will be taken to task. A circular in this respect has been issued after the Supreme Court imposed heavy fines on the state government for not filing a counter affidavit in one matter.

“All government departments, corporations and autonomous bodies are informed that whenever a response is not filed within time before the Supreme Court, National Green Tribunals or any other courts, or the matter/s are not attended on priority, the same will be viewed seriously,” law secretary Chokhan Ram Garg said in the circular.

Garg said some instances have come to their notice where, despite being served a notice by the apex count, no file or proposal has been moved by the departments for appointment of a standing counsel in the matter. As a result, the matter remains unattended on behalf of the state and the court imposes heavy fines for not filing out a counter affidavit/response in the matter.

“This issue is a clear sign of negligence on the part of departments,” Garg said.

He said that whenever departments or offices receive notices from any courts, authorities or tribunals, they should immediately submit their proposal for appointment of a standing counsel/advocates in the matter to defend the state’s interest. Simultaneously, a copy of the notice, summons or writs, along with the copy of the petition, must be marked and submitted to the law secretary within 24 hours of the receipt of the same.

The standing counsels before the apex court have also said that on instances, when they have tried to contact department officials, even on an urgent basis, they have failed to respond.

“The head of the department should ensure that a nodal officer is appointed for every matter pending before the Supreme Court,” he said.

327,['1/03/2020'],Yamuna water to help resolve water crisis in Mussoorie,"Mussoorie: The “bhoomi poojan” ceremony for a new pumping project was initiated on Saturday in which water from Yamuna river would be extracted to meet the water demands of Mussoorie town.

The ceremony took place at Yamuna Bridge, about 30 kilometres from Mussoorie and was attended among other by Tehri MP Mala Rajya Lakshmi Shah and Mussoorie legislator Ganesh Joshi.

The pumping project has an outlay of Rs 144 crore and can supply up to 12 million litres per day (mld) from Yamuna river – which flows to the north of Mussoorie.

Joshi alleged that the scheme, once operational, would resolve the water crisis in Musoorie.

“Mussoorie faces a huge water crisis, especially during the summer months. Through this pumping scheme, the town’s water demand will be fulfilled at least for the next 30 years,” the MLA claimed.

Funded by the Centre, the water pumping scheme is expected to be completed in the next two years.

Sharing the technical details of the project, executive engineer of Peyjal Nigam, Subhash Chandra told TOI that under the scheme, water would be pumped from the Yamuna river to Radha Bhawan in Mussoorie.

“Water will be pumped in four stages and will be lifted from a height of 1,500 metres from Yamuna to Mussoorie. The total length of the pipeline, from the river to the town, would be around 17 km,” Chandra said.

Officials further said that a reservoir of 4,000 kilo-litre capacity would be constructed at Mussoorie from where the Yamuna water would be distributed across the town through the existing pipelines and also through additional pipelines that would be laid in the upcoming days.

“Starting from 2022, around 6 mld would be supplied to fulfill the current shortfall. The quantity would be increased in the later years based on increasing demand. It is expected that this project would fulfill the water demand at least up to 2052,” Chandra said.

Notably, Mussoorie draws its water from 20-odd springs and brooks that are currently supplying 7.69 mld water per day while the peak demand is over 13.5 mld.

Meanwhile, on Saturday, some villagers from nearby Bhidiyana village also reached the site and accused the officials of not informing them about the programme while also demanding compensation for land to be acquired for the project.

Peyjal Nigam officials told the villagers that compensation proceedings were underway.

328,['1/03/2020'],Pune: Zilla Parishad promises land for trash treatment plant,"PUNE: The Zilla Parishad authorities on Saturday said gram panchayats in Hinjewadi, Maan and Marunji would be provided 2-3 acres of land to set up a garbage treatment plant.

At present, waste is picked up by private contractors as well as unregulated vendors who dump and burn the garbage, which pollutes the environment in the IT hub, said members and office bearers of registered cooperative housing societies in Hinjewadi, Maan, Marunji.

A town hall meeting, held under the chairmanship of the Pune Zilla Parishad CEO Ayush Prasad, was attended by villagers and members of housing societies from the IT hub. Issues related to garbage burning and disposal, water, sewage treatment plant and property tax were discussed at the meeting.

An alternative land would be sought by the Zilla Parishad from the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) or the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) to process and treat garbage for a cluster of four villages in the Hinjewadi area, said Prasad, who had conducted the first round of hearing with the villagers and residents of the IT hub.

He said he had already held a round of talks with the PMRDA and the gram panchayats could buy land on ready reckoner rate from the authority.

With the three gram panchayat areas largely dependent on tankers, Zilla Parishad authorities said water will be brought from the Kasarsai dam through a pipeline for the water scheme cleared by the government. For that, only an NOC from the MIDC and PMRDA will be required, he said. “I am told that 0.15 TMC water will be required. We will plan the water scheme within eight to nine months.” he said.

At present, there is no piped water supply to over 50 large complexes in Hinjewadi and Maan, while only a few societies in Maan get limited piped water supply. Overall, the entire area is heavily dependent on private water tankers, which has crippled the financial health of the societies, the residents pointed out.

The residents also stated that the Hinjewadi water supply scheme was approved by the government in 2014 and was to be implemented by ZP, Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran and gram panchayat for lifting water from Kasarsai dam. The budget of Rs 17.86 crore was approved, but work was held up due to protests by local farmers in Kasarsai.

The ZP has since proposed a water supply scheme for the villages in Hinjewadi, Maan, Sus, Nande, Chande, Mahalunge and are in the process of taking the necessary approval from the irrigation department and district administration. The ZP CEO assured residents that the matter would be expedited.

Over 100 representatives from societies and townships attended the town hall meeting. “We have been pressing for better garbage and water management issues for the last three years,’’ said Ravindra Sinha, a member of Hinjewadi Industrial Residents.

329,['1/03/2020'],Pune: Burglar caught by society residents after hot chase,"The burglary occurred at Vidyaniketan Housing Society in Undri on Thursday.

PUNE: Minutes after a gang of burglars broke into a flat at Vidyaniketan housing society at Undri on Thursday and stole cash and ornaments worth Rs 8.66 lakh, residents caught one of them after a hot chase.

Nazim Ansari, a criminal-on-record, was caught with a part of the loot worth Rs2.25 lakh and handed over to the police by the residents. Kondhwa police are on the lookout for Ansari’s two accomplices who are on the run.

The flat owner, Sameer Shaikh (43), has lodged an FIR under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.

Shaikh told TOI, “I was in my garage at Bhavani Peth . My wife had gone out to fetch my son from school at Sayyednagar. Most resident of the society had gone to a neighbouring building to attend a meeting on water scarcity. The burglars took advantage of the situation and struck at my flat on the first floor after finding the door locked.”

He said that burglars broke into his flat after breaking open the door lock with a sharp weapon. “They stole gold and silver ornaments and cash worth Rs Rs8.66 lakh from the cupboard safe and took to heels,” Shaikh said.

“My neighbour Vijay Chavan heard noise of locks being broken from inside the flat and then spotted the burglars leaving the flat. Chavan alerted his friend Ganesh Raut who rushed to the society. On seeing them, the panicked burglars ran helter-skelter, but my neighbours chased and nabbed Ansari with a bag at Undri Chowk and handed him over to the police,” he said.

Ganesh Raut told TOI, “I was riding a motorcycle when I entered the society and saw Chavan raising an alarm and chasing the burglars. I too gave them a chase and pelted stones at them, but they escaped in a waiting autorickshaw. I chased the rickshaw and intercepted it at Undri Chowk. Though two burglars manage to flee, we caught Ansari and handed him over to the police.”

“Ansari has revealed the names of his accomplices to the police. I have requested our building residents to form a society, appoint trained security guards and install CCTV cameras,” Shaikh said.

Sub-inspector Santosh Shinde from Kondhwa police said, “Ansari is a criminal-on-record. We have recovered part of the stolen loot and some weapons from him. He will remain in police custody till March 2. We are working on certain clues and hope to arrest his two aides at the earliest.”

330,['1/03/2020'],"After SC rap, lawyers of Doon district court work on Saturday, call off 35-yr-old strike","DEHRADUN: Ending the over three-decade-old practice of striking work in the district court of Dehradun every Saturday — in support of their demand to have a bench of the Nainital high court in the region — lawyers of the court worked on Saturday, the first time in 35 years.

The Supreme Court on Friday had held the strike called by lawyers of the district courts of Dehradun as well as some parts of Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar districts every Saturday as “illegal” and had asked the advocates to end their strike as it amounted to “obstruction of access to justice.”

Reacting to the SC ruling, Manmohan Kandwal, president of the Dehradun Bar Association , told TOI, “We respect the Supreme Court guidelines and from now on, will work on Saturday as well. Our protest was essentially linked to the common man and was being held to highlight the problems that litigants were having while travelling to Nainital for their cases.”

He added that the lawyers’ association still felt that there was a need for a high court bench in Dehradun as well. “Nainital is a tourist city and litigants have no other option but to stay in expensive hotels, which adds to their financial burden. It would therefore be good if a bench is set up in the state capital as well.”

Significantly, before the formation of Uttarakhand, lawyers had been demanding for a western Uttar Pradesh bench of Allahabad high court . After Uttarakhand was formed in 2000, lawyers continued to observe strike on every Saturday, but now to press for their demand of a bench of the high court in Dehradun or Haridwar.

In September last year, the Uttarakhand high court had ruled that strikes and boycott of court work by lawyers was illegal, as it “violates fundamental right of speedy trial and delays justice.” While hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL), the double bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Alok Verma had held that “strike or boycott of court work is a misconduct for which disciplinary action can be taken by the state bar council and its disciplinary committee.”

The HC had directed that district judges should ensure that the court functions on all working Saturdays and senior superintendents of police should provide police protection to ensure smooth functioning of the courts. Subsequently, an appeal had been filed against the high court’s verdict in the apex court which came up for hearing this week in the bench of Justices Arun Mishra and MR

Senior inspector Anil Shewale of the Chatushrungi police said, “The elderly man is a retired employee of India Meteorological Department (IMD). The man’s account linked to a UPI-based application had the money he had received from the central government after retirement.”

He said, “On October 11 last year, the man wanted to send a small amount to someone. But the UPI application continuously showed him the ‘server down’ message.”

Shewale said, “After the man failed to transfer the money, he decided to run an online search for the UPI (Unified Payments Interface) application’s helpline number.”

He said, “After finding a number, he made a call on it. A telecaller asked him to download a link, which he would receive on his cellphone in a text message.”

After downloading the link, the elderly man shared a number with the telecaller. “The suspects then siphoned off the money effecting as many as 15 transactions,” Shewale said.

“The elderly man realized that someone was siphoning off money from his UPI and contacted the branch concerned. But it was too late,” he said.

According to police, the man had downloaded a remote access software application on his cellphone and gave access of his device to the suspects unknowingly. “Once the suspects got the password of the UPI application, they made the transactions,” he said.

The police have booked the suspects.

While demand for chicken has crashed by almost 65%, demand for fish has skyrocketed.Besides the fear of coronavirus, the reported outbreak of Very Virulent Newcastle Disease (VVND) in a poultry farm in the Godavari districts have further fuelled fears.Data revealed that cost of chicken fell by 50% in the last three weeks and there has been a simultaneous rise in the cost of mutton. Consequently, sale of fishes has risen, being the only cheaper alternative available.Nowadays it is not out of ordinary to see long queues at fish markets. Speaking to TOI, Ramesh who runs a retail live fish unit at Patamata Lanka fish market, said “We usually see a huge demand on Sundays. But we are witnessing sales throughout the week. Buyers are showing interest in freshwater fish and we have arranged for small tanks to promote sales. Meanwhile, aquafarmers have increased their prices by Rs 40 per kilogram.

PUNE: Air Marshal Amit Dev, Air Officer-in-Charge (personnel) of the Indian Air Force (IAF), said on Saturday that research and strategic thinking were the key elements for utilisation of combat powers in the current security scenario.

He was speaking to reporters after signing an MoU with the department of defence and strategic studies of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) for establishing a chair of excellence in the name of IAF Marshal Arjan Singh for the resident scholar programme (RSP) for IAF officers.

Air Marshal SS Soman (retired), who commanded the Western Air Command , will be the first head of the chair. “Some people from the force can take leave and study and conduct research on strategic subjects. This move will certainly bring a positive difference to the service. We are looking for scholar warriors. As technology is advancing rapidly, we need strategic thinking to utilise elements of various combat powers that are with the force,” Dev said.

This is the first time that the IAF has collaborated with any university in the country.

“There are very few universities in the country which run courses related to defence strategic studies. The SPPU has been conducting this course since 1963. In fact, it has adequate resources, conducive environment and enough experience in the field. This is the reason why the IAF chose SPPU,” said Dev, a fighter pilot of the IAF.

“About eight to ten IAF officers will do research on national security subjects at the department,” said Vijay Khare, head of the department.

Vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar described it as a historic moment for the university. “The chair will bridge the gap between the armed forces and academia,” he said.

The device was developed by the city-based High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL) of the Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ) in 2018.

“Several security agencies, including Maharashtra ATS and Telangana police have tested the device in the last few months. They have informed us that their field results were positive. They had put forth some additional requirements, which will be added in the device,” HEMRL director KPS Murthy told TOI on Friday.

Mass production of the device will be done through transfer of technology (ToT), he said. “Currently, two private firms are bidding for the ToT,” added Murthy.

This device is useful for homeland security and civil security operations at airports, railway stations, shopping malls, multiplexes, schools, colleges, universities and all strategic locations. This device can also play a crucial role in post-blast analysis.

337,['1/03/2020'],"Andhra Pradesh: Fixed charges back; petrol, diesel become dearer again","Representative image

VIJAYAWADA: The government on Saturday increased the fixed charge component in value added tax ( VAT ) on petrol and diesel in the state. The hike will see petrol become dearer by 76 paise, while diesel will cost Rs 1.07 extra per litre. The new rates will come into force from the first hour on Sunday.

The government had, on January 29, made changes to the VAT tariffs by removing the earlier fixed charge on petrol and diesel. The tariffs were revised from 31% on petrol to 35.2%, and from 22.25% to 27% on diesel. By increasing the tariff, the government removed the fixed charge of Rs 2 per litre being collected on both petrol and diesel. Now, the tariffs have been reverted to the previous 31% and 22.25% on petrol and diesel respectively, but the fixed charge component has been reintroduced. In place of Rs 2 per litre, the fixed charges have now become Rs 2.76 on petrol and Rs 3.07 on diesel per litre.

The fall in prices of crude oil in the international market and the removal of fixed charge component had an adverse affect on the government’s coffers. Earlier, the government used to get fixed revenue from the sale of petrol and diesel despite the fluctuation in prices. But the recent fall in fuel prices has resulted in fall in revenues. The move to reintroduce the fixed charge is being seen as an attempt to bridge that gap.

AP has been collecting the highest VAT on petrol and diesel when compared to its southern counterparts. Photos of fuel stations putting up huge banners comparing local fuel prices to that in AP in the border areas of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to attract consumers have gone viral on social media many times before.

339,['1/03/2020'],Maharashtra: 4 leopard cubs spotted on sugar cane fields at 2 villages in Junnar,"The three cubs found in Rajuri village

PIMPRI CHINCHWAS: Four leopard cubs were spotted at two villages — three at Rajuri and one at Gunjalwadi — of Junnar taluka , around 17km from Otur and 123km from the city, on Saturday morning during sugar cane harvesting.

Sugar cane is cultivated on a large scale in these villages. Round forest officer SK Salunke of Ale said, “Labourers were harvesting sugar cane on farmer Shivaji Gatkal’s field at Rajuri when they spotted three leopard cubs around 11.30am.”

He said the forest department had left the cubs at the same spot on the field in anticipation that the mother leopard would come searching for them.

Gatkal said, “The labourers called me when they saw the cubs sitting at a small cleared space on the field. The harvesting activity was stopped immediately as the labourers were afraid of the mother leopard coming back. We notified the forest department.”

Gatkal said a tractor driver coming to his field to collect sugar cane spotted a big leopard, from a distance, in the morning.

Another cub was found at Gunjalwadi village, around 4km away from Narayangaon. Round forest officer Manisha Kale of Narayangaon said, “Farmer Arvind Dongare has a field in the village near Meena river. Three cubs wandered out when sugar cane was being cut on the field around 11am. Two of them scampered back into the thicket of uncut sugar cane, leaving behind the 25-day-old female cub. The forest team reached the spot after villagers informed us about it.”

Kale said the forest officials left the cub in the field hoping that its mother would take her away at night.

342,['1/03/2020'],Developed economies pulling the ladder from developing peers: India’s WTO envoy,"Former RBI governor at the Asia Economic Dialogue on Saturday.

PUNE: India’s ambassador to the World Trade Organisation JS Deepak on Saturday said developed economies, especially the United States, were imposing unfair terms and trying to dilute reforms at the WTO to the detriment of the developing nations.

“The agenda of the US is basically a reaction of them losing many cases at the appellate body of the WTO (World TRade Organisation), and many of their laws are being successfully challenged. In the name of national security or otherwise, they want to get out of commitments they had made in terms of tariffs,” he said, while speaking as a part of a panel chaired by former RBI governor Urjit Patel at the Asia Economic Dialogue organised by the Pune International Centre.

Deepak alleged that the US was trying to remove statutes from the WTO rules that they took advantage of, including removal of flexibilities for developing countries, so as to return to the era of bilateral trade deals.

He largely praised the WTO’s role in maintaining multilateral trade all over the world and underlined the effect of free trade, bringing millions of people all over the world out of poverty, besides offering consumer choice. He also offered a word of caution.

“Free trade has had both good and bad effects. There is of course a backlash against free trade these days because it had disruptive effects too. The steel industry in the US and the electronics industry in India have been wiped out by free trade,” Deepak said.

He said the US was funding thinktanks and other measures to implement its own WTO reforms agenda, which was centred on the fear of “the rise of the rest, including China, India and South Africa, among others”.

Deepak also cited examples of politicians who professed free trade, but went on to impose tariffs. “We had President Donald Trump going to Davos and affirming his commitment to free trade. But after return to the US, he imposed tariffs on hundreds of goods and services. Similarly, we had Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi speak at Davos and say that the country would be open without protectionism, but in the budget, we had tariffs going up. So, good economics of liberalisation does not seem to be good politics, as far as trade is concerned,” he added.

343,['1/03/2020'],"SIT starts probe, searches conducted at several places","Vijayawada: A team from the SIT , constituted to probe the alleged irregularities, which took place during the TDP regime, conducted searches in the house and offices of former minister Prathipati Pulla Rao’s relative Basavaiah on Friday. They inquired into his land transactions in the last five years in and around Amaravati.

Similar searches were conducted at the residence and offices of a builder from Vijayawada on the suspicion that he was acting as a Benami for Pulla Rao. They searched his house for documents related to land transactions, which may have taken place through his firm in the capital region.

Another SIT team conducted searches in the house of one Subhani, who works as a carpenter. He purchased a piece of land in the capital region, according to sources.

He is also suspected to be a benami to another person accused in the case. Houses of suspected benamis who made land purchases in capital region without proper source of income were also searched.

The SIT, which was given a wide-ranging powers to investigate the irregularities, has focussed on suspected benami land transactions, which took place in the capital region.

Meanwhile, on Saturday, the SIT also searched the residence of senior TDP leader and former chairman of Kanchikacherla Agriculture Market committee in Krishna district, Nannapaneni Lakshminarayana.

Officials had served search notices to Lakshminarayana on Friday. But, since his residence at Kanchikacherla was locked and his family members were unavailable, the officials pasted the search notices to the walls of his house and posted police personnel outside the house to prevent any outsider from entering the house. Lakshminarayana and his family members, who had gone to the hospital on Friday, returned home on Saturday.

Sources said SIT searched the residence for more than three hours and seized a few documents. Lakshminarayana’s son-in-law D Srinivasa Rao served as a government advocate general during the previous TDP government and Lakshminarayana’s son N Sitharamaraju is a real-estate business and he was also one of the sub-contractors of the Polavaram project in the TDP regime.

SIT officials suspect that Lakshminarayana and his family members might have been involved in the alleged insider trading (land purchase) in the Amaravati region.

As a cabinet sub-committee and CID prima facie identified the transactions pertaining to more than 4,000 acres of land in the capital region as part of the insider trading and benami transactions, the SIT is now digging deep into each transaction. It was also identified that some of the land were purchased by white ration cards holders, which are all suspected as benami transactions.

344,['1/03/2020'],"Hooghly water unfit for bathing, Dakshineswar worst: Study","TimesView A concerted approach involving upstream states, where many of bigger river systems originate, is necessary. Many of our rivers are still used as sewerage systems and this must stop.

KOLKATA: Water in the 17 rivers monitored by the state pollution control board (PCB) do not meet the bathing standard, putting several lakh who live along the rivers and bathe there at risk. The worst-hit area is Dakshineswar that attracts 50,000 devotees daily. Of the 44 locations where water quality was tested, Dakshineswar has the worst biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) level, implying that the pollution load is so high that it is difficult for even fish to breathe in the water here.None of 14 monitoring locations along the Ganga, five in the Himalaya and north, 19 in the west, including 10 locations at Damodar and six in the upper and lower Ganga delta rivers currently meet the bathing standard (5mg/litre dissolved oxygen; 3ml/litre biochemical oxygen demand and 500MPN/100ml coliform bacteria) revealed a report prepared by NGO Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment (LIFE) after analysing the water quality data compiled by PCB.Admitting that the rivers were choking and needed a break from the untreated sewage flowing into them, PCB chairman Kalyan Rudra said the watchdog agency’s target was to ensure that water in rivers improves to achieve the bathing standard.The report has also pointed out discrepancies in activities recorded by the watchdog agency and classification of rivers. “Designating the right use-based classification is a prerequisite for curbing pollution as the permissible limit of separate parameters is different for each class. For example, the level of total coliform (TC) needs to be brought down to 500 MPN (most probable number)/100ml if the water has to be made suitable for ‘Class B’(outdoor bathing). For ‘Class C’, or water that can be made fit for drinking with conventional treatment, the TC can remain at 5,000MPN/100ml. A higher level of TC indicates the presence of disease-causing organisms (pathogens),” said LIFE analyst Kankana Das.Rudra said water in the rivers are now a lot more polluted than when the classifications were done a couple of decades ago. “The ecological flow of the rivers, or their ability to flush the sediment load and dilute pollutants has since reduced. We have to stop flow of further drainage into rivers,” he said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74425388,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-148231,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/study-hooghly-water-unfit-for-bathing-dakshineswar-worst/articleshow/74421417.cms

New Delhi: Relief poured in for the riot-hit people on Sunday as volunteers from diverse spectrums documented losses, distributed food and provided legal help. At GTB Hospital , independent lawyers were seen providing monetary as well as legal help.

Senior advocate HS Phulka and spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravishankar were among those who visited the riot-affected areas. Police officers could be seen making note of the damage. They approached owners and recorded videos of them narrating their ordeal.

Sri Sri said people should take lessons from those who saved lives. “We should punish the anti-social elements. It is so disturbing to see so many people affected. We need to bring the lives back on track,” he said.

Naresh Aggarwal, owner of a sweets shop in Khajuri Khas, said: “My shop was locked when it was vandalized by goons. Last year, I had sold my wife’s jewellery to renovate it.” Phulka, accompanied by Khalsa Aid volunteers, spoke to shop owners. He said: “High court lawyers are voluntarily coming out to help the victims. We are working in coordination with Khalsa Aid as they have experience in this field. Our first priority is to ensure that people get their means of livelihood back.”

A delegation arrived from Nizamuddin Dargah in Babu Nagar to provide food to the refugees. Md Abdullah, the local Imam, said there were hundreds of people who had arrived in the colony to take shelter. Karan Pal (22) and his family had brought food for the security personnel on duty. “We are taking care of our fauji brothers who are helping everyone,” Pal said.

Right outside the morgue at GTB Hospital in Dilshad Garden , volunteers could be seen offering food, water and tea to the family of the victims. The group is working in shifts, from 9am to 9.30pm. “We are locals. We came here and saw people facing problems. We decided to pitch in,” Gulzar Ahmed (46) said. Teachers of a government school in Tukhmirpur in northeast Delhi also got together and distributed rations at Shiv Vihar. Dinesh Kumar, a political science teacher, said: “Motivated by other teachers, I came forward to help.”

“We are fighting coronavirus with great capability and responsibility. We are setting an example for the world in facing future challenges,” he said during a session on ‘Global Value Chains’ at the ongoing Asian Economic Dialogue in the city.

“We are confident that with the kind of cooperation and concerted effort, we shall win this war against coronavirus. With this, we shall fight against other challenges the humanity will face in the future,” Guocai said.

As of now, the Chinese government at all levels was making a tremendous effort focused on fighting the contagion and containing its spread, he said. At the same time, the other challenge remained in revitalizing China’s economy, which was nothing short of another battle, Guocai said.

He said, “A megacity like Wuhan has been placed under scientific quarantine. Adequate focus, in terms of precautionary measures, is being put on the manufacturing hubs in China’s coastal provinces, including Shanghai and Guangdong. The manufacturing industries in the coastal provinces, too, have responded positively to the crisis and cooperation from neighbouring countries has increased.”

According to latest reports, China reported at least 44 new coronavirus deaths on Friday, taking the total number of fatalities there to 2,788 so far. Coronavirus has killed more than 2,800 people and infected more than 83,000 worldwide.

“The spirit of global village chain must precede the global value chain concept. We have to move towards a global community of shared future that is free of divisions caused by politics, caste, race and religion, among others,” Guocai said.

Zhang Xiangchen, the Chinese ambassador to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), said reforms were required at WTO to ensure that more developing nations had a voice, in the face of more protectionism and tariffs from economies like the US.

354,['1/03/2020'],Delhi government’s special cell to tackle online rumours,"Security personnel walk past a riot hit area in Delhi

NEW DELHI: Delhi government is going to set up a special cell to fight the menace of rumours and fake and misleading content being shared on WhatsApp and other social media platforms . During the riots, which left nearly 42 dead, rumours were used to fan violence in different parts of northeast Delhi .

The government will soon issue a mobile number on which the public can forward suspicious messages. All such messages, which are in violation of the IT Act and various sections of the IPC, will be forwarded to the police for action. A public advisory will also be issued for people to refrain from taking the fake WhatsApp forwards at their face value, and from falling prey to the misleading information on social media.

An official said forwarding sensitive fake and misleading content could land any person in jail for up to five years. “The law has enough provisions to punish those who engage in spreading rumours which promote hatred in the society on the grounds of religion, race and other factors. But despite the presence of strong laws, such rumours are common during riots. The government wants to use the existing laws to check the spread of rumours to ensure peace and harmony in the society,” an official said.

“The elected government of Delhi does not have control over Delhi Police. It stops the government from taking direct measures in improving law and order. But it faces a share of the blame when law and order condition deteriorates as many of the common people do not understand the nitty-gritty of jurisdiction. The special cell will work in coordination with Delhi Police to control the fake content factory,” the official added.

355,['1/03/2020'],Dist administration completes preps for Inter exam in Krishna,"Vijayawada: Krishna district administration has completed arrangements for the Intermediate examinations, scheduled to begin from March 4. The intermediate board has introduced a few reforms, which include downloading hall tickets directly from the official website of the Board of Intermediate Education (BIE).

Around 70,000 students from the city are likely to appear for the examination this year. Officials are focused on providing necessary amenities to the students at examination centers.

Krishna district administration had formed co-ordination committees to arrange transportation, drinking water, continuous power supply at examination centers. Authorities has completed installing CCTV cameras in examination halls for the first time, which would help control mass copying. Departmental officers, chief supervisors will monitor the examination process along with invigilators. The board has decided to utilise the services of ward volunteers as invigilators in required locations. High power committee under the leadership of district collector Mohammed Imtiaz will inspect the examination centers.

Regional inspection officer P Ravi Kumar said they have arranged multiple helpline centers at Machilipatnam, Pedana, Pamarru, Korukollu and other locations to help students. “Students can download hall tickets from the board’s website and this will reduce the burden on colleges, he said.

We have directed the chief superintendents of all exam centers to acquire necessary furniture and will initiate stringent action if we find any student writing the examination on the floor, Ravi Kumar said.

Collector Imtiaz on Saturday urged officials to make the exams a success. He asked parents to use the mobile application to locate examination center and seating to prevent last-minute confusion. Officials at the centres will scan the special QR code printed on the hall tickets to prevent malpractices, he said. The collector also directed the students not refrain from cheating.

Police have been directed to deploy special security at exam centers and close all photocopy centers located close to exam centers.

356,['1/03/2020'],Pune: DPR for waste management in all villages in district,"PUNE: The Zilla Parishad is set to roll out a detailed project report ( DPR ) on solid waste management after several villages raised concerns about garbage burning in their areas.

The plan would be applicable to all 1,405 villages in Pune district .

Burning of untreated garbage along highways in the proximity of these villages is a common concern among villagers.

Officials from the Zilla Parishad said they would be drawing out the plan for the bigger gram panchayats first, followed by the smaller ones. “The entire plan should be ready within a year for all the villages. Once it is readied, the villages would have to follow the plan diligently. A panel would be appointed to monitor strict implementation of the plan,” said an official of the Zilla Parishad.

In a first, the detailed plan would ensure that garbage disposal and treatment were done at the village-level itself. Setting up sewage treatment plants (STPs) in these villages would be a part of the DPR that should be ready soon, said Pune ZP CEO Ayush Prasad .

He said only 100 villages have a rough draft at present. But soon the others would be covered to ensure streamlined waste disposal.

The plan would include activities such as collection, removal and safe disposal of waste with the participation of every member of the village community.

Village panchayats having the potential of generating the maximum volume of waste, those with a population of more than 10,000 peri-urban panchayats, those having association with tourist, pilgrim and industrial activities and the ones abutting national highways would be covered on a priority basis, another Zilla Parishad official said.

357,['1/03/2020'],India’s integration into global value chains a collective task: PMEAC head Bibek Debroy,"Pune: Chairman of Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC) Bibek Debroy on Saturday said the broader ecosystem, including industry and manufacturing, needed to react to the competitive pressures of international trade before the country was seen as doing much better in terms of integration into the global value chains (GVCs).

“Government is just an island in the broad ecosystem. It cannot become excellent in isolation and needs to do some things hitherto denied and to reduce some things that are malign with intent. But the broader ecosystem must react to the competitive pressures,” he said at a session on GVCs at the ongoing Asia Economic Dialogue organized by the Pune International Centre.

The GVCs refer to coordinated activities across geographies for production and post-production supply and distribution of goods and services. It has led to a redistribution of economic activity towards emerging countries, offering economic development opportunities to large and small firms.

“When we talk about GVCs, what we probably really mean is manufacturing and not services. The manufacturing share in India’s gross domestic product (GDP) has been virtually flat for several years. Liberalisation, whether multilateral, bilateral or unilateral, means competition and to benefit from it. To integrate oneself and one’s economy into that competitive framework, we require indigenous domestic changes,” Debroy said.

He said, “For decades, we have had a litany of woes that plague manufacturing. Be it in the form of physical infrastructure like road and electricity, taxation regime (tax rates and procedure), cost and availability of credit, and labour and skills problems. Many reforms we have in mind also relate to the judiciary and legislature. Many reforms that are required need changes in areas such as the Concurrent List and the 7th Schedule in the Indian Constitution.”

Debroy said there were various measures for judging India’s integration into GVCs. “While India has not performed badly on backward integration, it is the forward integration that remains a challenge. Much of this has to do with the fact that the country has historically been much more centralised for colonial or planning reasons. There is a long list of things that government has to do, but government is just an island in the broad ecosystem.”

World Bank’s former lead economist Jayanta Roy, while presenting a theme paper on the GVCs and what India needs to do, observed that India had been hesitant in global supply chains. “We have to make our industries competitive,” he said.

Sanjay Gandhi, chief financial officer of New Delhi-based Pearl Global Industries, gave an industries’ perspective on the GVCs and expectations from the government.

358,['1/03/2020'],Nagpur: SMSN to oppose 5% religion-based reservation,"NAGPUR: The save merit save nation ( SMSN ) forum that has been opposing more than 50% reservation in education and jobs is now up in arms against the proposal of 5% reservation to Muslims.

“Though it’s still a proposal given by one of the ministers in the state cabinet, there are differences within the state government. We don’t want to take any chances for 5% more reservation,” said Dr Anup Marar, secretary of SMSN forum.

A meeting of SMSN office bearers was held in Nagpur on Saturday to decide the further course of action. Members will oppose the very idea of religion-based reservation on all platforms.

“Religion-based reservation is unconstitutional and we will oppose it. SMSN is already fighting against the alarming situation in Maharashtra due to increase in the percentage of reservation to 74% after SEBC and EWS. This reservation escalates to 85% with further lateral reservations. What will remain for meritorious students of the open unreserved category if 5% religion-based reservation gets added?,” said working president Shreekrishna Buty.

SMSN is planning to hold an awareness programme in Nagpur in March to mobilize masses against the proposal of 5% religion-based reservation.

SMSN activists recently met chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in Mumbai and they were quite optimistic about the meeting. They are now saddened by the government’s response to their demands.

“Unfortunately, the very next day after our meeting with the CM, one of the ministers in his cabinet came up with the proposal of 5% religion based reservation ,” said Buty.

SMSN Office bearers said that the additional reservation should be opposed right at the beginning, before it takes the form of a bill or ordinance.

“Religion specific reservation will further divide our nation and lead to caste hatred and civil unrest. We will demand that reservation should never be religion specific and should be limited to 50 % for the non-creamy layers in all reserved categories. The balance 50% as per the Supreme Court judgement should be left for the open category so that merit is also recognized,” said Adv Rahul Pande.

360,['1/03/2020'],NMC begins to make aiwajdars permanent,"Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has started giving permanent jobs to daily wage sanitary workers (aiwajdars) from Monday. Around 347 aiwajdars were inducted on a permanent basis in the civic body on the eve of NMC’s foundation day.

Mayor Sandip Joshi handed over letters to 50 aiwajdars, five each from ten zones, in a programme held at NMC head office situated at Civil Lines. “2,206, including 347 aiwajdars will get permanent jobs in the NMC. Aiwajdars play a major role in city’s sanitation. Aiwajdars put their health at risk to keep city neat and clean. They deserve permanent induction in the NMC. Therefore, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis had approved it during his tenure as chief minister,” he said.

The state government on September 21, 2019, had issued a notification allowing the NMC to give permanent jobs to aiwajdars. The government had also relaxed the criteria of establishment cost for this particular subject. The government had also created new posts of 4,407 permanent sanitary workers.

The NMC has 4,407 aiwajdars. But the aiwajdars who completed 20 years of service in the NMC will get permanent jobs. Therefore, 2,206 will get the benefit immediately on completion of 20 years. The rest will be given the benefits whenever they attain 20 years in service.

While approving the plan, the government also imposed a condition that the NMC will not recruit anymore aiwajdars. Already, the NMC had started to give compensatory jobs to the kin of aiwajdars in case of their deaths.

The cash-strapped NMC is likely to incur a financial burden of Rs18 crore per annum if it gives permanent jobs to all aiwajdars. The number of posts of sanitary workers will increase to 8,346 in the NMC after permanent induction of all aiwajdars. The number of approved posts in the NMC will rise to 16,300.

The NMC had also transferred a few aiwajdars to the other departments like fire, administrative office and property tax.

361,['1/03/2020'],Reducing gap between TTD income and outgo should worry temple body,"The TTD might have approved its highest-ever budgetary estimate of Rs 3,309.89 crore for the 2020-21 fiscal, but the sharp rise in salary payments in the last five years coupled with a decrease in its revenues from interest receipts from banks and a decline in its corpus investments is a matter of concern for the richest temple body in the country.

TTD is expecting an income of Rs 1,351 crore through hundi collections, which is its major source of revenue . However, a comparison between the hundi income and its major outgo, which mostly comprise employee wages, presents a dangerous picture for the temple administration which definitely needs to have a closer look at the salaries and other monetary benefits extended to its employees.

In the last five years (2016-17 to 2020-21), while TTD’s hundi revenues rose from Rs 1,010 crore to Rs 1,351 crore — a rise of Rs 341 crore — its employees’ salaries and other benefits, which stood at Rs 500 crore in 2016-17, has jumped to Rs 1,385 crore in the 2020-21 budget, which is a raise of Rs 885.09 crore. Interestingly, in addition to the Rs 1385.09 crore towards human resources payments, TTD has to allocate Rs 75 crore towards employees’ pension fund.

Now, while the temple’s hundi revenues rising only by Rs 341 crore, the human resources related payments has gone up sharply by Rs 885.09 crore, which is almost triple within a five-year span.

Another policy decision which cost the temple administration dear was not to park funds in private banks but put everything only in nationalized banks. This particular decision has resulted in a dip in its revenues through interest receipts from Rs 857.28 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 706.01 crore in 2020-21. This is another area of concern for the TTD which maintains that temple funds are safe only with nationalised banks and not with private banks, despite the stringent RBI guidelines in place today.

With all these financial constraints adding up to TTD’s woes, the temple administration has trimmed its corpus and other investments to Rs 105.98 crore for 2020-21, down from Rs 165.41 crore in 2019-20.

Nagpur: Music lovers cherished their time listening to a fusion of Indo-Western music at a programme titled ‘ Anhad garje ’. The event, jointly organized by Chitnavis Centre and Vidarbha Gaurav Pratishthan, was staged at the Banyan Hall on Friday.

The unique concept of presenting Indo-Western music was put forth by various promising artistes of the city, who are national level awardees associated with the All India Radio.

The melodious tunes commenced with classical music and then moved to the western genre. The music was composed by Ram Khadse, who was on the tabla.

Nikhil Khadse won the hearts of the audience by melodiously playing the shehnai. Rishikesh Karmar’s performance was the highlight of the show. He amazed the audience by skilfully playing the dilruba.

Yashwant Humpiholi set the audiences’ feet tapping as he played the mrugadum. Kaustubh Tambuskar added his personal touch and turned the music magical by playing the keyboard.

Western music blended pleasingly with Indian classical with Chinmay Pittule on the drums. Rajdeep Ghagde complemented the beats by strumming the guitar.

The music part of the show was partially in solo and group form. The jugalbandi of the audience amazed the audience which responded with a round of applause.

The audience not only enjoyed the beats of tabla but also grooved to the beats of drums when western music was in motion.

The music was composed by Ram Khadse and the programme was conceptualized by Ravindra Durugkar.

Mitesh Lokhande, who was among the audience, said, “I feel privileged to have attended this event. The artistes were amazing and this programme was truly unique. I’m looking forward to many more programmes featuring these artists.”

Another music enthusiast, Amit Mehta, said, “I absolutely enjoyed the programme right from the start. All the instruments are wonderfully well-tuned. The composition of the music was noteworthy. I will definitely attend many more musical programmes like this one.”

Singla chaired a meeting of the district level coordination committee to review the preparedness of the district administration and modalities framed by them to implement the innovative project. The administration now aims to conduct such awareness camps at different places in the district on March 14 and 28 between 11am and 3pm.

Block developmental officers (BDO), tehsildars and bank managers participated in the district level meeting. It’s learnt that Singla also issued instructions to committees at the taluka level to engage in mobilizing maximum number of tribals, who are living in impoverished conditions, to attend the camps. The existing bank customers, too, would be invited to the camps to train them to use the facilities in a positive and benefiting manner. Awareness would be created regarding banking facilities, loans, government schemes and benefits for tribals residing in the interiors of the district.

It’s learnt that bankers and the district administration staffers exchanged their views and also discussed the possible hardships that may come their way. Singla, who promised to look into the issues, motivated the staffers and bank managers to take up the awareness camps in right earnest.

NEW DELHI: Even as residents of north-east Delhi are trying to pick up the pieces after the riots which left 42 dead amid widespread destruction, a “march against jihadi terrorism” was taken out at Connaught Place on Saturday.

BJP leader Kapil Mishra, who has been accused of making provocative statements before the riots broke out, was present along with families of some of the victims. He, however, didn’t shout any slogans or address the gathering during what was touted as a ‘peace march’ organised by NGO Delhi Peace Forum from Jantar Mantar to Parliament Street police station.

People had gathered at the march in large numbers, holding the tricolour, at Jantar Mantar and raised slogans of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’.

Mishra had earlier posted a tweet asking people to join the protest. He later posted videos of the march, saying: “No matter how much falsehood you spread, people know the truth”.

Even as the Opposition and a section of civil society has been demanding an FIR against Mishra, the BJP leader has maintained that he did nothing wrong and had only demanded that the roads be cleared of anti-CAA protesters.

The organisers paid tributes to Ratan Lal of Delhi Police and Ankit Sharma of IB, who were killed during the violence.

One of the participants was Suresh Kumar, who said his brother Dinesh Kumar Khatik was shot when he had gone to see whether shops were open on February 25. “He was shot near the Shiv Vihar puliya where petrol bombs were also used. I found him at GTB Hospital where he was on ventilator support. The next day he died of his injuries. He is survived by two children, a one-year-old and a seven-year-old,” he said.

Alok Tiwari was shot in the head while he was returning home on Tuesday from a Karawal Nagar factory where he worked, said his brother-in-law Sumit. “His fault was that he had stopped to see whether he could buy fruits for children. My sister got to know that he had been attacked and with the help of neighbours he was taken to hospital where he died of his injuries the next day. “He leaves behind a four-year-old son and a nine-year-old daughter,” he said.

365,['1/03/2020'],‘Time Muslims mingled with fellow countrymen’,"English professor Mohammed Ayyub Khan

Mohammed Ayub Khan is an English professor at the Women’s College of Arts and Commerce. He has been a teacher in more ways than one. He has dedicated his life towards ‘Mission Education for Slums’.

Khan has been working with Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH) for the past 12 years. As an office bearer of the organization, Khan has been attempting to integrate the larger part of the Muslim community into the mainstream. With the message of the Quran, Khan is also putting in efforts to initiate an interaction with other communities.

In an interview with TOI, he talks about the ‘We the Citizens’ concept which is now gaining a lot of ground due to the prevailing situation in the country.

Excerpts...

Q. Why have Muslims remained aloof from society for so long?

A. You can’t say that more or less all Muslims have been aloof from the society. Having said that, there is a section which was not enlightened enough to understand the social engineering of the Holy Quran. The Quran encourages every Muslim to develop peaceful, amicable and compassionate relations with other communities. Moreover, it persuades them to serve all communities without any inhibitions. The Holy Quran is the divine message of the omnipotent, the omnipresent and the omniscient Allah (SWT), who loves everyone on this planet and the scripture is the message for the entire humanity.

Q. Do you agree that this section has now realized its shortcomings in terms of not interacting with other communities?

A. With the advent of divide and rule politics, they have realized that it’s high time they mingled with their fellow countrymen. Due to vested interest, these so-called politicians have misused the communication gap by spreading many misconceptions about other communities.

Q. What are the initiatives being taken and since how long?

A. We reach out to our fellow countrymen in various ways. We invite them on Eid. We organize Eid Milan programmes even at temples. We share the dais with them and interact with them on a regular basis. We conduct medical camps for our fellow countrymen. We also run coaching centres where socially marginalized students are taught English and Maths. For women, we have a skill-based training programme. The JIH has been conducting these activities for almost 50 years. In Nagpur district alone, we have eight units which are backed by a workforce of 110 dedicated members and 1,000 associates. We have a big team at the national level. Our projects like social service, women’s wing, education department and movement for peace and justice are meant for people of all communities.

Q. In what way will creating awareness about other communities help?

A. The main mission is to create peace and communal harmony. Ultimately, it will lead to the country’s progress. For example, we want to inform the Muslim masses about the correct history of the Marathas. Warrior king Shivaji was never hostile to Muslims. His commanders, Ibrahim Gardi and Siddhilal, personal secretary Bande Ali and counsel Hyder Ali were all Muslims. Madari Mehtar was his very loyal servant who risked his life to free Shivaji from the Agra Fort. In addition to this, apart from Ramdas, Baba Yakub Shah was Shivaji’s spiritual guru. We are creating awareness among Muslims that Shivaji Maharaj was the only Hindu king who issued a government resolution which stated that the Holy Quran should not be dishonoured. Over 600 Pathans served in Shivaji’s army.

Q. How is ‘We the People’ gaining momentum?

A. Our community has now realized that it’s high time we researched real history to bridge the gap with other communities. JIH has been running four educational guidance centres for slum dwellers in Zingabai Takli, Petasur and Godavari. Free English and Marathi classes for all have been running at the centres since five years. We want to root out all misconceptions about Islam. The lord has sent a divine message for the entire human race. It is the only scripture which motivates the reader to reason and meditate on the signs of the lord before believing in Him.

Q. Were Muslims reluctant to sing the National Anthem , hold the Tricolour and chant Bharat zindabad?

A. Never. Since childhood we have been taught to sing the anthem, respect the tricolour and say Bharat zindabad. But people of other communities have been misinformed by vested interest. There should be no doubt in anybody’s mind regarding our commitment to patriotism. To prove this point, even madrasas, which are run by religious groups, have started hoisting the tricolour on Independence Day and Republic Day as well.

Q. How did Muslim women come to the forefront now, compared to the earlier times when they were sidelined?

A. Women are doing national service with the dignity and grace of Islam. JIH’s women’s wings became operational 70 years ago. The Quran has given the best status to women which makes men lower their gaze and not stare at women or stalk them. A woman is given respect of the highest order. She also has the freedom to pursue education, start a business or go shopping. You can find many examples in the history of India.

Q. Will women get entry into mosques ?

A. Women were never barred from entering mosques. They were unable to go for prayers five times a day due to personal reasons. For Ramzan and Juma, special arrangements are made for women to offer prayers.

366,['1/03/2020'],Kolkata: Majerhat bridge looks at July completion,"KOLKATA: With the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) nod, the new Majerhat bridge could be commissioned by July this year.The state public works department (PWD), implementing the Majerhat bridge reconstruction project, had set a deadline of five months from the date of the CRS approval. It is now racing against time to meet the July 2020 deadline. The Majerhat structure will be a road overbridge (ROB).A span of the ROB, that comes within the ambit of Eastern Railway (ER), collapsed on September 4, 2018. The new bridge, being built since January last year, has already missed its September 27 and December 31, 2019 deadlines. The Bengal government has held the railways responsible for the delay. On November 25 last year, CM Mamata Banerjee had written to railway minister Piyush Goyal, urging him to intervene in the matter to expedite the construction of the superstructure and in getting the CRS sanction. On Friday, she broached the issue with Union home minister Amit Shah as well. Hours later, Md Latief Khan, CRS, eastern circle, Kolkata, wrote to the general manger of Eastern Railway (ER) in charge of the ROB, that “sanction is accorded”. ER forwarded the letter to the PWD soon after.“The CRS wants that a quality assurance plan be rigidly implemented and any deviations brought to the notice of the approving authority. This means the conditions laid down by the CRS must be strictly adhered to. So, it will take at least five months to complete the bridge,” a state official said.The CRS, when it had turned down the approval in a letter to the general manager, ER, had asked PWD to adhere to 31 stipulations. In its approval letter on Friday, the number of stipulations were reduced to 22. Some important aspects — like using the right bearings and wind tunnel test — remain to be addressed.As things stand now, PWD has written to ER that the old ROB’s piers will be used as a temporary launching pad for building the superstructure. PWD is using temporary bearings. Permanent ones, as per the specifications of the CRS, will be installed once the superstructure is launched.Since November, PWD had been lobbying for the CRS nod to start building the superstructure. The superstructure will be a continuous girder system, built using high-capacity cranes. “We have asked ER for a railway block. As soon as we get it, the superstructure launching work will start,” a state official said.After the launch, there is the very complex job of fixing the pylons. Pylon construction has started and should end by March 10, engineers said. This will be followed by the deck construction. It will be a time-consuming phase because the casting must be done as per specifications of the Indian Road Congress (IRC).",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74422152,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-633546,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/majerhat-bridge-looks-at-july-completion/articleshow/74421424.cms

In a letter to GWMC managing director Levinson Martins, AAI’s general manager for CSR O P Chugh said that as per AAI’s CSR policy, Goa airport director is the implementing and monitoring officer for the project.

The bio-digester plant will consist of two reinforced concrete cement tanks which will each be able to treat 5 tonne wet waste per day. Around 3,000 sqm of land has been demarcated for waste management purpose.

As part of the project, four materials recovery facility (MRF) sheds will be set up along with a baling machine, forklifts and dustbins to help curb the garbage menace around Goa International Airport at Dabolim.

“Accordingly, action for signing of memorandum of agreement, release of payments, progress monitoring and collection of completion certificates, utilisation certificates may please be carried out at your end. Itis also requested to get this project implemented and completed as per the timelines,” said Chugh.

GWMC issued an expression of interest on February 19 seeking qualified agencies to setup and operate the bio-digestor plant for a five year period.

The biodigester plant will treat garbage generated from Chicalim panchayat, Chicolna - Bogmalo panchayat, Sancoale panchayat, part of Hollant and from AAI , and will help generate electricity.

AAI took the decision to sanction the funds at the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee meeting held on January 6.

369,['1/03/2020'],Delhi: Life returning to normal with shops open and traffic stalling,"Security personnel patrol on a street following clashes at Mustafabad in northeast Delhi

NEW DELHI: Life in violence-affected areas of northeast Delhi limped back to normalcy on Saturday with several shops and establishments resuming their businesses and people coming back to work. Locals came out of their homes to buy groceries, fruits and other items of daily needs.

After several days of the stretch remaining deserted, traffic jam was reported on the main road leading to Maujpur, Kardampur and Yamuna Vihar.

Meanwhile, police and paramilitary personnel maintained strict vigil in the northeast Delhi areas. They were deputed at every nook and corner to avoid any confrontation. Minority commission teams visited Maujpur and Jafrabad.

Jahangir Ali, resident of Moonga Nagar in Chand Bagh, accompanied his daughter, Iqra, who was returning from her school in Tis Hazari. “I didn’t let her go to school for six days because the situation was not suitable. Life is more important than anything else. On Saturday I decided to accompany her. I pray for things to get normal as riots have never served anyone’s purpose,” said Ali, with worry writ large on his face.

Sultan Singh, another resident of Chand Bagh, opened his confectionery shop for the first time after Monday. “All hell had broken loose in the area during the violence. People were mindlessly pelting stones at each other. Fearing my shop also getting targeted, I had decided to down the shutters,” said Singh.

In Mustafabad also, things are back to normal. Anshul Jain, running a general store in Mustafabad area, cannot stop thanking god for saving his shop from rioters. “Like others, I had also locked my shop on Sunday evening. The rioters burnt all shops in this lane, but failed to unlock my shop so it was saved from getting burnt. On Saturday, I decided to re-open it after assessing the situation in the area,” said Jain.

A team from SDM office reached Shiv Vihar, Kardampuri and other areas for property damage assessment. “We are also distributing forms to the affected people so that instant relief of Rs 25,000 can be given,” said an official.

Delhi government had earlier promised cash incentive to people who lost their houses in violence.

At Kardampuri, government staff were found approaching people in internal lanes to know their requirement for food and water.

Compared with Friday, the areas looked much cleaner. “For past six days, garbage was not being lifted as sanitation staff were not visiting the areas out of fear. On Saturday, debris and other materials were removed from the main road and garbage was lifted at some colonies. However, the situation in internal lanes is still bad,” claimed Kardampuri resident Shaukat Ali.

A few minor incidents have, however, come to fore and police are probing them. In Kardampuri, one Naeem alleged that he was thrashed on Friday night while he was returning from his factory.

370,['1/03/2020'],"Delhi: Woman got past rioters, rescued 40 trapped relatives via rooftops","I knew that the mob would not see us if we moved from terrace to terrace, says Mushtari Khatoon

NEW DELHI: Mushtari Khatoon mostly stays at home, doing stitching jobs to supplement her husband’s income. The 42-year-old doesn’t often venture out.

On Tuesday (February 25), when her family members needed help, Mushtari walked a kilometre through roads that had fallen to the mobs, managed to dodge stones and petrol bombs, and got past rioting groups to get to trapped members of her extended family in Khajuri Khas . There were 40 of them and Mushtari managed to get everyone out safely, showing great presence of mind to move the group along terraces of houses till they reached a police team that gave them safe passage.

In Chandu Nagar , where she and her husband, Hakeem, live, Mushtari has since become a household name. Neighbours call her “a hero”.

“I knew if someone didn’t go to them, they would lose their lives,” Mushatri said on Saturday, back home, relieved that her young nieces and nephews are unhurt. The worst clashes of the riots in north-east Delhi were reported on Monday and Tuesday and one of the most-affected areas was Khajuri Khas, where arsonists have left many houses burnt beyond recognition.

“I waited for the whole of Monday. On Tuesday, I left early in the morning,” said Mushtari. Khajuri Khas is on the main Karawal road — where mobs had gathered — from Chandu Nagar.

When she reached the house where her relatives were, Mushtari realised there was no way out through the streets. The mobs were everywhere, attacking each other and setting cars, bikes and houses on fire.

“We were trapped. The next four hours were tense because mobs were going berserk around us,” Mushtari said. While they waited, the family members coordinated to ensure everyone gathered at one place.

“When the mob grew closer, I asked them to jump from the terrace of one building to the other. The possibility of the mob seeing us was less if we moved along the terraces (the houses here are cheek by jowl and the terraces sometimes continuous). I had called people from our neighbourhood for help to get us out. The women who were with me were scared and someone had to guide them,” said Mushtari, who managed to hold her nerve through the escape till they met a police team, which gave them a passage across the main road so that they could reach Chandu Nagar. Along with police were over 100 people from Chandu Nagar who escorted Mushtari and the others back.

Mushtari saved eight families, all related, that day. Mohammad Minhaj , a nephew of Hakeem, was in that group. “The families have lived in Khajuri Khas for many years. The situation became tense on Sunday evening but we stayed back. Now, we are not sure if we will be able to go back there,” he said.

Mushtari said she wasn’t scared; all she was focused on getting her family members out. “We were getting no help despite our pleas. There were men with lathis and petrol bombs and police were nowhere to be seen for over a day. If I hadn’t take the decision, many lives would have been lost,” she said.

“There are so many children in our family, and most of them are girls. My wife insisted she wants to go and help them out. It is something to be proud of,” said Hakeem, who works as a labourer.

AHMEDABAD: Irked by pigeons annexing balconies? Now two were found in an aircraft flying from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad! Passengers aboard the Jaipur-bound G8-702 flight were confronted by the bizarre sight of two pigeons in the aircraft as it was about to depart from SVPI airport on Friday evening.

Confirming the incident, the airline issued a statement stating, “Two pigeons found their way inside GoAir Ahmedabad Jaipur flight G8-702 while passengers were on-boarding.” The statement went on to say: “The crew immediately got the birds shooed away outside. The flight took off as per its scheduled time of 1700 hours.”

The menace of birds has been a worry for airline crews using SVPI airport. Ahead of the visit of US President Donald Trump to Ahmedabad, another flight suffered a bird-hit while taxiing for take-off.

The airline said that it has requested the airport authorities to get rid of the menace. Sources said that birds, monkeys, and stray dogs are frequently sneaking into the city airport.

SVPI airport director Manoj Gangal could not be reached for comment.

In 2019, 37 bird-hits were reported at SVPI airport and three have been recorded so far in 2020. SVPI airport authorities have taken several measures to keep the birds away, including the deployment of avian-chasers. Just ahead of the US president’s visit, the authorities had written to the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation to maintain cleanliness in areas surrounding the city airport.

A complaint has been filed against the woman by officials of Child Welfare Committee (CWC) of Krishna district, who have asked the police to investigate the matter and file a case under the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986.

Child Welfare Committee chairman BVS Kumar said the two siblings, aged 12 years and 11 years respectively, were studying at a child care institute in a village under Nuzvid mandal of Krishna district. “Their mother took them to their village during the Sankranti holidays, but the girls did not return to the school even after the end of the vacation. The child care centre authorities tried to contact their mother and after failing to reach her, lodged a missing complaint with the Nuzvid rural police,” Kumar said.

The police traced the missing girls to Hyderabad and sent them back to the child care centre, who then informed the CWC. During their interaction with CWC officials, the girls said they were engaged for domestic work. Based on the siblings’ written statement, CWC directed Nuzvid rural cops to probe the matter and book the woman under the Child Labour Act. Nuzvid police station sub-inspector Ranjith Kumar said they will register a case against the TV channel staff after investigating the matter.

373,['1/03/2020'],Ahmedabad: Another killed by illegally dumped hot sand,"TimesView The government should not wait for more innocent people to die to crackdown on this criminal dumping of hazardous materials in the city. These incidents raise concerns not only about citizens’ safety but is also reflective of inaction and sloth on the part of authorities, giving the impression that criminals can get away with taking away other people’s lives. This has to stop. PASA should be imposed on such criminals, a policy governing disposal of flyash should be framed, and a squad comprising officials of the police, GPCB and AMC, dedicated to detecting and monitoring of illegal waste dumping must be formed. What matters now is action.

AHMEDABAD: Thirty-five-year-old Parvati Sarkar on Friday night succumbed to burns suffered when she accidentally stepped into superhot sand illegally dumped by the roadside in Ganeshnagar. For one month, she battled for her life in LG Hospital. Her son 20-year-old son Raja is shocked and inconsolable. Parvati collected metal scrap from waste for a living, and is the second casualty of illegal dumping that continues around Ganeshnagar in the Pirana area.A multi-department special task force — with representatives of the police, Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) — was formed to identify the culprits. Except for a report on the nature of the substance that caused the death, there has been no arrest. A senior GPCB official admitted that the report confirms that there was 40 tonnes of superhot flyash and 100 metric tonnes of burning garbage underneath when Parvati stepped into a pit to find metal scrap. Several heaps of dumped flysash and sand can be seen in the area. Narol police inspector S A Gohil told TOI, “We registered a case of accidental death in Parvati’s case. We are yet to nab the culprits and have no pertinent CCTV footage as yet. We are now relying on informers.”The loss for the Sarkar family is massive. “I lost my mother. I did not go to work for a month because she was in pain and I was by her side. My father and my sister are yet to come to terms with the loss,” said Raja. Parvati had already lost one lung to an infection. Doctors knew that though she suffered only 23% third degree burns, her body would not be able to fight if an infection got severe.In July 2018, 52-year-old Salma Nizamuddin succumbed to 57% third degree burns suffered after the motorcycle she was pillion riding on slipped and she fell on to a heap of hot sand. The accident had taken place on June 22 that year. “Salma’s case is also unsolved. She was in LG Hospital for a month. Police and the GPCB are yet to identify the culprit and the illegal dumping continues,” says her husband Nizamuddin.Environmental activist Mahesh Pandya of Paryavaran Mitra says, “This is a clear case of human rights violation and not just an environmental pollution case.

PANAJI: Congress on Saturday demanded that panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho and Chicalim deputy sarpanch Kamla Prasad Yadav , should be sacked from the cabinet and as member of Mormugao Planning and Development Authority ( MPDA ) respectively for violating construction norms around Goa International Airport .

Addressing the press, Congress media convener Trajano D’Mello urged chief minister Pramod Sawant to take action based on the high court of Bombay at Goa’s judgement regarding construction around the airport.

“The sacking of the panchayat minister is necessary, failing which I would caution the chief minister that Godinho has succeeded in using his position under more experienced chief ministers and managed to hoodwink them,” said D’Mello.

Congress said that Yadav is a “close aide of the notorious panchayat minister” and both were involved in illegal construction within the airport’s funnel zone.

“We demand that Yadav be immediately removed as member of MPDA as his conflict of interest with duty is a serious offence and being the deputy sarpanch he has knowledge of the law and still violates it with criminal intention,” D’Mello said.

D’Mello said that “interference of the minister of panchayat” prompted MPDA to pass a resolution on November 18, 2019 rejecting the Colour Coded Zoning Map prepared under the provisions of the Aircraft Act, 1994 Rules and Notification GSR 751(E).

“This has exposed the minister’s arrogance. He is paying scant respect to the judiciary when the writ petitions were heard. The motive was to try and abort judicial power,” said D’Mello.

375,['1/03/2020'],"VHP, Bajrang Dal warn Thackeray govt of backlash on Muslim reservation","NAGPUR: In what could be termed as signs of troubles for chief minister Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Agadi (MVA) government, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad ( VHP ) and Bajrang Dal on Saturday warned him against granting 5% reservation to Muslims as announced by minority affairs minister Nawab Malik.

Speaking at the joint convention of VHP and Bajrang Dal at Chitnis Park in Mahal, VHP national coordinator Surendra Jain in his speech, that was full of vitriolic attack, said they will fight against the government’s move from roads to judiciary.

“Their minister (Malik) said the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government would grant 5% reservation in education to Muslims. Next day, the Shiv Sena minister said no such decision was taken. We’ve already given them Pakistan and Bangladesh. Why do they need reservation? It wasn’t expected from Uddhav, who’s son of Hindu Hridaysamrat Balasaheb Thackeray . He has unexpectedly stooped to such a low level for the lust of power and in the process shattered the dreams of Shivaji Maharaj , his father and even Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar,” said Jain.

Further targeting Uddhav, Jain challenged him to remove all illegal Bangladeshi migrants from the state and VHP and Bajrang Dal would support him.

Flaying AIMIM’s ex-MLA Warris Pathan for his warning, Jain reminded him that the VHP and BD activists had thrashed his master (Asduddin Owaisi) in Hyderabad. “You threaten us with 15 crore numbers, but just think of the repercussions if we decided to reply. We will no longer tolerate such warnings. This is not the 1947 India, but a changed one after 1992, which is ready to give a befitting reply to any attack,” said Jain.

Supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), he said that when the entire country was celebrating the enactment, those who were not in favour of India had resorted to riots, arson, burning of shops, buses and the police were also attacked. “The coordinated attacks took place when US President Donald Trump was in Delhi. In Shaheen Bagh, they took shelter behind women, who were paid money. This amount is coming from the neighbouring country. I don’t know why the Supreme Court is entertaining them by sending a panel to hold talks. There can’t be any talks with traitors and terrorists as they don’t have any religion or gender. Leave the situation to the police to tackle it,” said Jain.

Attacking the Tukde-Tukde and Khan Market gang along with the secular mafia, Jain said all of them were hell bent on destroying the country, which was rapidly progressing in all sectors.

“Currently, India is a fourth in terms of armed forces and will soon occupy the third position. Once a land of beggars is now the fifth economic power and fourth in space. On the other hand, China is suffering due to Coronavirus. When all countries failed to take their nationals out of China, it was India which had taken the lead,” said Jain.

Applauding prime minister Narendra Modi, the VHP’s senior member said miracles were happening ever since he took over. “Article 370 and 35 A was abrogated, triple talaq was abolished and now, the way has been cleared for the Ram temple. Ram Janmbhoomi was in fact an ‘Andolan’ that was under way since the last 500 years, where lakhs sacrificed their lives. Over 16 crore participated in this movement which is akin to the world’s biggest freedom struggle,” he said while calling all activists to visit Ayodhya.

Earlier, a big rally containing floats was organized as a show of strength. It started from Reshimbag and culminated at Chitnis Park in Mahal with hundreds of activists waiving saffron flags and shouting ‘Jai Shree Ram’ and ‘Har Har Mahadev’ slogans. Children from Bhumiputra Akhada with swords and sticks demonstrated traditional warfare skills used by Marathas.

The dignitaries, including Govind Shende, Devesh Mishra, Navin Jain, Rajesh Murkute, Hemant Jambhekar and Amol Andhare shared the dais.

NEW DELHI: IPS officer S N Shrivastava took over as Delhi Police commissioner on Saturday evening from Amulya Patnaik . Shrivastava is currently awaiting formal orders and will hold the police chief’s post as an additional charge apart from being the chief of law and order in Delhi.

“My priority is to restore peace in the national capital and ensure communal harmony,” the 1985-batch officer told reporters. He said they had taken many steps in the last few days but a lot was left to be done. He pointed out it the city has a tradition of people of every section and religion living together in harmony and helping each other in good as well as bad times.

Shrivasatava said Delhi Police has started a massive outreach programme and senior officers have been meeting with people in order to build confidence among them. “The area (north-east) will soon return to normal and I am committed to doing this,” he said. “To avoid such incidents in future, cases will be registered in crimes that were committed and we will try to arrest the accused involved, so that legal proceedings can be initiated at the earliest,” he added.

Shrivastava was serving in CRPF as special director general since 2015. After Delhi Police came under fire for being unable to quell the riots, he was handpicked by home minister Amit Shah and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval to control the situation which is now fast returning to normalcy.

Known to be an honest officer with a no-nonsense attitude, Shrivastava was the anti-terror chief in Delhi Police till 2015. He headed several departments before going on deputation to CRPF. It was during his tenure that the special cell wiped out the Indian Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Toiba network in the capital. Brought to the special cell in the aftermath of the high court blasts in 2011, he played a crucial role in strengthening the cell. While preventing any terror attack in the capital for over three years, the cell went on to arrest 37 terrorists, including 22 from IM and seven from LeT.

377,['1/03/2020'],"After Naidu stopped at airport, TDP meets guv","Vijayawada: After moving the high court over police detaining former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu at Visakhapatnam airport, the TDP took up the issue with governor Biswa Bhushan Harichandan on Saturday. A delegation of TDP functionaries submitted a memorandum to the governor alleging that the state government used brute force to suppress rightful dissent.

The delegation, led by former ministers Nakka Anand Babu, Alapati Rajendra Prasad, MLCs Ashok Babu, Bachula Arjunudu, former MLAs Tenali Sravan Kumar and Bode Prasad among others met the governor. They accused YSRC of being paranoid and resorting to revenge.

They alleged that if such callous acts of the government go unhindered, there would be anarchy. The police are pursuing their personal agenda by conniving with the ruling party, the TDP said in a statement after meeting the governor.

The TDP leaders also told the governor that the Visakhapatnam incident was not a lone example of the government’s attempt to stifle the voice of dissent. They alleged that in the past few months, police have denied the opposition parties their right of expression in the guise of imposing prohibitory orders. In Visakhapatnam, the police allowed the YSRC cadre to disrupt the programme of Naidu. Instead of controlling the mob, they arrested Naidu by serving him 151 CrPC notice, they alleged.

The TDP delegation also expressed concerns about the safety of Naidu in the representation submitted to the governor. They have raised the issue of moving Naidu from the assembly in a regular vehicle instead of a bullet-proof vehicle on the night of January 20. Although Naidu is under Z+ security cover, the state government often puts him in dangerous situation and compromises his security, they alleged. tnn

379,['1/03/2020'],Riot probe: Congress seeks SC supervision,"AICC spokesman Anand Sharma

NEW DELHI: Alleging that Delhi Police was lodging false cases against bonafide protesters after letting the rioters to burn the capital for four days, Congress Saturday urged the Supreme Court to supervise riots cases even as it underlined that the entire world was watching the happenings in India.

AICC spokesman Anand Sharma said that protesters were being booked for attempt to murder for merely saying that they will not leave the protest site even if they had to die with cases even lodged against an organisation called “united against hate”. He said the police action mirrors the earlier lodging of sedition cases against protesters who flouted Section 144. In contrast, he said BJP leaders who gave incendiary speeches had not yet been booked for hate speeches.

“We urge the Supreme Court to take cognisance of all these cases. Let the SC appoint an amicus curiae, let them scrutinise all such cases which are being registered. People are being framed and put in jails,” Sharma said.

“The SC is the custodian of the Constitution. The delays don’t help. The entire world is watching this country. It is time the SC intervened effectively to protect the rights of citizens guaranteed by the Indian Constitution,” he added.

Sharma alleged the police “which allowed Delhi to burn for four days” was carrying out a “one-sided” investigation. “As per the cases registered, if made by BJP leaders, they are not hate speeches, and protests by citizens are a threat to the society,” he said.

381,['1/03/2020'],Sternest test yet: School in race to be ready for exams,"New Delhi: As rioters wreaked havoc in northeast Delhi, even schools were not spared. With life limping back to normal now, there are signs of activity there too. DRP Convent School in Mustafabad, for one, has started rebuilding on a war-footing to host students for the upcoming exams. On Sunday, teachers joined the management in its effort to restore the school to its original state. That won’t be easy though, with several floors damaged and the furniture charred.

Sandeep Verma, a mathematics teacher, lent a helping hand to the carpenters. Others assisted with painting the gates and the walls. Verma said the school community would ensure that the exams, which were scheduled to start from March 13, were not postponed. “We have another branch in Johripur , but we are committed to holding the exams here. Everyone will come together for this purpose,” he said. The school, located along the main Brijpuri Road, caters to some 1,200 students who come from a mix of communities from Shiv Vihar as well as Mustafabad.

Most of the rooms on the ground floor have been reduced to ashes. Books have gone too. Caretaker Roop Singh said the school was vandalised over two days by a mob of over 1,000 people. Sunil Sharma, another teacher, said: “We will give our best shot to starting the exams on time —even if that means camping here.”

Having remained holed up in their homes for several days due to the imposition of Section 144, several parents, too, arrived at the school to not only check its condition but also help out. Teena Yadav, whose son is an LKG student, said the children were scared. “It has been a week since they last came to school. They want to go back and meet their friends,” she said. Others say that while it won’t be easy for them to send their wards to school, they have no other option. Lalita Devi said she didn’t want her two kids to lose out on a year after studying so hard.

“Where MGP feels they are strong, we will support them and where we feel we are strong, they will support us,” Chodankar said.

Congress also demanded the resignations of chief minister Pramod Sawant and Union minister of state for defence and AYUSH Shripad Naik, accusing both of serving Karnataka’s interests, instead of Goa’s, in the tri-state Mhadei water sharing dispute.

383,['1/03/2020'],"Delhi: Amulya Patnaik didn’t lead from front, his image makeover for the force was non-starter","Amulya Patnaik

NEW DELHI: It was December 15, 2019. Violence had erupted in southeast Delhi’s New Friends Colony around 3.30pm with rioters setting buses on fire and pelting stones at policemen. Even as an area of the city burnt, police commissioner Amulya Patnaik was in Dwarka, cutting the ribbon at the inauguration ceremony of a public facilitation desk. This pretty much sums up Patnaik’s tenure as police chief — indifferent.

After then police chief Alok Verma was posted as director, CBI, in January 2017, 1984 batch officers Dharmendra Kumar and Deepak Mishra were the front-runners for the post of police commissioner, being the seniormost officers of the cadre. Taking them and the force by surprise, Patnaik managed to beat them to the chair.

Patnaik, who always preferred the backseat in his career, had his own plans for the force. One of the first things he did after taking charge was to ask women cops to shed their uniform, wear colourful sarees and sit at a desk at the entrance of police stations. Though it was apparently aimed at an “image makeover” wherein people were to be greeted with a smile upon entering a police station and not by frowning, old duty officers, many in the department — particularly senior women cops — criticised the move as ‘sexist’.

As far as decisions regarding welfare of the force is concerned, Patnaik’s intentions, people close to him say, were good. “It was just that he did not have a good plan or planners in place. Look at his supposed revamp of the crime branch..While he meant to do good, he ended up making teams with nomenclature like STARS & IGIS. He wanted to have a reformed cyber cell but ended up getting embroiled in inter-departmental politics and sidelining able people. The result was visible in their performance,” said a senior cop.

While Patnaik struggled to prove his mettle by working on the image of the force, law and order began to take a beating. His first big challenge was the major violence which broke out at Ramjas College in May 2017. Neither he, nor his deputy, chief of law and order, visited the spot. The college, meanwhile, turned into a battlefield, leaving dozens, including journalists, injured.

Throughout his tenure, Patnaik was seldom seen at any law and order situation. Those who have worked with him say he had individuals, and never a team of officers, in his close circle. “More than IPS officers, he trusted a few DANIPS cadre officers,” said another officer. For about a year, 1990-batch IPS officer R P Upadhyay was Patnaik’s troubleshooter as he took control of law and order.

After the Ramjas violence, two major challenges thrown at him were the farmers’ agitation at NH-24 and Vishwa Hindu Parishad’s rally at Ramlila Maidan. Thanks to Upadhyay and joint commissioners on the ground, Patnaik sailed through unscathed.

“Under Patnaik, police functioning focused on inauguration of initiatives, applications, buildings and cultural programmes. The core concepts of policing i.e. investigation, detection and prevention of crime were never given due importance. It was always done as a damage control measure,” said another top officer, who is currently serving out of Delhi.

The real test for Patnaik began in 2019, when he started losing his troubleshooters who got posted out of Delhi. Brazen shooting incidents and gang wars were staged in the city. While the police appeared helpless in controlling the organized gangs, the street crime situation hit rock bottom.

The last round of tremors began in November last year. In the aftermath of the Tis Hazari violence, a large section of force revolted and staged a protest demanding that the police chief should stand up for them. This unprecedented event was seen as a result of a build-up of a series of incidents where Patnaik did not side with the force.

As the anti-CAA protests broke out, the police came under fire in their conduct at Jamia and JNU. His tenure would have come to an end on January 31 but he was given a month’s extension in the wake of elections. The north-east Delhi riots proved to be the last nail in his coffin. As he hangs up his boot after three long years, his successor has his work cut out.

After violations were detected through the board's confidential material tracking monitoring (CMTM) mobile application, CBSE issued 1,242 notices, each carrying a fine of Rs 50,000, to the schools.Anurag Tripathi, secretary, CBSE, disclosed that the majority of the notices were issued during the first 10 days of the examinations, which started on February 15, though none of the cases involved tampering of question papers. The violations, he said, were related to timelines associated with the exam process, handling of confidential materials and delegation of scheduled responsibilities.It is for the first time that CBSE is taking a disciplinary step of this sort and imposing financial penalties. The schools facing action include Kendriya Vidyalayas, Navodaya Vidyalayas and government and private schools. The notices were sent not only to the school principals, but also the school education departments in the states concerned, school managements and official authorised to enforce compliance. The schools have been cautioned that repeat violation could attract a fine of up to Rs 5 lakh and even disaffiliation.“Following this, 99% of the schools are complying with the guidelines,” said Tripathi. “CBSE is cracking the whip not to harass a school, but to ensure safety of the students, preserve the sanctity of the exam process, sustain the trust of the people and offer a full-proof examination. If the schools respond to the notices with genuine reasons, for instance that internet access was not available, then the fines will be waived.”According to a senior CBSE official, the board is enforcing a “zero-tolerance policy” on any breach of the examination guidelines for 2020 and affiliation bylaws. For the safe collection and delivery of exam materials such as question papers, the guidelines require photo tagging of the custodian and centre superintendent with the image of the material meant for that particular centre. The superintendents, who are generally school principals, have also been instructed to be personally involved in the handling of the confidential materials and not to delegate their responsibilities to others. “If emergency cases require the superintendents to delegate work to others, they have to take written permission from CBSE regional offices,” said Tripathi.Over 5,000 centre superintendents were directed to personally use the CMTM app at each step of the exam process. The app captures images, time and location of activities like receiving of sensitive materials, opening of question paper packets and completion of the exam. Timelines were given for each part of the process.According to sources in the board, sensitive exam centres were identified, and principals of other institutions were deputed as superintendents at such centres.

The postponement of the event has led to discussions and speculations on social media. Some of these comments made on social media have even questioned the legitimacy of some of the nominees.

However, sources in the endowments department said that this is only a temporary delay and that there would be no changes made to the list of nominated members.

In a government order issued on February 20, the state government appointed 16 members to the Simhachalam Trust Board. Constituted after a gap of 15 years, the nominations reportedly raised many eyebrows. Although hereditary trustee P Ashok Gajapathi Raju who became the chairman of the board had welcomed the move.

Speculations were rife on social media about the merit and eligibility of sone of the nominated members. However, the endowments department is tight-lipped about whether it is those speculations on social media that led to the postponement of the swearing-in ceremony.

Sources are of the opinion that disagreement over the appointed members might be responsible for the delay. According to them, people from BJP, TDP and even some members of YSRC are unhappy with the list of nominated candidates. Some changes to the list could be in the offing, they said.

387,['1/03/2020'],"Lift schemes: Irrigation department, discoms in ‘power’ struggle","Representative image

HYDERABAD: Telangana power distribution companies (discoms) and the irrigation department are at loggerheads with each other over power requirement for lift irrigation schemes. So much so, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had to step in to resolve the differences, highly-placed sources said.

Owing to the differences on power indents, the discoms have even deferred the date of filings of annual aggregate requirement (ARR) to the Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission (TSERC).

The Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Ltd and the Telangana State Northern Power Distribution Company Ltd were supposed to file ARRs to TSERC on Saturday, but sought a month’s time to file ARRs as the lift irrigation scheme indents were not finalised. With the budget session beginning on March 6, the delay looks inevitable. Sources said the discoms and the irrigation wing were also warring over the per unit cost at which power need to be supplied.

“The irrigation department has submitted a proposal that it requires 5,290 MW a day to run the lift irrigation schemes such as Kaleshwaram, Devadula, Sitarama, Palamuru-Rangareddy and the existing schemes like Kalwakurthy, Nettampadu, Bheema and Alimineti Madhava Reddy. But, the energy department assesses that the irrigation schemes will need only 3,000-3,200 MW going by the previous consumption,” a senior official of TSTransco said.

Last year too, the irrigation department had placed an indent for 4,000 MW, but only 2,100 MW was granted. “The Yellampally project under Kaleshwaram was filled following rains in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh and pumps were not fully operated,” officials said.

Irrigation experts say that projected figures are submitted to the discoms to get them ready for providing power. “If all pumps under Kaleshwaram project are operated, the single project itself will need about 5,000 MW. Similarly, Palamuru Rangareddy project (phase I) will require 2,000 MW and Sitarama 650 MW. Another 1,500 MW will be needed for existing lift schemes . Since all the pumps are not operated at a time, the demand comes down,” a chief engineer of irrigation department said.

Meanwhile, the irrigation department is planning to procure power under open access method where it would get electricity at a cheaper rate. While the discoms have been charging Rs 4.80 per unit, the charges will come down to Rs 2.30 in the new method.

NEW DELHI: Border Security Force (BSF) will help its jawan, Mohammad Anees, rebuild his house in Khajuri Khas which was burnt during the riots that engulfed northeast Delhi recently. On Saturday, BSF DIG Pushpendra Singh Rathore visited Anees’ house and assured his parents of all possible help from the paramilitary force. BSF engineers, who will assess the extent of the damage, accompanied him.

Speaking to TOI, Rathore confirmed that BSF will help in rebuilding the house and giving compensation to the jawan’s family. “BSF is always there for our men and their families. We came here to show our support to Anees’ family,” said Rathore.

“As soon as we got to know about the ordeal of the BSF jawan and his family, we contacted the father and sent our men here. We will provide compensation to Anees’ family and our engineering team is already assessing the damage,” said the DIG, who also inspected the entire building.

The 29-year-old jawan is scheduled to marry in a few months. “We should be able to help him bring back his house in good shape before that,” Rathore added.

Addressing the huge crowd that had gathered at Anees’ house, Rathore said: “Several riots have happened in the country, but people start to live together in harmony even after that. I hope that happens here too.”

Recounting how his house was lost in just three hours, Mohammad Munees, the jawan’s father, said: “The whole thing started in the morning and went on for three hours. The mob first burnt a car near our house and then started hurling petrol bombs. I tried calling the police but they arrived very late.

However, despite all the loss, Munees has a message of peace to share. “I want to give the message of brotherhood to all those who live in the area. We have been living here for over 30 years and I wish people stay together in harmony in future too,” he said.

389,['1/03/2020'],"Delhi: Two Nirbhaya convicts file pleas, Tihar told to reply","Akshay Thakur (L); Pawan Gupta (R)

NEW DELHI: As the date of hanging approaches, convicts in the Nirbhaya case have once again got active.

Saturday saw two of the four moving a Delhi court seeking a stay on the execution of the death warrants, scheduled for March 3, on the ground that a fresh mercy plea had been filed by Akshay Thakur .

Additional Session Judge Dharmender Rana issued notice to Tihar Jail authorities on the pleas moved of Thakur and Pawan Gupta , directing the officials to file their response by March 2.

In his plea moved through his lawyer, Thakur claimed he had filed a fresh mercy petition before the President, which was pending and therefore the death warrants needed to be deferred.

Meanwhile, advocate A P Singh, appearing for Mukesh Singh, claimed that his earlier mercy petition dismissed by the President did not have complete facts and were filed in a hurry which led to it being incomplete.

Gupta, in his plea, told the court he had filed a curative petition before the Supreme Court, which too was pending. He said that he also had the option of filing a mercy petition, which he was yet to exercise.

On February 17, the court had ordered that the four convicts — Singh, Gupta, Thakur and Vinay Sharma be hanged on March 3 after it issued fresh death warrants, observing that deferring the execution any further would be “sacrilegious” to the rights of the victim for expeditious justice.

It directed that the four men be hanged by neck on March 3 at 6am. This was for the third time that the death warrants were issued by the court against them.

The court had noted that death warrants were earlier issued on January 7 and the execution was later deferred twice, i.e., on January 17 and January 31.

Except Gupta the other three had exhausted their mercy plea.

The first date of execution, January 22, was postponed to February 1 by a January 17 court order. Then the trial court, on January 31, stayed “till further orders” the execution of the four convicts as they had not exhausted all their legal remedies.

Meanwhile, in a connected development a PIL was filed on Saturday in Delhi high court seeking directions to the National Human Rights Commission to set up an inquiry and submit a report about the physical and mental condition of the four death row convicts.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

“I would like to bring to the attention of the chief minister that green cover in almost all village panchayats and municipal areas is being systematically destroyed by the powerful builders’ lobby, who are mostly non-Goans and possess just one motto, to mint money by corrupting officials,” Lourenco said adding that district collectors, deputy collectors and other government officials have failed to stop this ecological destruction. “Corrective action must be taken to prevent constant chopping down of trees across the state,” he said.

Lourenco cited recent Supreme Court proceedings where a three-member bench presided by Chief Justice S A Bobde had asked central government authorities to look at ways to create roads without cutting trees.

AHMEDABAD: A 26-year-old youth, a resident of Vastrapur originally from Kolkata, who is a consultant with a private company, fell into a trap set by cyber cheats, who lured him with the promise of chatting with a woman on a dating application.

The cheats took Rs 4,59,415 from him before he realized he had been cheated. They had threatened to upload his identity card on social media and defame him.

The youth first approached the cyber cell on February 2, and finally lodged an FIR at Vastrapur police station. ACP A Division Mukesh Patel said they have lodged an offence for cheating under Sections 406, 420, 506(1) and 114 of the IPC.

“We have the phone numbers the cheats used to call the victim to demand money.We will track these numbers and the bank account in which they made the victim pay the money,” he added.

According to the FIR lodged by the victim, in December 2019, he thought of chatting with a woman online. “Through a search engine, he got a number and a photo of a woman on a dating website. He called the number, but the person on the other end, she was not the one he has called,” said a Vastrapur police official.

He received a missed call from the same number at about noon when he was at work. He called back at about 2pm. The person on the other end identified herself as Dimpy and said that she ran a dating agency.

According to FIR, she asked the victim his location to arrange a meeting with a girl. She said he would have to become a member of the club first, by paying Rs 1,000. The victim paid the money into a bank account specified by the woman.

The woman then called him again and asked for his identity card and email address and how old he wanted the woman to be. He then provided his identity card to the woman.

The woman sent him two pictures of women on WhatsApp, and he picked a 26-year-old woman and deposited Rs 22,400. The cheats later made the victim pay a total of Rs 4,59,415 on various pretexts before he realized he had been cheated.

When he asked for his money back, the cheats threatened saying they would upload his picture on social media and defame him, said a police official.

While K Manikandan, 26, of Jafferkhanpet, A Thirupathi Ammal, 42, of Saidapet, and S Mary, 35, and her son S Ruben, 19, of Saidapet were sent to jail, the minor, daughter of Thirupathiammal, was admitted to the correctional facility in Kelly’s.

Police said Manikandan’s elder sister Pandi Meena, who worked as a maid, didn’t have children and was desperate for one. Through a common friend she came to know of Thirupathiammal, who allegedly made a living as a surrogate mother, and Mary. Pandi Meena then told Manikandan, 26, who offered the two women Rs 2 lakh for a child, an officer said.

After trying to get some narikurava women in Besant Nagar to sell a baby, Mary and Thirupathiammal decided to steal one when the women refused, he added.

On Thursday night, Mary, Ruben, Thirupathiammal and her daughter went to the Elliot’s beach. Around 2am on Friday, they went to the skating rink. One woman sat close to Rajeshwari and her mother Sneha, narikuravas from Kumbakonam. Around 4am, Selvi woke up and found her daughter missing. She rushed to the nearest police station with her niece. A case was registered but police found no CCTV camera at the spot. About 100 metres away, a camera caught four people including two women boarding an autorickshaw.

Police questioned an auto driver who confirmed the four had boarded his vehicle and that one woman carried a child. Police checked footage from CCTV cameras at Chinnamalai near Saidapet and at Jafferkhanpet. One showed the gang handing over the child to Manikandan, a second showed him walking home with the girl and a third had him handing her over to Pandi Meena.

On Saturday afternoon, a police team landed at Manikandan’s house and later rescued the girl from Pandi Meena’s house. She was reunited with her parents in the evening.

Adyar assistant commissioner Vinoth Shantharam who formed the special team and its members sub-inspectors Jai Ganesh and Karthikeyan and constables Thirumurugan, Pushparaj, Damodharan, Senthilkumar, Venkateshwaran and Vinod won praise from commissioner A K Viswanathan.

396,['1/03/2020'],Delhi: They wait for missing at mortuary,"A relative holds missing Aftab’s photo outside the mortuary

NEW DELHI: Rizwan Khan has been at GTB Hospital mortuary for three days, clutching his brother’s photograph, waiting for some news about him. His brother Aftab, a Class XI student, had come to Delhi to make some money. From what Rizwan gathered, Aftab and his two friends encountered a mob in Shiv Vihar on February 25. While the others managed to hide in a nearby godown, Aftab took the blows, a contractor who brought him to Delhi told Khan. The contractor too had a close shave and escaped only by chanting ‘Jai Mata Di’.

The godown was set on fire by the rioters, but the police came in within 45 minutes and rescued the two boys from the back entrance. There was no news of Aftab in GTB Hospital or Urban Hospital , Khan doesn’t know if he is in jail, whether he is alive or dead. He doesn’t dare go to Shiv Vihar to file an FIR, because he has heard the situation is “still dangerous for Muslims”.

Just on Friday, ragpicker Ayub was lynched in the area when he ventured out in desperate need of food, Khan pointed out. “My brother is gentle and helpful, he once dreamed of being a doctor,” he said. He hoped that someone would bring him news, while his mother stood distraught next to him. “I pray a lot, dekhte hain dua mein kitna asar hai,” he said.

As he spoke, two other bodies were brought out from the hospital. Aamir and Hashim were brothers whose bodies were found in a drain in Ganga Vihar, Gokulpuri. Aamir was a cab driver, his brother a tailor, said a person standing by the family.

Not heeding the warning of their eldest brother Shairuddin, 25-year-old Aamir and 19-year-old Hashim set out from Ghaziabad on Wednesday evening to meet their family in the violence-hit Gokulpuri. The following day, after they went missing, their family rushed to GTB Hospital and identified the bodies.

According to Akram, a family friend, “Around 8.45pm Shairuddin received a call from Aamir that he was coming to Gokulpuri to meet him and warned him not to.”

All this while, a family waited for the hospital to hand them the body of their son. “It has been four days. We have come here from Madhubani, Bihar. Police are not cooperating. Our tears have dried up; we just want to take the body and go home,” said Mohammad Ibrahim, father of 35-year-old Mubarak Hussain, who died during the violence.

Several community elders from Dilshad Garden are assenting in the processes at the hospital. S Hasan, a former RWA head and retired government official, suggested that the hospital set up a nodal point for those seeking news. “This is was a big problem earlier, because the police officer had not been coming regularly, which delayed the postmortems, but now, with the intervention from Shahdara and Seemapuri MLAs, the permission process has been simplified,” he said.

Most of those who died were migrant labourers, the poorest, he said. Among the dead was a hotel worker from Uttarakhand, Dalbir Singh. His brother could not even afford a cremation, but Hasan, Mohammed Daoud and others bore the cost of the ambulance and the last rites.

Meanwhile, Jhilmil Colony gurdwara has set up a free tea, water and snacks stand for everyone at the hospital. People from Dilshad Garden bring food for the families too.

In a shed, where families, lawyers and journalists were milling around, one man accompanied a neighbour, whose son, 22-year-old Salman, was shot in the head. Displaying his photo, he said, “He lived in Loni and worked in a small shop in Mustafabad. His father is inside waiting for the postmortem to be completed.” Hearing the conversation, a policeman nearby responded, “Insaniyat khatam ho gayi, people are worse than animals.

CHENNAI: The cyber-crime wing police arrested two people from Rajasthan who conned people by uploading photos of ‘army vehicles for sale’ in an online portal, pretending to be army officials.

At least 20 people lodged police complaints about the post on the online portal after they paid money believing the post to be genuine. The victims had wanted to buy used army vehicles at cheaper rates.

The accused identified as M Naresh Pal Singh, 36, and L Bachchu Singh, 26, were arrested from their hometown by a team of the cybercrime wing. Police said the duo is part of a gang that has cheated people across the country to the tune of more than Rs100 crore.

Narrating the modus operandi, a cyber-crime wing official said the duo had posted photos of two-wheelers, cars and trucks on the popular e-commerce platform OLX, claiming to be army personnel who wanted to sell the vehicles as they had transferred to another town. The gang shared fake documents of the vehicle to make it seem a genuine deal and enticed people by quoting a cheap price.

“They demanded Rs5,000 to Rs50,000 as advance, depending upon the nature of the vehicles and were asked the money to be transferred through e-payment portals. After the money was transferred, they would keep giving excuses for the delay and eventually snap ties with the buyer,” said an officer.

After the CCB received several similar complaints, a team was formed. “The team went to Rajasthan and nabbed the duo after a lot of struggle as the local police were not helpful. We were not even allowed to enter their village initially,” said police. They were produced before a magistrate at Bharatpur and will be brought to Chennai on Sunday. Police suspect that a larger network is at work in Rajasthan and further investigation is on.

401,['1/03/2020'],Goa must look ‘with all seriousness’ Mauvin’s aide’s role in MPDA: HC,"Representative image

PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has asked the state government to look at the potential conflict of interest in the way Mormugao Planning and Development Authority ( MPDA ) took decisions and asked the BJP-led government to look at the role played by civic body member Kamla Prasad Yadav and panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho’s aide’s role “with all seriousness”.

Expressing concerns over potential conflict of interest in the way MPDA took decisions, the HC said that these decisions are “vulnerable” to be overturned “if challenged”.

The high court’s observations came while ordering actions against “unauthorised constructions mushrooming” around Goa International Airport and in light of the resolution passed by MPDA on November 18 rejecting the colour-coded zoning map (CCZM) prepared by the Navy as per the civil aviation ministry’s provisions.

Godinho, the Dabolim MLA, is also a member of the MPDA, while Yadav is a deputy sarpanch of Chicalim panchayat.

Godinho had accused the Navy of ruling Goa by proxy and regulating construction around the state’s lone airport. At the core of Godinho’s outrage are buildings with over 100 flats—survey numbers 60/2, 63/5 and 63/8— built by Yadav.

Though justices Mahesh Sonak and Mukulika Jawalkar chose not to go deeper into the issue, they did stress that it “disturbing” to see that Yadav is a member of MPDA and allegedly responsible for “unauthorised construction” around the airport.

“What is more disturbing is that one of the parties to these petitions Kamla Prasad Yadav (builder) who is alleged to have undertaken the unauthorised construction in prima facie defiance of 2015 Rules and the CCZM prepared thereunder, in his capacity as the deputy sarpanch and member of the MPDA, is also a party to the resolution,” the court said.

The high court said that “impression is created” that MPDA and the Chicalim panchayat are interested in protecting illegal structures “regardless of issue of aviation safety”.

The counsel for MPDA and the lawyer for Yadav informed the high court that the Town And Country Planning Act did not prevent members of planning authorities from taking part in decisions where there is personal interest.

Counsel for the petitioner, advocate Rohit Bras De Sa said that Yadav’s personal interest was served when MPDA passed the resolution. “This is a serious issue because you are not only playing with national security but also with people’s lives. The conflict of interest can be seen in the resolution where basically they were trying to defy the court,” De Sa said.

“According to us, at least prima facie, this is a case of conflict between interest and duty,” the high court said.

The high court also pulled up the state government for not doing enough to stop the illegalities around the airport.

“In a petition of this nature, our role is to basically activate statutory authorities who, despite acknowledging that unauthorised constructions, which pose danger to aviation safety, have come up around the airport, have failed to take any meaningful action against the same,” the high court said.

403,['1/03/2020'],Farooq aides’ assets attached over JKCA scam,"National Conference president Farooq Abdullah ( Picture credits: TOI)

NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR: In a further setback to former J&K chief minister Farooq Abdullah , the Enforcement Directorate on Saturday attached assets of Rs 2.6 crore of Ahsan Ahmad Mirza and Mir Manzoor Gazanffer, close associates of the former CM, in a money laundering case for alleged misappropriation of funds of the J&K Cricket Association.

The attached assets consist of three FDRs (fixed deposit receipts) of Rs 1.29 crore with J&K Bank branch in Lajpat Nagar, New Delhi. 11 Kanals of land with structure and commercial shopping complex at Pandrethan in Srinagar to the tune of Rs 1.31 crore ,” the ED in a statement said.

The ED has also unearthed several transactions where the JKCA funds were transferred “illegally” in the personal accounts of Mirza.

Sources said, between 2002 and 2011, the JKCA received Rs 112 crore from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). Abdullah, then as its president, “appointed” Mirza as “treasurer” in 2003 though he was not elected at that time and through him allegedly laundered the money of the JKCA.

The ED, which has already questioned Abdullah once in the same case registered under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, has found that the former CM had allegedly used Mirza to open several accounts in the J&K Bank using fictitious documents to launder funds. Abdullah is currently under detention under the Public Safety Act .

Abdullah had allegedly made Mirza signatory to cheques issued in the name of J&K Cricket Association. Mirza, though not elected office bearer, was made “treasurer” of J&K Cricket Association by Abdullah through a resolution signed by him and then general secretary of the association, according to ED’s investigation.

The role of a senior executive of the J&K Bank, now retired, is also under scrutiny for helping the former J&K CM in opening these bank accounts based on “inadequate” documents. Mirza raised loans in these accounts from the bank and transferred them to his personal account and further laundered them, the probe has revealed.

When in 2007, the then elected treasurer of J&K Cricket Association (JKCA), Mir Manzoor Gazanffer, brought these fictitious transactions to the notice of JKCA president Farooq Abdullah, the latter ignored the anomalies in the association’s accounts, the ED probe has revealed. Gazanffer is now one of the accused for laundering the proceeds of crime.

It has been found that cheques of JKCA were deposited in the personal accounts of Mirza. Questioning of elected treasurer Gazanffer by the ED further revealed that he had signed some cheques, which were deposited in the personal accounts of Mirza, at the instructions of Farooq Abdullah.

Mirza was arrested by the ED in this case and a charge sheet under the PMLA has also been filed before a special court in Srinagar.

NEW DELHI: A total of 69 riot-affected persons have applied till Saturday evening to take immediate monetary relief of Rs 25,000 announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal . After holding a marathon meeting to review the distribution of relief and implementation of rehabilitation measures in riot-affected areas with the senior officials at the office of northeast district magistrate on Saturday, Kejriwal said that all the 69 applicants would be given the money by Sunday so that they can restart their life.

The authorities distributed the application forms on Saturday in the affected areas. “Priority of the government is to restore normalcy,” the CM said.

Kejriwal appealed to the people, who have left their homes, to come back and resume a normal life. He said that the task to identify the victims has almost been completed. “All SDMs have carried out inspections in their respective areas and completed the identification of damage and affected people, but the government will be able to share the data only on Sunday.”

Kejriwal added that there is no crisis of food, and there is enough arrangement for shelter. “The security of the public will be ensured. Orders have already been issued to repair all the defunct street lights.”

Most of the relief camps set up by the government in Shashtri Park, Seelampur, GTB Hospital, Kabool Nagar and other places have zero to few people as the riot-affected people prefer the comfort and security of their relatives’ houses than the relief camps.

“A few people had come to the camp on Thursday and Friday, but they all spent just a night there. They were mostly the attendants of the people who were injured and hospitalised,” said Dharmendra Kumar, a vendor near the relief camp at GTB Hospital Gate No. 3.

The relief camps though appeared clean, and rugs, blankets, mattresses and pillows were neatly stacked for the needy people.

In the Kabool Nagar camp, which is located around three kilometres from Jaffrabad where the communal violence raged for a couple of days, not many turn up to take shelter. “It was not risk free to walk three kilometres and take shelter in the relief camps. People preferred the houses of their relatives for security reasons,” said Md Irshaq, a local.

Delhi government had opened 11 relief camps to provide accommodation to the people who were displaced in the violence.

Meanwhile, health minister Satyendar Jain visited GTB Hospital on Saturday to meet the riot victims and their families. “We are monitoring medical condition of all the victims and are committed to take every possible step to ensure their speedy recovery,” he stated on Twitter.

Urs, which began on February 17, will continue till March 6 and Pakistani pilgrims will be here till March 7.

“It is clear in the visa rules that the delegation will move in a group during their visit. They will be taken to the dargah in a group during the hours decided in consultation with members of the delegation. It will help us in providing security to them,” said Ajmer SP Kunwar Rastradeep.

For the first time, Pakistani pilgrims have been asked to visit the shrine for a specific duration instead of going to the dargah any time of the day.

They are also not allowed to visit any Hujra (priest seat) or the house of their Khadim (priest), which they otherwise used to do. The restrictions have clearly made the pilgrims unhappy.The Pakistani pilgrims have been kept on the premises of a central girls’ government school at Naya Bazaar in Ajmer, which is about 1km from the shrine.The restrictions were conveyed to the leader of the Pakistani delegation during a meeting with dargah committee officials and members of the Khadim community at the SP office on Saturday.

The administration has provided the Pakistani pilgrims a duration of 6-10 hours on a daily basis, depending upon the auspiciousness of the day. Sources said that their visit time will be 2pm onwards.

Requesting anonymity, some Pakistani delegates said the time restriction would not allow them to offer five prayers a day on any day.

“The restriction in visit hours is in accordance with the visa rules. They will not be allowed to visit the shrine beyond the specific hours and they have to move in a group or in small groups inside the shrine under police cover,” the SP told TOI over the phone.

Other restrictions include eating food inside the dargah premises. The Pakistani pilgrims have been categorically told not to eat inside (the shrine) or at the residences of their Khadims, which will disunite the group violating visa rules.

412,['1/03/2020'],Vyapam scam accused found heading government hospital in Madhya Pradesh,"Dr Amit Kumar Yadav

AGRA: A doctor who was named by CBI as an accused in the Vyapam scam was found to be working as the superintendent of a government hospital in Madhya Pradesh’s Datia district despite many courts, including the Supreme Court, rejecting his bail pleas. The accused, who is the son of a BSP politician, used forged documents to get the job, claimed hospital authorities.

Dr Amit Kumar Yadav, who worked as the superintendent of government hospital, Datia, allegedly used fraudulent means to clear PMT 2006 exam and was named as the accused number one in the CBI chargesheet filed in December 2019.

According to the CBI, with the help of middlemen Deepak Yadav (Gwalior, MP) and Surender Verma (Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh), Dr Yadav hired impersonator Prabhat Chaudhary (Sambhal, UP) to appear for him.

Following the chargesheet, Gwalior district court issued a non-bailable warrant against Dr Yadav, but he applied for bail in HC, which was rejected on February 27. The accused doctor is now absconding.

When contacted, Dr Rajesh Gaur, dean of government hospital, Datia, told TOI, “The doctor had filed a false affidavit and hid the fact that he was the prime accused in the Vyapam scam to obtain the job. We are going to take action against him on Monday.”

A senior government doctor, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “At least five times, Dr Yadav’s bail was rejected by various courts, including SC, but he was never arrested. In fact, he continued to work as hospital superintendent and was later made the nodal officer for an upcoming hospital project worth Rs 250 crore.”

Dr Yadav’s father Lakhan Singh Yadav is a well-known contractor who had contested the 2018 assembly polls from Sewda assembly constituency on a BSP ticket. He stood third.

“In April 2018, Dr Yadav was selected by the Datia hospital administration as assistant professor for forensic medicine, even though 10 candidates who appeared for the job interview were way more qualified than him. Dr Yadav did his MD in forensic medicine from a private college,” the doctors said.

Government hospital dean Dr Gaur said, “The accused doctor was removed from all the posts several weeks ago. Our committee is going through his case closely.”

As many as 289, including pre-medical test candidates, their parents, impersonators and middlemen, were named as accused in a supplementary chargesheet filed by the CBI in the Gwalior court in connection with alleged irregularities in the MP Vyapam case in December last year.

Out of the total, 41 impersonators and middlemen are from UP, mainly from Agra, Aligarh, Sambhal, Hamirpur, Allahabad, Mirzapur, Kaushambi, Kanpur, Mau, Deoria, Azamgarh and other districts.

GMR Goa International Airport Ltd had approached the board seeking that consent to establish under the Air and Water Acts be extended. Its application was placed before the board’s technical advisory committee on December 2 last year, during which extension of validity was recommended.

Once ready, the airport at Mopa will handle 4.4 million passengers per annum. Although it was slated to be completed by September this year, the state cabinet extended the deadline up to May 30, 2022 owing to delays in the project caused by litigations.

The government had signed a concession agreement with GMR Goa to develop the airport on a public-private partnership on November 8, 2016. Construction of phase I began on September 4, 2017. The state appointed Engineers India Ltd, a Government of India entity, to supervise progress.

The project, however, faced constraints where the felling of trees was concerned. A 365-day stay by the Supreme Court was also imposed against the environmental clearance granted by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change.

On January 16 this year, the apex court upheld the environment clearance and allowed construction to resume. It said that although there was a stay on the felling of trees for 167 days, there was no stay on the project. The pace of construction, however, slowed down considerably.

The overall progress achieved during the stay on tree felling was 5.3% as against planned progress of 10.9%.

NEW DELHI: Behind the main tent at the Shaheen Bagh protest , groups stood around watching relief material being collected for the riot-hit areas in northeast Delhi. Inside the tent, the speeches and songs continued at a slower pace, but exhorting the same messages of peace. “No matter what the slight to us, we will not lose our peace,” said a volunteer, visibly upset.

Celebrating the “nari shakti” in demonstration the last 77 days, one speaker said, “The nation has looked up to you, and you have made history.”

A visit by police in the first half of the day followed by the cops walking through the colony and a drone hovering over the neighbourhood led to some anxious moments, said the protesters. A ‘march’ announced by a Hindu fringe outfit had been called off, the police had said, but “can one ever be sure?”, said a woman in her 50s, referring to the sense of betrayal many spoke of in the days following the attacks.

Some perceived the police’s visit as a “sign to be wary of” while others said “police had been coming around often,” and that Saturday’s visit to the protest site was “no different”.

If some talk of “Supreme Court has said it will hear the matter on March 23 and nothing can be done before that,” there are those who are “ready for anything untoward, what can one do?”

Anxiety has them further rooted to the ground, though as the rain came down, many raced home. A peace march planned for Sunday will now depend on the weather.

He added that he was informed that the protest would end after he received their memorandum. “Holding a protest is everyone’s democratic right but it should not cause inconvenience to the general public with blockades of roads,” he added.

Aligarh SSP Muniraj G said police will not allow anyone to disturb the city’s law and order.

418,['1/03/2020'],"HC summons top guns of AMC, ADA over pothole-riddled roads","Agra: Allahabad high court has summoned commissioner of Agra Municipal Corporation ( AMC ), vice-chairman of Agra Development Authority ( ADA ) and executive officer of Agra Smart City Limited (ASCL) following a petition over pothole-riddled roads in the city and road traffic mismanagement. The petition was filed by a social organization, Civil Society of Agra. In its petition, it has said poor maintenance of roads causes frequent accidents.

Agra city is divided into 100 municipal wards with a 1,720 km road network. Every year, more than Rs 2 crore is spent on repairing the roads.

The petition said Agra appears as if it has been ravaged by war because most of the roads have developed potholes and cracks after the monsoon. Besides, continuous digging by one or the other government department not only raises a lot of dust but also makes mobility difficult. The waterlogging and potholes due to rain and digging hinder traffic and some people have lost their lives, it added.

Anil Sharma, general secretary of the Civil Society of Agra, said, “We travelled across the city to record traffic conditions. The condition of the roads in the city, particularly at the roundabouts, is worse. It has resulted in accidents as there are huge potholes. In fact, some are so huge that the chamber of the car touches the broken road and damages the vehicles. Every day, two-wheelers lose balance due to potholes on the road and hit the on-coming drivers.”

Social worker and member of the Civil Society Rajeev Saxena said, “There is no procedure of surveying of newly-constructed roads. Although the AMC, ADA and other government departments spend large sums of money on the construction of roads in Agra, there are still permanent potholes. Newly-constructed roads show signs of damage within a month. Authorities fail to fix responsibility on for poor quality road construction.”

Senior municipal councillor Shiromani Singh said, “Our writ petition highlighting the pathetic condition of city roads and ill-managed of the traffic system, that cause much inconvenience to the citizens, has been accepted by the high court. Municipal commissioner, ADA vice-chairman and executive officer of ASCL have been summoned by the court on March 24. We will pursue the matter to its logical conclusion.”

Roads at Madia Katra, Boghipura, Kailashpuri, Shahganj locality, Paschimpuri, Sikandra road, Maruti estate and interior roads of Pratapura locality, Belanganj, Peepal Mandi, Langdey ki Chowki and Daresi, Heerabagh, Devri road and Nunihai, are among those in dire need of repairs. Roads in Trans-Yamuna and Shahdara localities around Yamuna bridge and Guru-ka-Taal also require repairs.

419,['1/03/2020'],Making restaurant management simple digitally,"With the entry of a slew of food delivery apps, eating out hasn’t just increased manyfold over the past three years, but the change has also steered restaurateurs to quickly adopt new technology. Enabling restaurateurs to efficiently manage and streamline operations, Ahmedabad-based start-up, PetPooja, came up with an effective solution to help restaurants adapt to the food app wave.

Past journey

Founded by an MBA from Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow (IIM-Lucknow), Parthiv Patel, and an MBA Apruv Patel in 2011, PetPooja helps digitize restaurants by building technology to streamline their operations to scale and make them more productive. “Food industry is a business that will never slow down but calls for adapting to changing times and formats. When it came to digitisation of the restaurant management system, all that existed was a billing machine and the PoS software that existed were extremely complex with a complex pricing structure and provided no after-sales support,” said Patel.

Changing this, PetPooja provides a PoS platform that enables restaurants to manage all of their operations effectively right from dine-in orders, online orders to billing and more. As on date, the start-up operates with 15,000+ restaurants in India and UAE, including brands such as La Pinoz, Honest and Doolally, among others.

Next steps

PetPooja recently received funding from a B2B e-commerce unicorn, Udaan. Over the years, the company launched a basic billing solution software for restaurants and an online portal for managers and owners. “Going forward, we plan to launch our indigenously developed restaurant robot to augment wait staff at restaurants.”

Challenges

One of the key challenges for PetPooja was to make an operating system that was comprehensive enough for owners to holistically manage operations while being simple enough for an ordinary biller to operate without much training, said Patel. “Creating interfaces that improves ease of adoption of new technology for employees with limited skills is a challenge and therefore, the focus is on adapting to their needs,” said Patel.

Secret to success

Creating value for restaurants through innovative solutions was the key focus, said Patel. “All we’re trying to do is to innovate, execute effectively, gather feedback and try again and remain futuristic in the process,” he said.

NEW DELHI: Thundershowers lashed parts of NCR on Saturday evening after the Indian Meteorological Department predicted moderately cloudy skies, strong surface winds, along with very light rain and hail at isolated places. The rains, which lasted for over a couple of hours, resulted in waterlogging in a number of areas in Delhi. As many as 18 flights bound for Delhi’s IGI airport were diverted to Lucknow, Ahmedabad and Jaipur.

Till 8.30pm, the Safdarjung station recorded 18.5mm rainfall, while Palam recorded 14.8mm.

“An active western disturbance (WD) caused this rain in NCR. Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, north Rajasthan, west UP and East UP were also affected. Another WD will impact Delhi on March 4 and will hit NCR on March 5 and 6. Similar rain and thundershowers can be expected then,” Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional forecasting centre at Delhi, told TOI.

Earlier on Saturday, people in Delhi woke up to a windy morning with the minimum temperature at 16.2 degrees Celsius, four notches above the season’s average. The maximum temperature was 27.3 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal.

On Sunday, partly cloudy sky is expected with the possibility of very light rain or drizzle.

The maximum temperature is expected to remain around 25 degrees Celsius, while the minimum on Sunday will be around 14 degrees Celsius, IMD said.

The rain and windy conditions also helped the city air quality as the AQI on Saturday was ‘moderate’ at 135. According to SAFAR, a body under the Union ministry, the air quality might touch ‘satisfactory’ on Sunday.

The Parliamentary Caucus on Migration and Development, Bangladesh National Parliament was organised in association with the Migrant Forum in Asia.

Members of Parliament (MP) and civil society from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, India and the Philippines, who met in Dhaka recently, spoke on the hardships suffered by migrant domestic workers from these countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations which include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE (comprising Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Umm al-Qaiwain, Fujairah, and Ra’s al Khaimah) Qatar, Bahrain and Oman. The MPs suggested that these GCC countries should also ratify ILO C 189.

“Domestic workers are human beings. They have to be treated with respect and dignity and their rights should be assured,” Bangladesh MP Md Israfil Alam said during the convention held on February 25 and 26.

The ILO C 189 which came into force in September 5, 2013, requires that several stipulations be met for the employment, treatment, and wages of domestic workers, freedom, protection against all forms of abuse, respect for their privacy, and decent living conditions.

“Bangladesh will also work towards ratifying the international convention and some local laws are already in place to protect domestic workers,” said MP Alam, who is also a migrant rights advocate.

Nepal MP Ram Kumari Jhakri said while his nation would also work towards ratifying the convention, it was equally important that GCC countries ratify it. “Migrant domestic workers from the origin countries should feel safe and protected in the GCC countries and therefore the member countries should ratify it,” she said.

Sri Lankan MP Sujith S Perera said MPs would strive for the ratification of the convention by Sri Lanka. “All the sending (origin) countries should form a regional forum where to show unity and guarantee the protection of rights and living conditions of domestic workers in the destination countries,” he said. The conference said due importance should be given to safe and legal migration.

Accused was annoyed about the four-hour-long delay of Kerala express; the connecting train to the national capital, which his elder brother was supposed to board to reach Delhi.

The man sent a tweet to the railway ministry on Friday evening when the Rajdhani was about to reach Ghaziabad junction. Taking prompt action of the tweet, GRP Agra division brought the train to a halt at Dadri junction, 17km away from Ghaziabad. However, after a thorough check of the train for three hours, no bomb was recovered.

According to GRP, the tweet was sent by a 25-year-old Sanjeev Kumar Gurjar, resident of New Vijay Vihar colony of Murar area, Gwalior district, Madhya Pradesh.

The tweet sent from his Twitter handle @sanjeevriyana1 tagged the railway minister Piyush Goyal and Delhi police. It read, “I want to inform that there are 5 bombs in a train rajdhani (12424) going from new delhi to kanpur central. Please take some action on this quickly. (sic).”

Speaking to TOI, Sachin Kaushik, the twitter handler of Agra GRP division, said, “As the tweet was brought to our notice, we immediately alerted our ground force in Dadri and also informed railway control room to stop the train immediately at Dadri junction. After three hours of thorough checking, nothing suspicious was found. Meanwhile, we also attempted to contact the person who made the tweet, but he did not reply.”

“Around 7pm, Sanjeev posted another tweet, apologising for the hoax message. He claimed that he was angry after his brother’s train was delayed for four hours.”

The tweet read, “Ye tweet mere dwara maansik tanav ki sthiti me kiya gaya tha, aaj mere bhai ki train 4 hr late ho gyi thi, jisse mujhe boht gussa tha, me iske liye bharat sarkar se maafi chahta hu. (sic)”

Senior superintendent of police, Agra GRP division, Jogendra Kumar said, “Sanjeev’s elder brother Rahul Gurjar, an army jawan posted in Kibithu, Arunachal Pradesh at 56 APO (army post office) Assam unit, was supposed to board the New Delhi-Dibrugarh Rajadhani express, but his connecting train Kerala express was running late by four hours. Therefore, in order to delay the Rajdhani, Sanjeev tweeted the hoax tweet from Gwalior.”

“The accused was arrested by Aligarh GRP team lead by SHO Raees Ahmad on Saturday. He has been booked under IPC 505 B (Statements conducing to public mischief with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the State or against the public tranquillity) and 174 railway act (Obstructing running of train, etc).”

Hindu families residing in this sensitive area said they want to sell their property and move to “safer localities” as they feel “threatened” whenever incidents of violence occur in the area.

Talking with mediapersons, Neha Agarwal, a resident, said, “Babri Mandi area is not safe for Hindus. Whenever some communal violence occurs in any part of the city, this area is primarily affected as it is Muslim dominated.” She said now, it was impossible to live in the locality.

Another resident, Dwarka Prasad, said every day, “they” create hooliganism in the area due to ongoing anti-CAA protests across the city. “We want safety for our families and have decided to sell our property and move out,” he added.

An elderly woman, Sharda Devi, said she was injured on Sunday night after a group running away from police, bumped into her and she fell on the ground. “Communal tensions are nothing new in this city and I have been seeing it for long.

425,['1/03/2020'],Elders feel a void as Mapusa’s 137-year library shut,"The Athaide Municipal Library has remained shut since September

PANAJI: Residents of Mapusa , especially senior citizens , have been robbed of their opportunity to keep their minds active and healthy after the town’s lone public library was shut down.

The Athaide Municipal Library, one of the oldest in the state and in existence since 1883, used to receive large footfalls and was shut on September 13 last year with no immediate alternative arrangements made for its relocation.

The elderly, for whom the library and its reading hall provided an opportunity to keep abreast on current affairs and delay the onset of dementia and Alzheimer’s, are feeling the void after the old municipal building that housed the library was closed by the local civic body.

One of the regulars at the library was Mapusa resident and senior citizen Simon Pereira who would spend up to two hours reading various newspapers and magazines.

“Now I only read two newspapers at home as I cannot afford to buy six newspapers every day. I used to read The Times of India regularly at the library,” 78-year-old Pereira told TOI.

The reading hall was always crowded in the evenings, sometimes even making it difficult to find a seat, he said. “It was a good pastime for us. I’m missing it very much. What else is there for us to do in our old age?” he said.

Retired banker Allan Faria who frequented the library too agreed, saying the library was a home away from home for senior citizens.

Besides the large reading hall, the library with more than 6,000 members and 25,000 books in various languages also had a separate reference section and children’s section. Children are now forced to do any reference work at their own school library.

“It is the mission of the Central government to promote education and literacy and encourage the library movement. But in Mapusa, something that was running since 1883 has been closed with no alternate arrangements made. It is a shame that it is the only town in Goa without a library today,” Faria said.

Distressed citizens deprived by the closure of the library shot off letters in December last year to the Mapusa Municipal Council, Mapusa MLA, art and culture minister, directorate of art and culture, directorate of municipal administration, health services and civil supplies and consumer affairs requesting for an urgent decision to make alternate arrangements for shifting of the reading room and library to the old Asilo Hospital which has been renovated and not in use.

Mapusa MLA Joshua D’Souza, when contacted, told TOI that he has already moved a proposal to the health minister for the library and reading room to be temporarily shifted to the ground floor of the old Asilo Hospital building.

“The library had to be shut down because the roof was collapsing and after it was declared unsafe following structural surveys. We couldn’t take a risk. We are waiting for approval from the health minister to use the old Asilo building,” he said.

427,['1/03/2020'],Firm gold prices increase recycling of gold; physical demand plunges,"Ahmedabad: Amid rising geopolitical tensions, gold prices have rallied in the international market, touching a high of $1,689 per ounce earlier this week. Since gold prices in the Gujarat market remained above the Rs 40,000-mark through most part of the festive and wedding season, the demand for physical gold has plunged, so much so that jewellery purchases are increasingly being made by exchanging previously purchased gold. In Ahmedabad, at least 70% of jewellery purchases are made by exchanging old gold, according to estimates by Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA).“Till a year ago, barely 30% gold jewellery was purchased by exchanging old gold whereas 70% were fresh purchases. However, with the rise in yellow metal prices and the recessionary trend, the ratio has reversed,” said Jigar Soni, vice-president, JAA.Similar is the situation in the diamond city of Surat, where consumers are shying away from making new purchases of gold jewellery due to the high prices of the yellow metal. In the last one month, the recycling of old gold has increased by about 35% in Surat and South Gujarat region. “Cash sales in the jewellery showrooms have gone down by almost 40% due to the high gold prices. Customers are preferring to recycle their old ornaments and coins for the jewellery. Out of 40kg of gold jewellery manufacturing per day in Surat, about 12kg consists of recycled gold,” said Nainesh Pachchigar, director, Indian Bullion Jewellers Association (IBJA).Gold prices have been on the upward trend since early last year. Thanks to this, the demand for gold has significantly reduced. According to data by Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex, gold imports plunged to the lowest ever at 49.1 tonnes in the state in 2019, against 56.3MT in 2018.With reduced demand for physical gold, jewellers are facing significant loss in business. “Our business has come down to 25% as customers are reluctant to buy gold at such a high price. Those who need jewellery for marriages prefer to buy new designs in exchange of old jewellery,” said Bhayabhai Soni, president, Rajkot Gold Dealers’ Association (RGDA).Revenues of jewellers have also come down. Manoj Soni, an Ahmedabad-based jeweller said, “People come with a fixed budget for gold purchases and the proportion of transactions made through exchange of gold is high. As a result, revenues of jewellers have taken a hit. At the same time, purchase for gold jewellery other than wedding occasions has declined by more than 50%.”Rallying price trendWith the coronavirus infections spreading not just in China but other countries as well, gold prices have rallied in the international market. Yellow metal prices consequently touched a record high earlier this week, breaching the Rs 45,000-mark per 10g in Ahmedabad to settle at Rs 45,050 per 10g. “Gold prices are hovering around Rs 44,000 per 10g in the Ahmedabad market for about a week now. Due to this, the demand for physical gold has significantly declined and is impacting employment in the sector,” said Haresh Acharya, national director, IBJA.“With continuing geopolitical uncertainty, gold prices are expected to remain on the upward till the end of 2020. The spike in coronavirus cases is expected to have an adverse impact on global trade. and as a result, investors are moving towards safe-haven investments in gold,” said Sudhish Nambiath, head, India Gold Policy Centre (IGPC) – Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A).Employment hitThe volume of gold buying has reduced significantly. As a result, employment in the gems and jewellery sector is significantly impacted. Gujarat, which was home to some 1 lakh gold jewellery artisans a year ago, witnessed 40% of them moving to their home towns and refusing to return, say jewellers.“A number of jewellery artisans are changing their profession and moving to alternative means of employment. High price of gold is a deterrent for jewellery purchases, even during wedding as well as festive season. Some 500 jewellery manufacturing units – predominantly involved in job work – in Manek Chowk are now operating at 50% of its actual capacity as there is no work,” said Chinubhai Choksi, president, Manek Chowk Choksi Mahajan.Several gold artisans have now turned to agriculture, turned into fruit and vegetable vendors or began working as labourers at factories and printing presses in absence of jobs.“Because there is no work, we are not able to pay full salary to our artisans. Instead of four people, our unit is now operated by two people only,” said Salim Abbas, a jewellery making unit owner in Manek Chowk.“High gold prices have led to 35% rise in recycling of gold and a decline in cash sales at jewellery showrooms. That apart, workers from the manufacturing centres including Surat, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Rajkot, Bengaluru and Coimbatore are leaving as they do not have enough work due to weak sales.” Anantha Padmanabhan, chairman, All Indian Gems and Jewellery Domestic Council",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/firm-gold-prices-increase-recycling-of-gold-physical-demand-plunges/articleshow/74421593.cms

The synchronised enforcement drive was carried out by the PWD groundwater division after the Madras high court on Thursday directed all district administrations to seal illegal water packaging units in their respective jurisdictions.

The units were extracting groundwater for commercial gains without obtaining the consent of the PWD groundwater division. Over 30 packaged drinking water units function in Trichy, of which 23 illegal units in Lalgudi, Thiruppuraithurai, Thiruverumbur and Trichy city were closed.

Of the total 14 blocks in the district, the central groundwater board has classified four blocks as over-exploited and one block under critical groundwater table category. Though packaged drinking water units are not permitted to operate in the above mentioned categories, PWD officials said that several packaged drinking water units were found operating from such blocks.

“The packaged drinking water units can function only from blocks with safe groundwater table that too after obtaining PWD consent. Borewells in the illegal packaged drinking water units were sealed and the managements were served with notices,” a PWD groundwater division official told TOI.

Seven PWD teams conducted raids and sealed borewells of 51 illegal packaged drinking water units in Trichy, Pudukkottai, Perambalur and Karur districts on Saturday.

The drive is likely to continue for the next two days. Officials said that the report on closure of the illegal drinking water packaging units shall be submitted to the high court. Some of the packaged drinking water units that were closed were operating with lapsed licenses.

In what could gladden the industry experts, the SEZ authorities have scotched rumours that IT units were moving out of AP. “In fact, Telangana has shown the way ahead with some of the ITES units from Bengaluru shifting to Hyderabad,” the authorities said.

Telangana has 33 SEZs, AP has 21 and Chhattisgarh has one SEZ.

VSEZ development commissioner A Ram Mohan Reddy told STOI that they achieved the highest growth rate despite the economic recession. “When compared to Rs 63,924 crore exports in the last financial year, our overall exports of Rs 89,748 crore till February 27 this financial year tells you the story,” he said.

Ram Mohan ruled out any unit from Andhra, Telangana and Chhattisgarh moving out of SEZs. “We do not know about other SEZs. But, there is no migration of units from AP to Telangana. In the last 10 months, we have 86 new units making an entry. They are investing Rs 7,935 crore in the next five years in three states,” he said.

Telangana has 292 units currently. “Hyderabad is adding four units every month. On February 19, approval for 10 units was accorded by VSEZ Hyderabad sub-office,” he said. The units are coming up in private SEZs like Phoenix Infocity Private Ltd, Divija Commercial Properties, BSR Builders, Sundew Properties, Laxmi Infobahn Private Limited and NSL.

431,['1/03/2020'],Waste dumping at corpn’s yard to delay bio-mining,"Trichy: Waste is still being dumped at Trichy City Corporation’s dump yard at Ariyamangalam, where the bio-mining process to reclaim the land is under way. According to people involved in the land reclamation project, this is delaying the bio-mining process. They have urged the civic body to take steps to prevent waste from entering the dump yard to avoid the delay in the reclamation of the land.

The scientific land reclamation process at the 47.70-acre dump yard has been initiated under the smart cities mission at an estimated cost of Rs 49 crore. Segregation and recycling of waste, which accounts to 7-11 lakh cubic metres, is being done using machinery. But, fresh batch of waste from the city is still ferried to the yard, adding to the mounds of waste there. “Every fresh set of waste entering the dump yard is adding to our burden. We have stabilized the garbage mounds and started recycling a portion, but fresh waste dumping continues in other portions,” a source involved in the bio-mining project said. Fresh addition of waste to the existing mounds means that the agency, which has been engaged to undertake the work, will have to spend more time and resources in stabilizing, processing and recycling waste.

Corporation sources acknowledged that new batch of waste is entering the dump yard as they have no other choice. Around 50 MT of waste is being ferried to the yard, sources said. As a solution to prevent this, a proposal to set up an alternative temporary dump site was mooted. However, the civic body seems to be reluctant in implementing the proposal. “We have restricted the quantity of waste entering the dump yard. Further, new decentralized compost centres are planned in the city. Soon, waste dumping in Ariyamangalam yard will be completely stopped,” a corporation official said.

432,['1/03/2020'],Kolkata: Resale property owners have to pay limited tax dues,"Representative image

KOLKATA: Owners of apartments purchased through resale will no longer have to cough up property tax dues that date back several years, and at times, over a decade. Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim on Saturday asked the assessment department to ensure that KMC did not demand dues exceeding one general revision (GR) from new owners, who have either bought a property or had been gifted one.

A GR or general revision of property tax is carried out every six years. Usually, the rate of hike is 10%.

The issue came to light when the mayor received two calls from property owners in the Garia-Patuli belt during the ‘Talk to Mayor’ session on Saturday. Both said they bought apartments on resale and that they were burdened with huge tax dues for no fault of theirs. Hearing them out, Hakim made it known to KMC assessment department team that the civic authority could not demand unreasonable amount of money from a recent owner and fixed the limit of liability to one GR period. “It is your duty to give relief to owners of transferred property,” Hakim told civic staff.

Sources in the KMC assessment department said the new rules would offer relief to buyers of properties on resale but at the same, dent the civic coffers. A senior KMC official said the civic body would automatically switch all new flats to unit area assessment (UAA) method once the owners applied for mutation and instructions would be given to assessor collectors in the borough offices to give relief to buyers of resold properties or gifted properties.

Periyakaandiyamman temple at Veppur, about 13 km away from Manapparai, attracts lakhs of people, mostly from the western districts. During the Tamil month of Masi, the temple celebrates Masi Perunthiruvizha (grand festival), which will be observed for more than 10 days. In the past, to go to the temple in Nallampillai panchayat and park their vehicles, the devotees had to pay fees (minimum Rs 50), which was collected by private agencies or people entrusted by the panchayat body.

The annual festival started on February 21 will continue till March 4 and at least 5 lakh people are expected to visit the temple in the next four days. Based on the grievances received from the public, Trichy district administration has asked the local body and temple management not to collect fee from devotees. District collector S Sivarasu has warned of stern actions against those involved in collecting fee near the temple.

435,['1/03/2020'],Where politicians live without privileges,"BENGALURU: In 2019, India ranked #80 in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), an index that is published annually by Transparency International. The index ranks countries based on their ‘perceived levels of public sector corruption’. Per CPI, the definition of corruption stands for ‘the misuse of public power for private benefit’. In the last five years, India’s ranking has hovered in the 80s. Next, if you just did a cursory search on ‘political corruption in India’, you will be presented, in alphabetical order, with a range of scams that have and continue to shock us regular citizens for the sheer scale of impunity of the political class and bureaucracy that is involved in them. While the money involved can give the strongest amongst us a heartburn, the snail’s pace at which the scams are investigated and solved have only worked to numb us to corruption, we as a country have gotten used to shrug and look the other way. It is just the way it is. “The most infamous corruption scandal in Sweden happened in the ’90s when the then deputy prime minister Mona Sahlin used her official credit card to buy bars of Toblerone and some other personal items. The scandal was so huge that she had to resign and it has since been referred to as the Toblerone Affair,” laughs journalist and writer Claudia Wallin who was in Bengaluru to attend the Times Litfest. Set against India's state of affairs, Wallin’s comment about Sweden and its corruption-free politics sounds a little fantastic. Wallin gets your bewilderment.

As a Brazilian who grew up during a military dictatorship, Wallin is familiar with corrupt governance. “Brazil is violently corrupt and very high on social inequalities as well. And because I grew up during a military dictatorship, I didn’t know what democracywas for a long time,” she says. So when Wallin landed in Stockholm sometime in the 2000s after marrying her Swedish husband – “I am what they call a love refugee” she jokes – she found herself in a strange country.

“My first shock happened in a supermarket in Stockholm because I was there doing my shopping when I suddenly saw former Swedish PM Carl Bildt there pushing his own shopping trolley and choosing his own vegetables! He was the minister of foreign relations at the time, and for a Brazilian like me that was nearly like an extra-terrestrial experience because in Brazil, politicians don’t buy their own vegetables. They have servants and private assistants to do that,” Wallin jokes. “After that, I saw the speaker of the Swedish parliament–the highest political office in the country, even higher than the PM–in a subway train. I discovered that he went to work by train. Another time, I saw the mayor of Stockholm waiting in line at a bus stop with grocery bags in hand, just like any other regular citizen. All these incidents made me wonder what this was about,” Wallin recalls. That curiosity eventually led Wallin to write a book about Sweden’s politicians. Called Sweden: The Untold Story the book, first published in the Brazilian language in 2014, became a bestseller. Translated into English in 2019, Wallin has since then been travelling the world to spread the word about Sweden’s political system. “It is important for people to know that there is another way of doing politics. Sweden can become an inspiration to so many countries,” she says.

For cynics, Wallin may seem like an enamoured outsider but Sweden’s uncorrupt governance is the reason why the country ranked #4 on the CPI in 2019. Prod Wallin to share more details of the ‘normal’ lives Swedish politicians lead and the former BBC journalist says, “In Sweden, politicians including MPs go to work by bus, they live in state apartments as small as 16 square meters, they work in parliamentary offices which are as tiny as seven square meters, they even wash their clothes in shared laundry facilities. Even inside the Swedish parliament (the Riksdag), there is a laundry facility where they wash their own clothes because Sweden is a society that does not offer luxury or privileges to its politicians. At all.” The only privilege Swedish politicians have is a card that allows them to use public transport, she adds.

In Brazil, Wallin says that her book and TV specials she has done on the subject have inspired youngsters to demand for change. “What I wanted to show was that if Sweden can do it, we can too. Today, people are realizing that if they want to change the system, they have to enter politics themselves or be more active in terms of citizen participation and demand their MPs to do more. The Swedish model of politics is achievable, but we all need to work together to make it happen,” Wallin says.

436,['1/03/2020'],Anandwan to create gene pool of 1 million native forest trees,"Nagpur: Philanthropist Baba Amte’s Anandwan in Warora will create a gene pool of 1 million rare endangered native forest trees of 200 species.

Dr Sheetal Amte-Karajgi, social entrepreneur and CEO of Maharogi Sewa Samiti (MSS), Anandwan, said that less than 1% native forest tree species are remaining. “So, even in case of they get extinct, we will be able to restore them,” she said.

In view of the United Nations General Assembly declaring 2020 as International Year of Plant Health (IYPH), Anandwan is geared up to expedite the project.

Amte said, “Of these 1 million trees, 5 lakh will be created at our project at Somnath in Mul, while another 5 lakh through distribution by tying up with various universities, educational institutes and National Service Scheme (NSS) volunteers.”

The MSS has been organizing national-level youth camps at Somnath (Chandrapur) since last 52 years to inculcate values of national integration, peace, harmony and voluntary labour. Over 40,000 youth have drawn inspiration from it.

“We are thinking of redesigning the camp and coming out with a model where an army of youth can create long-term sustainable impact for mother earth with a single vision. We will train youth by holding year-long camps for this constructive work. Registration will start from March 10,” said Amte.

In the last 10 months, the project was implemented at Anandwan by planting 43,000 trees of 85 species from southern tropical dry deciduous forest region. At least 18,000 have been done under Miyawaki model of dense forest plantations.

On one of the small plots in Anandwan, 420 trees were planted on February 25 last year. This patch has turned into a dense forest in a year. 45 of the trees are native ones. Amte and her staff celebrated first birthday of these plantations on February 25.

Akira Miyawaki is a Japanese botanist and expert in plant ecology. In a bid to boost 33 crore plantations in 2019, the then BJP government, under the ‘Green Maharashtra Mission’, had launched Anandwan model in MIDC and civil corporations.

The social entrepreneur said, “In conventional forestry, you cannot plant more than 400 trees in 1 acre of land, but 12,000 trees can be grown under Miyawaki. The expenditure per sapling for three years was Rs242.”

Dr Amte said there are many advantages of these multilayered Miyawaki plantations. There is no soil erosion and groundwater recharge is good. These plantations act as good carbon sinks and reduce temperatures. This technology gives 10 times faster growth, 30 times density, and trees are 100 times biodiverse.

The Samiti will plant over 5 lakh trees by 2025 and remaining in the next five years. These 200 tree species are going extinct due to forest fires and indiscriminate felling for various development works.

Native trees play an important part as they are the spine of food chain in the forest. These trees create food, fertilizer, fodder and fresh air, besides cleansing the water streams and revitalizing soil.

As native tree species have dwindled in core areas of forests, it has disturbed the food chain, thus causing man-animal conflict. Wild animals are coming to human habitat in search of food resulting in conflict.

“Our team aims to create micro forests from 1,200 trees to mega forests of 5 lakh trees and conserve them. Attempt is to bring back food chain to barren lands,” Amte said and added, “A leopard recently visited our 7-month-old forest besides blue bulls, porcupines and several bird species.”

The mother plants at Anandwan will act as a bank of genetic material so that even if these trees go extinct from forests, they would have the genetic material in the form of trees and seeds to bring those species back.

437,['1/03/2020'],"Giant croc captured from canal, released into Kollidam river","Trichy: A 10-foot long crocodile , which has triggered panic along the banks of Uyyakondan canal for a few days, was finally captured by the fire and rescue department officials here on Saturday. The scaly reptile was later released into the Kollidam river at Grand Anaicut.

The crocodile reportedly crawled to the banks of the canal near the shrubs at Thirumalai Kallangadu, near Kuzhumayi Amman Temple after the water Cauvery, Uyyakondan, receded. Sources said that the residents had noticed the crocodile in the shrubs a few days ago and were scary of venturing into the canal.

Visiting the banks on Saturday morning, a few devotees saw the hulking creature and alerted the rescue service officials in Cantonment. A team headed by station officer Melchiah Raj arrived at the scene and launched a hunt. The team captured the crocodile after in two hours.

Following the capture, the forest department officials reached the spot and took possession of the reptile. The forest department later released it into the Kollidam River at Grand Anaicut.

Hundreds of devotees converge at Kuzumayi Amman Temple as the annual festival is nearing.

“Had the reptile was not captured, it might have scared the devotees gathering around the temple on the banks of Uyyanodan canal,” residents said.

Fire service station officer Melchiah Raj warned the public that chances of crocodiles crawling out of rivers or canals is high as there is no flow in waterbodies. He asked them to be cautious.

438,['1/03/2020'],CM for jt inspection of Mhadei project to expose Karnataka,"Panaji: Two days before the Supreme Court hears the state’s application seeking relief in the Mhadei water dispute on March 2, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Saturday said that Goa would push for joint inspection of the Kalasa-Bhandura project to expose illegalities committed by Karnataka. He also said that the government would seek a stay so that Karnataka can’t start work on the project.

Sawant said that he would seek a direction from the apex court to Karnataka that it should not approach any authorities for permission till the matter is heard in court. He also said that we would appeal to the court to stop the diversion of water, which is being done “illegally” by Karnataka.

The state government wants a joint inspection of the Kalasa-Bhandura site, and that it should be headed by the chief engineer of the central water commission or assessor of the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal, Sawant told reporters.

On Tuesday, the state government filed an application before the Supreme Court seeking interim relief to restrain Karnataka from carrying out construction or any other activity on the Mhadei. The chief minister’s office said after senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi pleaded before the bench presided by justice D Y Chandrachud for an urgent hearing, the court posted the matter for March 2.

Sawant also said that the state government is opposing the transfer of 3.9 tmc water from the Mhadei basin to the Malaprabha basin as per the award of the tribunal. “We oppose this because one cannot allow the transfer of water from one basin to another,” Sawant said. He also said that under the garb of water for drinking, they want to use it for irrigation. “Hence, we are opposed to it,” he said.

Sawant said that the state of Goa would challenge the finding of the tribunal that there is 188 tmc yield in the Mhadei basin. He said that as per the state government, the yield of the Mhadei basin is around 113.5 tmc.

In August 2018, the three-decade-old dispute between three states — Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Goa — over sharing of the Mhadei waters ended with the tribunal rejecting Karnataka’s demand for 36.5 tmc, and allotted it only 13.4 tmc, including 3.9 tmc for drinking purposes through diversions, against its demand for 7.5 tmc.

Sawant said that as per Mhadei tribunal interim order dated April 17, 2014, Karnataka cannot divert water till the revised detailed project report is prepared, as well as wildlife and forest clearances are issued.

Dempo won a record five national league titles before opting out of the top-tier. They were protesting the roadmap from All India Football Federation (AIFF) that proposed to make Indian Super League (ISL) the top league and reduced I-League to second tier. Salgaocar FC and Sporting Clube de Goa also withdrew in 2016.

Now, Dempo could take another shot at the top-tier – through I-League – with help from their academy graduates.

“Our eventual pathway is we want to become a factory of players. We want every single ISL and I-League club to come and tell us that they want our players. The same set of team, they have to be capable enough to go through the competitive league system and at least through the I-League, we can see whether we can come and play,” club chairman Shrinivas Dempo told TOI on Saturday, while felicitating their junior squads, all of whom have topped in Goa and made it to the national leagues.

When at its peak, Dempo had the highest budget with a reported Rs 15 crore being spent in 2012, the year they won their last I-League title.

“Today, low budget teams have done well. You no longer have to spend Rs 15 crore which Dempo spent 10 years ago. Things are changing. There’s hope for us,” said Dempo.

Since opting out, Dempo has chosen to invest in the academy at Ella in Old Goa, a decision that is now starting to bear fruits. Since October 2019, Dempo have won 44 of the 46 matches, kept 33 clean sheets and averaged four goals a game.

“Our journey has just begun. I would have been disappointed if success wasn’t there. What’s the point of having a team for three years, detailed planning if you cannot get results (at the state level). The challenge is now to do well in AIFF leagues,” said Dempo.

TRICHY: An interdepartmental raid conducted for the past two days has led to the rescue of nine child labourers in Trichy.

Initiated by the Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) project, a team comprising sub-judge R Nandhini, secretary of district legal services authority (DLSA), volunteers of One Stop Crisis team, Child Labour Elimination and Effective Rehabilitation Society (CHEERS), labour department, Child Line, anti-child trafficking unit (ACTU) and District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) carried out a massive raid on shops at the central bus stand, Chathiram bus stand, Teppakulam and Somarasampettai area on Friday.

The raid brought to light employment of children below 14 years and adolescent child labourers under 18 working in mechanic shops, tea shops, bakeries and grocery shops in the areas. The rescued children include a girl who was working in a book shop. Almost all of them were school dropouts. The children said poverty has pushed their parents to send their kids for jobs. Project manager of CHEERS, Trichy, S Gowthaman was also part of the rescue team. He said that the team reprimanded the employers for employing the children and warned of legal action against them. “They are paid a paltry daily wage of Rs 100 to 150 for which they have to toil for nearly 12 hours at the workplace. The situation is worse in some places in the rural areas,” said Gowthaman.

Acting on the information from the labour department, a 14-year-old boy was rescued from a two-wheeler mechanic shop by the ACTU police in Thuraiyur in Trichy on Saturday. The children were produced before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), which ordered to keep them in government reception homes until further orders.

AHMEDABAD: The central government’s action at a belated stage against financiers in the Rs 1,300-crore gold smuggling racket at the Ahmedabad international airport has been nixed by the courts, which found no nexus between financing the alleged illegal activity and the present detention orders.

On Thursday, Jitendra Rokad was released from the Sabarmati Central Jail after the Gujarat high court quashed a detention order passed by the customs department under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (COFEPOSA).

The order to detain Rokad was passed on August 2, 2019 after the Customs authority came to know about his financing the smuggling activity in 2014-15. He along with others were accused of financing Rutugna Trivedi — the alleged kingpin of the gold smuggling racket with as much as 4,242kg gold being smuggled between 2014 and 2019 — Rs 52.35 crore to get 185kg gold smuggled into India between January 2014 and July 2015.

Similarly, a detention order was passed against Mehul Bhimani for financing Trivedi during 2014-15. One Pramodgiri Goswami too was detained by the agency for allegedly financing Trivedi Rs 204 crore to bring in 731.7kg gold without duty in India through Ahmedabad airport.

All three persons had challenged their detention orders before different courts. Goswami had moved the Supreme Court, which quashed his detention order on January 27. The SC order was placed in his submissions by Bhimani in proceedings before the Delhi high court, which quashed on February 25 the detention order passed against him.

Rokad had challenged his detention before the Gujarat HC and placed the orders passed by the apex court and Delhi HC relieving the co-accused in the smuggling racket.

Justice S H Vora said that the court noticed that there is “no nexus or live link between alleged illegal activity and purported claim of detaining authority, as the activity had been committed between January 2014 and July 2015 while the detention order was passed in August 2019”.

The high court also said that the authority could not give reasonable explanation for the delay in taking action against Rokad and no offence was registered against him either by the customs or central department about “prejudicial activities”.

444,['1/03/2020'],"From the darkened halls, a peep into global culture","BENGALURU: If you’re among those watching the Andrei Tarkovsky retrospective at the on-going film festival in Bengaluru, you surely wouldn’t have had to scrounge for information about the Russian film director and theorist before walking into the movie hall. There are numerous online blogs, analytical notes, documentaries and scholarly video lectures, apart from DVD collections of his cinema for further viewing.

It wasn’t so in the decades before this millennium; nothing came off the shelf or at a click of a button. Why, even a film festival in the city wasn’t regular. Before the 35th edition of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) became competitive and pitched tent in Goa in 2004, Bengaluru hosted the event only twice: the Filmotsav in 1980 and the IFFI in 1992.

Both those events were widely celebrated by the media, students of cinema and professionals. Viewers lapped up special coverage in the papers, stood in queues for season tickets and strode in and out of theatres in Majestic –then, with about 20-plus movie halls in the vicinity and seen as an ideal location for a film festival. Critics not too familiar with world cinema, had begun to contact film societies for material on trends and seek old copies of “Sight and Sound”. First-hand experience meant taking down notes in the darkened halls – perhaps of Miklos Jancso’s expansive use of open fields and trademark long-takes.

They had to change the structure and language of their reviews too. All year long, they had been used to writing about popular cinema in a set format: opening lines that set the mood followed by a summary of the plot invariably beginning with “The film revolves around…” and a concluding paragraph that judged the performances of the cast and the cinematographer with one or two adjectives for each. Assessment of quality cinema needed a more rigorous approach – of not only understanding the socio-cultural and political context of the theme, but also unique narrative styles and technique. Why does Robert Bresson “flatten” his images? Or why does Chantal Akerman use the kitchen as central space in her films?

And even if it didn’t interest most readers, there was a mandatory article on the market. Looking at the film bazaar in 1992, one report said there was hardly any buzz “as far as imports were concerned owing to certain curbs and censorship code, but organisers believed enquiries for exports were encouraging”.

The coverage ended with comments that art cinema was still in the grip of “neo-Rayalism”, with no sincere attempt to break the mould. At least a dozen films in the Indian Panorama package were set in the countryside. As a cinematographer put it, “The village has become an ideal setting for projecting universal values, even if simplistic. Can you recollect how many calendar shots of sunrise and sunset you have seen, or how often you have heard the suprabhatam on the soundtrack in the morning sequences of Indian art cinema?” There were exceptions that year, though, and pick of the Panorama included Satyajit Ray’s “Agantuk”, G Aravindan’s “Vastuhara”, Mrinal Sen’s “Mahaprathibhi”, MT Vasudevan Nair’s “Kadavu” , Jahnu Barua’s “Firingoti” and TS Nagabharana’s “Mysuru Mallige”.

Many festivals in India have left us with a tinge of displeasure about the absence of big names and the best cinema. If there was a memorable one, it was in Delhi in 1977, attended by maestros Satyajit Ray, Michaelangelo Antonioni and Akira Kurosawa. A photograph of their visit to the Taj Mahal was splashed across newspapers and magazines. BIFFes (Bengaluru International Film Festival), now in its 11th edition, is grappling with the task of establishing its own identity.

Finally, it’s all about access to films and avenues for film appreciation. The city wasn’t short of independent film clubs, among them the most active were Bangalore film society and Suchitra. They brought out newsletters and journals, apart from hosting their own festivals. One club, Manthan, had a distinctive process of understanding a film. I remember attending a screening of Ingmar Bergman’s “Wild Strawberries” sometime in the early 1980s on a Saturday. Soon after the movie, we were given some notes to read for a second screening that happened the next morning. On the second day, finer points – specific shots and sequences – were discussed threadbare, after halting the projection for a veritable “rewind” of the reels. At a time when film was still physical and the digital evolution was nowhere on the horizon, this took some doing.

Over the years, the experience hasn’t changed drastically, though. Cinephiles continue to search for newer works of true art. They spend hours for the living experience, for that matchless joy of watching directors sculpt a “lump of time”. When the lights fade out, they would have grasped a bit of Tarkovsky. And agree with him that the power of cinema hasn’t to do only with stars, story-lines and entertainment.

445,['1/03/2020'],Farmers urge CM to expedite work on Kollidam barrage,"Thanjavur: Farmers from Nagapattinam and Cuddalore have appealed to chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami to take steps to speed up the work on a barrage across the Kollidam. The farmers also urged the chief minister visit the worksite during his scheduled visit to Tiruvarur to participate in a felicitation function organized for him by farmers.

Based on the announcement made by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa in the assembly, Rs 428 crore was allocated by the government in November, 2018 for constructing a barrage across the Kollidam with head sluices on the downstream of the Lower Anaicut connecting Kumaramangalam village in Nagapattinam district and Adhanur village in Cuddalore district.

The chief minister laid the foundation stone for the barrage in February 2019, to minimize surplus flow of water in the river and for creating additional infrastructure to control excess flow in the Cauvery and Kollidam during monsoons. The barrage will be built at 1,300 meter length and three meter height. The state government has allotted Rs 23 lakh to conduct a study and prepare a project report. Now the work has been going on at a snail’s pace, farmers said.

The secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, Swamimalai S Vimalnathan, said that construction of a barrage was a long pending demand by the farmers to save water. “The work, going on at a snail’s pace, has to be expedited. The chief minister had inspected Mukkombu barrage and reviewed the work. He should also come and visit the sites, when he visits Tiruvarur on March 7,” he said.

Trichy city witnessed protests at eight places since morning with people crossing the Palakkarai area having a tough time as the protesters camped on the Palakkarai road. The group staged its protest under a large shamiana forcing the city police to divert traffic through sub-jail road and other roads. However, traffic moved at a snail’s pace for many hours. A pandhal also came up outside Jamal Mohammed College (JMC) with members of the Muslim community blocking one side of the road as they sat in protest.

Protests were organized at Edamalaipatti Pudhur, airport, Ariyamangalam, Singarathoppu, Palakkarai and Woraiyur. Police said the protesters numbered about 3,000 in the city. Meanwhile, the ongoing protest at Uzhavar Sandhai grounds in Thennur for the past two weeks continued. Wearing masks of leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Subash Chandra Bose and E V R Periyar, the protesters tore a sheet of paper intended to be a copy of the CAA to register their protest against the central government.

Trichy rural witnessed protests at five places whereas Pudukottai, Karur, Perambalur, Ariyalur, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagappattinam districts saw protests at 69 places. Police have been deployed at all the places to keep a watch on the protests and ensure law and order in the area. The protesters, except in Thennur Uzhavar Sandhai grounds, dispersed in the evening.

To avoid suspicion, the accused made a distress call to the police, feeding them a fake narrative of been robbed by dacoits, who also allegedly killed his wife.

The apprehended accused was identified as Netrapal Singh, 30, of Parmal village under Kagraul police jurisdiction. He was married to Rakhi (28) since 2011. The duo had three children. The victim hailed from Sahrai village of Bharatpur district.

SP, rural west, Ravi Kumar said, “Prima facie it looks to be a pre-planned murder . After returning from a wedding ceremony, around 9.30pm, the accused whipped out his country-made pistol and shot his wife. In order to avoid police suspicion, the accused shared a false narrative, that group of dacoits attacked the couple and took away Rs 1.25 lakh and shot the woman.”

“His lie was caught, after he was confronted by his children, who told police a totally different story,” said SP.

SP added, “Later during interrogation, the accused broke down and claimed, that he was having an affair with another woman and wanted to marry her. His wife Rakhi came to know about his affair and reprimanded him. Infuriated over Rakhi, the accused shot her dead.”

451,['1/03/2020'],77 people complete 28-day quarantine for coronavirus,"Jaipur: As many as 77 people who returned from China, the epicentre of novel coronavirus outbreak, have completed the 28-day tenure of isolation on Saturday.

They were worried when they reached Jaipur a few weeks ago. Since they have now completed 28 days of surveillance, they have heaved a sigh of relief.

Varun (name changed) told STOI that they returned from China on January 13. They were the first who were kept in isolation. “We were asked to remain at home (home quarantine) for at least 28 days. I was kept in the isolation ward at Sawai Man Singh hospital for six days. They took my samples twice and both times, I was tested negative for nCoV. My 28-day ordeal has ended now,” he said. However, 261 people are still under surveillance. According to the health department figures, till date, a total 73 suspected patients had been admitted in isolation since the scare of nCoV gripped the state in mid-January. The health department has conducted 100 tests of nCoV, all of them tested negative, a health department official said.

WHO has declared the recent nCoV epidemic as public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). In India, so far only three confirmed cases of nCoV have been reported, all from Kerala.

Keeping a close eye on nCoV, the health department is conducting nCoV screening at Sanganer airport, Jaipur. They are conducting screening of all passengers arriving from the eight international flights daily since January 28, 2020. For the purpose, five doctors and five paramedical staff have been deputed at the airport. Passengers are screened using non-contact thermal scanner. “Till today, 22,437 passengers of 152 flights have been screened,” said the official.

The official said those who have travelled recently from the corona-affected countries must inform the national/state/district helpline number and remain under strict home isolation for 28 days from the date of arrival in India, irrespective of whether they are symptomatic or asymptomatic. Those who have travelled Wuhan-China since January 15, 2020 onwards must get themselves tested for nCoV at the government-designated centres.

452,['1/03/2020'],Woman protests with ailing hubby before registrar office,"Karur: A woman staged a protest with her husband on a stretcher in front of the registrar office in Karur after she was denied transfer of property from her husband to her. As the man was bedridden due to a nervous problem, the woman wanted to sell their property to remit fees for her daughter’s final year BDS course.

R Manjula, 52, a native of Vanjiyamman Temple street, is working as staff nurse at a government hospital in Karur. Her husband K V Rajaram, 60, was running an automobile spare parts shop. He became bed-ridden and could not even speak after being diagnosed with motor neuron disease (MND) four years ago, sources said. Manjula had spent several lakhs of rupees for her husband’s treatment at various hospitals. Meanwhile, their only daughter who is now in her final year of BDS at Puducherry had to remit Rs 7 lakh as fee.

“Only one in a lakh people get affected by this neural disease. Despite spending lakhs of rupees at hospitals across the country, he was not cured”, she told TOI. With their money drying up, they decided to sell two plots of land in Rajaram’s name. “I explained our situation to the sub-registrar of Mela Karur, BalaSenthil Murugan, and appealed to him to help change the property’s ownership to my name so as to sell it easily. He too promised to help us. We went to the sub-registrar office in an ambulance and took my husband on a stretcher to his room. The sub registrar did whatever procedure was required to be fulfilled. However, when he asked my husband to say his name and also asked a few questions, he could not speak and started to cry. Suddenly, the sub-registrar went out without completing the procedure and also without telling us anything”, she said.

Confused by his act, Manjula staged a dharna in front of the office demanding the name change. Soon, Karur town police arrived there, pacified her and got a complaint from her to take further action. Manjula also sought help from the district legal services authority to settle the issue. When contacted by TOI, sub-registrar Balasenthil Murugan refused to divulge anything in tune with the government rule. “I have no option but to seek the help of legal authorities. I hope I will get legal aid for my problem”, Manjula added.

454,['1/03/2020'],CU researchers decode stickiness of mussels,"Kozhikode: Researchers from Calicut University have uncovered physico-chemical and structural properties that make marine mussels stick onto underwater rocks withstanding constant pounding of waves and extreme under water conditions.

Dr Y Shibu Vardhanan, associate professor of the department of zoology, along with researcher Anand P P at the department have completed the physio-chemical structural and functional characterisation of mussel foot proteins (Mfps) responsible for the moisture-resistant biological glue which helps mussels cling to under water surfaces.

They have also revealed the specific physio-chemical structural and functional characters of each of the 78 Mfps belonging to nine mussel species which are available in the protein bank of National Centre for Biotechnology Information, USA. The study holds potential for developing super-strong water-resistant synthetic bio-mimetic adhesives in the future. While most conventional engineered polymer-based adhesives cannot be applied onto wet environments, marine mussels have mastered the ability to anchor to foreign surfaces under the seawater. The foot of mussels contains glands which release glue-like materials known as byssus thread made up of an array of proteins. The byssus threads cure rapidly to form adhesive plaques with high interfacial binding strength, durability, and toughness. They are engineered to withstand elevated mechanical loads applied by waves and currents.

The moisture-resistant adhesive property of Mfps has inspired development of a wide variety of functional materials. Understanding the specific physio-chemical and functional property of each Mfps is vital for designing mussel-mimetic adhesive materials. The 3,4 dihydroxy phenylalanine (DOPA) is the main constituent in mussel foot proteins which can form various types of chemical interactions and cross linking which imparts foot proteins the ability to solidify in situ and bind tightly to various types of surfaces.

Vardhanan said that the remarkable wet-adhesive properties of these proteins have potential in a range of biomedical applications including developing super-strong synthetic bio-mimetic adhesives, which can be used for biomedical purposes like post-surgery wound closing adhesives.

A major industrial application of mussel protein is for the preparation of anti-fouling surfaces, especially for ships. The work has been published in international journal ‘Nature – Scientific Report, Springer Nature Ltd’. They are also invited as speakers at International Conference on Material Science and Nanotechnology to be held at Osaka in Japan in 2021.

455,['1/03/2020'],"SUV hits woman, then runs her over in Kolkata","The spot at Kalighat, where the accident took place

KOLKATA: A 44-year-old schoolteacher died when an SUV dashed into her at a breakneck speed and flung her into the air. As she landed on the bonnet, the driver took a sharp turn, throwing her to the ground and then, ran her over while speeding away. Police have got the vehicle’s registration number but are yet to track down the driver.

The incident took place early on Saturday at Kalighat , barely 50m from the victim’s home.

Subhalaxmi Banerjee, a resident of Syama Prasad Mukherjee Road who taught English at Arya Kanya Vidyalay in central Kolkata, had gone out around 6 in the morning to buy flowers for puja at home. After buying flowers from shops near the Kalighat temple, she was on her way back home, when she stopped at a traffic signal, waiting for the light to turn red so that she could walk across the road. When she reached the middle of the road, the SUV reportedly sped at her and hit her before she could react. The impact was such that Subhalaxmi was flung in the air and she fell on the bonnet of the same vehicle. In his attempt to flee the spot and apparently to shake her off, the driver took a sharp turn towards right, and Subhalaxmi flee on to the road. The fleeing driver did not stop but reportedly ran her over as he sped away.

As the SUV driver sped towards Rashbehari Avenue, he tried to jump a signal, rammed into a car waiting at the signal and nearly hit a traffic cop who tried to flag him down.

Cops on the road imm-ediately took Subhalaxmi first to M R Bangur Hospital and then, to SSKM Hospital, where she was declared brought dead.

“I was selling tea at my stall. I had seen the woman about to cross the road. Suddenly, the vehicle appeared from nowhere and dashed into her. Before we could react, the vehicle took a turn and again ran her over and left at an equally high speed. But I managed to note down the SUV’s registration number,” said Pratap Pailan, owner of a nearby tea stall.

It was the Banerjees’ domestic help, who first learnt about the death, when she went out looking for Subhalaxmi. “Boudi always offered puja before leaving for her school. Like every day, she had gone to buy flowers. Worried that she was taking way too long to return, I went out, looking for her. The flowersellers in front of the Kali temple know us and they said she left long ago. When I was asking some shop owners on the opposite pavement, a traffic police approached me and showed me her photograph. Her head was completely smashed,” said Bratabala Biswas, the help.

Subhalaxmi’s husband, Mrinal Banerjee, is a wildlife photographer and was in Siliguri when the incident took place. After his family informed him of the tragedy, he managed to buy a flight ticket and reached Kolkata by afternoon. “Our house is nearly a century old and we have a temple inside. A special puja is offered on Tuesdays and Saturdays and she went out to buy flowers for that,” was all that he could manage to say.

“We have checked the CCTV footage and got the number of the vehicle. We are trying to track it down,” said an officer at Lalbazar.

Though Subhalaxmi started walking across the road only when the traffic light had turned red, residents of the area said the non-functional timer at the signal leads to uncertainty among pedestrians as they are never sure when the traffic light will again turn green and till when it is safe to cross the road.

456,['1/03/2020'],100 Anganwadis in Gadchiroli to be developed on lines of urban play schools,"A Mumbai-based NGO is likely to be roped in for training the Anganwadi teachers, volunteers and other support ... Read More

Nagpur: Gadchiroli administration has decided to develop 100 Anganwadis in two blocks of the tribal district, on the lines of play schools in the cities with a budget allocation of around Rs30 lakh.

A Mumbai-based NGO, already engaged in similar projects in Jharkhand and elsewhere, is likely to be roped in for training the Anganwadi teachers, volunteers and other support staffers.

The Anganwadis, which had been so far catering to only nutritional aspect, will now be elevated a notch higher with the attendants and teachers also imparting basic elementary education to the students emulating a similar kind of practices in the pre and play schools in the urban centres. The decision was taken by the district administration to improve the standard of primary education and help students prepare better at the pre-entry level.

With Maoist-related problems, education had been one of the most adversely affected sectors with high absenteeism of teachers in schools and anganwadis in the backdrop of uncertainty and insecurity.

District collector Deepak Singla, who is planning to implement the project, said the anganwadis with maximum attendance have been earmarked in the first phase. “The idea is to impart and empower the students at the pre-school level with motor and cognitive skills like basic counting, identifying colours, some reading skills, learning alphabets, names of animals and so on,” Singla said.

“Right now, the anganwadis just ensure that the mid-day meal is properly served and try to shrug off the rest of their responsibilities at that point. We are now aiming to ensure that the anganwadis go beyond just providing the mid-day meal and teach some basic skills to the students too,” he said.

Singla said the students face hardship in the first couple of years in the schools after walking out of the anganwadis as they are not learning much at this stage in today’s scenario.

Singla said the trainings would include the aspects of using the materials available at the spots, like stones, sticks and such things, as tools for learning. “The cost of training per student is around Rs1,000 per annum, which is negligible. We are trying to arrange the funds from certain channels, or else shall use the budget allocated for the district under various heads,” he said.

457,['1/03/2020'],"Mulberries, cherries, and chillies for some zing, their summer wine is made from all these things","BENGALURU: The Kodava people are known for their love for nature and its products. One member proudly said that they can make a fine wine out of anything and everything. The community in Bengaluru is also a witnessing a wine-making renaissance and new inventions of wine crop up time and again here, with recipes shared by word-of-mouth.But the wine making in Kodava culture isn’t something that was passed on from generations. “This wine creating frenzy is relatively new among us. I don’t remember my grandmother making any wine at home,” says Ponnamma Barianda, a microbiologist who hails from Murnad in Coorg.According to this Victoria Layout resident, the wine making and serving didn’t really exist among the community this the 90s. “In functions or family get-togethers, men used to be served hard alcohol and women used to stick to fruit juices. But it gradually changed from the late 90s when women started to enjoy some wine in gatherings. Then slowly some ladies started to make their own and serve it in events much to the appreciation of those attending,” Barianda recalls.A healthy contestWhat was just traditional grape-based wines gradually started to evolve into wines fermented out of pineapple, gooseberries, mulberries, starfruit, cherry and even the betel leaf and rose petals. The women of Kodava community in Bengaluru began to experiment in their kitchens and came out with new and unique varieties of wines. Soon, people from outside the community started showing interest. Kodava women started competing with their wine-making skills in meetings and the commercial value of these drinks started to mount.Anitha Ben Kariappa had to quit her marketing job involving real estate to concentrate on a restaurant business. It also allows her to indulge in her favourite hobby, wine making. On any given day her kitchen in Indiranagar has a dozen unique wines she had made over the years. He oldest bottle is seven years and interestingly, its base is the red rose petal. “I like to experiment with new flavours and ingredients. Our community comprises of people who are nature-lovers and we cherish what it has to offer to us. Therefore, making wines from local ingredients is where some Kodava women are excelling,” proudly adds Kariappa as she shows her bottle of rose petal wine.Right now, she has a set of nine wines she has fermented including flavours like mint, betel leaf, grape, passionfruit, ginger and chilly. Her son’s wedding in November turned a platform to showcase her wine-making skills as she served a variety of flavours much to the delight of the attendees.Kariappa doesn’t plan to market or sell her wines but is keen on serving it to her family and friends who can appreciate her skill and of course give feedback be it positive or negative.No expiry date, commercial value“A real Kodagu wine and honey doesn’t have an expiry date,” says Ponnachanna Madhu, a winemaker and dealer from Madikeri who acquired his mother’s skills in making using local flavours for wine, namely hibiscus, jackfruit, jamun and even the honey. Madhu asserts there are 32 varieties of wines which can be called Kodagu’s own and they are best in the country in terms of natural ingredients and traditional fermenting procedures.“Today what was made in homes started to attract tremendous commercial attention. Some wine makers from Kodagu have made it big for their unique flavour. People personally preserve wines at home that are decades-old and serve it with pride. But the wine boom among tourists began from early 2012 and has been a rage ever since,” adds Madhu. Interestingly, the wine trade has boosted the prices not just of the drink but also the bottles it comes in. Few years ago an empty bottle for packaging cost Rs 2, but today it is Rs 12.According to Anil HT, tourism promoter and businessman from Madikeri, there are over 32 varieties of pure Kodagu wine, with and without alcohol and are unique in flavour and taste which the Karnataka state can be proud of. “Unfortunately, fakes have been pumped into the market with fraudsters sensing the demand,” Anil adds.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/mulberries-cherries-and-chillies-for-some-zing-their-summer-wine-is-made-from-all-these-things/articleshow/74418563.cms
458,['1/03/2020'],"Drive launched for saving kids from HIV, syphilis","Jaipur: Aiming to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis, Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) along with social organisations have launched a statewide campaign to sensitise private hospitals for scaling up of screening of pregnant women for HIV.

It is estimated that 23% of babies are born in private hospitals in the state. For the purpose of sensitising private hospitals on HIV screening among pregnant women, RSACS, Federation of Obstetric and gynaecological society of India, Rajasthan and NGO SAATHII organised a state level training of trainers for the elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV and syphilis.

“At present there is coverage gap of almost 32% from estimated pregnant women in private sector. The private health facilities who provide services to pregnant women are requested to engage with government under public private partnership and support in the elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV and Syphilis by 2020,” said Dr Anju Soni, chairperson, FOGSI.

For eliminating mother to child transmission of HIV, it is required that all pregnant women should be screened for HIV and Syphilis preferably in the first trimester, once detected reactive, they should be linked to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) for confirmation of HIV. Those tested positive for HIV are linked to Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) services.

“There are 33% chances of transmission of HIV from infected mother to her baby at the time of the birth. But, the chances are reduced to 2%, if the woman gets ART on time. ART helps in preventing the vertical transmission of HIV from mother to new-born,” said RSACS official.

Also, HIV testing data from all private hospitals should be reported to HIVPULSE portal.

“At present there is coverage gap of almost 32% from estimated pregnant women in private sector. The private health facilities who provide services to pregnant women are requested to engage with government under public private partnership and support in the elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV and Syphilis by 2020,” said Dr Soni.

E-challans will now be implemented in the entire state. A total of 1,200 machines have been provided to the traffic department for this purpose.

In the presence of the CM, an MoU was signed between the traffic directorate and the State Bank of India for the E-challan service. The documents were signed by director of traffic Kewal Khurana and SBI DGM B L Saini. On the occasion, Rawat also flagged off interceptors for all districts of the state.

The e-challan will also reveal how many times an offender has been challaned before. A driver's licence can be revoked if its holder is challanned thrice.

Speaking at the event, the CM said, “It is everyone's responsibility to follow the rules of traffic. Continuous awareness programs are necessary for road safety. The number of accidents has come down in the last one year due to strict police action against traffic violators.”

“The purpose of police is not to cut challans but to protect people’s lives. Action should be taken against those who violate the rules. Challans and punishments can be helpful in following the rules but discipline is the only way to avoid accidents,” Rawat added.

The state government has sanctioned 20 new vehicles to the police for traffic arrangements in Dehradun. DGP Anil Kumar Raturi said that “it is the responsibility of the police to ensure public safety and they have to deal with difficult situations and challenges with discipline.”

460,['1/03/2020'],Govt to file offences against 70 insts named by SIT in scholarship scam,"Nagpur: The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) would be registering offences in the multi-crore scholarship scam against 70 educational institutions named by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) after the probe by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is completed.

Relief and Rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar, who informed this to media recently, said that the SIT report would be tabled in the cabinet to decide future course of action.

The ED probe was set up by previous state government led by then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. According to officers who were part of SIT, the previous BJP government failed to initiate any action despite assurances by the former CM.

The SIT had confirmed the scam, which was exposed by TOI in 2013, after inspecting audit reports of just around 14% — about 1,704 — of state’s colleges availing scholarships. Based on this, it had arrived at misappropriation of Rs2,174 crore in scholarship distribution in these colleges. TOI had first published the SIT report on August 20, 2017.

About 24 offences were lodged against colleges, including two from Nagpur, and students before formation of the SIT on January 15, 2016.

The SIT strongly recommended probe by Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). The panel adopted the audit method and was able to inspect only 13.43% colleges coming under tribal development department and 15.11% of social welfare department in 35 districts of Maharashtra. The audit reports are based on documents received from the colleges.

The scope of the scam could be massive as SIT so far has managed to audit only about 14.21% institutions while 85.79% is yet to be inspected, the officers said.

The SIT directly named about 70 institutions, mostly belonging to Congress, NCP and some BJP leaders, and recommended criminal offences against their chairmen/directors. The government had directed officials from social welfare and tribal development departments to register FIR against the culprits, but no action was taken till date.

The SIT mentioned that in all the cases it was found that all students who received scholarship grants were fake.

The SIT had actually recommended probe using three methods — physical verification of students getting scholarships, inquiry through police in various districts and towns, and audit. But due to stay from the court, the panel managed to collect information through audit method only, the officers said.

Irregularities found by SIT

* Students granted admissions on duplicate transfer certificates

* Amount distributed even as courses were not recognized

* Scholarships granted to more no. of students than sanctioned intake

* Even for short-term courses, scholarships were illegally distributed

* Same students were shown taking scholarships from different institutes

* Scholarships taken on names of bogus students who didn’t exist

* Even management quota students offered scholarships without eligibility

* Students were distributed grants without verifying caste validity certificates

* Non-existent colleges granted amount on bogus documents

* Even failure students were awarded funds without authentic documents

“These defaulters have not been clearing water tax dues for several years despite our constant follow-ups. Now, we have decided to disconnect their supply, which will only be restored after the dues are cleared. Our action against will continue,” said CBD officials.

There are nearly 6,500 water supply connections from the board. The consumers have to pay water taxes every six months.

In the last six months, the board has collected nearly Rs 68 lakh from the consumers.

“But during that period, the total amount that was supposed to be collected as water tax amounted to more than Rs 73.54 lakh. A large number of consumers have failed to clear the tax dues,” said board officials.

According to CBD vice president, Bhagwan Katariya, the board had to take this harsh step as the board needs money to provide proper services to the residents.

The current rate of water charges in the cantonment area is Rs 4.21 per litre which was last revised in June 2018.

Apparently facing problems in collecting water tax from a section of the residents, CBD has now planned to take an advance amount for new water connections.

The civic administration has placed a proposal before the board to seek its approval on this issue.

At present, CBD takes a deposit of Rs 2,120 as advance payment from applicants seeking water connections. The applicants have to produce documents like rent receipts, no objection certificates from property owners, ownership titles recorded in 7/12 extract.

“The move to increase the advance is a wise thing to do. If they fail to pay the tax, the board can use the advance money paid to adjust the pending dues,” added the board vice president.

The cantonment board has a water tank of 10 lakh litre that supplies water to the whole cantonment area with the help of four overhead tanks.

The water is supplied for one-and-a-half-hours in the eight wards of the area.

AHMEDABAD: An NGO, Lion Nature Foundation , has filed a PIL in the Gujarat high court seeking directions to concerned authorities to stop illegal mining in the 10km buffer zone around the Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary for protection of environment and wildlife. The petitioner demanded that the government be asked to repair, restore and re-vegetate the area in accordance with established forestry practices. The power company should be asked to cut electricity supply to all offenders involved in illegal mining. The government should also be ordered to recover wealth amassed illegally by the mining mafia.

The PIL has requested the HC to ask authorities to take immediate steps to terminate all leases in the buffer zone, which are found to be involved in illegal mining and in violation of the Forest Conservation Act and other laws. The PIL has demanded that the authorities be asked to submit a list of quarry leases granted within the 10km buffer zone and submit a report of steps undertaken to implement the December 15, 2011 resolution, which prohibited mining in the area.

The PIL has urged the HC to appoint an expert committee to ascertain the damage already caused due to illegal mining. It has also sought action against officials who are found complicit in the illegalities.

The petitioner said that for any project, including mining, in the 470.5 sq km area of buffer zone around Gir sanctuary, prior environment clearance and recommendation of standing committee of National Board for Wildlife is required.

AYODHYA: Heavy earthmoving machines rolled into the Ramjanmabhoomi premises in Ayodhya on Saturday afternoon, marking the beginning of construction of the Ram Mandir.

The chief priest of the makeshift temple, Acharya Satyendra Das , said, “Machines have begun levelling land and clearing bushes and heavy thickets… It’s a joyous moment for Hindus in India and abroad as we are now free from 500 years of slavery.”

The 67.7-acre compound also houses more than 12 ancient temples, including the Ram Janamsthan and the Sita Rasoi , which are in ruins. No rituals have been performed here since 1993, when land was acquired by the Centre. There’s still no word from the Ram Mandir Trust — it will lay out the blueprint of the Ram Mandir — on whether these temples would be renovated or annexed into the greater temple design. Dr Anil Mishra , a trustee, said, “The Trust will decide the fate of these structures and on restarting worship.”

As was first reported by TOI, Ram Lalla idols will be shifted 150m from the sanctum sanctorium towards the north-east during nine days Ram Navami to make way for construction of the temple. Highly placed sources in the office of Ayodhya royal Bimlendra Mohan Pratap Mishra confirmed this to TOI.

The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has also finalised moving carved and uncarved marble to the Ramjanambhoomi premises.

The shifting of stones will take place from the rear of Ayodhya town at night to avoid traffic snarls.

LUDHIANA: Two people were crushed under a train and two were injured when they were negotiating the ""closed"" Giaspura railway crossing in Ludhiana at 8.15pm on Saturday.

Government Railway Police officials confirmed the death of Ratanjit Singh, 63, and Gurpreet Kaur, 26. Two other commuters - Sunny (21) and Arjun Kumar - were injured in the accident. Two scooters, two motorcycles and one cycle were smashed in the accident.

Northern Railway officials claimed that the accident occurred as the commuters tried to pass the crossing that had been closed ahead of the trains' arrival. Sunny, one of the injured, however blamed the accident on the confusion caused by gates opening for a short while. He said some of commuters were at the crossing when a train went towards Ambala, after which the gate opened and then shut, all within a few seconds, followed by the Shatabdi's arrival on other track, and running over those trying to cross over.

Railway officials rule out technical error

However, chief area manager, Ludhiana railway station, Parminder Singh, said the crash was not caused by any technical error.

He said, “As the people were crossing the tracks, two trains reached there on different tracks. First the Chandigarh-Amritsar Intercity going toward Am ritsar passed through. Then the Amritsar-bound Shatabdi Express arrived and hit the two-wheeler riders on the second track. After we received a message in the control room, a team was sent to the spot. We also deploy the Railway protection Force (RPF) during the peak hours, but people still cross the closed gates, risking their lives,” he said.

PRO, Northern Railway, Deepak Kumar said all the gates were closed and there was no error.

SRINAGAR: Withdrawal of additional forces from Kashmir has come to a halt in the wake of rumours that 90-year-old separatist Syed Ali Shah Geelani ’s health is fast deteriorating, a J&K administration official said on Saturday.

At least 400 additional companies of CRPF , BSF, ITBP and SSB were brought into Kashmir the day before August 5 last year. In December, on the directions of the ministry of home affairs, 72 companies of additional forces were withdrawn from Kashmir.

Now, J&K authorities apprehend law-and-order problem in the Valley in case Geelani passes away, which may trigger violence, the official said.

A CRPF official, requesting anonymity, said there were thorough deliberations of the security grid, both in New Delhi and Kashmir, in the wake of strong rumours about Geelani’s deteriorating health.

“Earlier in February, rumours about Geelani’s fast-deteriorating health had raised serious concerns on law-and-order front. Keeping this is in view, the MHA took a decision that further withdrawal of forces should be halted immediately,” the officer said.

Another reason why additional forces are not being withdrawn could be the impending by-elections to nearly 12,000 vacant panchayat seats and the upcoming tourist season, he said.

He also urged the Centre to frame laws “to tackle such anti-national elements”.

475,['1/03/2020'],Watch out! BMC to renew its plastic ban drive from Sunday,"Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation

MUMBAI: After state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray 's statement on making Maharashtra single-use plastic free by May 1, BMC has decided to renew its plastic ban drive from Sunday, by going the extra mile to make it a success with the help of a squad sporting navy blue jackets.

BMC has decided to take an undertaking from marriage hall managements, institutions and schools that they will not allow single-use plastic material on their premises, like spoons, plates and glasses. The squad will also check act against visitors using plastic at gardens.

Environmentalist D Stalin said, ""BMC should penalize people with plastic in public places, but after imposing a nominal penalty. They should act against big institutions by imposing heavy penalties. BMC must also conduct drives at night to act against hawkers using plastic. These are few things that can make the drive successful, instead of making it complicated by exploring multiple options that are not workable.""

The ban is Shiv Sena's pet theme and Thackeray was pushing for, during the previous state government, a ban on single-use plastic in 2018. BMC started its drive in June 2018, and till date has seized 86,000kg plastic material and recovered Rs 4.6 crore as fines after examining around 16 lakh premises.

Most of this took place during the initial days, when it started acting against big shops, malls and fast-food chains.

There was no political will and the drive slowed down gradually, said officials. Now, Thackeray is environment minister, and his party is ruling the state, so officials are taking keen interest.

An official admitted the drive slowed down due to lack of clarity, non-availability of alternatives and inadequate awareness campaigns. Civic officials stated that they will continue acting against shops, malls and food chains, apart from trying to include other stakeholders in the drive. They said they will create awareness at BMC schools, asking students to collect plastic at home and deposit it at school for recycling. Most BMC school students come from slums. BMC will then encourage private schools to adopt similar measures.

A civic official said, ""Plastic was coming into the city from neighbouring states after the ban. Since last October, single-use plastic is banned across the country, so we do not expect plastic to come in. But extended producer responsibility (EPR) are a matter of concern. It was decided that plastic water bottle manufactures would develop a mechanism to collect used plastic bottles for recycling, but it has not happened.""

478,['1/03/2020'],"Property tax: BMC acts tough, nets Rs 350 crore in week","Sumer builder’s site furniture and computers were seized on Saturday

MUMBAI: BMC received Rs 350 crore as property tax in the last week after it started taking strong action against defaulters by attaching their properties, including movable assets.

The civic authority's property collection target for the current financial year is Rs 5,400 crore, of which it has collected Rs 3,500 crore till February. In March, it hopes to collect the remaining Rs 1,900 crore, after exerting pressure on defaulters to clear dues.

Ward officers, who have been told to act against defaulters by seizing their movable assets, last week seized two helicopters. BMC has already attached 3,179 properties and disconnected water supply of 213 for non-payment of Rs 1,645 crore property tax dues.

Civic official also started shaming defaulters by making loudspeaker announcements on pending dues where such properties are situated or where owners of these properties live. BMC had published a list of defaulters in newspapers whose property they have attached for non-payment of taxes and initiated the process of seizing their movable assets for auction to recover the dues.

Despite that, civic officials are struggling to increase collections. An official stated that most of the major defaulters are builders or land-owners. He said, ""Due to a slowdown in construction market, they are not clearing pending property taxes, as it is last on their priority list. Through the action, we are sending a message to defaulters to clear dues.""

BMC seized Sumer builder's site office furniture and computers at Reay Road for defaulting on Rs 22 crore property tax on Saturday. It also sent notices to three partners to clear payments at the earliest to avoid further action.

BMC's property tax collection has been dropping over the last few years, and is expected to drop further as the government, as part of election promises, has decided to exempt flats measuring below 500 sq ft. Property tax is the biggest revenue source for BMC ever since octroi was abolished.

HYDERABAD: A 45-year-old man was arrested by police on Saturday for allegedly making a bid to rape his younger daughter at his Dundigal home. The accused was caught by his wife while he was trying to sexually assault their daughter on Friday night.

More shocking details tumbled out on Saturday when his elder daughter broke her silence and revealed that her father had been raping her for almost a year now.

Dundigal police arrested and booked a rape case against him.

Wife caught him in the act as he tried to abuse younger daughter

Police said the accused had made attempts to sexually assault the younger daughter (12) in January also. “Both girls, along with their parents, sleep in the same room. After midnight, the accused would sexually assault his elder daughter when his wife was asleep. On Friday, the woman woke up and saw her husband trying to abuse their younger kid,” Dundigal inspector A Venkatesham said.

The girls are in Class VI and V. Police said the elder daughter is mentally unstable. “When he was confronted by his wife, his 14-year-old elder daughter revealed that she had been sexually assaulted multiple times in the past one year. He had threatened to kill her and her sister if they speak about their ordeal,” the inspector said.

It was only after he was caught red-handed, the elder daughter mustered courage to speak about her abuse, the inspector said.

NEW DELHI: In a bid to break the convention when it comes to election strategies, Lok Janshakti Party will release its manifesto or vision document on April 12, nearly six months before assembly polls are scheduled in Bihar.

LJP chief Chirag Paswan , who is trying to invoke Bihari pride by launching a ‘Bihar First Bihari First’ campaign in the state, told TOI that manifestos should be the centre of a campaign, not caste or religion.

“Political parties should come out with their manifesto quickly so that elections are fought on developmental issues rather than caste and religion. We saw in Delhi how the entire campaign centred around religion and caste. We can’t blame people as they don’t come to know about the manifesto. How can they weigh options when parties release manifestos just days before polling? In some cases, manifestos are released after one round of nominations are filed,” the LJP supremo said.

The second time MP from Jamui claimed that the main intention behind his new campaign is to revive the pride of the state and its people against the present bad perception of ‘Bihari’ as a derogatory remark. Though sources said LJP is targeting a bigger role for its young chief by 2025 and the ground work has begun with this campaign, Chirag said the main aim of this initiative is to bring the development agenda to the forefront during the election.

Claiming that the campaign is not merely for elections, he said, “It’s our aim to push development in the state. Since Independence several states have grown, but we have been lagging behind. This has been a matter of concern for us. The CM has done a lot by building a solid base. But we need to make it number one. We will come out with a complete road map; we need work across all sectors — health, education, law and order and infrastructure.”

He added the campaign will reach out to all sections of the society and put greater focus on students and professionals such as doctors, lawyers, middle class, service class and farmers.

483,['1/03/2020'],Civic body banks on BPS as town planning revenue dips,"Visakhapatnam: At a time when the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) is struggling to reach its target revenue , the civic body’s building penalisation scheme (BPS) has come as a blessing in disguise.

While the city’s civic body has been able to realise just around Rs 90 crore through the town planning wing by giving permissions for construction as of Friday, the building penalisation scheme has fetched GVMC around Rs 50 crore.

Revenue from town planning wing permissions has come down significantly. In the 2018-19 fiscal, GVMC had earned Rs 163 crore and in 2017-18, the civic body had earned Rs 146 crore by giving permissions for construction plans of housing and commercial complexes.

GVMC officials attribute this drop in revenue to increased issuance of TDRs (transferable development rights) as compensation to landowners over the last two years and the consequent utilisation of TDRs. Thus, it is the BPS scheme that is helping GVMC’s town planning wing to compensate for the decreased revenue in building plans.

According to GVMC, the civic body received 6,166 applications under BPS when the scheme made a comeback in 2019. GVMC had disposed 3,800 applications till 6pm Saturday— the last day to process BPS applications— to generate revenue of nearly Rs 50 crore. The municipal corporation has sent intimation letters for payment of balance amounts in documents to around 1,400 applicants.

Now, if the state government does not extend the deadline again as it has done in the past, the processing of applications may end on Saturday midnight.

Through BPS, GVMC regularised constructed buildings that had deviations from the sanctioned plan or completely unauthorised structures. Building owners whose applications have been processed and approved will be issued occupancy certificates.The scheme however is not applicable for buildings constructed on government land or on prohibited areas under CRZ (coastal regulation zone) norms.

API Nagpur President Dr Shubhada Khirwadkar said that the event was organized as part of the youth connect initiative.

“Children and adolescents need to be educated about personal hygiene, healthy lifestyles, fitness, gender respect and many other issues important for their health in all its dimensions. If these messages are given in the usual didactic way, they hardly make an impact. API Nagpur has come up with a novel way to reach out to children through this contest,” she said.

API joined hands with the South Centre zone cultural centre (SCZCC) to organize this event in their premises. Siddhivinayak Academy of Performing Arts, Tarang Foundation and Inner Wheel Club of Nagpur supported this maiden initiative of API. Paediatricians have decided to connect with school students and spread awareness about prevention of non-communicable diseases and providing CPR training during this year.

“Street play is the most effective and popular medium of giving social messages. Children conveyed appropriate health messages in an interesting and effective manner today. Some of the actors were very talented and I have offered them to join theatre movement with me,” said senior theatre activist Sanjay Bhakre, who was one of the judges of the contest. Adolescence health specialist Dr Nishikant Kotwal, physician Dr Smita Desai, and veteran journalist Barkha Mathur were among the jury.

Dr Avinash Gawande, Medical Superintendent of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) was the chief guest. “Street plays are simple, effective and low-cost way to share social messages impactfully. Students who presented these plays must have learnt a lot about these important themes,” he said.

It was a novel experience for doctors to coordinate a theatrical event, said API Nagpur secretary Dr Mustafa Ali.

489,['1/03/2020'],"Delhi violence disturbing, govt must remain secular: Amartya","Santiniketan: Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen is “deeply concerned” and “disturbed” with the violence in Delhi and wants peace to return to the country’s capital. The government should govern by allowing free public interaction instead of slapping “sedition” charges on dissidents, Sen said on Saturday.

“I am deeply concerned with what happened in Delhi. Delhi is the country’s capital and centrally-governed territory. Now, there are incidents of torture on minorities because most of the victims are Muslims. We have to find out why it is so. Were the police unable to tackle the situation? Or was there any shortcoming in the government’s initiative? Our country has a secular name. We can’t distinguish between Hindus and Muslims. But if that happens, there is a reason to worry. I am proud that I am an Indian citizen. I feel disturbed,” he said after speaking at a Pratichi Trust programme in Santiniketan.

The senior philosopher and economist, however, refrained from making any comment with finality. He said he was asking certain questions on the recent developments in Delhi out of concern.

Sen didn’t see any contradiction between restoring peace in the capital and the different views aired by political parties to attain peace. “Peace is important. But that doesn’t mean that the discourse over why it happened or ways to bring peace will hamper the peace process. There is no reason to believe that there is a contradiction between the two,” he said.

Sen also raised the transfer of Delhi High Court judge S Muralidhar, who was hearing the Delhi violence cases. “It is a big question. I know him personally. His transfer came at a time when he was trying to help out people. But I don’t know why he was transferred. The government must have an answer,” he said.

The Nobel Laureate reserved his comment on the government’s decision to serve a notice to the Visva Bharati student from Bangladesh to leave India after she uploaded a photograph of an anti-CAA demonstration on her Facebook wall.

“I have read it in the newspaper. The government must have reasons to take such action. We need to know from the government what the reasons are,” he said.

Sen reiterated the need for the government to remove opaqueness in decision-making. “Democracy is a government by discussion,” Sen said quoting John Stuart Mill and held that the government should allow free public interaction. “If government decisions are taken after public deliberations, then their opaqueness disappears. On the contrary, efforts to silence critics by slapping sedition charges do not help democracy,” Sen said.

491,['1/03/2020'],Coronavirus scare: Chinese yuan offtake comes to a halt in Kolkata,"KOLKATA: For the first time in recent memory, foreign exchange units in Kolkata have stopped transactions in Chinese yuan , a currency that was being bought and sold in impressive volumes till the novel coronavirus outbreak brought an abrupt end to trading around 10 days ago.With both business and leisure travel to China coming to a halt, forex units are refusing to buy yuan. “We are not purchasing yuan now as there is no possibility of trading in it under the current circumstances. Once travel to China resumes, trading in yuan will restart,” said A K Dutt, director of RN Dutt & Sons that has been in the currency exchange business since 1887.The only two currencies to witness suspension in trade in recent years were the Qatar riyal and Kuwaiti dinar after both countries faced external conspiracy and aggression. But neither currency traded in high volumes.The Chinese yuan , on the other hand, has emerged as one of the most popular currencies in the past decade following a sharp rise in business and leisure travel to the country and introduction of direct flights to Kunming and Guangzhou apart from Hong Kong.Till January, around 4,000 people from Kolkata — businessmen and holidayers — were travelling to China every month. That has dramatically changed since the news of outbreak hit headlines. There were very few travellers in the first week of February. And, no one has travelled to any Chinese city from Kolkata in over a fortnight now, leading to a crash in the demand for yuan.Kirshore Majumdar of Lakshmi Narayan Air Travels that also deals in forex said purchase of the Chinese currency was unofficially suspended by most forex traders in Kolkata around a week ago. At the time, yuan was being purchased for Rs 9.20 and sold for Rs 10.50.“All money changers are holding some Chinese currency but there are no takers. Similarly, many businessmen who regularly travelled to China and a few holidayers who were about to depart for the country but were forced to cancel their trip are saddled with yuan that they cannot sell,” said Travel Agents’ Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi.Dutt explained that holding the Chinese currency at a time like this entails risks as one doesn’t really know the kind of volatility it may encounter if the country remains isolated for a prolonged period due to the nCoV outbreak. It has already had a ripple effect on China’s economy — and the global economy — as many factories remain closed, disrupting supply chains and impacting revenue.Also with nCoV spreading to other countries, travel to the entire region has dropped drastically. This has led to a dip in all forex trading in the past week.While the US dollar is by far the most traded foreign currency in terms of value in the city, euro, Japanese yen, UK pound, Thai baht, Singapore dollar and Arab Emirate dirham are the other major currencies traded in Kolkata. The currency that is traded in the highest volume in Kolkata is, however, the Bangladeshi taka.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74422053,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-530981,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/chinese-yuan-offtake-comes-to-a-halt-in-city/articleshow/74421742.cms
492,['1/03/2020'],"NCP nixed Shiv Sena’s choice, leaned on ally to pick Param Bir Singh as Mumbai police commissioner","MUMBAI: After two names were shortlisted by the Maha Vikas Aghadi for the post of Mumbai police commissioner , DGP of the Anti-Corruption Bureau Param Bir Singh was chosen over the other contender, Pune police chief K Venkatesham. It was the NCP which tilted the scales in Singh’s favour, if a senior IPS officer is to be believed.“Our information is that while the Shiv Sena was in favour of K Venkatasham, he missed the bus following reservations expressed by the NCP,” the IPS officer said-.The state home ministry is with the NCP.Though Singh had held a press meet on the Elgar Parishad case in his capacity as additional DGP (law and order) to show “proof” against the accused, it was under Venkatasham’s leadership that the Pune police registered offences in the case against activists. NCP chief Sharad Pawar has claimed that the activists have been framed and that the role of Pune police must be probed and has pushed for an Special Investigation Team.Singh, on the other hand, had been directly handling, as DGP of the ACB, the multicrore irrigation scam case involving NCP leaders Ajit Pawar and Sunil Tatkare. In his affidavit filed before the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court in December last year, Singh had granted a clean chit to Ajit Pawar, who is now deputy CM.Though in political circles, there was speculation over whether the NCP had favoured him for this reason, a senior ACB official claimed that the clean chit had been granted to Ajit Pawar during BJP rule. “It was in July 2018, when the BJP was in power in the state, that the water resources department wrote to the ACB saying all proposals were cleared at the level of the water resources department secretary and as per rules of business, the cabinet member is not responsible for decisions taken by the department,” the official said.Significantly, Singh’s affidavit granting Pawar a clean chit was filed a year after Barve’s affidavit on the scam, in which Barve – who was then heading the ACB -- had obliquely blamed the political leadership, saying the scam needed in-depth investigation.Sources said the search for Barve’s successor as city top cop began a week ago after the Sena-led government took a decision not to grant further extension to him following objections raised by the NCP. In fact, NCP had objected also to the way CMdesignate Uddhav Thackeray had granted him a second extension on November 27, a day before he was sworn in.When deliberations began, there were more than a half-a-dozen senior IPS officers in the zone of consideration, among them MD of police housing corporation Bipin Bihari, state security corporation MD D Kanakratnam, DG (legal) Hemant Nagrale, DG (ACB) Singh, SID commissioner Rashmi Shukla, ADG (law and order) Rajneesh Seth, Pune top cop Venkatesham and Thane police commissioner Vivek Phansalkar.The senior IPS officer said that there was a long discussion on whether the Mumbai police commissioner should be of DG or additional DG rank. “There was a vertical split in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government as one section felt the CP should be of DG rank, while the other section said that he should be of additional DG rank. Even as these discussions were in progress at the political level, the names of Param Bir Singh and Venkatesham were shortlisted,” he said.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74422046,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-628433,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ncp-nixed-shiv-senas-choice-leaned-on-ally-to-pick-param-bir-singh-as-mumbai-police-commissioner/articleshow/74422043.cms

CHENNAI: Scanning footage from as many as 150 CCTV cameras from Besant Nagar to Jafferkhanpet, police on Saturday rescued an eight-month-old girl, less than 36 hours after she was kidnapped from her mother's side on the Elliot's beach, and arrested five people including a juvenile. While K Manikandan, 26, of Jafferkhanpet, A Thirupathi Ammal, 42, of Saidapet, and S Mary, 35, and her son S Ruben, 19, of Saidapet were sent to jail, the minor, daughter of Thirupathiammal, was admitted to the correctional facility in Kelly's.

Police said Manikandan's elder sister Pandi Meena, who worked as a maid, didn't have children and was desperate for one. Through a common friend she came to know of Thirupathiammal, who allegedly made a living as a surrogate mother, and Mary. Pandi Meena then told Manikandan, 26, who offered the two women 2 lakh for a child, an officer said.

After trying to get some narikurava women in Besant Nagar to sell a baby, Mary and Thirupathiammal decided to steal one when the women refused, he added.

On Thursday night, Mary, Ruben, Thirupathiammal and her daughter went to the Elliot's beach. Around 2am on Friday, they went to the skating rink. One woman sat close to Rajeshwari and her mother Sneha, narikuravas from Kumbakonam. Around 4am, Selvi woke up and found her daughter missing. She rushed to the nearest police station with her niece. A case was registered but police found no CCTV camera at the spot. About 100 metres away, a camera caught four people including two women boarding an autorickshaw.

Police questioned an auto driver who confirmed the four had boarded his vehicle and that one woman carried a child. Police checked footage from CCTV cameras at Chinnamalai near Saidapet and at Jafferkhanpet. One showed the gang handing over the child to Manikandan, a second showed him walking home with the girl and a third had him handing her over to Pandi Meena.

On Saturday afternoon, a police team landed at Manikandan's house and later rescued the girl from Pandi Meena's house. She was reunited with her parents in the evening.

Adyar assistant commissioner Vinoth Shantharam who formed the special team and its members sub-inspectors Jai Ganesh and Karthikeyan and constables Thirumurugan, Pushparaj, Damodharan, Senthilkumar, Venkateshwaran and Vinod won praise from commissioner A K Viswanathan.

RAMPUR: It was a bit of an anticlimax when the family of the erstwhile nawab of Rampur (UP) gathered at the sprawling lawns of Khasbagh Palace this week to witness the opening of a strongroom — now at the heart of a decades-old inheritance dispute — and its six-tonne door refused to give away. Despite several hours of drilling, five expert welders armed with an array of tools — gas cutter, pulling machines and grinders — managed to chip through only one of the multiple layers of iron on the eightfeet-tall door on Wednesday.

This was the sixth in a series of futile bids to open the strongroom which was built in the 1930s by Nawab Raza Ali Khan . In fact, the only time the room was breached was during a break-in back in 1980 when thieves had entered through the roof and made away with valuables. Today, no one really knows what’s behind the sealed door. The reason: Very few royals have actually seen the inside of the strongroom since its keys were lost decades ago. Speculations have been rife about the riches it could hold.

The attempts to open the strongroom are part of the evaluation exercise of royal treasures so it could be divided among family members of Nawab Raza Ali Khan. Raza Ali Khan — who had acceded to India in 1949 — was survived by three wives, three sons and six daughters. The government recognised the eldest of his three sons—Murtaza — as the sole inheritor as per the customary law. But this was challenged by his siblings, spawning a 47-year-long legal battle. In 2019, the Supreme court ruled that the property would be divided among all family members according to Muslim law .

The property assessment is now being done by the Rampur district court following apex court’s orders. As part of the exercise, the locks of an armoury in the 450-acre palace were opened to reveal carved guns, gem-studded swords and knives while a garage was hiding vintage cars imported from the US and Europe, among them a Plymouth (1957), Dodge convertible (1954), Austin convertible (1956), Buick (1939) and Jeep Willys (1956). Other properties to be divided among 18 claimants include the 200-acre Benazir Bagh Palace, Sarhari Kunda, Shahbad Bagh Palace and a private railway station, all in Rampur.

On March 24, another attempt will be made to open the strongroom. Court-appointed commissioner Saurabh Saxena said he was hopeful they would be able to get through this time.

Some family members said they have little expectations about what the room would yield. Nawab Kazim Ali Khan, son of former Congress MP Begum Noor Bano, wife of Murtaza’s younger brother, told TOI, “The strongroom used to house Basra pearls, trays filled with diamonds, emeralds, sapphires and rubies. It also contained a crown, carpets with stone-work, heirlooms and sword scabbards. But I believe little is left now.”

Nawab Muhammed Ali Khan, Murtaza’s son, whose mother had the keys to the strongroom insists they were never found. “My mother was a cancer patient but she passed away suddenly during treatment in Mumbai in 1993. The keys were never found,” said Khan, who lives in Goa and was in Rampur with sister Shehzadi Naghat Abedi for the evaluation.

“The family opened the strongroom ahead of Muharram every year. Gold alams (plates) and silver tables were taken out for rituals. I don’t know what’s inside because I lived abroad until my mother’s death and there was a theft as well. We were told that thieves had entered through the roof and stolen valuables from the strongroom. The theft was discovered after a child found a part of a gold plate in the palace premises,” he said. Rampurbased historian Nafis Siddiqi said very few people were even aware of a strongroom in the palace until the evaluation started. “This is the first time, many have heard of a strongroom full of treasure in Khasbagh. It has evoked a lot of curiosity here,” he said.
